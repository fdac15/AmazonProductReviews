"Me and My family have family game nights on the weekend as were always going to our vacation home . We like to go there so we can spend time together away from the tv, electronics, phones and friends. We have played many board games over the last couple years and with my oldest daughter being 10 and getting more into card games such as rummy and playing war, gold fish ,solitaire and what not with her sisters I thought when I seen this nerts game that it would be perfect and fun for the whole family.When it came in the mail I was surprised at the size of the main box was. Wasn't large like i thought it would be so perfect to travel with and comes with everything you need . A small pencil, small scoring pad and 6 boxes of cards- red, black, silver, blue, green and yellow. The only thing I was disappointed in is that there wasn't instructions just visit a website to learn to play so the first weekend we took with us we weren't able to play nerts BUT we did play other card games since the website wouldn't load on my phone since we had no signal in the woods. ( When getting this I would suggest learning to play before going anywhere's so you can teach others - which once watching its very easy).The cards are regular playing cards with 52 cards, all 4 symbols and jokers- the back are a bold color back with nerts written on it. They are great though, easy to slide , solid -not paper thin and fun colors to pick from.This nerts game set was provided to me at no cost for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest,unbiased review.I am very pleased with this set and would highly recommend it to others. The cards are made well- comes with everything you need and once you play nerts which is easy and easy to learn , its fast pace and fun and sure your family will have a great night of family fun. You can also find other games out there where you will need more then one set of cards and this set would be perfect.Would make the perfect gift for family's, teens or anybody . Would also be a great set for somebody who plays cards all the time to where they are always needing another set there's 6 in one for a great price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXDCV3PXQQGRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQOPDX8#wasThisHelpful","RXDCV3PXQQGRC","A1S2VSHI4J5K8O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2VSHI4J5K8O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Me and my family - husband and 3 kids play family games each night over the weekend as were normally at our family vacation home. There are times when my parents, aunts and cousins come up so playing monopoly is out of the question as there's to many people. I have been looking for a game that would be more adult based so when when I came across this 3 pack of charades I thought this would be perfect.Let me tell you I don't know who laughed more the adults who were playing or the kids who were watching the adults. On Friday night we did the adults only and played Rock and roll. On Saturday we mixed it up a little not only did we allow the kids on the teams to guess and help act out with the adults but we took all 3 packs (Hollywood, Party animal and Rock and roll ) and mixed them all together.I don't think I had so much fun with a game ever and gives you a mixture and wide range of categories.Charades is an acting game were a  player acts out a word / phrase, Sometimes acting out similar-sounding words. The goal is to use physical rather than verbal language in limited time to convey the meaning to another party .This set has some hard phrases/words to act out or guess but on each card there's 3 to choice from so either you will be able to pick one you think you and team can get or have a good laugh trying to get. Me being 32 there was some I was like WHAT THE so.I would think 10-14+ age is a little off but sure they will have just as much fun.This set is perfect for traveling and family vacations as each box comes with everything you will need.  Each box has a timer, score pad, pencil,  instructions on how to play and clues to get you started as well as 180 different charades .These charade games were provided to me at no cost for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest,unbiased review.I would highly recommend this charades games to anybody to have for holidays, get togethers, work party's or anytime you are going to have more then a handful of people. Im sure there will be lots of fun and laughs- and if like me lots of pictures to laugh at. I love this and plan to get friends and family sets as gifts as its perfect to have at the house for a time when you need to live in up the party.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL4XYP80UZK3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXEVKV8#wasThisHelpful","RL4XYP80UZK3Y","A1S2VSHI4J5K8O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2VSHI4J5K8O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have 3 daughters 10, 8 and 6 who are all in elementary school. Ever since they were born I have always looked for fun learning toys and tools. To help them learn and have fun while learning so want to learn more.Of course we have a lot of electronic toys that help but I have been looking for more hands things that would help. My oldest is in 5th grade and doing pretty good in math but having some issues so thought these would be perfect.When they came in the mail the box sounded like it was going to be a big mess as everything was shaking around inside. But to my surprise the wooden separator actually has a slide on lid which I really like so none of the pieces will get lost when taking it from room to room or while having in the closet.This set is not only helpful for the older kids with math but also younger as well my daughter & niece were separating the pieces into different sections,they were  making patterns , and teaching my niece her colors and shapes and asking what the #'s were on each wooden piece.There's so many things there's wooden pieces can be used for:*adding*subtracting*colors*patterns  ****pretty much any math problem ( use your imagination it can be done with them just flip them over to not see the  1,10,100,1000) These  can help with hands on learning in MANY different ways you can think of. The set is made from high quality finished/colored wood to not only help learn but make it fun.  The set comes with a wooden case to separate the pieces as well as  35 #1's, 30 #10's, 30 #100's and More !This colorful mathematics stamp set was provided to me at no cost for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but Istated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest,unbiased review.I would 100 % recommend this to anybody with children.This set is not only perfect for young kids but also middle and high school age children male or female- for when you are trying to help with with a problem you can show them as I know showing me and having me have hands on helps more then just talking. Also perfect for daycare and classrooms. Would make a perfect gift as well. Each piece and the set is well made and great price.This has helped my daughter already in the short time we have had it and that's what counts !","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7VVWHBDBAWWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UWN8S4U#wasThisHelpful","R7VVWHBDBAWWI","A1S2VSHI4J5K8O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2VSHI4J5K8O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having 3 daughters of my own who are no longer infants but having friends and family who do when I came across these silicone baby teething toys I thought they were very interesting. With my friend who lives next door who's always coming over with her little girl that is teething shes 8 months old. I thought it would be perfect to have something at the house here.When they came in the mail of course I couldn't wait to test them out on my friends little girl to see if they would give her relive or if she would even like them.These teethers are AWESOME.Not only does she like them as they are bright, fun , bold colors but in fun shapes as if they are also a toy. I put the little teddy in the freezer so when she got board with the elephant I grabbed the other and was like a hole new thing.There's so many positive things about these :* the teddy bear has in prints on the back that help with teething and rubbing on the gums* they are made from silicone so can be frozen and cleaned in boiling water* comes with a  pacifier clip that attaches to EACH teether so don't have to worry about it dropping on the floor or ground* the  pacifier clip has teethers all the way down it* the fact that is all made of silicone so you dont have to worry about any rough edges cutting gumsI'm jealous they didn't have something like this when my girls were little. No more boring teethers!These teethers with pacifier clip were provided to me at no cost for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but Istated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest,unbiased review.I would 100 % recommend these to anybody who has a little one OR would make the best baby shower gift. Well made, fun and so easy to care for and great price and most of all does an amazing job .","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVRJS62NNSVAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZZ4EC0A#wasThisHelpful","RVRJS62NNSVAK","A1S2VSHI4J5K8O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2VSHI4J5K8O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My oldest daughter who is 10 loves jewelry and has been taken pretty good care of the old things I have gave her that were mine that I never wear. When I came across this galaxy crescent moon necklace I thought she would love it . I went ahead and got it and thought it would be a great gift for either her birthday or Christmas.When it came in the mail I was shocked a how nice it really was for the cost of the necklace. I thought it was going to be a little big for mine or daughters liking and pretty heavy. Its actually the perfect size to where you don't have to be nose to nose to see the detail in the pendant or the pendant its self. Almost the same size as a half dollar piece. As for the weight its perfect not light to where its going to be blowing in the wind or weighing our neck down.I love all the swirls in the moon, most look like swirl hearts as well as the galaxy actually hangs from the top of the moon instead of being attached.This pendant does come on a silver 19 inch detailed chain link style necklace. The necklace has a lobster still clasp so its easy to put on by your self but not going to come loss or open itself and make you loss the necklace or pendant.This necklace  was provided to me at no cost for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest,unbiased review.This is a very pretty necklace and pendant . Looks like you got it from a high end department store but not top dollar jewelry store. Very detailed and you will get many compliments on it. I gave it to my daughter the day it came in the mail as i couldn't wait and she just LOVES it and many people have stopped to talk to her about it since she wears it daily. A lot said it reminds them of the saying "" I love you to the moon and back "" and wanted to know where she got it.I highly recommend this to others for yourself, your girlfriend or child - great to dress up your out fit or everyday where. Well made , AMAZING price and just all around Beautiful .","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XQ42QQU80SLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YE4E0O0#wasThisHelpful","R2XQ42QQU80SLN","A1S2VSHI4J5K8O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2VSHI4J5K8O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter is a big fan of Ensasa fashion since she got her first tank top and leggings from them a few months ago. Since the clothes are very well prices its been a lot easier to get her more of the new punk/fun fashion that she likes. When buying from Ensasa fashion I know its going to be made well and to her liking.When she came across this Babmetal halter tank top she didn't know what babmetal was but she liked the design even thought its not very colorful like most of her clothes. She liked it because of all the detail in it and reminds her of day of the dead. The design isnt printed/ironed  on the shirt so wont come off or crack when wearing or washing.The top is made from  82% Polyester and 18% LYCRA .She normally wears an adult med. and fits her perfect but with the material is made of it does stretch so think it would be perfect on a Large with no issues at all.  Its the perfect material for hot summer days.Very light and breathable very comfortable on the skin. As well as it being a halter top it shows enough skin but not to much.My daughter has worn this a couple times already since having it and people ask her all the time wear she got it. We have washed it by hand and in the washer and air dried and tumbled dry - we didn't notice any shrinking or changes in the top or print . All the threads were still in tacked as the day we got them.This shirt was provided to me at a discount for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest,unbiased review.I would highly recommend this halter top to anybody looking for a fun , comfortable, well made , affordable shirt. My daughter suggest it Would make a great gift for any teen or young adult ( perfect for adults who like this type of design as well).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B0X4W6O7FR5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W02G48I#wasThisHelpful","R3B0X4W6O7FR5F","A1S2VSHI4J5K8O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2VSHI4J5K8O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter and her friends are really into leggings this year. Her best friends birthday was coming up and loves mermaids so when I came across these leggings I knew they would be perfect. We have got other leggings from Ensasa Fashion in the past and just loved them . These were no different.My daughter was a little jealous that she had to give them to her friend as a gift as she really liked them. As for her friend she loved them.The day after her party she came over with them on and they looked good on her. Shes a little short but these were perfect on her . Even with her being short they were just a little bunched up towards the bottom but once she put her high tops on you couldn't tell.These leggings are great. Normally my daughter & friend both wear a size medium in adult/jr's and these fit them perfect. The waist is elastic so if your thin or have a little belly they will fit. Also if you have a butt no worries as these are made from  elasticity spandex material to do stretch.The design on this pair of leggings is very bold and bright in color which is a green/blue and black scales of a dragon or mermaid tale. Its in the fabric so you don't have to worry about when washing that the design will fade or come off. The girls are talking about maybe being a mermaid for Halloween and wearing these leggings.These leggings aren't like others they have, where you can see threw them so HAVE to wear something over them. You can wear them alone , with a long shirt, under a dress or like my girls they normally wear there bootie shorts over them so they can wear their shorts to school.These leggings were provided to me at a discount for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest,unbiased review.I would 100 % recommend these leggings to others as they are made well, very comfortable on and GREAT price. As well as super fun to wear !","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8LPR3P32UF0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQJRXYO#wasThisHelpful","R8LPR3P32UF0I","A1S2VSHI4J5K8O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2VSHI4J5K8O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been looking around for a robe for my husband. He had one when he was younger and said he really liked it and since he out grew it he trys to put mine on when he gets cold or out the shower but its more of pajama robe for warmth and its pink with clouds on it. I've been looking and haven't found one that he would really like til I came across this Men's camp True timber New Conceal Accent & Black Fleece Long Robe.I have got a couple other products from Camo Chique Boutique before and they were very well made and great all the way around. This robe was provided to me at a discount price . I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased reviewWhen this came in the mail my husband loved . He said it has the perfect amount of camo that isn't doesn't make you feel like your dressing to go hunting. The edges of the sleeves and pockets and opening/collar all have about an inch of true timber camouflage .The robe is made from Polyester fleece so very soft on the skin to make you nice and cozy. This robe closes with a self tie belt. One of his favorite parts is that it has 2 pockets in the front so he can put his phone in one & the remote in the other so when he walks out of the room we don't change the channel on it.The robe is true to its size and goes to about knee length which is perfect.We did wash it with like colors and tumble dried it and it looked as if it was brand new- no fading or shrinking that was noticeable.Every string since it came in the mail and even after washing was nice and tight with no loss ends .My did put it on the other day when getting out of the shower and put it on the hook and air dried and didn't take long to dry which was nice as I thought it would hold the water and need to be washed again.We have been completely happy with this product & would highly recommend to anybody. Would make a great father's day , anniversary, birthday gift for any man . Or just to replace your robe with an amazing robe to put on in the evenings when it gets chilli while laying around the house as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X1X4ACGOKURO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IK4VYYE#wasThisHelpful","R1X1X4ACGOKURO","A1S2VSHI4J5K8O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2VSHI4J5K8O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have 3 daughters  & 3 nieces who are always trying to use my sun glasses while we are driving down the road. It was time I got them each a pair to leave in my truck for when this occurs. Yes they have other sun glasses but they always seem to forget them.When I came across these Steam punk Turbo Sunglasses sold by Style Vault I knew my niece Star would love them. They come in 3 different  colors black, silver and mirrored pink and black which I got her as they were totally her style.Luckily the day they came in it was sunny out and she was with us going away for the weekend and I had them in the truck so when she asked for my glasses I told her put these on and she screamed.They are SUPER cute. The frames are made of a very durable plastic with black and pink on the inside and outside of the frame and look really fun and bold together. As well as plastic lens. The lens are a mirrored blended lens so are also a fun punk style with different shades depending on the light your in.My niece is 12 years old and these glasses fit her face/head perfect. They didn't squeeze her temple and wore then for the 3 hour trip as well as the rest of the afternoon and said that they were very comfortable around the ears and nose and could wear all day every day. My 6 year old asked my niece to try them on to see if she liked them and they fit her pretty good as well .These sun glasses were provided to me at no cost for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review.I would 100 % recommend these glasses to anybody with a child who likes sunglasses or wants a very nice stylish pair . They have the punk turbo style that would be great for girls or boys. They are very well made and durable and an amazing price you cant beat.The glasses do come in a cloth storage bag which I like so when not wearing the lens don't get scratched from putting in glove box. Also the customer support is prompt and very easy to work with as well as shipping is very fast.These would make a perfect gift ! They are 5 star kid approved !","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NXDSIQQ4DYBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GBHK1LO#wasThisHelpful","R3NXDSIQQ4DYBA","A1S2VSHI4J5K8O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2VSHI4J5K8O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One thing that runs in my family is high blood pressure and last time I went to the doctors they told me mine was high but didn't want to put me on meds and wanted me to watch it. I have come across many blood pressure monitors and cuffs but didn't think I would be able to get the exact reading on a manual one. When I came across this measupro digital upper arm monitor I thought it would be prefect.Of course as soon as it came in I wanted to test it out to see if it was accurate and I had been to the doctors earlier that day so know about what it was running. I loved the fact since I didn't know what the monitor ran off of I couldn't go get the right battery's that this came with them so can use right away. It was the exact reading that I had at the doctors office only an hour before. So right on the dot.This monitor is far behind like any other monitor and easy for any age to use. I think its perfect for elderly people who have a hard time reading as the digital numbers are large and very bold on the lCD screen. Its very simple to use you put the cuff on and push the button and it pumps the needed air into the cuff - after a few seconds it slowly lets the air out and gives you a reading. I love the fact that the screen will be blue when good, yellow when a little high and red when its to high.This monitor comes with an instruction book that tells you how to set up the monitor, which each symbol that comes across the screen means, also about blood pressure and what it should be and what is pre-hypertension and crisis need medical care pressures would be.It also saves up to 60 of your previous pressures . It allows you to save up to 2 peoples different info which is perfect that you don't have to worry about who's is who's and writing things down .This machine was provided to me at a discount for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review.I would 100 % recommend this to any teacher, school nurse or even a doctors office and perfect from home use. Very easy to read and use. It comes with everything you need he cuff, monitor , instruction book with health info as well as battery's. Its made very well with high quality material and a GREAT price . Im so impressed with this blood pressure monitor I am going to be getting my grandfather and mother one for them as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWMY4PK9YII3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TGC4MNY#wasThisHelpful","RWMY4PK9YII3C","A1S2VSHI4J5K8O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S2VSHI4J5K8O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love bath fizzies. I think they make the perfect gifts for nearly any occasion. And I love getting them. The Pure Sanctum bath bomb gift set is amazing! There are six different fragrances in the box and all them smell wonderful! I think my favorite is the Coco Bombe because I have very dry skin and this leaves my legs and body feeling silky smooth. For my daughter I love the Big Easy - the french lavender really calms her down and puts her to bed. But all 6 scents are fab. I gave the bath bombs a 5 star review because they are made with natural ingredients, they are vegan and gluten free, do not contain any artificial colors or synthetic fragrances, they are sulfate free, phthalate free and contain non-GMO ingredients.

"How cute is this! Halloween is one of my most favorite times of year. The weather is beautiful and little kids are dressed up all cute as can be. Even though I'm an adult I want to dress up too. But not the same as those little kiddos running around. The Inspired Silver Grinning Pumpkin Halloween bracelet lets me partake in the Halloween festiveness without looking tacky. I can wear this work, around town or just at home. It has a braided chain so it gives it a casual dressy feel. I just love it! The clasp is secure so no need to worry about it falling off while you are wearing it.

"Manners and compassion are two big things we are working at instilling in my daughter this year. The Good Deeds Manager is a great way to help. So with this manager you are given some straws of hay. With each good deed you do you get a piece to put in the manager to make a bed for Baby Jesus. The object is to have a nice soft bed of hay ready for Baby Jesus's arrival on Christmas Eve. I think this is a great way to get your child thinking about their actions and thinking about those around them and how to help others. It's also a way to get your child out of the me me me commercialism that the holiday season can turn into. My daughter is excited to earn her straw this year. She's already thinking of ways to earn a little each day. I gave the Good Deeds Manager a 5 star review because it brings families together, teaches children to think of others, reminds us that the season is not all about presents and what we get but what  can we do to help others and it's incredible teaching tool.

"Every year for Christmas Eve I make a box with a new set of PJs and a few other things for my daughter to help get her through the excitement of the night. Well this year I'm adding in a set of Pjs for her doll! Just to be sure these would work I tried them on her AG doll while she was at school. Perfect fit!

"The holidays are near and I'm on the look out for some presents for a special little girl and her AG doll Grace. The Irish Step Dancing outfit is adorable!

"he holidays are right around the corner. For me, that means spending a fair amount of time in the kitchen cooking meals for the family. More time than normal. And cooking for larger groups. The KUKPO 5 quart colander will come in handy when making some of those dishes.So I bet you are wondering why the holidays will be easier with this around the house. Well, it's going to make time in the kitchen easier. Think about when I have to drain all those cans of green beans to make my famous green been casserole. I can drain all the cans into the colander without have to take a break and dump them into the dish. There's plenty of room!Once I'm done boiling those 5 pounds of taters I can dump them in the KUKPO 5 quart colander. It's a large enough colander they should all fit. Then I can dump them back into the pot and get to mashing! I can see myself using this kitchen tool time and time again with various recipes. When you are cooking for a large group it's nice to have tools that can handle large capacities.How about making a huge batch of spaghetti and meatballs for game day? All that pasta can easily be strained with this colander. No need to worry about it overflowing and going to waste.

I would take the mug out of the cooler, dry it off and then pour the milk (individual shelf stable milks we kept in the cooler) and serve it with her dinner. It helped to keep the milk cool while we ate. And just in case you are wondering - shelf stable milk is great for camping! But buy it in the individual boxes. It taste great cold so having the mule cup with us was perfect. Plus the mule cup is sturdy. If she drops it, it won't break. And it cleans up nicely.

It also makes it easier to turn kabobs because the curve of the tongs just seems to grip the meats and veggies better. The spatula is solid and works perfectly for flipping burgers and flattening them on the grill. All the tools are a little over sized which makes it easy to hold.I gave the BBQ Grill Tool Set a 5 star review because they are sturdy, over sized making them easier to hold, the tongs are curved making picking up meats a breeze and the spatula does not bend when flattening burgers.

My favorite part is when you open the pamphlet the inside is full of all the common essential oils, It gives a picture of the plant, name of the oil, botanical name, the benefits it can provide, the uses and a caution area too. Then if you turn over to the back cover there is a glossary for word used throughout the pamphlet as well as the definitions. There is also a section of ailments with a listing of which oils to use for each one. The front over is full of basic information like the different uses of essential oils, how to purchase them on how to store them. If you want a quick reference guide this is a great for that. There is lots of useful information.I gave the Aromatherapy Quickstudy a 5 star review because it has lots of useful information, has a listing of common essential oils and goes into detail about them, has a list of ailments with solutions and is simple to understand. I received the Aromatherapy Quickstudy pamphlet complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"If you are new to essential oils and aromatherapy this is a good book to have. It will help you learn to combine oils and help you learn which oils will help with which ailments. There are 6 chapters - Aromatics - Past to Present (a little history lesson), Combining Scent and Touch, Selecting and Using Pure Oils, Aromatherapy Formulas, Essential Oils A to Z and a Quick Guide to Properties.My favorite chapter is Aromatherapy Formulas. There are lots of recipes! From air fresheners to deodorants to sunscreen and more. There are recipes you can use in every aspect of your life. I also like how it educates you on the various types of essential oils.I gave the 500 Formulas for Aromatherapy a 5 star review because it tells you the various levels of oils, has tons of recipes and is a wonderful reference book.

"DIY Aromatherapy: Over 130 Affordable Essential Oils Blends for Health, Beauty, and HomeThis is a wonderful book for first timers. The first few pages of the books explains the differences between essential oils, hydrosols and fragrance oils. Then it goes into the history and uses of essential oils. The writing flows well and is easy to read. I've been a user of essential oils for a few years now and even I learned a lot from sixths book.  I really like that there are several pages that go over safety, safety on how to use the oils, safety using them when you're pregnant, have allergies, ect.. I appreciate how they pointed out common allergies like ragweed and said do not use chamomile on your skin because you are likely to have a reaction. It's a very common allergy, I'm allergic to ragweed but never knew this fact.There are 8 chapters in the book that will cover what you need to know to start using essential oils. They are Aromatherapy Basics, Shopping for Aromatherapy Projects, Your First Aromatherapy Blends, Oils and Remedies for Health, Beauty & Home, 35 Oils to Know and Use, Remedies for Health & Healing, Remedies for Cosmetic Care, Remedies for the Home and Perfume Recipes. This is a great book to help you get started on incorporating essential oils into your life.I received the DIY Aromatherapy: over 130 Affordable Essential Oil Blends for Health, Beauty and Home complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I have two German Shepherds so when I was offered a chance to receive the Bazook-9 Dog Tennis Ball Launcher at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review I agreed. When the launcher arrived I was pretty eager to take it out of the packaging and try it out. Without the dogs around I loaded a tennis ball, pulled the plunger back all the way and then shot it into the air. The ball only went about 30 feet. Not nearly enough for a German Shepherd. I can easily throw the ball farther than it went with this launcher.I gave the Bazook  -9 Dog Tennis Ball launcher a 3 star review because while it did work and launched a ball in the air with ease it did not go far. And if you are trying to exercise a dog this would only work for a small dog. Larger dogs will get bored easily and it will not give them a work out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15689WFGPZHWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01721QZDK#wasThisHelpful","R15689WFGPZHWE","A3VTI5TFS1JNH3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VTI5TFS1JNH3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'd never seen this 1980 series before, but a friend who's a horror fan told me about it so I took a chance. Hammer's TV venture was interesting--15 original teleplays, about 50 minutes each, with British stars of the day in stories of suspense and the supernatural. They're not all gems, but I'm so impressed with the effort that I'm giving it 5 stars anyway. Too bad we don't have anything like this on TV these days, to say nothing of Thriller, Outer Limits, and Twilight Zone. Oh, well, we can still enjoy these.

"When Carl Martins father dies, Carl inherits a house in London and his fathers collection of homeopathic remedies. To make ends meet, he rents out the top floor to a stranger, a local veterinary assistant named Dermot McKinnon. He also decides to sell some of the medicine to a friend--and thereby hangs a tale. Soon, Carl is driven to the edge of madness by a mounting plot of blackmail and murder. This dark, claustrophobic story reminded me of another Rendell favorite, The Lake of Darkness, about the lottery winner and his creepy stalker. The growing tension between Carl and Dermot kept me turning the pages, wondering how it would all turn out.Ruth Rendell is my favorite author, and Im still mourning her loss. I attended her final appearance here in NYC last January, just before she died. She was 85 years old, and she left behind more than 60 novels and a couple hundred short stories of mystery and suspense. Ive read them all, many of them more than once. If you havent yet discovered this great mystery writer, you have a treat in store. Im sad that there wont be any more.

"Wow, this collection brings back great memories! I remember watching a lot of these mini-movies on late-night TV back in the '80s. This British omnibus show ran for 6 seasons (1973-78), with a grand total of 43 suspense stories. Each 65-minute story has British and American stars of the day in (mostly) good tales of murder, madness, and the macabre. Not all 43 are gems, but a surprising number of them hold up very well, and a few of them are as good as anything I ever saw on The Twilight Zone or Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Everyone will have their fave episodes--mine are ""Someone at the Top of the Stairs,"" ""A Coffin For the Bride"" (with a very young Helen Mirren!), and ""I'm the Girl He Wants To Kill."" Those titles alone tell you what to expect. The ITV Studios boxed set of discs is excellent, with clear picture and sound (for the period). No extras, but we can't have everything. If you're a fan of this show, or if you just love well-made TV thrillers, this package is for you. Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FSXNHQC31DVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1VJRJU#wasThisHelpful","R2FSXNHQC31DVD","A3CE57YNGVWBQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CE57YNGVWBQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 1977 film version of Sidney Sheldon's bestselling 1973 novel, The Other Side of Midnight, was not very good, but it had one element that was a complete success--the musical score by Michel Legrand. I was a budding composer in college when the film was released, and I actually sat through it twice in theaters, once for the silly, romantic plot and once just so I could hear the score again. I studied how Legrand worked his various themes into each part of the film, and I noted how the sweeping main melody, ""Noelle's Theme,"" kept arriving in almost every scene. This melody acted much like the woman herself--sometimes grandly symphonic, sometimes a simple piano solo, but always there in the background to connect the various other characters with her overwhelming power and passion. Noelle's story--love, hatred, obsession, revenge, murder--is on the epic scale of a Greek tragedy, and Legrand's music always supports it, from the ominous opening (""Prologue"") straight through to the triumphant finale (""Adieu, Noelle""). If the film itself had been as good as the music, it would have become a classic. Alas, the movie was a flop, but the score lives on.I'm glad this soundtrack album is finally available on CD because I lost my old LP years ago. Listening to it again after all these years, I'm amazed at how fresh and powerful it is. Legrand won several Oscars for scoring other films (The Thomas Crown Affair, Summer of '42, etc.), but I honestly think this is his best film work. If you're a fan of his, you must experience this wonderful score. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25RR80XZJ4E9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9A5VTS#wasThisHelpful","R25RR80XZJ4E9A","A3CE57YNGVWBQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CE57YNGVWBQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A young British widow on holiday in coastal France stumbles on an insidious plot, turning her relaxing vacation into a nerve-jangling nightmare. This is the basic outline of a lot of mystery novels, but few writers have done it as well as the late, great Mary Stewart. MADAM, WILL YOU TALK? was her first published novel in 1955, and she followed it with a long and glorious career. In addition to her famous cycle of books about King Arthur (The Merlin Trilogy), she wrote more than a dozen novels of romantic suspense, a category she practically invented.This novel is a perfect example of Mary Stewart's distinctive style. There's a clever, charming young woman in an exotic locale (Avignon and Marseilles). There's a colorful group of friends and suspects. There's a man who may or may not be a romantic prospect. And there's a dangerous mystery--real, visceral peril for the heroine. Above all, Stewart's writing is lush and descriptive, bringing her people and places to vivid life. I reread her books frequently, and they stand the test of time. My other favorites are Nine Coaches Waiting (Rediscovered Classics), The Ivy Tree (Rediscovered Classics), and The Moon-Spinners (Rediscovered Classics). If you haven't yet discovered this magical writer, you should.

"A highly-regarded doctor in coastal England (Anthony Perkins) takes a great interest in an amnesiac man (Charles Bronson) who shows up at his hospital. He goes so far as to take the confused, possibly violent man home with him for ""treatment."" This is a set-up, of course--the surgeon has a complicated plan to avenge himself on his cheating wife (Jill Ireland) and her lover. And Bronson--who may or may not be a serial killer on the loose--is the key to Perkins' plan.I love a good suspense thriller, but this odd film from 1971 (a British movie with American stars) looks and sounds like a filmed play. I'm willing to bet that this was an unproduced theatrical play someone handed to a film producer, and the producer saw a way to make a reasonably entertaining, inexpensive movie out of it with one set and four actors. 90% of the action takes place in one room! I think it would have made a better play than a film. But the cast is very good, and there's a neat, sardonic twist at the end. It's okay--and a must for Bronson fans. You've never seen him in a part like this before!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TQQH6A1Y658Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ION230#wasThisHelpful","R2TQQH6A1Y658Y","A3CE57YNGVWBQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CE57YNGVWBQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't familiar with this little gem from 1958 until it arrived as a Warner Archive DVD. I love twisty mysteries, so I gave it a look. Michael Anderson followed his Oscar for Best Picture for AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS (1956) with this shadowy, well-made thriller. A diamond heiress living on the Costa del Sol in Spain (Anne Baxter) is suddenly confronted by a sinister stranger (Richard Todd) claiming to be her dead brother. She calls the police, and the local inspector (Herbert Lom) investigates. This obvious ""con job"" leads to a genuinely surprising turn of events.From one of the biggest epics ever made to a small, intimate, 5-character thriller set in a remote Spanish villa: I'm really impressed with Michael Anderson's range. Anne Baxter is excellent, the rest of the cast is solid, and the production values are above average, particularly the music (with the great Julian Bream on guitar). It's a perfect movie for anyone who likes to be surprised.

"The leader of an underground Irish movement (James Mason) is mortally injured during a bank robbery, and he spends the next few hours trying to get back to his hideout in the unfriendly streets of an unnamed Irish city. This seemingly simple plot brings together a large cross-section of Irish society, vivid characters who either help or hinder the antihero. There is a fascination in this story, almost hypnotic, that's hard to describe. The dark black-and-white photography, the beautiful music score, and the performances of Mason and the rest of the superb cast combine to create a film experience you won't forget. And it all builds to a surprising--and surprisingly moving--ending.The Criterion Blu-Ray has been remastered from original elements, and the package includes several extras of the high quality we've come to expect from the Criterion Collection. ODD MAN OUT stands alongside Sir Carol Reed's other great noir film, THE THIRD MAN, as one of the best British movies of all time.

THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME (1932) is an exciting adventure from the makers of KING KONG with the same female lead (Fay Wray). She and Joel McCrea must escape from a madman on a remote island. AND THEN THERE WERE NONE (1945) is Rene CLair's all-star film version of the famous Agatha Christie play.

"I love suspense novels that make me think, and this is one of them. I've been hearing the buzz about this book for weeks now, so I got a copy as soon as it was available. For once, the hype is true: THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a well crafted, beautifully written thriller.Rachel is a thirtyish Brit who has recently lost her husband to another woman. She's also lost her job in London, but that doesn't stop her from commuting there on the train from her suburban home every day. Rachel is an alcoholic who's drunk all day long, and she has a problem facing reality. She harasses her ex and his new wife and child. She makes up stories about strangers she glimpses every day from the train. And she frequently has alcohol-induced blackouts. She's not the world's most reliable narrator--which causes definite problems when one of the people she watches goes missing and is presumed dead...Paula Hawkins has written a first novel that is amazingly polished and professional. Her missing woman mystery is a good one, and we learn about it through three narrators--Rachel, her ex-husband's new wife, and the missing woman herself. Jumping back and forth in time, before and after the disappearance, Hawkins teases the reader onward toward a disturbing conclusion. Like the train at the center of the story, it just keeps moving forward to the end of the line. I'm still thinking about it, and I'm telling everyone about it.

"Screenwriter Hossein Amini (Drive) always dreamed of writing a film adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's dark 1964 novel, THE TWO FACES OF JANUARY, and he finally realized that dream. He also ended up directing it, and it's an auspicious directorial dbut. The movie stars Viggo Mortensen, Kirsten Dunst, and Oscar Isaac, and it was filmed on locations in Athens, Crete, and Istanbul.Athens, 1962: A young American slacker, Rydal (Isaac), acts as a tour guide, living on the tips and spare cash he cons out of unwary foreigners. He meets Chester and Colette, an older American businessman (Mortensen) and his beautiful young wife (Dunst), and offers to show them around. He soon helps them out of a jam. Chester is really a major fraudster who's escaped the law (and his creditors) by fleeing to Europe, and a detective tracks him to his hotel. Chester accidentally kills the detective, and now he and Colette must get out of Athens fast. Rydal takes them to Crete, where he arranges for false papers to conceal their tracks. From there, the plot evolves into a modern version of a Greek drama among the splendid ancient ruins.Amini manages to capture the peculiar, oppressive Highsmith atmosphere that her fans (including me) are so wild about. The production values are first-rate, with lots of gorgeous scenery, including the Acropolis, the temple of Knossos at Iraklion in Crete (where a murder occurs), and Istanbul's sinister Grand Bazaar (for a chase and shootout in the dead of night). All in all, it ranks high on my list of Highsmith film adaptations.

"These candles are amazing! I didn't really have high expectations when I ordered a couple of them (Orange Lemon Splash and Clothesline Fresh).

"I grew up with this 1965 version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's made-for-TV musical, and I love it. I got the 2002 Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment DVD as soon as it was available, and I've loved it all these years. But when I saw that there was a remastered new version with a better picture quality, I decided to upgrade. That's when I discovered a problem.My 4-star review for this 5-star musical is for one reason only--the sound. The picture now is much better than on the earlier DVD, with clear images and brighter colors. BUT...the original 2002 disc was in Dolby Surround, using the stereo pre-recordings of the musical numbers and background music that were featured on the 1965 cast album from Columbia Records (Cinderella (1965 Television Cast)). This new ""improved"" 2014 DVD from Shout Factory doesn't have that stereo soundtrack--they've replaced it with the original monaural TV audio tracks from 1965, and I have to wonder why they did that.When the special was made for TV in 1965, the entire score was pre-recorded twice--once in 2-channel stereo for the inevitable original cast album that would be released to stores, and once in mono. The actual broadcast used the single, flat, monaural tracks for the monaural TVs of the time, and that's what we heard on TV in 1965 (I was 9 years old). The stereo record arrived soon after that, with a much fuller, more resonant sound quality. Not only were all the instruments of the orchestra and the voices of the chorus more clearly defined, but the principal voices were much improved by the dual amplification. Most particularly, the 2-channel Surround helped 18-year-old Lesley Ann Warren, whose lovely, light soprano voice sounded rather thin on the original monaural TV broadcast. She sounded much better on the record--and she sounded much better on the Columbia Tristar 2002 DVD. Now, this 2014 HD DVD gives us those old, flat mono tracks, and Warren sounds thin and insubstantial again. So does everyone else, for that matter. Why? Why didn't the people making the new DVD use the superior stereo tracks of the original DVD?To hear the difference yourself on the new Shout Factory DVD, listen to the overture that was added to the cast album and the discs but never officially a part of the TV broadcast. It's in 2-Channel Dolby Surround on both versions. Then the actual program begins with the main titles, and from then on what you hear is in mono. If you can't hear the dramatic difference in sound quality between the overture and the program itself, you'll probably be fine with this new DVD. If you DO hear the difference--especially if you use headphones or earbuds--then you'll know why I'm complaining. The entire 2002 Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment disc sounds like that overture!I appreciate the better picture quality, but I won't be watching this new Shout Factory DVD again. I'll stick with my 2002 Columbia Tristar DVD. The picture isn't quite as good, but that lush Dolby Surround soundtrack makes all the difference. If you can find a copy of the original DVD that isn't crazy expensive, you might also prefer it to this new version. (I'm a musician, and sound quality is more important to me than picture quality--this is a musical, after all.) Either way, it's a great show, possibly the best made-for-TV musical ever.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSKMUPC9FK5L9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JHH1ZN8#wasThisHelpful","RSKMUPC9FK5L9","A3CE57YNGVWBQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CE57YNGVWBQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This terrific courtroom drama from 1957 is based on the hit play by Agatha Christie, and it's been called ""the best Hitchcock movie not made by Hitchcock."" That pretty much sums it up. It's a gripping, surprising story of a man on trial for his life (Tyrone Power), the eminent defense attorney trying to free him (Charles Laughton), and his mysterious wife (Marlene Dietrich) whose shady agenda is unclear. And it has a shocker of an ending that only Agatha Christie could have imagined.This new DVD version of WFTP is excellent, a big improvement on the earlier MGM DVD. It's been remastered in high definition, so it looks and sounds much better than before. (I can't speak for the new Blu-Ray version, but I'll assume it's at least as good as this DVD--why wouldn't it be?) This is a real upgrade of a classic thriller with Billy Wilder's excellent direction and career-best performances from Power, Laughton, and especially Dietrich. It really is one of the finest courtroom dramas ever filmed. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32TFPD44NV43I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6D1QV8#wasThisHelpful","R32TFPD44NV43I","A3CE57YNGVWBQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CE57YNGVWBQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A hapless NY reporter (Joel McCrea) is sent to Europe on the eve of WWII to get a scoop on conditions there from a renowned diplomat (Oscar nominee Albert Basserman). The diplomat is immediately assassinated--or is he? McCrea pursues the assassins, first in a sinister windmill in rural Holland, and later in England. Along the way, he meets a friendly Brit diplomat (Herbert Marshall) and his beautiful daughter (Laraine Day), who soon become involved in the intrigue. And everyone he meets seems to be trying to kill him. The film speeds through one adventure after another, culminating in a terrifying plane ride no viewer will ever forget.This Oscar-nominated gem from 1940 is one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock films. It's also an important link in the Hitchcock chain, if you're a fan like me. Hitch's favorite theme throughout his career was the ""man on the run,"" the innocent bystander who is plunged into danger against his will and must survive by his wits. The trend began with THE 39 STEPS and the original version of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH back in the 1930s. Then came FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT and SABOTEUR. Finally, we had the wonderful 1955 remake of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH and his crowning achievement, NORTH BY NORTHWEST. In FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, you can see many of Hitchcock's signature ideas in an early form. It's a wonderful movie. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DHDZY305WVCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPPXNEE#wasThisHelpful","R1DHDZY305WVCP","A3CE57YNGVWBQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CE57YNGVWBQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's an old urban legend. Or maybe it's the worst-kept secret in the world. It might be both. It is...the formula for synthetic fuel that can run all gas-based engines more efficiently and ecologically, at a fraction of the cost. If it existed, it would be the greatest advance in mass transportation since the invention of the steam engine. And it would put the big oil companies out of business. All of them. Permanently. Naturally, Big Oil will do anything--ANYTHING--to keep this formula off the market. And only one man can stop them. Or can he...?Steve Shagan's bestselling novel, THE FORMULA, was filmed in 1980 by director John G. Avildsen (ROCKY, THE KARATE KID). George C. Scott plays the burnt-out, divorced cop who stumbles on a string of dead bodies and an insidious plot to keep the world enslaved to the gas engine. Marthe Keller is the mysterious woman who may or may not be trying to help him. Marlon Brando is the ubiquitous oil tycoon who opposes him. Scott runs all over Europe and America, constantly pursued by a bunch of bad guys. Wherever he goes, things blow up and more people die. There are only two scenes between Scott and Brando, but they're the best scenes in the film. This is a fun, fast-paced thriller with a plot that doesn't bear close scrutiny (Why don't they just kill him, for Pete's sake!). The book and film arrived at the height of late-1970s paranoia, with oil shortages, high prices, and long lines at gas stations, and that explains why it was popular at the time. But it holds up very well today. I guess we're all still hoping that this synthetic fuel dream becomes a reality. Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13DWCC0ZM69F8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KHME7U#wasThisHelpful","R13DWCC0ZM69F8","A3CE57YNGVWBQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CE57YNGVWBQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these double discs! I recently went looking for DVDs of two favorite films, MARATHON MAN and THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, and I found both of them in double-disc packages with two other favorites, BLACK SUNDAY and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. Both sets have excellent widescreen versions of the movies with good picture and sound. And both sets have really great prices. So I ended up with 4 great films instead of two--and for less than I thought I'd have to spend. Now, that's a bargain!This package has two really intense thrillers from 1976 and 1977, with great directors, John Schlesinger (MARATHON MAN) and John Frankenheimer (BLACK SUNDAY). They also both have the same leading lady, beautiful Swiss actress Marthe Keller (THE FORMULA, FEDORA, etc.).MARATHON MAN is a creepy cat-and-mouse game that pits a vicious Nazi war criminal (Laurence Olivier) against an innocent college student (Dustin Hoffman) and his girlfriend (Keller) in 1970s New York City. When Hoffman's CIA agent brother (Roy Scheider) is murdered by the Nazi, he becomes inadvertently involved in the villain's attempt to retrieve a stolen fortune. The Nazi was a dentist in the death camps, and that fact leads to one of the most excruciating interrogation scenes you'll ever see. (""Is it safe?"") Goldman wrote the screenplay based on his own bestselling novel, and Schlesinger (MIDNIGHT COWBOY) once again makes NYC seem like the most sinister place on earth.In light of recent historical events, BLACK SUNDAY is no longer the same movie I saw in a theater in 1977. I was a college student then, and the story of fanatical Islamic terrorists planning to blow up the Super Bowl (with the President of the United States in attendance) seemed like great fun. Not anymore. Now, this long, detailed film seems more like a cautionary tale than entertainment. It is practically a step-by-step ""How To"" instruction manual for lunatics. Based on the bestselling novel by Thomas Harris (RED DRAGON, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS), it is a truly chilling experience. Marthe Keller is the crazy terrorist in charge of the deadly plot, with Bruce Dern (COMING HOME, NEBRASKA) as her even crazier American accomplice. Robert Shaw (JAWS, THE STING) is the Israeli Mossad agent who tries to stop them. Frankenheimer (THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE) keeps the big story racing to the jaw-dropping finale. (Note: this movie was filmed long before the invention of CGI special effects, so most of what you see actually had to be staged. Amazing!)So, two great thrillers for one low price! (PS: The other double album I mentioned is All The President Men / Three Days of The Condor (DBFE).

"This double DVD was a real find! I was looking for a copy of THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, and I found this package. I hadn't watched either film since I first saw them in theaters in 1975 and '76, and they both hold up beautifully.ATPM is just about the best film I've ever seen about working journalists--along with HIS GIRL FRIDAY, of course. But this story happens to be true. And horrifying. I lived through the actual events, and Alan J. Pakula and his screenwriter, William Goldman (who won an Oscar for this), really caught the mood of the country at that time. Redford and Hoffman are superb, and the supporting cast is wonderful.TDOTC is a terrific suspense thriller about a CIA employee who suddenly finds himself ""out in the cold,"" with Redford once again in top form as the terrified hero. It's based on James Grady's excellent novel, Six Days of the Condor, with the nonstop action made even more immediate by the subtraction of three days from the original story. Cliff Robertson, Faye Dunaway, and especially Max Von Sydow are perfect in their parts. Sidney Pollack directed several of my favorite films, and this is one of them.This DVD set has excellent widescreen picture and clear sound. Not a lot of extras, but a great price for two great films.

"Good news for everyone who loved last summer's Blood of the Lamb--the second book in Sam Cabot's exciting paranormal series is here!Livia Pietro and Father Thomas Kelly have left Rome for New York City, where they're soon joined by their friend, Spencer George. If you don't know who these three detectives are, you should. I'll give you a tantalizing hint: Only one of them is, um, mortal. And that's the fun in this particular series. In the first book, an old document that involved the Roman Catholic Church led our protagonists to some shocking discoveries about a group called the Noantri-what we, in English, would call vampires. Now, in SKIN OF THE WOLF, they're on a case that involves an old American Indian ceremonial mask, a murder at Sotheby's auction house, and a group of Native Americans who are not unlike the Noantri. They're just from a different, um, strain of supernatural beings. (The book's title will give you a big hint!) Livia, Thomas, and Spencer must stop them before...well, find out for yourself.I enjoyed BLOOD OF THE LAMB, but I think I like SKIN OF THE WOLF even more.

"Her name is Mia, a 25-year-old art teacher from a well-to-do Chicago family. She's been abducted by a man she met in a bar and held captive at a remote cabin in another state. Now she's returned--but the woman who comes back is not at all like the woman who vanished. She calls herself Chloe now, and she apparently doesn't remember much of her ordeal or of her life before it. Amnesia, the doctors call it. Her socialite mother, a concerned police detective assigned to the case, and the abductor himself take turns filling in the blanks of Mia/Chloe's story. And it's quite a story...Mary Kubica's first novel is unusually constructed: several voices, all in the present tense, jumping back (""Before"") and forth (""After"") in time. This may sound complicated, but it isn't. For a first novel, THE GOOD GIRL is amazingly polished and professional. All the characters spring to life as they speak, and I really began to care about them--especially the young woman at the center of the plot.I've already seen early reviews comparing this to GONE GIRL by Gillian Flynn and STILL MISSING by Chevy Stevens, and I think it's every bit as good as both of them. If you like low-key psychological suspense stories about troubled families and the secrets they hide, you really should try this.

The copy I just bought has 4 DVDs in it--each title is its own disc. I think they must have added this improvement after earlier customers complained about the packaging. But it's now 4 discs, so no more worries about scratching or marring them.There's no point in saying much about the films themselves because they're among the most famous movies in the world. Great scripts, direction, acting, and atmosphere, from a time (the 1940s and '50s) when films were made a lot more carefully and lovingly than they are now. There's not a bad one in the bunch. And getting them this way is a big moneysaver--individually, they'd be 2 to 3 times the price. If you want to add these 4 classics to your DVD library (and who doesn't?), this is the way to get them.

"Howard and Deborah Morgan are aging New Agers who once set up a karmic paradise at Stoneyridge, their freehold farm in rural England. He was a potter and she a weaver, and they raised sheep for modest profit while home-schooling their only child, Adam. More recently, they set the place up as a bed-and-breakfast for occasional tourists in the area. But now, Howard is an invalid, Deborah is his 24/7 nurse, Adam has escaped the farm for the real world, the sheep are dying of neglect, and the bed-and-breakfast is a bust.

What happens next is...a crime?I've loved the dark psychological thrillers of Morag Joss ever since I read her wonderful first novel, Half Broken Things, and I particularly admired The Night Following. Her writing style is lush and eloquent. Her main characters are always people with big emotional issues, and the suspense in her stories is always based on the fragility of human nature.

"This British series from the 1970s is a real treat for suspense fans. It ran for 5 seasons, and this package is Season One, the first 10 episodes. I saw most of them as a kid when they first aired in the US, and 40 years later they're as good as I remember. Each film is approx. 65-70 minutes long, with a ""3-act play"" set-up (2 breaks for commercials, which are NOT included--Yay!). Brian Clemens is a sort of Brit Rod Serling/Alfred Hitchcock, and he wrote most of these stories. (He also wrote several great theatrical suspense films, including AND SOON THE DARKNESS and SEE NO EVIL.)These 10 stories are well produced and directed, with strong casts headed by one or two stars in each episode (Robert Powell, Barbara Feldon, Richard Johnson, Polly Bergen, Paul Burke, Sinead Cusack, Diane Cilento, etc.). They range in quality from excellent (""Possession,"" ""A Place To Die,"" ""Spell of Evil"") to average (""An Echo of Theresa,"" ""Murder In Mind""), with 1 genuine classic in the batch: ""Someone At the Top of the Stairs."" This episode, about two college girls (Donna Mills and Judy Carne) who take a room in a creepy London boarding house, is simply ""marvelous!"" (You'll know the significance of that word after you've seen it.) My vivid memories of this episode prompted me to buy the whole box, and I'm glad I did.If you like TWILIGHT ZONE, ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, OUTER LIMITS, and the American THRILLER (hosted by Boris Karloff), you'll like this show as well.

I couldn't remember much about it, only that it involved a car breaking down and 2 young men going to a creepy house where someone named Eula Lee lived. I remember being terrified, and all my life I tried to find out what it was.

I watched ""Pigeons"" and the other 9 episodes here, and I must say, they're pretty scary!I love THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE OUTER LIMITS and especially ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, but I'm only now discovering THRILLER. Boris Karloff is the host, and he's wonderful. The stories are definitely weird, and a couple of them (""Pigeons"" and ""The Incredible Dr. Markesan"") are truly nightmarish--even scarier than those other scary series from the 1950s and 1960s.

"This is one of the best films I've ever seen on the subject of crime and criminals, and the effect crime has on the people who get caught up in it. Director David Fincher took the original memoir of San Francisco Chronicle journalist Robert Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal in the movie) and fashioned it into a story that is less a whodunit than it is a character study of obsession and its consequences. We may never know the truth about the crazed killer, but this film gives us a good idea of what Graysmith and various other journalists, cops, and Feds went through in their pursuit of him. By concentrating on victims and bystanders rather than the perp himself, Fincher has managed to convey a sense of the true horror of violent crime. He's also made a suspense film that Hitchcock himself would admire. The entire cast is excellent, and the sense of time and place (1960s-70s San Francisco) is vivid. I'll never forget it. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM3S4ORUPXOE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XCZGV8#wasThisHelpful","RM3S4ORUPXOE9","A3CE57YNGVWBQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CE57YNGVWBQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third-best recording of GYPSY I've ever heard, and I was glad to add it to my library. I saw it on Broadway, and I also saw Angela Lansbury and Tyne Daly, not to mention the movie (which we won't mention) and Bette Midler on TV. I'm too young to have seen the original with Ethel Merman, but I'm from a show-biz home, and my late mom (an actress) always mentioned the original 1959 production in hushed whispers, the same way she described the original productions of MY FAIR LADY and WEST SIDE STORY. Anyway, I'd rank this recording after Merman and Lansbury, but before Daly. (I never saw or heard Bernadette Peters, but I'm sure she's great, too.) Whichever recording you prefer, it's definitely one of the Top 10 Broadway scores ever, so you really can't go wrong.

"I'm a die-hard R&H fan, so I was very interested to get this specially-recorded studio version of their rarest score. Well, the good news is that we now have a good recording of the score. The so-so news is that the score is so-so, just like the play itself. Big props to R&H for trying something so outside the box--they were reportedly inspired by Thornton Wilder's OUR TOWN, and you can see the influence. But ALLEGRO just never rises to the ranks of their great works like OKLAHOMA!, CAROUSEL, SOUTH PACIFIC, etc. The score is hard to follow, with its combinations of many different styles and sounds, but the cast of singers assembled to perform it here is impressive. It certainly is fascinating, and there are a couple of outstanding songs, if not hits. If you're as interested in the evolution of this immortal duo as I am, you'll want to hear this work at least once.

"I've loved this retro-noir movie ever since I first saw it in a theater in 1981. It's a slightly altered updating of my favorite noir film of all time, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, and writer/director Lawrence Kasdan really honored the Billy Wilder original, not to mention James M. Cain's wonderful novel. William Hurt and Kathleen Turner are perfectly matched as the conniving lovers, and they're ably supported by Richard Crenna, a pre-CHEERS Ted Danson, and a very young Mickey Rourke, among others. Great atmosphere and lots of heat--in the weather, in the story, and in the bodies (I guess that's why they called it BODY HEAT). And John Barry's musical score deserves special mention. This is a terrific thriller, start to finish.

"I first saw JCS on Broadway in 1971 when I was a teen, and I loved it. Then I saw this film version in a theater in 1973, and it was very impressive. Norman Jewison (IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF) took an energetic young cast of unknowns to the Israeli desert to tell the greatest story ever told in authentic surroundings. The Webber/Rice score is beautifully presented, the imaginative staging is often stunning to watch, and the cast is just about perfect. You don't have to be particularly religious (I'm not) to enjoy this fresh examination of the final week in the life of Jesus. The ""rock opera"" approach makes the well-known Bible story seem immediate and vital. This Special Edition DVD of JCS looks great and sounds greater.

"This film was a pleasantly nasty surprise--or maybe it was a nastily pleasant surprise. Whatever. I first saw it on cable after a lot of friends recommended it, and I couldn't believe an American film company would go so far out on a limb with such dark material. It seems much more like something the Europeans would do. I'm very proud that it's an American movie--it proves that we can sometimes make sophisticated black comedies like everyone else. The cast is perfect, the script is wonderfully twisty (and twisted), and everyone involved should be very proud of themselves. Thank you, John McNaughton, and please make more movies like this.

"William Bellman spends his entire life haunted by one bad decision he made in childhood. That life is the subject of Diane Setterfield's second novel, seven years after her glorious dbut, The Thirteenth Tale. First at his family's fabric mill in rural England, and later in a very peculiar business of his own in London, William is constantly followed and watched by...something. His business fortunes, his wife and children, his fleeting happiness--everything he acquires in life manages to vanish, leaving him older and increasingly bitter and hermitic. Will he ever finally confront the demon that has always threatened him? That's the big question at the heart of BELLMAN & BLACK.B&B is subtitled ""a ghost story,"" but it isn't your usual kind of ghost story. The title of my review is a quote from the book on the subject of rooks, the strange, beautiful black birds that resemble crows. If you read B&B, you'll learn a great deal about these elusive creatures, and you'll see what they have to do with the fate of William Bellman. It's definitely unusual.I bought this book from Amazon.uk last month and had it shipped to me here in NYC because I couldn't wait for the American release--that should tell you how much I loved THE THIRTEENTH TALE. The first book reminded me of Charles Dickens and Daphne du Maurier, my all-time favorite authors. This new book reminds me of the same giants, but not in the same way. B&B is a shorter, simpler story than TTT, and it made me think of A CHRISTMAS CAROL. If you consider William Bellman as a stand-in for Ebenezer Scrooge, you begin to see just what Setterfield is up to. I can't say I loved this the way I loved the first one, but it's an interesting, surprisingly fast read, and Setterfield's vivid, graceful prose is always welcome in my house. Try it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL81UFE9YMOJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147671195X#wasThisHelpful","RL81UFE9YMOJP","A3CE57YNGVWBQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CE57YNGVWBQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book I've read in the new line of thriller novellas from Hammer, and also the first book I've read by Julie Myerson. She's apparently a highly-regarded British author, but you'd never know it from this anemic thriller. I love the old Hammer films from the 1960s and '70s, but THE QUICKENING doesn't really follow that tradition.A young honeymoon couple in Antigua--she's rich and pregnant, he's poor and acting suspicious. Some local natives warn her to get herself and her husband away from the island. Then she starts seeing a phantom, or zombie, or something--a young man covered in dirt (from a grave?) who tells her that her groom is responsible for his death. So far, so good, right? But then it just goes on--the groom keeps acting fishy, and everyone in their resort hotel thinks the bride is going crazy. (Try counting the number of times people ask the heroine if she's feeling okay.) It builds to a fairly shocking finale, if you have the patience to stick with it until then.Myerson's fancy writing style (she doesn't use contractions or quotation marks) isn't really suitable for the thriller genre, and that may be the main problem here. I gave it 3 stars because she's clearly a good writer, and some of the descriptions are vivid, but I suspect her other, non-horror books are probably better than this. It's not the thrill ride I was expecting. Based on this, I'm not rushing to get more books in the Hammer horror line.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NL4WX9K8SAT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0099580233#wasThisHelpful","R3NL4WX9K8SAT6","A3CE57YNGVWBQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CE57YNGVWBQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I fell in love with this cool, compact keyboard when it was first introduced on iMacs in 2009. It was only available for about a year, then Apple discontinued it, replacing it with the bigger, wider, more detailed aluminum-framed keyboard that includes a number pad on the extreme right and a middle section with various buttons and arrows for gamers. (This is the model that is currently available from Apple.)I'm a writer. I use my iMac for work. I do not play games, watch movies, or do any other superfluous things on my machine. This sleek little keyboard--with just the QWERTY keys and the usual other keys above and around them--has everything I need. It is ALL I need. My original one gave up the ghost, and I found a new one from a terrific seller right here on Amazon Marketplace. These particular keyboards are getting harder and harder to find--even on eBay--but Amazon always seems to have whatever I'm looking for.

I wasn't aware of the many, many tricksters out there who are marketing so-called ""authentic"" Uniden batteries that are not the real thing. I looked at several choices on Amazon, and I found the correct battery based on 2 clues: the product number and cover info (which are on the authentic battery that came with my phone in the first place) and the fact that this product page clearly states that it is for Uniden phones (the phony batteries offer a long list of brands their battery will be ""compatible"" with).Here's a big hint: You get what you pay for. The phony, knockoff batteries are deeply discounted ($5-$6), while the real batteries cost more. This one is authentic, and it works fine in my phone.

The writing, direction, and acting are first-rate, and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant, Kate Miskin, in the BBC adaptations of the P. D.

"This 1966 film is a classic of its kind. At the height of the James Bond craze, it dared to be different. Using Adam Hall's bestselling novel as a blueprint, director Michael Anderson (AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, THE SHOES OF THE FISHERMAN) came up with a dark, twisty, ironic look at the real spy trade, as opposed to Hollywood's usual version of it. To do this, he kept his direction and his actors very low-key, but his secret ingredient was the screenplay by...Harold Pinter! Yes, Harold Pinter, the Nobel Prize-winning British playwright.Pinter didn't usually do this sort of thing--a slick, commercial secret agent movie--but he accepted the challenge because he had something to say about the world in 1966, and this story was a perfect way to say it. Spying is a (mostly) dull, tedious business, and the people in charge of the agents aren't always on top of things. But they're devious--everyone lies, and everyone uses whatever means necessary to get the job done. In this case, a bumbling ""control"" (Alec Guiness) throws a clueless American agent (George Segal) to the wolves in an attempt to locate and destroy a ring of neo-Nazis in Berlin. The villain (Max Von Sydow) is equally ruthless, and poor Segal may not stand a chance of succeeding--or surviving. He wanders through the city, shadowed by a sinister (and laughably obvious) group of bad guys, using code names and passwords and a lot of other silly devices to find his quarry. He even meets the requisite beautiful woman (Senta Berger), who--of course--becomes a pawn in the game. All these clichs are there for a reason--a terrific, powerful punchline at the end of the film.Pinter's dark sense of humor and Anderson's no-frills direction (Berlin in 1966 seems remarkably underpopulated) make this a real gem among spy movies of the period. It's a sober--and sobering--look at the unglamorous realities of this ""glamorous"" profession. The Fox DVD is in great shape, with the original trailer and interesting commentary by 2 film historians. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROQSVXWFYQUMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HT3PBU#wasThisHelpful","ROQSVXWFYQUMK","A3CE57YNGVWBQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CE57YNGVWBQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always been a bit of an insomniac, but I avoid prescription sleep meds. I also don't like the idea of over-the-counter sleeping aids, because I know people can get hooked on them, just like the prescription stuff.

"David Mennery is an American music critic with zero experience as a secret agent, but that's exactly what he must become, and fast. An ex-girlfriend, the daughter of a world-famous Czech novelist who has defected to the West and gone into hiding, must now be taken safely out from behind the Iron Curtain to join her politically important father. David is the only person outside Czechoslovakia who can positively identify the woman, so he's pressed into service by some shadowy CIA types. Suddenly, he and the woman are running all over Europe (circa 1975) with the help of an international band of allies--and a ruthless, high-ranking Commie on their trail. That villain happens to be the woman's ex-husband. As if this weren't enough trouble for David, he soon realizes that at least one of their ""allies"" is working for the other side...Helen MacInnes has been one of my favorite writers for many years, ever since I first read her thrilling novels as a teen back in the 1970s. She was the first--and she's still the best--woman in the male-dominated genre of international espionage. All her books are good, but THE SNARE OF THE HUNTER is particularly fast-paced, like one of those Hitchcock chase movies (THE 39 STEPS, NORTH BY NORTHWEST) where the heroes have to cover a lot of ground without being killed. Her descriptions of her settings are always vivid and colorful--this time it's Austria and Switzerland. The politics of this story may be dated, but the excitement and urgency are as fresh as ever. I'm glad MacInnes's books are now back in print, and I hope new generations discover her. She's a terrific storyteller.

"I love a good thriller, especially the ones that start with an old secret from the past coming to light. I've been hearing about this British suspense author from friends in England, so I decided to try her latest in paperback, KISS HEAVEN GOODBYE.The set-up is just the sort of thing I like: 4 young people on an island holiday, something goes wrong, ending in murder and cover-up. Now, many years later, certain evidence comes to light that endangers their old secret, and the 4, who haven't seen one another since, must get back together and decide what to do. What follows are accusations, revelations, and maybe some new murders...Usually I'd love a story like this, but I found it to be pretty superficial. The 4 leads (2 men, 2 women) aren't very interesting, and the ""old secret"" that finally gets revealed isn't much of a surprise. Tasmina Perry's writing is serviceable, but hardly inspired. I got through this, and I'm glad I tried this popular author, but I'm not rushing out to buy her other titles. A lot of other writers (British and American) do this sort of thing much better. I can't really recommend this very highly, but I'm clearly in a minority--she's one of Britain's biggest sellers. If you're curious, try it.

"This is a new and different kind of book from the wonderful Linda Barnes. Unlike her two series that feature detectives, THE PERFECT GHOST is a stand-alone suspense novel with a fascinatingly eccentric protagonist. Em Moore, the ""ghost"" of the title, is a ghostwriter of celebrity biographies. She was part of a two-person team until her writing (and sometime romantic) partner, Ted, was killed in a car accident while researching their latest project, the bio of Oscar-winning actor/director Garrett Malcolm. Em is pathologically shy and somewhat agoraphobic, but she determines to carry on with the bio alone. She goes to stay on the estate of the famed director, getting involved in his life and learning a lot of secrets about him, his family and friends, and his Hollywood colleagues. And one of these secrets may have led to her partner's death--which may or may not have been an acccident.Linda Barnes is always good, but here she really piles on the Gothic atmosphere. She also uses a lot of details of her other passions, theater and film, to tell the story. There are a lot of interesting things here about Shakespeare, theater families, and the movie industry. Above all, we get a real sense of the inner workings of her odd, damaged narrator, Em Moore. My only complaint is that the narrative is rather slow, but it builds to a nifty surprise at the end. Fans of Barnes's Carlotta Carlyle and Michael Spraggue books should enjoy this, and people who haven't yet discovered this author will find it a good place to start.

"A young British couple, Richard and Frances Myles, are asked by a friend in the government to do a spot of undercover work for king and country, and they cheerfully agree. But this is 1938, and the work they're asked to do--spying--will take them into the very heart of the Weimar Republic. This doesn't deter our intrepid heroes in the least. In fact, they actually begin to enjoy the code-breaking and clandestine meetings. Unfortunately, their adversaries are closing in, and even an innocent-looking young civilian couple may not be...ABOVE SUSPICION.This 1941 novel was the literary dbut of Scottish writer Helen MacInnes, and it was an instant hit, spending many months at the tops of bestseller lists in the UK and the USA, and it was made into a hit movie with Fred MacMurray and Joan Crawford. It established her as the first woman writing in the international espionage thriller genre, and for many years she was the only woman in the game, following ABOVE SUSPICION with 20 more bestsellers before her death in the early 1980s. Her books have been out of print for quite a while, but now they're being republished in paperback and ebook. I sincerely hope this leads new generations to discover her. I've been reading and rereading these books since I was a teenager in the 1970s. They're a bit dated, of course, but they're always fast-paced and exciting, with charming heroes, dastardly villains, and lots of exotic locations. She was one of the best thriller writers of the last century, and now you can read her in the new one.

If you want to know why, try any one of her books, starting with this one. She pretty much created this particular style of domestic thriller, and she continues to be the best of the bunch. In a world of uncertainty, I can always look forward to at least one book a year that I know I'm going to love.

"It's amazing what a few years of living can do to your perception. I saw this film in a theater in 1977, and again in the mid-80s when it was reedited and rereleased, and both times it left me cold. I thought Scorcese--one of my favorite directors--had jumped the track with his weird attempt at a musical. Now, almost 30 years after the last time I saw it, I got this 2-disc set from Amazon, thinking I'd give it one more try. And boy, was that a good idea! This isn't the movie I remember at all! But, of course, the movie hasn't changed--I have.Scorcese is very interested in film history, and this film was his attempt to fuse the past (old-time big screen musicals like 42nd Street and Singin in the Rain) with the 1970s present (gritty, realistic character studies like his own Mean Streets and Taxi Driver), using the artificial old style to comment on the dark new one, and vice-versa. The hopes and dreams of the two main characters are contrasted with their grim reality, and we get a vivid idea of what they're experiencing. Minnelli was a perfect choice--she'd just done Cabaret, which used the same contrast idea to great effect, and our inevitable memories of her mother's movies (particularly A Star Is Born) helped sustain the illusion. De Niro is fine as the brooding, conflicted antihero, and his fake-playing in the musical scenes is very impressive. The big musical numbers and the painful, sometimes violent ""book"" scenes are a jarring combination. Together, they give us a real feel for the time and place of the story. Is it a complete success? No. But it's worth seeing, anyway.I love Scorcese, mainly because he's one of the few directors who always take chances. His films don't look like anyone else's--he has his own definite stamp--and Hollywood is one place where individuality should always be encouraged. Let's just celebrate his vision, even here in NEW YORK, NEW YORK. It's not his best film, but it's a fascinating one.

"I have 4 favorite film directors of all time, and Stanley Kubrick is one of them. These 9 films are among the most stylish, visually stunning, intelligent movies ever, and watching them is always a pleasure. This package contains newly restored copies of all of them, and they look great in DVD and/or Blu-Ray. I saw everything from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY on in theaters when they were first released, so you have an idea of how long I've admired them. And the bonus documentary about the obsessive/compulsive, difficult-but-generous genius who made them is fascinating.Other reviewers here quibble about the physical packaging of the discs, but I don't have a problem with it--if you're careful with them, you'll be fine. They also argue that some of the aspect ratios are wrong, but I wouldn't know about that--they all look fine to me. As for the films themselves--well, we're all going to have favorites and others we don't like so much, and that's true for me. But even my least favorite film here is better than most other movies.Anyone who is seriously interested in the art of moviemaking must see these films. There's never been another director like him--he's one of the artists who caused critics to coin the word ""visionary"" to describe him. I really recommend this excellent boxed set. (PS: My other 3 fave directors are Hitchcock, Kurosawa, and Lean.)

"Six years ago, college professor Jake Fisher's whirlwind romance with the beautiful Natalie ended abruptly when she married another man, and he's been pining for her ever since. When Jake learns that the man Natalie married has died, he goes to the funeral, hoping to reconnect with her. There's just one problem--the widow at the funeral isn't Natalie. His search for his lost love leads to two disturbing facts: No one has seen Natalie in years, and no one remembers Jake at all. Then the attempts on his life begin. As his quest continues and the danger mounts, his confusion grows. Is he losing his mind? Or is there another, darker explanation? Where is Natalie? Who is Natalie? But the biggest question of all is, Who is Jake Fisher?I love Harlan Coben's thrillers. From Tell No One to his most recent title, Stay Close, I can't wait to devour them, and I devoured SIX YEARS in one long sitting. No other current mystery writer has his knack with a twisty, unusual plot. His characters are vivid and sympathetically drawn, and the suspense is always relentless. If you're a fan of stories that build to a powerful ""gotcha"" ending, you're in for a treat. He's always terrific, and SIX YEARS is one of his best.

"This is certainly good. With two of the worlds finest orchestras playing under the baton of an eminent conductor, what would you expect? The recording would also have to be good, of course, but there is nothing wrong with it either. The takes were done over a period of nearly 20 years, from 1970 all the way to 1989, but the 1970 sound serves the opulent Daphnis score admirably, chorus and all, and it is onwards and upwards from there. All the same, I know from experience that Ravel is able to do a lot more for me than he does on this set.I had a very similar experience with Abbados Tchaikovsky. The fourth and fifth symphonies were just fine from Abbado, but when I then listened to them performed by Mravinsky and Celibidache the experience was something of a different order altogether. At a less subjective level, the collection here is also at an almost-but-not-quite level of inclusiveness. Ma Mere lOye is not here and the Daphnis ballet is represented by the familiar second suite, but otherwise I cant think of anything of any importance that has been left out. I also dont feel like doing a serial survey of the works individually, because a blanket rating of A- seems to meet the bill in every case. Horace has a phrase aurea mediocritas  golden mediocrity  that seems particularly apt here. Im not sure I understand it exactly (perhaps we are not meant to) but it sprang into my mind unprompted as I listened to what I am offered here.Another question that I had to ask myself was -- Why buy Ravels orchestral works as a set anyway? They are not very numerous, indeed someone has calculated that Ravels entire oeuvre lasts for something like sixteen hours in total. Its possible, though not probable, that one issue might contain my ideal rendering of each individual composition, but for two hours and ten minutes worth it seems to justify the effort of identifying some kind of best in each separate case. At that rate, why did I buy this set in the first place? Simply, it looked from reviews as if it might be worth having, and indeed so it is from one point of view at least. I had just made the astonishing discovery that my large collection was almost totally lacking in Ravels orchestral works. I have his complete piano music (much of it in a variety of performances), I have the concertos, I have LEnfant et les Sortileges and I have what must be most of the songs and chamber music, but somehow next to nothing orchestral, not even Bolero.So now I know what I have got and what I should give it by way of a recommendation. I want it for reference. It is all good and I said that already. For all I know this or that performance here may come over time to be my favourite rendition of this or that familiar masterpiece by a composer of whom I am inordinately fond. I dont need to restrict myself to one single account of any of them, given the choice available. However given the number of decades that I lived through without even one in most cases this makes a belated start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5951MWHRX9LZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00001IVNK#wasThisHelpful","R5951MWHRX9LZ","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This looks high quality, it feels high quality, and that is because it is high quality. LEDs and lithium batteries have managed to make small torches interesting, and I like this torch even as a kind of toy, but a toy that does its proper job very well.There are three brightness settings, the lowest being faint and the highest startlingly strong. The bulb is an LED, (hopefully the era of the filament lamp wasting its wattage on heat will soon be over), and it has an estimated operational life of 20 years. The recommended battery usage is a 3.7V 18650 lithium battery if you can find it. As an alternative two 3V CR123A batteries are accepted, and I am using Panasonic CR123 lithium power units. I particularly like the solidity of this torch for the reassuring sense of quality that it gives.There is a handy leaflet that is more intelligible than many such, except perhaps for the paragraph on Output Selection. I get the general idea  you keep on pressing the control button and it takes you through the brightness levels successively. These are early days and I am hitting them a little erratically, but that will be my own clumsiness and practice should sort the matter out. What is really impressive is the low-to-high range of the settings.One point made in the leaflet that is worth taking seriously is the advice to remove the batteries if the unit is likely to be unused for a long time. Lithium batteries are magnificent, but they need careful handling.Overall judgment: if you can still get this torch at its introductory offer price then go for it. If you want a top-quality small hand-held torch then go for it at any reasonable price.

"As Kathleen Ferrier had been the Red Rose of Lancashire, Janet Baker hoped that she herself might be the White Rose of Yorkshire. If that was what this great singer wanted, and if its in any way up to me to grant her wish then let me grant it. What she has given me on this pair of discs is 42 songs by the greatest of all the song-writers. The first 30 date from 1971 and the accompanist is Gerald Moore, the final dozen are from 10 years later and in these the accompaniments are provided by Geoffrey Parsons. As if the singing were not marvellous enough, what makes this set an even greater treasure is that it also preserves so much of the work of the great Gerald Moore, an artist incomparable in his own field.We are not kept waiting for proof of what Moore amounts to, because the very first song is Gretchen am Spinnrade, and I wonder how any listener could not be struck right away by the absolute perfection and rightness of Moores tempo and touch. While we are getting used to this the diva herself enters with an interpretation that is some ultimate in sensitivity, intensity and at the same time dignity. I think I could plod through all these first 30 songs giving each some suitably adapted variant of the same assessment. Everything is here  power when wanted of course, as in Anselms Grave or Aufloesung, but above all tenderness and lyricism. If I had to select my other (after Gretchen) most striking and affecting piece of interpretation, artistry and mastery from these two great musicians it might be The Young Nun. The rumble of the storm is majestic, the young nun is intense to start with, but listen to the sheer control that Baker exerts to express the strange serenity that comes over the music, her quiet  Alleluias awesome while Moore provides the perfect response, and the calm of the ending is sublime.Of the last 12 songs I would place 9 in the category of established favourites. The theme of this collection was apparently that they should be womens songs. Obviously Gretchen and The Young Nun are womens songs, but in general the numbers here are not gender-specific. Everyone has had the good sense not to offer, say, Erlkoenig, which I have heard done by a soprano and hope never to repeat the experience. Otherwse here are The Trout, Auf dem Wasser zu singen, Who is Sylvia, To Music, Der Musensohn, Heidenroeslein, Du bist die Ruh and a couple of others. Janet Baker sails on superbly, and Geoffrey Parsons does really very well even if he is no Gerald Moore. Indeed Parsons surpasses himself with the celestial repose he achieves in Nacht und Traeume, and I like to think Moore himself would have been proud of this.Digital remastering has been applied in 1996, and I have no complaints about the sound. There is a short but sensible liner note by R Kinloch Anderson, but there are no texts. This is a bit of a nuisance I suppose, but the economics of the classical recording industry make this kind of economy unavoidable at times. In fact I found myself thinking back to a remark by Sibelius to the effect that it is not necessary to know what singers are singing about. No doubt this is an exaggeration, but it comes near to being true where this set is concerned. We are in the presence here of the greatest creative musical talent, I firmly believe, that any human being ever had. These 42 songs, enormous in their variety, are about one-fifteenth of the total number Schubert composed in thirty-one years of life. The variety and resourcefulness of the sheer musical invention is prodigious, incredible, out of this world. I know what most of them are about, but give them to me performed like this and I hardly give that a thought, such is this musics power over me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AVRK0D5HV4Z4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002Z83MK#wasThisHelpful","R3AVRK0D5HV4Z4","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The good sisters are the marvellous sisters Labeque, here at their  superlative best in some unfamiliar but interesting music. The not-so-good sisters are the obscure sisters Sutro who doctored the score of Bruchs concerto. It is not clear to me whether the damage has ever been fully undone, so now read on. Perhaps you will understand what I have not understood.Mendelssohns concerto was written when he was 14 or thereabouts. He was a precocious prodigy, so we know better than to assume that this is an immature work. It follows the full-scale Mozart concerto scheme, with a long orchestral introduction  the very scheme that he later truncated in his more familiar concertos. It is thoroughly enjoyable all the way through, but it seems to me to improve as it goes along. The slow movement is lyrical and moving, but the finale is a superb piece of Mendelssohnian sparkle, and the gossamer piano figuration gives Katia and Marielle Labeque the opportunity to wow us with some truly amazing leggiero virtuosity.  Those who already know their work know that they play as one, but for even one to play this kind of piano writing so brilliantly is wonder enough, let alone for two in perfect combination.The Bruch concerto has had a strange history indeed. It does not follow the scheme of any normal concertos. It sounds like a suite with obbligato piano parts, and a suite is what it turns out to have been in origin, but one intended for organ with orchestra. In 1915-16 Bruch gave the score in its new arrangement to the Sutro sisters. According to Christopher Fifields liner note they gave the work its premiere under Stokowski in Philadelphia in 1916, but then covertly started to neuter the score so as to bring it more comfortably within their restricted abilities. So there is the first mystery  if they were able to perform it as written (I can only suppose) why did they need to simplify it? The next mystery is  how did the score manage to disappear for half a century despite having been copyrighted and lodged with the Library of Congress? Most frustrating of all  did Nathan Twining and Martin Berkofsky, who restored the score to the form we have here, have Bruchs authentic version of the piano parts, or did they have to create their own idea of that? If the genuine Bruch material was available, where did it come from after the Sutros had done their worst with it? All we are told is that the orchestral parts were recovered.One way or the other, the Bruch piano parts call for, and are given, a completely different approach on the part of the soloists. The recorded sound in both concertos, particularly of the orchestra, is rather soft-centred, but that suits the Labeque sisters touch very well and the balance is good and natural. The recordings were made in 1990 and issued on the Philips label three years later. Between then and now I dont think I could have named a single composer other than Bach and Mozart who had written a concerto for two pianos. Now I know better, and the enjoyment that this disc gives me is all the greater for that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMZ6I2WBH1GFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E4SV#wasThisHelpful","RMZ6I2WBH1GFT","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Considering how good this set is, and in particular how authentic the performances are, it is attracting surprisingly little attention from reviewers. The recordings were made in Chicago between 1989 and 1990 and the quality is admirable. The disc is almost a single hour-long crescendo, starting on the verge of audibility with the Andante Tranquillo of the Music for Strings Percussion and Celesta, and rising to a final assault on our ears and sensibilities with the Miraculous Mandarin Suite. When the orchestra is the Chicago Symphony it is hardly necessary to draw attention to the quality of their work, but I wonder whether by now music-lovers are forgetting that Solti was Bartoks own pupil. I dont doubt for a moment that many other accounts are as good as some enthusiastic reviews are telling us, but authentic is authentic, and here we have the tradition at its purest.The Divertimento is the piece that is probably less familiar to audiences in general than the other two works are. It was written in 1939 at the behest of Bartoks patron Paul Sacher, and is scored for strings alone. On this disc it is placed effectively between the Music for Strings [etc] and the strenuous Miraculous Mandarin score, serving as a kind of intermezzo or entracte. The MM presented here is the Suite, more frequently encountered in concerts and recordings than the unabridged version. Soltis account pulls no punches, as most of us would expect, and it is easily hellish (the composers own word) enough for my taste. I would give a favourable mention here to the Naxos performance of the entire MM score from Marin Alsop. This does not, I dare say, set any records for cacophonousness, but it is a useful reminder that what we are dealing with is still music and not just sound-effects.There is a polyglot liner note of the familiar European kind. I found it helpful and informative up to a point, but what it rather suggests is a certain type of student essay -- a collection of random points without any real theme to it. For those already familiar with Bartok that will not matter very much. What I have mainly got out of this Bartok concert is a sense of reassurance that what I am listening to is the real thing. The disc may be hard to find, but if you can find it you may be able to get it cheaply (no promises, of course). If the performances duplicate others in your collection then just go ahead and duplicate them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24UM5QZ628H4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000041XP#wasThisHelpful","R24UM5QZ628H4S","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There surely can't be many tragic love stories more affecting and involving than this. Nor, it seems to me, can there be many that are more original, despite the conspicuous play the author makes of depending on ancient sources. The tale of Troilus and Cressida (Criseyde) derives ultimately from the Iliad through a multiplicity of mediaeval variations, cited in detail by the editor. It is original in the way Hamlet is original, in its depiction of characters and thought-processes, and it does not suffer from the comparison. There are four protagonists, and two are straightforward, contrasted with a wince-making clarity. Troilus himself, son of King Priam of Troy, is a mighty warrior but tongue-tied and shy when it comes to dealing with women, derisive to begin with at the agonies of those who fall in love and then falling hopelessly, suddenly and finally into the same trap himself. How often have we all seen just that happen within our own acquaintance? Diomede, sent to escort Cressida from Troy to the Greek camp as part of a prisoner-exchange, is uninhibited in that respect to the point of outright crassness, with an eye for an opportunity and an easy `nothing venture nothing gain' attitude that I would again guess most of us will recognise without much difficulty.The other two are anything but simple. Chaucer stays deliberately vague regarding Cressida's relationship with Diomede (characteristically hiding behind his sources - he was anything but straightforward himself), and what if anything remains of her love of Troilus. However it seems to me that there was a calculating bit in her decision to give herself to Troilus in the first place. She could make herself fall in love, and her fascinating speeches with the twists and turns of their thinking say to me that she was no innocent, quite unlike her infatuated wooer. That leaves Pandarus, a creation to rival Iago in a different way. Again, it's left to us to decide what prompted such extraordinary vicarious commitment to bringing the pair together. There may or may not be hints that his motivation was not altruistic, but hints are the most they can be. It is not just a matter of his strange motivation but also of his extraordinary mental agility and speed of reaction. He plots the lovers' tryst in fantastic detail, when the fateful prisoner-exchange is decreed he tries to steer Troilus into a different outlook that in effect abandons the romance he has taken such incredible trouble to arrange, and to the very end he is still trying to manipulate the emotions of the devastated Troilus.It is all told in an easy and relaxed verse, typical Chaucer in being at the same time deadly serious and tongue-in-cheek. This verse is not as 'poetic' as, say, The Ancient Mariner. It stands in much the relationship to that, poetry-wise, as Hamlet does to Macbeth or Othello. This is a psychological drama, not an opportunity to display the special `tone of voice' and `way of saying things' that Housman thought the essence of poetry. Obviously it is in mediaeval English, and this edition uses the authentic original spellings. This will slow most of us down a bit, but that can actually be a good thing. I found that it not only forced me to read with the close attention this drama needs, it kept me fascinated with the wonderful English language itself, and I had to notice how popular speech and even slang have kept alive ancient meanings of words (guess, deal, gear, right, sweetheart) that have been lost in more formal discourse. Where this edition is particularly helpful is in its footnotes reminding us of the meanings of certain words (and reminding us repeatedly, for which I bless the editor) and translating occasional phrases and lines where we might go wrong. I think I only had to refer some half-dozen times to the glossary at the back throughout a poem that is half as long as Paradise Lost.The editor is no less a person than the Professor of English at Cambridge, so his introduction has the thoroughly thorough and also thoroughly stifling profundity that I associate with university literature courses. There are also notes at the back, very helpful in the main but obsessed with quoting parallels for the sake of quoting parallels. At V/1176 there is the line `Ye, fare wel al the snow of ferne year', and I thought immediately of Villon's `Mais ou sont les neiges d'antan?' On turning to the back I found that the editor just quoted this obvious parallel without further comment on what the connection might be, and for a moment I nearly hurled the book across the room. Again I wondered whether the proem to book III might have influenced Milton's great invocation of light at the start of the same book of Paradise Lost, but no light was shed. In general, though, this is a very helpful edition. When reading the Iliad I found that after I had read the first 23 books the 24th was comparatively simple. You may find here that once you have got through the first four books you are quite fluent with the fifth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HY4C38GUPZ6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N7EU10#wasThisHelpful","R2HY4C38GUPZ6I","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This debut novel seems to be aiming at best-seller status already, and it ought to stand a fair chance of achieving that. The basic ingredients are here  a good strong story-line, Romans and Jews doing battle in Palestine, a very readable style, liberal dollops of sex and gore, and above all a highly provocative alternative scenario for the origin of the Gospel. This kind of swordsnsandals setting is a proven winner with much of the reading public, and if the characters at least give some impression of being true to history that should add to the books attraction. Probably not all that many readers will subject the participants to detailed prosopography because this is a novel not a volume of history.Some readers may however be surprised by how little the narrative takes sides as between Jews and Romans. Indeed in the early chapters the Jews are shown as being riven with bitterly opposed factions. The hero of the saga Jacob is indeed a Jew, but he is a hero mainly in the simple sense of holding the central thread of the action  its mainly a tale of what happens to him and what he tries to do to put that right. However thats not how matters develop either: Romans and Jews alike are shown as gradually yielding to a new vision, the vision of the Logos -- the Word or Message. Its growing power and influence are shown as depending on capturing hearts much more than minds, because it is represented quite unequivocally as being myth  deliberately concocted myth by St Paul and others. For People of Faith, then as now, that kind of detail just seems not to matter.I shall be interested to see whether this provokes outrage or whether the events of the Gospel can be seen as true in some transcendental way even though they did not happen, which is what this story is saying. The Sermon on the Mount is great prophetic teaching indeed, and the tale of the Resurrection of Christ apparently strengthens the Sermons power over human hearts and souls despite being invention in the literal sense. Is there any sense (just within the terms of this story) in which it is not invention, or is totally necessary and justified invention? Come to that, does even sense matter to thinking like this?Back on the airport bookstalls, travellers looking for something to read will find Logos a very pleasant vade mecum. I sense that John Neeleman is writing down to his readers, because here and there, e.g. on the first page of Chapter Eleven, he raises the level of the writing to a different plane of quality. If he is doing so, I can imagine sound business reasons. The blood and thunder takes place mainly in the early episodes, the sex gets more frequent without losing descriptiveness or detail as the story goes on. My own favourite among the sexual descriptions is the passage where someone praises celibacy by listing with some particularity the activities from which it releases us.There is even a final sexual envoi after all the arrangements are made for writing the Gospel that people need to hear, as defined by Paul and others. However that must be just to give the reader a good send-off. The real message of this book has been in the pages just preceding, with their scenario of the Gospel as myth (or perhaps allegory) and Jesus as just a man like other men. Something along these lines is how I myself have thought about these issues for decades, and I wonder how receptive the reading public will be to its being proclaimed in a novel written, very effectively, in a populist idiom. In the beginning was the Logos is the beginning of St John. The world is everything that is the case is the beginning of Wittgensteins Tractatus. Something that did not happen cannot have been the case, surely, and therefore is not part of the world. Is there still some way of believing it?","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HTSI1TB1O9IN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1938846265#wasThisHelpful","R3HTSI1TB1O9IN","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Does anyone know why the saxophone has never established itself firmly in the classical orchestra? It was invented in 1840 and Berlioz spoke appreciatively of it. We all know it well as a jazz instrument, but the clarinet is equally at home in jazz combos while remaining a staple of the symphony orchestra. I find it a strange situation.However all is not lost. What we have on this disc is four concertos (using the term loosely) featuring two different types of instrument. The Villa-Lobos Fantasia is for the soprano sax, the other three are for its alto counterpart, and the soloist in all of them is the magnificent Eugene Rousseau. He can be soulful when required, notably in the Dubois Sarabande, but the style of these pieces is mainly virtuoso and the recital ends with a flourish in the same composers finale. I suppose it would be fair to describe this music as in a sense lightweight, but only in the sense that the expression could be applied to much of Mozart.Speaking of Dubois, I see that this disc, recorded originally in 1972, has not been updated to note his death in 1995. His birth year was 1930, as was that of the conductor Paul Kuentz, and I am happy to say that he is still with us and I wish him many years yet. His players do justice to both the music and the soloist, and as all four concertos are for small orchestras we have the opportunity to admire and enjoy the work of these instrumentalists also. The sound has been digitally remastered, if that even needs saying, and it is admirably clear if not exactly ingratiating in tone.The liner note has nothing about the players, not even about Rousseau, but its message regarding the music and the instrument it is written for is conveyed not just in the usual English German and French but also in Italian and Spanish this time. Looking at the sales ranking of this fine disc I have to conclude that it could do with all the publicity it can get, so perhaps even these few remarks and a strong recommendation will help in some small way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYXRX69NYN4U8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000009MC7#wasThisHelpful","RYXRX69NYN4U8","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andrew Manze writes nearly as well as he plays. The short essay he provides to accompany this disc is knowledgeable, clear and witty. Handel's instrumental music is a scholars' playground - he left, and very likely kept, no proper catalogue of it, and it falls to specialists to clarify as best they can which compositions going under his name are really his. What the artists here give us is 7 complete sonatas and one that is presumably complete, plus two stranded individual movements. Of the 8 'complete' efforts 5, including the presumed-complete G major, seem to be definitely by Handel. Two sets of 12 'violin' sonatas were published by one Walsh, one under his own name and the other under the pseudonym 'Roger'. The works they contain do not exactly match up, and I would have liked the contents of each plus the contents of this disc laid out as a table so as to be completely clear about the issue. The best piece of all, placed first in this recital, seems to belong in neither edition, and the most original and unusual, placed second, is of doubtful attribution.The players' style is all-the-way authentic. Full details of the 18th century instruments, plus a fascinating picture of the violin-maker's workshop, are provided on pages 12-13 of the booklet, and Manze goes into the question of the proper constitution of the continuo or accompaniment. I found that I adapted to the sound of the violin within seconds. There's a fair amount of action-noise from the harpsichord, but authentic is authentic, so I adapted to that too. The playing seems to me beyond criticism, full of verve in the fast movements and soul in the slow, and the recorded sound is of the highest modern standard. The works themselves are beautiful and fascinating. I wonder in particular whether Handel wrote the first movement of the F major sonata, and if not who did. It is not only an exceptional piece but decades ahead of its time, as Manze rightly says.The production is fairly de luxe, containing not only an expensively printed booklet but also a full colour catalogue of Harmonia Mundi's current offerings. The set has won critical acclaim, which I endorse wholeheartedly, and it can be recommended without qualification to all Handelians and indeed to the music-loving public generally.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G6449IW1AVP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006Z2LN8#wasThisHelpful","R2G6449IW1AVP1","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In case the strapline following the title suggests that this book may be about abused children, its actual topic is the effect of domestic violence between adult partners on the children who have had to live through that. After a long string of introductions, forewords and whatnot, the book finally gets going. There are 11 chapters. The first sets out the general theme that is to be illustrated with detailed examples in the next ten, and it can probably be summarised by the statement, headed ONE TRUTH YOU MUST KNOW, As a child of domestic violence you have inner reserves of strength far beyond the ordinary, and the ability to channel all that you have been through and felt into a life of extraordinary fulfillment and success.The remaining ten chapters are case studies, and each ends with a set of conclusions, all to a common format consisting of The Lie, The Why, The Truth and To Try, again subject to a general heading, this one being FROM THE LIE TO THE TRUTH. The terms lie and truth are not of course used in any sense that linguistic epistemologists would recognise, they have something like the frequent Christian sense (as in, say, Catholic Truth Society) in which a lie is what the author wishes to deny, the truth being his own teaching. I could not help but experience a certain feeling of one size fits all about this way of organising the material, but I also appreciate that it makes for clarity. However having once mentioned religion I should probably note at this point that Brian F Martin never calls on it in aid. Humana uoluit quaerere nomen ope as one atheist poet puts it, He has sought to make his reputation by human resource alone. He also does not place much apparent reliance on established academic work, and I have no idea what conclusions, if any, can be drawn from that. What is abundantly clear is that this is a book written from the heart and meant to go to the heart.I am totally persuaded of Brian F Martins general view that domestic violence is a subject much avoided, and that many of the downstream problems that people encounter stem from this very cause. Both author and book deserve the greatest respect for their grim determination to bring the taboo topic out into the light, and then dare to find a method, or maybe even a formula, for undoing the damage that has been done. I am only partially persuaded by Martins ten success stories. What is absolutely clear is that certain children of abusive homes have gone on to achieve great things. Bill Clinton is not one of the detailed subjects of study, nor is Nelson Mandela, but you could hardly expect Martin not to at least refer to them by way of chapter-headings. As for the real-life subjects of study, there has to be at least a possibility (I will state that no more strongly) that Martin is, to some extent at least, finding what he is looking for.Brian Martin has devoted so much of his life to investigating this deeply important but still only partially understood problem that he deserves as much of an act of faith as can be rationally made, at least by an interested party lacking direct or even second-hand experience of the matter. A reader who gets even as far as the contents-page will immediately notice one thing  the lies and their corresponding truths in most cases do not make obvious pairings. Free is not an antonym of guilty, to take the first obvious case, nor is grateful of sad or trusting of alone.  It is well worth the time of anyone looking for answers in these chapters to start by being clear what the question posed is in each case: the chain of reasoning may not be quite what you might otherwise expect. That aside, there is a real sense of heroism about this book. Anyone wishing to follow Martins prescription will probably do well to stick to one course or maybe two at a time. The extent of the effort of will required suggests to me that any more would be out of the question. However thats out of the question for most people: Brian F Martin has managed to put ten whole programmes together.

"Provided this little portable scale stays in good order I can give it a high rating: my only reservation is that I sense it might be rather delicate in use and handling. Other users suggest that this is not my own imagining, so for these reasons I think I had better withhold the fifth star rather than take the chance of giving prospective purchasers unrealistic expectations. However I think I can at least reassure everyone regarding the design and functionality of the scale.It is battery operated (2xAAA) and the batteries come ready-installed at purchase time. Startup is simple, and the little user leaflet is more intelligible than many such. You can choose between no fewer than six different units of weight, and there is a tare-weight function that strips out the weight of any packaging or containers and calculates the weight of the contents. The leaflet tells us how to perform our own calibration if for any reason we feel the need to (and the leaflet makes a cryptic reference to variations in gravity at different points on the Earth, a theory that calls for elucidation.) Far easier is to try the ACC200 in parallel with some similar piece of apparatus. I happen to own a Picco1000 which I sometimes use for weighing letters. This only deals in integer grams, not being a pocket-portable unit and being able to weigh up to a kilogram, but allowing for normal decimal rounding it matches the ACC200 as near as can be seen, so that satisfies me regarding compatibility, whatever variations in gravity may yet be encountered.To test the unit's sensitivity I weighed a small pinch of saffron. Of course I had nothing to compare the ACC200 reading with this time, but all I wanted to know was that it really could detect such a minuscule mass and tell a plausible tale, which it did. Very properly, the leaflet warns us how delicate the unit is, as obviously it must be if it is sensitive to a few strands of saffron. There is a manufacturer's warranty for ten years, but it is emphasised that `misuse' voids the warranty. How they tell misuse from wear and tear they don't say, but being realistic this is a very reasonably-priced product and if we are clumsy in handling it we may get what we deserve.The ACC200 is a handy pocket size and of a smart appearance. The digital readout is clear without our having to peer at it, and as you would expect it switches off after a short period of non-use. The lid can be locked when closed, but the lock feels flimsy to me, and the lid tends to come loose at the left corner. However the upside to that is that we can detach the lid altogether, allowing us to weigh letters or similar items that overflow the weighing-plate. I have seen complaints that the rubber feet can come away. I am having no such problem but I dare say if you lose one of the rubber feet you can just throw away the other three and go on your way rejoicing, for all they really matter.So there is the experience that one small householder has had of the ACC200. I have no 48-carat diamonds to weigh, or however many carats there are, but for any normal domestic purposes this little device will do admirably. I hope I am not being grudging when I limit the stars at four, but they asked for an honest review, and honesty compels me to say that I would need a longer period of use before I could be sure just how robust the ACC200 is and will be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SBZ6D8GACLYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MHSYYM8#wasThisHelpful","R1SBZ6D8GACLYY","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The four works on this disc occupy two almost exact halves of the 76 minutes total playing time, and any review needs to consider the two halves separately. The first half consists of Schumanns opus 1 the Abegg variations plus the Humoreske opus 20, and this half is absolutely splendid. In the second half we find the great C major Fantasie opus 17 together with a rarity in the form of a 7-and-a-half minute piece called Blumenstueck. This time things do not go quite so well: the Blumenstueck is fine, nearly as good as the first two items, but the wonderful Fantasie is a bit of a let-down. Before I give more detail in support of these opinions let me first say that I have no hesitation in recommending the disc, Fantasie and all. My reason for this is simply that there is abundant choice available among versions of the Fantasie, for instance those by Pollini and Richter that my own collection owns, whereas the other three numbers are comparative rarities. Even where you can find them at all I think you will have a job finding versions as well played as here.I dont think I can ever recall a record making such a favourable impression with just its first few notes as this record does. The sound (DDD 1980 in Paris) is absolutely perfect for Schumann, and so is the players touch. Both are warm and sympathetic, and these characteristics are retained throughout the 15 separate movements that the two suites contain. Dalberto can raise his voice when that is called for, of course, but the dominant impression is of a beautifully modulated tone, brilliant at times as in the earlier Abegg variations, but always responsive to Schumanns special Innigkeit. I would also draw attention (if it needs any drawing) to the self-repeating upward phrases in the second number of the Humoreske  simply my idea of absolute musical delight.The Fantasie and the Blumenstueck were recorded in Switzerland when Dalberto was six years older. I have no way of knowing whether this fact had anything to do with the loss of Schumannesque poetry that I cant help detecting here, but one factor that certainly does not help is the quality of the sound  things dont go wrong in ones, apparently. The murmuring left-hand figuration at the start of the Fantasie is not meant to be overly distinct, I quite appreciate, but here it manages to sound a little bit muddy and even slightly lumpy, with the melody picked out in an artificial-sounding tone. Dalbertos general idea of the first movement is fine, but I hear nothing in it that puts this rendering in the class of Pollini and Richter. The start of the second movement is interesting in the quirky way that Dalberto handles the march rhythm, and in fact I like this way of doing it better than Richters perversely subdued tone here  (I mean theres mezzo-forte as the composer specifies and theres whatever this is)  but Pollinis straightforward approach is surely far better. From there on not only do these two giants eclipse the stodgy Dalberto but so do many other players.The last movement probably comes off best of the three sections, but the recording is still a bit cloudy although let me at least compliment Dalberto on his beautiful dreamy close. Whatever did not quite come off in this performance and recording of the Fantasie, at least the recital ends on a high note (in every sense) with a fine account of the Blumenstueck. There is a short and trilingual but quite interesting liner note by Raymond McGill in which the Fantasie is called one of the great piano works in the entire literature for the instrument. Indeed; and I might go even further and call it Schumanns very greatest composition in any medium. In case it still seems odd that I should recommend a disc enthusiastically while remaining disappointed with the way the greatest thing it contains is done, let me just say again -- you can find any number of fine recordings of that. Its the other three items that are not scattered around among piano issues like leaves in Vallombrosa. Even if I had somehow known in advance about my reservations concerning the Fantasie I would still have been eager to buy this disc. If there is, say, an MP3 download available of the very first bars of the very first number I think that when you hear it you may quickly realise why.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZZW0KQ1X88L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00021SUH2#wasThisHelpful","RZZW0KQ1X88L","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is best read as a feasibility study, the project studied being one particular form of climate engineering, namely designing and implementing a global `thermostat' with the aim of combating and controlling the greenhouse effect. The author does not restrict himself to this narrow technical remit but devotes the later part of the short (140 page) book to what he calls `reframing' the problem. This consists, to put the matter bluntly, of talking around the issue after the more direct approach has proved rather intractable. A great many laudable sentiments and objectives are expressed with regard to what we ought to do by way of adapting our lifestyles thought-processes and culture to climate change, insofar as that looks likely to be with us for the foreseeable future. However the uncomfortable thought remains that if the polar ice keeps melting and the oceans continue to acidify and their levels keep rising, then we need to DO something more drastic than just find ways of feeling more comfortable about it all.I would be surprised if the author agrees with this view considering he is a Professor of Climate and Culture. What I am suggesting is, I don't deny, that the `cultural' side of the book dilutes the impact of the more technical arguments. The `reframing' material is important in its own right and indeed it is relevant to the main thread, but one thing at a time would have been better. And the reason for that, I fear, is that the strictly `feasibility' arguments are so well argued and so compelling but at the same time so negative in their conclusions that we are left with the sense of an urgent need for some course of action that confronts the problem more actively than a bit of reframing, however worthy and necessary, is likely to do.Mike Hulme starts by identifying eight possible approaches to the climate change problem. Interestingly, it seems that the warming effect is felt (at least so far) very little in the air and much more in the seas. Of the eight, four consist of removing the CO2 from the air, the best known example of which being presumably carbon capture at the point of the release of the CO2 in industrial smokestacks. I wonder why Hulme does not pursue this last option, because it has the fewest negatives of the eight. However, he doesn't, whatever his reasons. He focuses instead entirely on what appears to be the `front-runner' among the four sunlight reflection methods; and that is stratospheric aerosol injection, aka the dreaded global thermostat. Hulme's arguments are simple, they are commonsense, and they are deadly. There is no way of predicting the outcome of any such experiments. Just recall if you will Mr Rumsfeld's famous classification in another context of `known unknowns and unknown unknowns'. One particular nightmare that Hulme postulates is an infinite regress in which unexpected side effects from the experiment are `compensated' with would-be palliatives that in their turn need palliation. But it is all nightmare. There would be no possibility of gaining global agreement on the details of how to set the proper levels of aerosol injection. There would be no way of policing compliance or of preventing certain nations doing their own thing for what they consider their own best interest. Obviously, atmospheric release of aerosol particles is no respecter of national boundaries, so there would be a babel of accusations and counter-accusations over the causes of certain effects. And another nice little touch is - if it was decided to `turn off' the aerosol releases, what would then happen with the pent-up CO2 that had meantime been belching out regardless at ground level?That all spells `unfeasible' to me as well as to Professor Hulme. I called his arguments technical above, but that was only to distinguish them from the cultural pleading that I would have liked to see dealt with elsewhere. The main arguments, as you can see, are not very technical at all, they are plain clear reasoning. That doesn't make them more palatable, quite the reverse I expect. I do not for a moment deny that technological progress may help, but the boffins will need to come up with better suggestions than this, and time is not on their, or our, side.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11TZHHVOYCO3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745682065#wasThisHelpful","R11TZHHVOYCO3I","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bathroom scales aint what they used to be. Just as I was on the point of replacing my rusted-up old set, here is a first-class new product that puts some new (but by now familiar) technology at our disposal. I see that the Smart Weigh Body Scale has been getting enthusiastic notices in America, so let me endorse those now that the scales are also available in Europe.Besides weighing you, this scale can report back to you on a number of key body/health measurements, specifically. body mass index (BMI). body fat. body water. muscle mass. bone massIf you dont want all that data you dont have to have it. You can stick with being told your weight if you want, but there is nothing difficult about setting the unit to do the rest as well. Up to 8 different people can identify themselves to the system by picking a profile number from P1 to P8. The unit will then ask you to supply your age, sex, height and (approximate) degree of athleticism, and will categorise you accordingly. E.g. your weight reading will be given a rating as underweight, healthy weight, overweight and obese. Setting the unit to perform these functions is a process similar to setting the time on a digital watch.There is a very clear little booklet supplied with the scale. Make a point of reading it and following its advice in some important respects. First, be aware that the additional functions are not to be used by anyone fitted with a heart monitor or other surgical implant because it sends a mild electrical current through the body, transmitted through ones bare feet via the stainless steel plates. I have no sense of this electricity, and probably few users will feel anything. However there are also some sensible words of caution regarding use or avoidance by persons with certain medical conditions or, say, young children or pregnant women. In some cases it may not be possible to guarantee accuracy, so naturally it is advised to consult a physician if anyone is doubtful whether or not to use the device. Another piece of advice that I was at first inclined to ignore was the instruction not to use the unit on a carpeted floor. I can tell you that the extent of the inaccuracy that causes is startling. It gave my weight as 10 stone  if only! In passing I should have said that you have the choice of kilograms, lbs, or stones/lbs as your scale in weighing.Lithium batteries come supplied with the unit, and the cardboard carrying box is worth retaining. This is also a very nice-looking little device. It looks quality and other reports that I have seen confirm my own early impression that it is quality. There is a two-year manufacturers warranty, but subject to correction later I doubt that I shall have to invoke this. I hope not, because I rather like my new toy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZCQ93N1DTHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8FXDIQ#wasThisHelpful","RZCQ93N1DTHE","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To describe some music as interesting does not have to be damning it with faint praise, provided that there are some more positive things to say as well. However if when all is said and done `interesting' is the word that sums the music up then it signals something lacking. And that, I'm afraid, is how I have to report on Berwald's string quartets - I find them interesting but they don't excite me.The young artists of the Yggdrasil Quartet are specialists in `Nordic' music, the liner tells us. At that rate we can expect authenticity of expression in the playing, and I find nothing wanting in that matter. Berwald was born in Stockholm one year before Schubert and outlived him by another forty. What training he ever received in composition seems to be uncertain, but his melodic and harmonic idiom is thoroughly characteristic of that period. So far as those matters go this music sounds thoroughly German, so perhaps there is no distinctive Nordic accent to be applied after all. What it does stand in need of is something to give it more superficial appeal, some touch of lustre, some sense of radiance. So whose job was it to supply that sort of beautification - was it for the players or for the recording technicians? If the latter, it is like applying cosmetics to a slightly plain and average complexion I suppose, but we should not expect the players to rectify the composer's limitations. Their responsibility is to represent his inspiration faithfully for what it is worth, and that they do. As for the recording, it lacks for nothing so far as clarity and good balance are concerned. It's just a pity that these highly professional technicians did not interpret their role in making a presentation version of Berwald's quartet writing a little more imaginatively than they have done.So far as distinctive features go, one that strikes me strongly but which the liner does not mention is the strangely inconclusive manner that Berwald adopts when bringing a movement to a close. You can hear this in the first second and final movements of the first quartet and also (very markedly) at the end of the first movement (or section, this being a work where the movements are played without intervening pauses) of the second. What the liner does remark on is the structure of the third quartet. This is in six sections played as a continuous fantasia like the seven sections of Beethoven's great quartet in c# minor. Berwald's first element is vaguely suggestive of a recitative, and the other five are quaintly arranged like a sort of Russian doll, with a central scherzo between two adagios and an allegro di molto bracketing the two adagios.The liner writer Julius Wender has a dutiful-sounding remark about Berwald's `sure sense of form'. Well, either I am missing something or he is missing something in the first movement of the first quartet, which he calls `technically perfect'. I simply cannot deconstruct this as any kind of sonata form, and that is something you could never say about a first movement by Schubert (pace Tovey's pedantries) or Mendelssohn. To me it sounds completely shapeless, even if one embraces the alternative possibility that it was never meant for sonata form in the first place.Having got reasonably familiar with these quartets I have to report that this was harder work than I usually find music of this period and this style. All very interesting I suppose, but I still wish that the recorded sound had done more to enliven whatever interest it all held for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BX2L7BTAIOOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000264CB#wasThisHelpful","R3BX2L7BTAIOOT","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is this `sum', I wonder, an English noun meaning `total', or is it a Latin verb meaning `I am' or `I exist', or are we not supposed to know which it is, if either? This collection of small vignettes is certainly very clever and accomplished as well as being nicely written, but I would have difficulty in characterising it as imaginative. The flip side to the fluent obverse of this coin is that it is all just slightly, or more than slightly, facile. Here are forty little items taking up two or three pages each of nice clear print in this edition (the editors specifically draw attention to it), and I sense that given a little more time this author could have stretched that total (or sum) to four hundred or forty thousand without subjecting himself to any degree of strain. It just seems to come to him naturally, the way fruit comes naturally to the tree that produces it. Musically minded readers may be reminded of that very image as applied to himself by the composer Saint-Saens. He could turn out his polished and agreeable works without effort and seemingly without any detectable limit or restriction; but accomplished, stylish, clever and appealing as they were, what they also were was superficial.The strap-line `tales from the afterlife' is a reasonably accurate summary of the contents so long as you don't press it too exactly. Afterlives are usually a condition reached by human beings (Mr Eagleman please note - `humans' is a solecism), but animals share it in one of the little stories here, which is certainly fine by me. Most of the narratives relate to humanity as advertised on the cover, but several raise their eyes towards the fate of the various deities themselves. `Graveyards of the Gods' is a kind of miniature Goetterdaemmerung, as an obvious example; `Apostasy' finds space for pity reaching out to the solitary Creator in Her loneliness; and `Blueprints' actually startled me by reverting to the clich that not all the analysis performed by the Rewarders and Punishers can identify the essential taste of wine or the sense of being in love, these being human experiences that they fail to share.Otherwise it is mainly clever little propositions of a half-surreal kind. It is many years now since I read any of the more surrealist kinds of science fiction or science fantasy, but although I could not pinpoint any exact resemblances between those and Mr Eagleman's scenarios, I sensed a certain familiarity in the kind of thinking I was encountering. `Scenarios' almost overstates the case, I'm inclined to think. Mr Eagleman has encroached on the space properly occupied by serious evaluation of what might constitute some afterlife and filled it, or at least filled a corner of it, with intellectual doodling. These days we don't seem to hear or read much about, or by, Olaf Stapledon, and that is our great loss. If you don't know him already, let me suggest Odd John or the terrifying Star Maker for ideas of what certain alternative outlooks might be for us. If Mr Eagleman ever feels up to making a bit more effort I shall certainly read what he offers us with interest. Until then I thank him for an interesting but hardly absorbing couple of hours' reading.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F74TW8NSQC8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOHGS9U#wasThisHelpful","R2F74TW8NSQC8H","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was Tchaikovsky who described the powerful atmosphere surrounding the Russian Orthodox rite, saying `There is nothing like entering an ancient church on a Saturday, standing in the semi-darkness with the scent of incense wafting through the air, lost in deep contemplation searching for an answer to those perennial questions, wherefore, when, whither and why?' Tchaikovsky said it, but the composer who most recreated the feel of it all in music was Rachmaninov. Rachmaninov lived in voluntary but irreversible exile from his native land and culture, and we can hear deep nostalgia in his Vespers and Liturgy of St John Chrysostom. Without in any way detracting from his sincerity we can also hear a conscious effort to sound Russian to the ears of western listeners who doubtless had stereotyped ideas of what that sounded like. Tchaikovsky after all lived (basically) in Russia and composed as a Russian for Russians without any need to force the idiom. His beautiful setting of the St John Chrysostom Liturgy was also intended, I'm in no doubt, for performance in church. I am almost as certain that Rachmaninov would have thought his own masterpieces appropriate for that, but it's fair to say that he was also pushing the boundaries a bit between the altar and the concert-platform.The Liturgy is the Orthodox counterpart of the Catholic Mass, and the St John Chrysostom version is the `basic' version. Orthodox ritual is entirely sung, but instruments are not allowed, and the same goes for the Vespers. In the Roman rite Vespers have had far less attention from composers than Masses have, and for a good many of us our knowledge of musical settings of the Vespers begins and ends with Monteverdi's masterpiece. What a pleasure it is to have a modern setting that also represents a different religious tradition, one especially pleasing inclusion being a 20th-century Magnificat to place beside not only Monteverdi's but also Bach's. What neither of those masters set (so far as I know) was the Te Deum, but that text found Handel, Berlioz, Verdi and Bruckner at their best and Rachmaninov's Great Doxology (item 12) incorporates its text, although a full-scale setting would have been impossible in a context that is already long.The recordings date from 1994 and 1995, and it is hard to compliment them enthusiastically enough. The stakes were high for the technical personnel, because the performances are likewise beyond praise, so that anything less than excellence in the sound would have seemed like failure.  In describing these accounts I prefer to consider performance and recorded sound as one single experience and not two. The music is not all slow by any means, but it is likely to be the slow music that creates the strongest impression. Slow usually means quiet as well, and there are many long-drawn-out cadences, some but not all Amin's, that are downright miraculous for beauty, control and depth of feeling. Where volume and forcefulness are required the artists are effortlessly up to that too, and you will find such a full-blooded effect delivered impressively at, say, item number 7 in the Vespers. However I can think of no respect in which I want to criticise the way things are done. Soprano pitch never goes very high, I suppose, but for what it may be worth I found the tone always agreeable without a hint of edge or steeliness. Balance among the voices always seems perfect, the soloists are agreeable to listen to, but above all I have been given one thing I particularly yearned for, namely a fine black-velvet basso-profundo `Volga-boatman' bass timbre.  It all takes place in a superbly calculated acoustic too, resonant in a suitably ecclesiastical way without compromising distinctness in the words or introducing unwanted echoes.The artists here are Russian (or at least Russian-based) of course, and I can't imagine that did any harm. However I do not propose to stray into ethnic assessments beyond saying that to me they sound born to perform this music, my own ideas of the matter being no doubt the kind of western stereotypes that I referred to above. There is a brief liner note attributed only to Decca, and for once I would have liked rather more of it because it is tantalisingly suggestive of having genuine thought put into it. I have never visited Russia and I have no experience of Orthodox rites, but after all these years I like to think I must be able to recognise good music well performed when I hear it, and that is what I think I am hearing, to a quite exceptional degree, in this set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REVBOGE1LLNON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000ARNF9#wasThisHelpful","REVBOGE1LLNON","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Tchaikovsky produced his Liturgy of St John Chrysostom in 1878, despite a legal challenge from the Imperial Chapel whose permission he and his publisher had neglected to obtain, the Tsar remarked to him that he was surprised Tchaikovsky had not done more church music. Tchaikovsky no doubt knew which hints were worth taking, and he turned out a number of other items in 1884-5 and 1887, 10 of which are on this disc.The 'Liturgy' equates more or less to the Catholic Mass. Like the Mass it comes in a 'standard' version and a number of others for special occasions, the St John Chrysostom version being the standard one. The 10 choral numbers from it are given here, with the solos for the celebrant and deacon, and the litanies sung antiphonally by celebrant and choir, being omitted. Preceding these on the record you will find the other 10 items mentioned above, mostly isolated items from the Chrysostom Liturgy in fresh settings. These are slightly more elaborate and more solemn in tone than the main setting, with a little more polyphony and a little more word-repetition, but in general Tchaikovsky's a capella music is easy to grasp and much less severe in style than the unaccompanied motets of Bach and Brahms. There are no fugues or anything of that kind, and the longer sequences such as the Creed and the Lord's Prayer are despatched very briskly indeed. The Orthodox Liturgy is a lengthy affair, and I dare say that even the most devout congregation would have thanked the composer for restraining his muse to some extent.I would very much have liked to give this disc 5 stars, but I find I can't quite make myself do it. The articulation is very clear, and some of the singing is very good indeed, particularly sustained bass notes although even here I found myself yearning slightly for some 'real' Russian bass timbre. The recording may be part of the problem, and it could be that the intention was to provide a churchy acoustic, but the overall result is a certain dullness in the tone. I found it helped to boost the volume a little, but what I couldn't edit out was some very indifferent soprano sound on the higher notes, which are not even all that high. I refer to the choral sound. In the item with three soprano soloists these perform reasonably well, although I could not say I thought their voices were wonderful.The liner note provides a very good little introduction to the music, and the Russian is very sensibly given in Roman script with English translation. Nothing at all is said about the performers, the introduction is also translated into French and German but the texts are not, at least in the version of the note issued in England and, I can only suppose, in America","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18335MAC1JD40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096N6BCI#wasThisHelpful","R18335MAC1JD40","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I say that I recommend this set cordially, you will of course understand that I am not exhorting anyone to pay any old price for it. Keeping that aspect of the deal within reason, it is still an issue that would grace any musical collection. Robert Kings way of handling ancient music is one that I like greatly. It has some body and warmth to it, he does not try to set speed records, he does not restrict himself to one voice per part, but at the same time he uses proper period instruments and is careful about allowing vibrato into the solo vocal lines.So far as I know, the performing version that King uses here is faithful to Monteverdis own original arrangement from 1610, except that of course the composer would not have given both settings of the Magnificat during one and the same performance of the Vespers. King provides another of his agreeably-written notes on his own idea of such a performing version, and it is almost a pity that he didnt write the main part of the liner essay, as he often does, (meaning no disrespect to the sound and informative contribution of John Whenham). I know his liner notes mainly from his work on Handel, and I suppose that the subjects treated by that master provide more human interest, but Robert Kings humane and winning approach extends not only to music more than a century older than Handel but also to academic commentary on it.Each of the numbers is provided with a synopsis by John Whenham, although as you would expect the text of the Mass calls for less explanation than the various numbers constituting the Vespers do. This Missa in Illo Tempore is in fact a cappella, i.e. in a contrapuntal style like Palestrinas, the voices unaccompanied although the bass is supported discreetly by the organ. Monteverdis idiom is probably rather more grandiose than Palestrinas, and King and his chorus do a splendid job of maintaining and building a magnificent tone without fatiguing the listener. Elsewhere the idiom is more varied, calling for no fewer than nine vocal soloists together with special choral effects of echo and distance. I am entirely pleased with the way it is all handled, and that is of course a compliment to the technical personnel as well as to the artists. After several listenings I have yet to spot any lapses by either singers or instrumentalists, so I can now take off my fault-finding Beckmesser garb and refocus on not only enjoyment but also study and instruction.The liner material is given in French and German as well as English in the usual EU manner, the Latin texts being accompanied by English translations only. I compliment the production on the accuracy of the Latin, where there is all of one superfluous comma (after tuos in the Dixit Dominus.) In the texts there are a handful of minor quirks, which I shall list here. They have no effect on understanding the relationship of the music to the words, but we might as well get them right:. Dixit Dominus: ex utero...te. The meaning is simpler than the translation gives. Take it as I have begotten you out of the womb before the dawn.. Dixit Dominus: confregit. This is past tense smote. If the translator thought that this verb should be in the future tense like the three verbs following that could well be right, but in that case change the Latin to confringet.. Laudate pueri: humilia respicit means looks on the things that are lowly.. Laetatus sum: The line beginning cuius does not make sense. If the text can be trusted as far as eius the intended sense seems to be along the lines of whoso has a share in Jerusalem also partakes of <?>. However the corruption may go deeper, and any translation is guesswork.. Laetatus sum: The line beginning testimonium would be better translated as the testimony of Israel bearing witness to the name of the Lord.. Laetatus sum: loquebar pacem de te means I spoke peace regarding you.. Nisi Dominus: substitute a comma for the colon after filii/sons. They are the first noun of a little series of three nouns.One great bonus is the provision of both Monteverdis settings of the Magnificat, the second being the simpler 6-part effort, which Whenham suggests (quite plausibly) may have been the basis for the more elaborate 7-parter. Altogether there is little or nothing to find fault with in this production, and I didnt pay a lot for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R124ANMN8J8QRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F5FPCI#wasThisHelpful","R124ANMN8J8QRQ","AAE2DUEMTR30I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAE2DUEMTR30I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For no one is a secret Ernest Ansermet occupies an enviable place among the greatest conductors of an era that probably will never see. His persuasive intelligence for shaping and sculpting every work he performed reveal the arduous process of study and revision of the score.This album captures even the most distrusted listener. You may argue his Prokoviev lacks of the sinister attacks one should expect after listening the lecture of Antal Dorati or Sergei Koussevitzky, for instance. But he manages to show us details of orchestration and intimate voices hidden beneath the score.That's why I buy his smart approach of the Classical Symphony. Recorded twice one can perceive the eleven years between the mono and the stereo versions, the first one is notable even if lacks some of the brilliant opulence of the second one reading.I'm less swayed with Proko's Fifth. The First movement sounded me extremely fast, losing his energetic punch, vital element for this Symphony. Nevertheless, the superb phrasing and committed spirit in which is involved deserves my whole respect.Proko's Sixth is probably much more propulsive and demolishing, it matches with the other two versions I remind: Ormandy Philadelphia and more recently the always well esteemed reading of Walter Weller with the L.S.O.In sum, this double pack is a real musical document to have, for the ages to come. No doubt and purchase it without hesitation.PD.

"During the very beginnigs of the cinema, Hollywood has always paid tribute and even has felt a visible fascination respect to the figure of anti-hero, outsider or renegade of the system. Let's take a ride about it:Ray Milland in ""Lost Weekend"", Marlon Brando ""On the waterfront"", Paul Newman in ""Cool hand Luke"" and Jon Voight ""Midnight cowboy"" (the only two of all them who were not awarded, ironically in one of the hardest decades of the century: the sixties), Al Pacino ""Serpico"", (Just nominated), Jack Nicholson in ""Someone flew over"", Peter Finch ""Network"", F. Murray Abraham ""Amadeus"",  Nicolas Cage ""Leaving las Vegas"", Jeff Bridges ""Crazy heart"" and now Michael Keaton ""Birdman"".But there's still more. I found clever reminiscences with ""All about Eve"", ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""Who's afraid of Virginia Wolf"", in which the backstage is used as cathartic device to explore the dark side of the moon.On the other hand, there's a blink respect Keaton himself ""Birdman"" is a cynical reference respect ""Batman""; as well as the reiterative image of ""The phantom of the opera"" (despite I think Keaton is a superb actor who like Woody Harrelson and William Hurt have been underrated by the industry for reasons absolutely unexplainable to me) .In terms of sinister metaphores, there's a lot of them, the critic respect to action films and special effects without nothing more to say, the acidic reviewers of the recent past (Pauline Kael maybe?).Riggan is a dismissed actor who just has much more past than future, he is well aware about it and the way he has to deal with his inner demons works out as need to escape, forget his limit, participate better in this world. After all, to escape to find again.  Need to be more self in order to escape into self.How could we ignore the subtle handle of the music as crucial key to understand even better his undermined spirit?. Mahler's Ninth symbolizes the process of disolving oneself in the universe' wholeness, without forgetting Rach's Second Symphony op. 27 that reflects the bitter taste of exile from the extinct U.R.S.S. and Tchaikovsky's nostalgic second movement of his Fifth Symphony.And finally, there's a subtle homage to ""Fight club"" using Edward Norton as the alter ego of Keaton and starring the role of Brad Pitt respect himself.All this intense portrait told under the sign of black comedy, is a splendid device to tell the truth without the bitter taste included in the package.Watch a film whose main virtue is to say in loud voice many, many unsaid aspects of the real world backstage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFROERT4IRSLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RO49JEI#wasThisHelpful","RFROERT4IRSLP","A16CZRQL23NOIW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16CZRQL23NOIW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nicolas Winding Refn has found his place in the reduced elite of creative filmmakers in this kaleidoscopic legion of directors.He has a style that blends some of Kaurismaki's narrative lexicon, some of  Lars Von Triers' visuals,  Kubrick's travellings, and claustrophobic ambiances that made me remind Peter Brook's Marat Sade spiced with surrealistic sequences of Alexander Jodorowski and Peter Greenaway, caustic humor of Terry Gilliam and memorable close ups via Ken Russell.)Tom Hardy displays a terrific performance (with a tongue in the cheek to Alexander from The clockwise orange)in this singular and minimalist film.The musical language is another invisible actor: Bruckner and Wagner, which meant a smart device in order to avoid any reference with Beethoven's Ninth from the Clockwise.My personal advise: Watch first the Pusher's Trilogy, Drive, in order to get acquainted with Refn and then go for this one.Not for all tastes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11WV8EU2T2OPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002XTXFU8#wasThisHelpful","R11WV8EU2T2OPN","A16CZRQL23NOIW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16CZRQL23NOIW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Faith Arkin develops an absorbing film, building a dramatic chain of events that link six lives.The movie centers around two cities Bremen and Istanbul, the crude portrait of Turkish inmigration ( Fassbinder had paid tribute in his memorable film Ali: Fear eats the soul)and the way each one of these human beings play hard for what they consider their goal in this puzzled multi-cultural universe of ideologies and ways of living.Hanna Shygulla - the most relevant iconic actress of Fassbinder (in a small role) ignites the screen an captivates the audience through the second half of the film.The agile script, well handled direction and fabulous cast make of this story a motive of serious reflection about what is right and what is wrong in this unsuspected web of facts.I won't tell what's going on with the story.

"Antal Dorati always knew to keep a vibrant recording around practiaccly all the repertoire as long my memory may remember.In this sense, Dorati captures the energy,sensuality and drive the Gayne requests. The LSO as always giving the best of his well known performance high level.Skrowaczewski at the front of the MSO gives a well thought, impressive and amazingly expressive reading of Shos's Fifth.If you like the race-horse performance of Bernstein New York Philharmonic from 1958, definitively this version is far from being from your taste.But if you regard this work as an introspective living, where the solemnity hides the perversion, in which the Scherzo is depicted as a true dance with the devil,where the opressive Stalin's iron fist hovers the Third Movement (to my mind the gravity center of the Symphony). Finally the last movement doesn't begin as a triumphant March (a vision I don't share), but a devilish masquerade where the final won't leave you smiling, this recording is for you. Skrowac accents the percussion (generating a fabulous ritard in the last bars of the Symphony) making the finale extremely authoritative.(In fact, it's one my three best choices of Shostakovich's Fifth) If you recall Reiner's performance of  D.SH' s Sixth at the front of the Pittsburgh, the treaTment is similar.In these times, most of conductors are not well aware about the meaning of this somber feature of the work and many of them remark the crescendos as it were fireworks. I think it's not a wise choice, because the spirit in which the Op. was composed is completely divorved the audience perceives.An album that must be part of your collection.

"Anatoly Vedernikov is part of the poker of aces of distinguished Soviet pianists ( the others would be to my view, Sviatoslav Richter, Tatiana Nikolayeva and Vladimir Sofronitzky.)In this opportunity Vedernikov gives us a stunning reading of the Four Temperaments; his remarkable style makes of this recording an absolute revelation.On the other hand, his performance of Hindemith's Sonata 1 is absolutely amazing and remains (with Glenn Gould and Paul Badura Skoda)as one of the most brilliant versions I remind.Finally, Vedernikov and Natalie Gutman play an irresistible and -one of its kind-version of the Cello Sonata.I wouldn't hesitate to qualify as one of the most extraordinary releases of this prestigious label.Don't miss it...","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KIQWM3UJIYCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XYUEAO#wasThisHelpful","R3KIQWM3UJIYCM","A16CZRQL23NOIW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16CZRQL23NOIW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert Schumann personified (without leaving aside Chopin) the Romantic mood of the first half on the 19th century. He wrought unique pieces of the piano literature with a sense of feathery poetry and nocturnal lyricism.This album presents Stanislav Bunin in one of his big achievements. Childhood scenes, Aus Wien Op. 26 and Arabeske Op.18.S.B. gives the accurate balance between introspection and sublime mystery, creating the necessary atmosphere of backward nostalgia that invites us to be part of this ambiance.Peerless choice.

"I had the chance to download (a week ago) this curious performance and I remained speechless after listening it. Ormandy's elan for Bruckner is plenty of that enraptured cosmical vision Bruckner demands. The Philadelphians as always, playing with amazing results. Subtle phrasing and superb crescendos, expressive musicality and fierceness in the most expresive moments.I still wonder why this recording dated from 1969 has not been exhumated from the vaults to make the next step: digital format.I really hope in the next two years someone proceeds to make this dream come true.

"During the eighties there was a very succesful meeting between Uto Ughi and Wolfgang Sawalisch. Both recorded memorable versions of distin guished violin concertos, but in particular, this Schumann violin Concerto might be the cherry on the cake.Let's go by parts. Perhaps, most of you agree with the fact the supreme version of this Op 120 belongs to Szeryng Dorati. It's dynamic, powerful and incisive.But the team Ugi-Sawallisch addresses it a very fluid musicianship, loaded of vigorous commitment and deep introspection. the Bavarian Orchestra is as always convincing and shining all the way through. Musicality and overwhelming display of Romantic mood without being schmaltz.Uto Ughi is an admirable soloist. His artistic integrity and majestic intonation have become him a radiant musician.Go for this one.PD In case you get Schumann's Violin Sonatas 1 and 2 by Ughi- Sawallisch, don't think it over and purchase it. It's the best the money can buy.

"Really a COMPLETE kit with the lithium-ion battery powered clipper (with integral hair vacuum/collection bin), 11 various length guide combs, scissors, blade oil, charger, travel pouch, cleaning brush, and hair clip.  I cut my own hair, so I'll have to supply my own mirrors.  If I may add a little as to my hair-cutting do-it-yourself credentials:  I learned in the submarine service by necessity.  Since then, I've dabbled with a few barber/salon haircuts, but mostly I've been cutting my own hair for decades.  Not for money reasons, but because I can get exactly what I want and if I don't there is no one else to blame or resent.  Over time I've became very good.  Really very good.  So I've used many home clippers over the years.  Some features of this set:The lithium-ion battery is a plus for reduction in size/weight, and battery life.  You should get at least an hour of hair cutting time per charge.  An LED indicates charge status during charging.I thought the vacuum feature might be a little gimmicky, but in fact it works pretty well.  The exception is when long hair is being cut (on top for instance), and will fall away or must be cleared away.  Ditto for scissor work, of course.  So maybe the vacuum might be a needless distraction for major hair restyling involving big length reduction - but it will probably be appreciated for regular touch-up haircuts and trimming. The vacuum adds some weight, so this clipper is heavier than other home units I've used, but not objectionably so.  And one can certainly hear the vacuum feature, but again, it's tolerable and a reasonable trade-off.Titanium-coated blades to extend blade life.  Very sharp out of the box.  Easy to pop off for cleaning.We'll have to see how long it holds up, but for now this seems like a nice complete set for any level of home use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJHG5NAG6PTWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014SG616I#wasThisHelpful","RJHG5NAG6PTWJ","AW7BIYHXUIZ62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW7BIYHXUIZ62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Part of the territory that comes with being over 60 . . . occasional indigestion and GI/colon health concerns.  I prefer homeopathic and dietary supplement options to medical or invasive options and my reading research indicated that taking a probiotic supplement was an excellent choice for me. I had been procrastinating making a purchase choice, but when this Viva Labs Advanced Bioactive Probiotics product became available (via a promotional product evaluation program), this was a no brainer choice.To be honest, supplements such as this  probiotics are not medicine and results are not immediate.  I'm only a few days into this, but my reading suggests that there is absolutely benefit to be had here (GI tract health) and Viva Labs is a trusted name that I have long experience with.  The Viva proprietary blend contains 25 billion CFU per dose (1 capsule).  The blend contains 6 friendly bacteria strains targeted to colonize the GI tract.  Also contains Viva ""BioXtend"" technology to help protect the product in the stomach and ensure that more is delivered safely to the lower GI tract.  I look forward to great positive results here and have no reason to expect otherwise (but will edit my review accordingly as appropriate over time).A dose consists of one or two capsules (they are small) daily, with or without a meal.  I should mention - I take a wide array of supplements (to which I credit to my excellent health for a senior), however, I don't always take every supplement every day.  But that is not my routine with the probiotic.  The bacteria colonization is progressive and cumulative and should be supported by regular daily supplement intake.  My Viva Probiotics bottle resides on my computer desk to make sure I never miss  a day.  As I said, I'm looking forward to positive observable results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKXIQAJBOITFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAWLVGU#wasThisHelpful","RKXIQAJBOITFJ","AW7BIYHXUIZ62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW7BIYHXUIZ62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These PROFOOT Dura-Soles are as comfortable as any insole I've ever tried.  Noticeable padding at heel and toe.  Nice, but not too much, arch support. All USA made, which I like.  Claims to ""meet all military guidelines"".  A couple of reservations . . . .These are claimed to fit  sizes 8 through 14.  I'm not sure they will go that big. I'm size 11 to 11 1/2.  Right out of the package each insole is right at 12"" long.  I trimmed some off the toe (nearly an inch?), but I'd be surprised if this insole would have filled up a size 14.  Also, if one is at either end of the range (at size 8 or at size 14), wouldn't the arch support be possibly out of place?  I'm just speculating that for a buyer with feet at either end of the range, maybe he might also consider buying a brand offering a more targeted size range.Also, these seem to be rather wide (well over 3"" at the arch).  Works very nicely in the steel toed work boots I'm using them for, but appears a bit wide for a dress shoe (there's always the trimming option).  All applications and user needs differ.  In some cases these would be a nice addition on top of the original insole, in others they could replace a worn out or inferior original, in others they may simply help take up some space in a boot that fits too big.As with all aftermarket insoles, don't be in a hurry when trimming for the initial sizing.  Test it in the shoe or boot well, and be willing to make several small adjustments rather than just relying on the sizing guide and accidentally trimming off too much.In summary, as I said, these are as comfortable as any add-on insole I've tried.  Thin but effective.  American made.  Rather wide (but comfortable), and maybe slightly too ""one-size-fits-all"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMYNVD2RC5RZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JYE2O9S#wasThisHelpful","RMYNVD2RC5RZF","AW7BIYHXUIZ62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW7BIYHXUIZ62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A circulating fan forces air past this wick, and the moisture evaporates into the passing air and leaves the unit.  Thus the moist air is not oversaturated after exiting, and does not condense and leave a damp mess in the area.  Additionally . . .The wick also acts as a filter, cleaning out impurities as the air passes.  And, unlike the steam or cold mist units, this one is inherently self-regulating . . . as humidity in the room increases, the evaporative action will decrease.  Conversely as ambient air becomes drier, evaporation speeds up and humidifier output naturally increases.  A neat idea.Maintenance issues:  #1, like all humidifiers, the reservoir will become slimy and nasty if not periodically cleaned (simple enough).  And, #2, the wick/filter here will slowly accumulate dust it has filtered and will also accumulate impurities in the water left after evaporation.  That will cause the filter to become hard and ineffective.  It will eventually have to be replaced.  I checked, and these replacements are readily available on Amazon (series WF2 and I've already ordered one).  Replacement filter prices start at about $10.  Both OEM and aftermarket brands are available.Finally, about operating the filter.  Easy to fill:  The reservoir lifts off and has a screw on cap.  Easy to change the wick/filter:  the body of the filter (which contains the fan mechanism) lifts easily off the base, exposing the wick.  Fan is 2-speed - and the low speed is so quiet that it's nearly inaudible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGRUC7ARJR9UD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01410YUH8#wasThisHelpful","RGRUC7ARJR9UD","AW7BIYHXUIZ62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW7BIYHXUIZ62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like Hefty kitchen trash bags and am a long time user.  This is my first experience with this new ""Renew 65% Recycled Plastic"" bag.  How does it work?  Well, I really can't tell the difference from a traditional bag (i.e. this one works great).Visually, this Renew bag is gray in color with a blue tie handle.  I am 100% OK with that (it's a garbage bag).  No ""odor-control"" feature.  I'm OK with that, since,  #1 we have and use a garbage disposal unit for most foodstuffs, and,  #2 once the bag is tied shut any odor issue disappears.Regarding the recycled plastic factor . . . I like it, but personally, I will not pay a price premium on the purchase of a recycled plastic TRASH BAG (the bag itself represents very little actual bulk, but it's a good use for crude gray-colored recycled plastic).  Right now, the price offered on this box is 28 cents higher than a 45-count box of Hefty Tall Kitchen Odor Block bags.  I buy by price/performance, so I'd purchase the Odor Blocker over these.  And a final recycling note - I checked, and the paperboard box the bags come in is made from 100% recycled paperboard.  Good.In any case, no surprises here.  No bag blowouts, or tie handles that break off. Each bag comes off the roll individually, with no need to tear it off at perforations. Good quality bag at a (usually) fair price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M7J6V8WNOGSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZR4TTG0#wasThisHelpful","R3M7J6V8WNOGSS","AW7BIYHXUIZ62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW7BIYHXUIZ62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An interesting configuration for a dog treat . . . each Nutri Dent treat is a 3-pronged shape that can easily be broken up into two or three pieces.  This works well in the case of my two small dogs, where I give them a 1/3 section each, per serving.  This is a rather pricey treat, so dividing it up for smaller dogs will help stretch out the life of a package (as well as avoiding excessive treat feeding).I won't rewrite all the ingredients, as the reader can find it elsewhere in these reviews.  It's enough to point out: Made in USA.  No artificial preservatives, etc.  Bears the ""Veterinarian Recommended"" seal.  Purports to promote dental and breath condition.  And finally, how do the dogs like them??Both of my treat spoiled dogs (6 year old Pekanese mix, 12 year old Jack Russell mix) absolutely love them.  Love them.

"This is a 7.8 oz package (slightly under half a pound) containing 17 meat sticks, each about 4 1/2"" long and the diameter of a pinky finger.  The sticks do indeed appear to be ""deli-style"", with outer skins tied off at each end and a friendly beef-stick aroma not unlike what you'll find in the people food variety.A few labeling proclamations:  No corn or wheat or soy.  All natural and grain free.  Premium USA beef.  Free of fillers, rich in protein.  No animal by-products.  No artificial colors, flavors, preservatives.  Made in the USA.The ingredients list:  Beef, salt, sugar, citric acid, cultured dextrose, paprika, black pepper, garlic powder.Sounds good enough to eat, huh?  So I did.  I selected a stick and bit the end off.  Mmmm.  I did it again.  My impressions:  Less sodium than the typical ""people food"" beef stick.  High fat content (you can feel it lingering on your tongue).  I can taste a wee bit of that black pepper (pleasant sensation).  In all, and considering that this is a dog treat, unbelievably good.  These could easily serve as snack food (for me).  But that sounds kind of sick and I'd be cheating my two small elderly dogs - so they're getting the rest.  By the way, the package does prescribe consuming or refrigerating within 3 days of open (for freshness).  I'll do that.And of course, how do my dogs like it?  Well, for the first time in a dog food/treat review, I'm going to go ahead and post the review before ever giving the treat to my dogs.  I know them and I know that they're going to absolutely love these (especially if they see/smell that I've been there first).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TJ8YV0T73RHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URDX6SS#wasThisHelpful","R3TJ8YV0T73RHN","AW7BIYHXUIZ62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW7BIYHXUIZ62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my 3rd version of the review on this product -- each time I keep subtracting a star.  Now, after a few uses, my latest opinion . . . .When I opened the shipping box, the fragrance hit me.  I thought;  #1 this is sun tanning lotion (it's not, it's the NUXE Prodigieax Shower Oil), and, #2 this must have spilled open during shipment (it didn't, it was still completely sealed).Out of the tube, this is a rather thick amber gel infused with micro-size gold metallic ""shimmer"" particles.  The gold disappears under the shower as the gel diffuses (with very little lather).  Initially a brief pleasant fragrance as I do my face.  As I spread down away from my face the odor mysteriously transforms to what I can best compare to tire rubber.  Old tire rubber.  It's not a good scent.  I did not find the product on the skin to be at all ""oily"", and rinsing was easy and complete, with no residue sensation.After drying my skin felt clean, and reasonably soft and moisturized.  The very light residual scent was simply a soap-like fragrance that smelled clean and was not unpleasant.  It lingers for a few hours.  There was also a residual softness.  I realize that means that some moisturizing agent, along with a fragrance agent, was left behind on my skin after rinsing.  I'm OK with all that.I guess my main complaint is that horrible in shower smell.  But it goes away.An acceptable product in my opinion.  I'm not raving about it and will probably use it intermittently, for a change of pace.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GN41UZPYKY7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5Z5GFM#wasThisHelpful","R3GN41UZPYKY7U","AW7BIYHXUIZ62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW7BIYHXUIZ62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes, surprisingly good.  The packaging cleverly incorporates a lift out cup for pouring on the marinara sauce after heating, while keeping the pasta section enclosed so that it steams while heating.  Although I found the marinara a little too tart for my taste (just a matter of preference), I was really pleasantly surprised by the penne pasta.  It was like just boiled.  In fact it was better than my usual pasta preparation efforts.  Next time I may even dress it up a little cheese.  This stuff is very, very good for an instant, no refrigeration, microwave entree'.

"About the artwork:  I have been a many-time visitor to Israel and can never get enough of the wonder of Jerusalem.  Thus, my past Hebrew calendar purchases have generally leaned toward photographic art from Jerusalem and Eretz Israel.

Beautiful artist renderings of scenes from The City, and The Land, many of which I specifically recognize.  An added treat is the artist's commentary provided in a paragraph below each painting.  This will be a great source of enjoyment and meaningful reflection during the coming year.About the calendar part:  EXACTLY what I want!  Not too much, but in addition to Hebrew dates, it does include candle lighting/Havdalah times (based on sunset times),  Rosh Chodesh (new moon), Biblical Feast days and so forth.

"Men, don't be scared away by the name.

Too extensive to list here, but I can summarize that it's generally a full daily value of all essential vitamins and minerals, with a little heavier allotment of Vitamin C (333%), Vitamin D (500%), and mega-doses of the various B-Vitamins.  Everything that I can think of and in generally in full dosage (only a few minerals are less than 100%).Recommended serving is 2 caplets daily, preferably with a meal.

"This is just perfect as an age 2 birthday gift for our youngest grandson.  Smaller than other Power Wheels type toys we've had in the past -- but is properly tailored for the target ages 1 through 3.  Rides low, so is easy to mount/dismount with a low center of gravity to prevent tip overs.  Simple push-the-button operation to make it go (let up to stop).  A 2 year old can catch on pretty quickly.  Steering is via handlebars rather than a steering wheel, which seems to be more intuitive for a little one to learn (a skill already learned on his tricycle).  Speed is a slow/safe advertised 2 mph with plenty of power and good battery life (charge for at least 18 hours prior to presenting).  Assembly is easy and mostly snap together.  And all the aesthetic flash of PAW Patrol!In all, this Fisher-Price Power Wheels PAW Patrol Lil' Quad(tm) lives up to the standards we've enjoyed over the years from Fisher-Price, raising both our two kids and now enjoying our six grandsons.

"This has turned out to be a wonderful APP-driven RC toy car set.  Goal is to destroy the opponent car.  The ""opponent"" can be either Player 2, or, the AI (artificial intelligence) computer opponent.  Works on any reasonable surface in the house, garage floor, patio, etc.  The APP is free.  You'll need an IPhone or Android with Bluetooth enabled.  Pairing could not be easier (just hold the phone over the car).  Each car powered by 4 AA batteries.  Loading the batteries will require a Phillips screwdriver for the cover.  Battery life seems excellent (still on the first set after hours).  You'll probably have to recharge your iPhone before replacing the batteries.  With all that technical stuff out of the way, let me get on to the highlight, which is the play action . . . .SUPER!  Control is very quick and sensitive but kids will catch on fast.  Expect dads (and moms) to probably get hooked too.  The AI opponent is very smart and effective, so this is a wonderful play alone toy.

"I'm very impressed.  If the manufacturer/labeling here are telling the truth (and I have no reason to doubt their honesty at this point), this is a true premium dry dog food.  To be clear, I'm reviewing the ""Wellness CORE Large Breed Original Formula Grain Free"" product.  The information on the bag overflows with various commendable claims.  More that I can reproduce here, but among them . . . .Protein rich deboned chicken and chicken/turkey meal.  No meat by-products or fillers.  Optimum fat/calories.  Gluten and grain free.  Contains; antioxidants, Omegas, glucosamine, probiotics.  Added vitamins & minerals.  No artificial colors, preservatives, etc.  Made in USA.The ingredients list is also very long.  Lots of good stuff.  No red flags.  I'll list the first 5 ingredients: Deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, potatoes, and peas.Opening the bag - you'll need a pair of scissors.  But once you've got it open there is a nice resealing closure strip.  The odor?  OK, dry dog food-like and not at all offensive or repugnant.  This product is targeted for ""large breed"" dogs, but that has to do with the formulation of the product, not the kibble size - which are rather triangular shaped and about 1/2"" in diameter (not remarkably large).  As is my practice (as long as as the ingredients do not contain anything prohibited by my own biblically-compliant diet), I selected a few morsels and ate them . . . .Very good in reference to the dry dog food arena.  Meaty with a remote suggestion of fish.  No bland cardboard-like flavor as often experienced in dry foods. As a dry dog food, this is rather tasty and I can see where dogs would like this.  I tried it out on my two senior mixed breeds.  They are a bit smaller than the 50 pound entry level suggestion on the bag, but their usual diet has such wide variety, I have no personal reservation in trying them on this Wellness CORE Larger Breed.  How did they like it?I first presented a kibble to each dog ""treat style"".  They regarded it like a treat and asked for more.  In the food dish, I mixed in the Wellness with their usual dry food.  As I expected, they are fishing out the Wellness and leaving the other (which is a premium food also).  I expect the new will eventually wear off, but for now, they are hooked.Great dry food has it all - taste, wholesome ingredients, added nutrients.  It's not cheap, but this seems to represent the ""get what you pay for"" principle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NTERVJQ17KJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F57N92O#wasThisHelpful","R3NTERVJQ17KJ8","AW7BIYHXUIZ62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW7BIYHXUIZ62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So how do you improve a blow dryer?  (it's just a hand held hot air gun).  Really, there's not much left, but Remington has went all in on this D8700 T/Studio PROtect - and there are a few things here that are ""new"".The aquamarine tinted body looks great and the soft touch button controls feel great.  It's 1875 watts, which is the absolute maximum wattage you'll find in a blow dryer.  Three heat levels and two fan speeds (enough).  Easy to use Cold Shot button.  This one uses an ionic ceramic heating technology which mitigates local peak temperatures at the outlet and reduces that burning effect.This is kind of gimmicky, but there is a removable/replaceable ""exclusive conditioning ring"" which ""releases micro-conditioners"" (macadamia nut oils) as you dry.  Sounds ok.  I think it works, but I'm not sure, as I use good shampoo and conditioning products and am usually happy with after drying results with ANY dryer.  The kit includes a couple of different shaped concentrating/diffusing heads (I prefer the open dryer nozzle), and the box includes a nice conditioning hairbrush (labeled a $10 value).  There's a soft hanging loop (there's a new idea).*** The one improvement that I really do like is the removable rear grill.  Now, when the air intact starts to become blocked with dust and hair, I can slip off this grill, wash it clean, and reinstall easily.  This is a really important improvement that helps keep air flow up, and thus outlet temperature down (no burning), and greatly increases dryer life.Nice dryer.  Blows hot air with the best of 'em.  Looks and feels nice.  Not too heavy.  A few improvements (some real, some maybe).  This one can last longer that your old one if you keep that removable screen clean.  I received this one complimentary as part of a product evaluation program, and there is currently no offer price posted on Amazon, so I'll have to let the future potential buyer weight that decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29Q6CKJ23730M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQN6C0Y#wasThisHelpful","R29Q6CKJ23730M","AW7BIYHXUIZ62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW7BIYHXUIZ62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty good muesli.  Mostly toasted oats, sugar added, and then a variety of various seeds/nuts/fruits.  This is marketed as the""Blueberry"" variety, but don't expect to be overwhelmed by the blueberry flavor.  Again - this is mostly toasted oats - but the mix of other ingredients does make for a pretty tasty product.A few other thoughts:  I only eat mine cold and with milk and a little added sugar, so I base my favorable comment on that serving choice.  This 11 ounce bag is EXPENSIVE.  Fortunately, this is a very compact and filling type of cereal, so you don't need a full to overflowing bowl as you might with, say, a puffed rice type cereal containing lot s of air and low density material.  This type of product also lends itself to adding more or other ingredients yourself, right into the bag or your bowl (nuts, fruits, etc.)This is indeed one of the better muesli products - not the best I've eaten, but it is highest priced.  Sorry for the drumbeat about price, but it is, unfortunately, going to prevent future purchases by our household (we're too frugal).  Maybe if you are a real muesli fiend, it may be worth it?  A personal choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FLUE00WRD6KG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XSFNXJE#wasThisHelpful","R2FLUE00WRD6KG","AW7BIYHXUIZ62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW7BIYHXUIZ62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not going to wax on for paragraphs about a can of dog food, but I'll make 3 points:1.  Opening the can, I was not offended by the smell - which is not unlike that of canned beef stew, and such other people foods.2.  The ingredients list is too long to reproduce here, but I'll list the first 5 items:  chicken broth, chicken, chicken liver, beef liver, ground rice.  Thus, one can see this is heavy on the meat and light on the corn and wheat.  In fact, it contains no corn or wheat - but it does contain a wide array of vitamin supplements.3.

"I've owned one OtterBox Defender previously, installed on an earlier iPhone 4.  This current design for the Galaxy S6 Active is fundamentally the same yet upgraded to be more stylish and sleeker.  That is . . . stylish and sleeker compared to earlier OtterBox cases . . . this  heavy duty case is necessarily rather bulky and heavy compared to light slimline cases.Acknowledging the Defender trade-off adding bulk/weight, the only other design feature I don't like is the high rim surrounding the screen, which can get in the way of touch screen access near the edges.  The model doesn't seem as bad as my memory of the earlier one on my iPhone, however.If you are familiar with the Defender line, you know it gives great protection, with a soft rubbery inner slip-on, a rigid outer case,  and its own built-in screen/lens protection.  And, of course, the floating buttons all function great.  As usual, installation is not as quick as lesser cases, ESPECIALLY if you are unfamiliar with the Defender.Comes with a belt clip.

"I love this stuff in the shower.  Tis is a bar soap with a bold clean fragrance that reminds me something of Irish Spring.  Creamy, but there are distinct scrubbing granules throughout.  The granules are widely dispersed and I don't find them at all harsh like a Lava type hand soap or a women's exfoliating bar.  Stimulates and cleans without beating up your skin.  A very pleasant sensation -- leaves you feeling clean and smelling great.  No exaggeration here to say that this is probably the best soap product I've used for everyday showering.If I may add . . . lately I've tried and reviewed several products from the new Dove Men + Care line.  The Dove folks really did their homework on this product line. Without fail, I've been remarkably impressed by the product every time.

"These seem to be true to size at a boy's 12 Husky.  This is a lightweight denim fabric.  By look and touch, I thought it was the stretch denim material common to women's jeans, but it's not.  This is a 82/18% cotton polyester blend.  This light cool fabric lends itself well to hot weather comfort.  It does not stretch, although there are built-in elastic stretch tabs in the waistband that function to provide a little stretch in the waist.The color is a very dark indigo, with just a bit of light distress fading built into the front thigh area.  The length is just right (in my opinion), extending down 11 inches from the crotch intersection (I don't care for ""shorts"" that extend down to the calves).

"I wanted to approach this book like it was a high-priced antique. I wanted to look at the beauty of the cover and the intrigue of the synopsis. I didnt want to rush it. I wanted to savor it. With this being the conclusion of Tyler and Mackenzies story, I knew once I started, I would NOT be able to put it down. I would devour it whole, and I would look up and it would be over and I would be sad. My plan was to take it slow, but after staring at the cover and re-reading bits and pieces of Chasing The Dragon, Book 1 in the series, where it all began, I shot my plan all to HELL!

"WOW! I had a fantastic time reading HARD TO BREAK! Since Ive discovered this author, it has been hit or miss, and let me tell you this was quite the HIT! It was fresh, unique, and extremely sexy. We dive in to the world of fast cars, custom builds, and illegal racing. The sexual tension is at an all time high in Ms. Jewels latest standalone in her ALPHAS HEART series. This heart pounding, exhilarating, and erotic thrill ride will have you on the edge of your seat. This author delivered in a BIG way!This was a different and all around steamy read for me. HOT mechanics? Yes please! The main characters were fantastic in this. Our male lead, Tazen, is a cocky son of a *****. He is sexy, and he knows it. He is wealthy, accomplished, and he takes what he wants. His name even SCREAMS arrogance. At the beginning you will LOVE to HATE him, but dont worry, he grown on you and you will fall for his charms. My favorite character was our female lead, Quinn. She is a bold, strong, confident woman, with a good head on her shoulders. She has been through so much with her family and her familys business. She has had to grow up fast and took on so much responsibility at such a young age. She didnt have a normal childhood. When women her age are going out with their friends, seeing movies or partying the night away, she is trying to keep her fathers business afloat. She is a tomboy at heart and she loves hanging out with the guys. I loved her attitude and her sense of loyalty.When these two get together, their worlds explode. Crude and hilarious banter ensues, and a battle of wills begin. Both are determined and stubborn. Who will break first? Who will give in? With each page turned, the sexual tension kicks up a notch. The simmering connection turns to a full on boil when they get a taste of one another. As the story builds, and as Tazen and Quinn learn more about each other, the hate that they felt for one another slowly fades to a deep and passionate love that they will not be able to deny.Thank you to Bella Jewel for crafting such a smart, sassy, and steamy romance.*Gifted copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21P3F19XTHSNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRFUEK2#wasThisHelpful","R21P3F19XTHSNE","AUZ96COITGKE3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUZ96COITGKE3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A slow burning romance full of so much emotion! The last 20% took a lot out of me. A truly tortured hero and the woman who will risk her heart over and over again to give him peace. Another Rock Kiss novel is just what romance readers need to satisfy their craving for a romance that tugs at the heartstrings. A beautiful friends-to-lovers tale that will bring out all the feels and leave you craving so much more.Readers have to be strong with this one. Kit and Noahs relationship is a whirlwind of ups and downs. A woman wanting so much more than the man can give. Kits heart takes a bashing when she allows Noah back into her life. Noah cant be who Kit needs him to be, but he NEEDS her in his life. She makes everything better. He is tormented every day, and even though he needs her, he WILL NOT subject her to his past, present, or future. The back and forth is killer, and the sexual tension is ridiculous. The happily ever after makes all of the emotional highs and lows that you go through while reading this book, so worth it. The emotion, the intrigue makes this hard-won romance a fantastic installment to a favorite series of mine.ROCK REDEMPTION is a rock star romance that is hard-fought for and deliciously won. This story of healing will touch you, and the intensity of the sensual connection will have you swooning. Im really diggin Nalini Singh writing in this genre.

"A passionate, addictive, and sexy whirlwind of an erotic romance that will reach all of your senses and touch every part of your heart. Axel Dillon is one HERO you will never forget!The Wicked Lovers series always turns me inside out leaving me in an intense state of happiness and contentment. This series seems to get better with each installment. I crave Shaylas writing like no other, and every time I see she is releasing something new, I tend to get giddy like a school girl. I feel like Ive been waiting on Axel Dillons story for a while, when really, it probably hasnt been that long. I just get so enraptured in these characters lives, I yearn for more every time the last page has turned.Gripping, sensual, and seductive, WICKED FOR YOU will set your e-reader on fire! This author never slacks off in the erotic department, so each sex scene is better than the last. It always starts off so sexy and savage and then after the characters give in to their emotions, it turns tender, loving, but still with a heavy passionate edge that Black does so well.Mystery Mullins (can I just say, I freaking love that name for a heroine!) is our female lead. Axel Dillon has always been her hero and her fantasy. They live two totally separate lives, and the first time they come into each others lives, she is too young and innocent for Axels rough nature.

"Katie Ashley continues to raise the stakes, giving her readers a sexy MC romance that they crave! Intense. Dramatic. Sexy. Dangerous. This next installment of the Vicious Cycle Series takes the MC genre to the next level! I just knew that after reading about Nathaniel Reverend Malloy in Vicious Cycle, I was going to fall hard when he got his own story, and boy did I fall HARD. This rugged, sexy beast of a man has a gentle side and past that should have broken him. When Annabel Percy falls into his life, he instantly feels protective of her, and will do what it takes to keep her safe, no matter what. Explosive chemistry and a connection they cant deny, these two come from different worlds, but when they come together, they make a world for themselves that house so much passion and love, there is nothing that can break through.Every single second of this thrilling romance did something for me. There was an intensity that flew off the pages and so much sexual tension you wont know what to do with yourself. Stunning writing where the vibration of the motorcycle engines sink through to your bones, and the smell of leather takes over your senses, REDEMPTION ROAD has become a favorite of mine in a genre that I adore. This is turning out to be a fantastic series with a great group of characters that you will yearn to know more about.

"Scorching hot, fiery, explosive, and undeniably gripping, LAST HOPE has got to be my FAVORITE of the series! You will feel the sexual tension encase your body like a warm unforgiving blanket. Shivers and goosebumps will surround your skin. Your cheeks will become inflamed, and your mind, body, and soul will be held captive until the end of the journey. These two authors continue to amaze me with their fantastic co-writing skills.A strong heroine and a TO DIE FOR hero is the perfect recipe for a captivating and beautiful love story. With every new book in this series comes more sex, more suspense, and more drama. I will never get enough!The story of Rafe and Ava was intense, steamy, and adventurous. A mercenary hitman and a hand-model find themselves deep in the jungle struggling to survive. Danger is all around them. The elements of the jungle are unforgiving. They have to battle that danger along with their lust for one another. Objectives change in the midst of their situation. Rafe still has a mission to accomplish, but his strong protective feelings for Ava might end up costing him more than that.Ava was a great heroine - strong with such courage. Rafe was a fantastic hero. I had no doubt of that, because the male leads in this series always surpass my expectations. Together, these characters have such great and intense chemistry. You feel it from the moment they lay eyes on each other. Surprises, suspense, and a ridiculous amount of sexual tension cover every single page in this amazing new installment of the Hitman series. Clare and Frederick certainly have another hit on their hands!*Gifted copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ4ED88KKXPKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA5KFS4#wasThisHelpful","RQ4ED88KKXPKT","AUZ96COITGKE3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUZ96COITGKE3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can always ALWAYS count on Ms. Armentrout to deliver a beautifully touching love story. A heart-warming romance full of humor, emotion, and passion, FOREVER WITH YOU was a thing of grace and charm. It brought out all the feels and satisfied all of the senses. This author gives us strong characters and highly emotional storylines. If I were to pick one word that sums up this novel and every novel Jennifer turns out, it would be LOVELY.I fell pretty hard for Nick and Stephanie's story. There was such a strong connection with these two and when it was ripped apart it gutted me. You have to be strong through this one and just know in your heart that this author will give you a happily ever after you will always remember.Stephanie and Nick were fantastic characters. They were so strong, refreshing, and charming. I loved how bold Stephanie was and I loved the fact that even though she had this tough exterior, Nick was always able to knock her off her game and rattle the hell out of her. My heart swelled for these two. I cheered them on the whole way through. You will experience a broad spectrum of emotion throughout this novel. It goes from funny, witty, and light to deep, tragic, and raw. This deals with real issues that some women and couples will be able to relate to. This is embedded with a great message and will definitely be able to touch some hearts.I'm never disappointed with this series or with this author. Her love stories always picks me up when I'm feeling down and reading them always acts as a great escape for me. Jennifer's writing is a thing of beauty and her stories are always must reads for me. FOREVER WITH YOU is part of a series but CAN be read as a standalone novel. If you are a newbie, I trust that you will fall instantly in love with this author's style.

Prepare to get HOT under the collar because the sexual tension is OFF THE CHARTS!Before I go any further, I need to warn you that you DO need to read UNTIL JULY before you start this book. I know this is labeled as Book 1 in the UNTIL HIM series, but believe me, you need to start with Book 1 in the UNTIL HER series to be caught up at the beginning of UNTIL JAX.Ok, back to it! Jax Mayson has experienced his BOOM with Ellie Anthony. I love this whole BOOM concept with this family. It's INSTA-LOVE, but I freaking ADORE it! Yes, it is instant for Jax, but it's not for Ellie, so you get to experience the journey of her falling for this beautiful alpha male. I'm not a fan of overuse of terms of endearment, but it works for me with Jax. He says 'baby' all the time, and each time my heart flutters. I also love Jax's confidence. He knows what he wants in his future, and Ellie is IT. No more, no less. He just needs to spend his time protecting her, and convincing her that this is the real deal. It's cute, it's so alpha, and I expect nothing less from the amazing Ms. Reynolds.Ellie has secrets. Jax wants her trust. Enemies get closer, and the Mayson crew is ready for battle. Ellie is one of theirs now, and they will stop at nothing to stand by Jax's side and take on whatever threat might linger.UNTIL JAX is full of drama, scorching hot love scenes, and beautiful moments.

"Victoria Ashley always brings the heat in her books. They are wonderfully erotic and extremely sexy. I enjoyed the reading despite a few things bothering me throughout. The plot was predictable BUT still enjoyable. Im a HUGE fan of dirty-talking heroes and Alex Carter was definitely one of them. There were parts that were sweet, a little emotional, and heavy. There were parts that were a little repetitive, but it didnt deter me from continuing on. This was fast-paced with not a lot of angst. I enjoyed Alexs POV. Im a big fan of love stories given in the male POV. Something for the Pain was dual POV, but I could have done without Tripps side. I didnt connect with her well. She was a little too much oh, woe is me in this book.The chemistry between Alex and Tripp was good. The chemistry between Lucas and Tripp was not so good, but that might have been intentional. The leading characters said each others names WAY too much. That made it a little awkward and a little too forced. I was digging the secondary characters, Ace and Harley. It seems like the author has another story there. We do get a little bit of Memphis and Lyric from book 1, but I could have used more because I adored those characters and missed them greatly.Towards the end, the declaration of love was a little anti-climactic and felt a little rushed. I wanted something emotional, something big, and it fell flat. All in all, I DID like this read, I just wish that it reached me on a deeper emotional level like Book 1 did. That being said, if you are an erotic romance reader, you should try this book out. It will get you all hot and bothered. If you are looking for a more powerful and emotional sexy read, this might not touch your heart the way you want, but it will make you blush.*Gifted copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review*","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R393E5I7SB2M1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SF5RQ8#wasThisHelpful","R393E5I7SB2M1X","AUZ96COITGKE3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUZ96COITGKE3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WOW! I just fall in love every. single. time. with these books! This beautiful, sexy, and breathtaking book is over 700 pages of SEXY and EMOTIONAL goodness! Its page after page of pure delight and hours and hours of sensual scenes that will make you melt. I LOVE everything about this series. Im so grateful for Red Phoenix for bringing us this amazing character in Brie. Ive been a fan since the beginning and with each new book, comes a passionate and erotic journey of self discovery. Im emotionally invested in not only Brie and Sirs character, but every secondary character as well. Its amazing because you get to learn SO much about each character  their past, their present, their desired future. Each one has taken up a piece of my heart and with every ending, I miss them more and more.The intense love that Brie and Sir (Thane) share is transcendent. Im envious and yet I am their biggest fan. I feel for them during their struggles and I cheer for them when they triumph. They are so good for one another. They learn from each other and make each other whole in every way possible. Their easy dynamic is beautiful and refreshing. They chase away each others demons and bring light to each others darkness. I cant say enough good things about these two. This deep lovethis heavy devotion is something that I hope to have one day. They have fondness, friendship, respect, and love. You can feel it jump out of the pages with each turn.Again, Red Phoenix gives us SO MUCH MORE than just a sexy read with her Brie books. There is always a variety of emotions that these books pull out of me. She keeps us on our toes, and makes damn sure that we experience every laugh, every cry, every moan just like we were in the room with these characters. I will NEVER get enough of these books, and I hope that each journey Brie takes us on, we become that much closer to the characters that we fell in love with at the very beginning! I can always count on a Brie book to put a smile to my face and warmth to my heart. I will never tire of her adventures and her spirit. Red Phoenix created an amazing character, so easy to fall in love with and so easy to share a journey with.My recommendation: Take the journey.

Always making us swoon, always making us sigh, and always making us blush like crazy, this author gives us another intense, passionate, and overwhelmingly sexy love story.

"BAD *** sassy female. BAD *** rugged biker. EXPLOSIVE chemistry. LIES, SECRETS, and MURDER. This fantastic MC Romance was raw, gritty, fast-paced, emotional, sexy, and INTENSE to the max! What an adrenaline rush! I devoured this book. I let Lip and Cherrys story consume me from the inside out. A solid, steamy and intense read!With every new book in this series, comes a new sense of admiration for this author and a new love of her writing. She takes a premise that you might not be comfortable with and turns it in to something so incredibly beautiful. She makes you fall in love with these foul-mouthed, sometimes rude, sometimes lewd, but ALWAYS sexy bikers. MC Romances are my favorite and MN Forgy is at the top of my list of authors I love in the genre. There was so much going on in this story. There is an expansive timeline we go through, but it adds so much to the story and helps guide us through this intense journey.Lip and Cherry. These two are quite the pair. Their initial meeting was fantastic! The sexual chemistry was scorching hot. The banter between these two was hilarious. There are twists and turns along with some pretty amazing sex scenes. I couldnt turn the pages fast enough. I wanted to get to the end but I didnt. I wanted to savor it, but I needed to get to their happily ever after. This was a tough journey to love for these two, but it was all worth it in the end. Im not bashing insta-love, because lord knows I love me some insta-love, but I appreciated the fact that this wasnt the case for Lip and Cherry. There was a slow build-up there,  and it was a lot of work, but that made it that much special when they finally experienced it.You cant go wrong with this series. Every character brings something special to the table and it seems like the stories keep getting better and better. MC Romance lovers will immediately sink their teeth in to this baby and they will not want to let go. If you are looking for a light, fluffy romance, this is not your book. This book has meat. This book has substance. This book has so much heart.

That one night stand turns into playing house with the beautiful knight in disguised armor. Intense passion ensues. Emotions become tangled and feelings deepen. When Jesse's cover is blown, Bristol finds herself incredibly hurt. Bristol has become special to Jesse and he will do what it takes to earn her trust back. He wants forever.

This little novella had it ALL - humor, quick wit, steamy love scenes, emotional upheaval, I couldn't put it down. I found this read charming, sweet, and sexy. I'm used to Shayla Black's Wicked Lovers series to be more heavily erotic. I'm not complaining either way. Black absolutely KILLS both genres.

"Angel Payne and Victoria Blue are back with another scorching HOT, emotional romance that will have your head in the clouds and your heart in a vise. VERY well done!This story was smoking hot right from the start. Michael Pearson shows his dominant side in more ways than one, and I LOVED it! Margaux and Michael's chemistry is just on point and oh so heady. Together they took the good ole' school girl fantasy to another level. This was one of the best scenes in my mind because this is where Margaux realizes what Michael can really do for her. He can take her to another place and make her forget her worries. He can bring her a pleasurable pain that she never knew she craved. This was a great turning point for them and was a small window in to what was to come in this love story.Margaux Asher was not my favorite heroine going in to this book, but man did she redeem herself in NO MAGIC MOMENT. She won me over 100% in this installment of the series and she just surprised the hell out of me. I even realized the Margaux and I, are not all that different. I was able to relate to her on a couple of levels in this book. I mean sure she is ridiculously wealthy (and I'm not). And sure she has the gorgeous and sexy Michael Pearson on her arm (and I DO NOT). But she showed us great strength and tenacity in this book, and I was incredibly proud her the entire way through. The fact that it is so hard for her to shed tears, made my heart ache. The strength she shows for herself and for her relationship with Michael was a beautiful thing. She does NOT give up. She WILL NOT give up on herself or their relationship.Michael Pearson. GOD! I just melt every single time 'sugar' comes out of his insanely sexy mouth. I melt. I shudder. My heart skips a beat. Michael was a FANTASTIC male lead. We get to experience the yummy dominant side, as well as, the vulnerable side of Mr. Pearson. He put his heart in Margaux's hands and he trusts her with everything he has that she will take good care of it. Michael's past is the main topic on display in this book and I was so happy to have it revealed. Margaux shared her past with him, it was only fair to reveal his. The problem is, is that his past puts everyone he loves in danger and Margaux holds that top spot right now. When he decides that the only way to keep her safe is to let her go, well, let's just say, maybe he doesn't know Margaux as well as he thinks he does.Their relationship, their love, their happily ever after is put to the test in a big way in the latest installment of the Secrets of Stone series. We get TONS of make up sex, a deeper level of emotion, and a dash of suspense and I enjoyed ever minute of it. Don't worry ladies, you will get your Killian Stone fix as well. The easy relationship he has with his sister, the deep love he shares with his Claire, and the heartbreaking confession he has yet to share with anyone, comes to light in this fabulous read.Angel Payne and Victoria Blue did it right with NO MAGIC MOMENT. I'm looking forward to more of this series and more of these wonderful and complex characters.*Gifted copy provided by the authors in exchange for an honest review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N7774C16EDSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010S2OTVK#wasThisHelpful","R3N7774C16EDSX","AUZ96COITGKE3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUZ96COITGKE3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Amy is having a really hard time adjusting because she has been looking over her shoulder for years. On top of that there may be a couple missing pieces of the puzzle that are not accounted for. Liam is her safe place, her hero, her heart, but is it enough to finally move on from the past?In the final installment of this beautiful series, one of my favorite all time heroes shows his romantic side. Oh don't be fooled, the dominant is still VERY alive, but to help ease Amy's mind, Liam tries his best to shower her with tenderness and love. Amy deserves the world, and Liam will do everything in his power to give it to her. With all of the turmoil and strife still lingering, these two amazing characters draw strength from one another, showering each other with love, affection, and devotion. The love runs deep and so intense between Amy and Liam, you can't help but envy their connection.These two have been through so much. The obstacles, the struggles, all of it, testing their love day by day. Finally, their roadblock to happiness has been cleared.I felt such a sense of contentment while reading this book. I feel like I know these characters inside and out. I've been emotionally invested from day one, and it is so important to have their ending go down as one of the greats. There is just something about Lisa Renee Jones' characters that get to me down deep. Amy and Liam are two of those characters and they will forever be remembered in my heart.*Gifted copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29OJ9O0XW82MZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WV1K#wasThisHelpful","R29OJ9O0XW82MZ","AUZ96COITGKE3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUZ96COITGKE3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is incredibly hard to find the right words to describe this book and do it justice. All I know is that Alessandra Torre is a beautiful genius! I completely lost myself in this book from page one. For a few hours NOTHING else existed but these characters and their story. I didn't blink. I didn't breathe. I didn't sleep. This book surrounded me and I didn't want to come up for air. It teased all my senses, leaving me in a completely blissful state of mind. Ms. Torre sucked me in and everything else was a blur. I fell in love with Cole and Summer. I fell in love with their story and I fell in love with this town. Alessandra Torre is one of the elite. She is in a category all her own. Novel after novel she brings something new, something fresh to the table and I devour it every single time.This was an enthralling, emotional romance about taking risks. It's about finding yourself, finding your love, your passion, and the other half of your soul. This was EASILY one of my FAVORITE reads of the year!*Gifted copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MZBCGX6DHD4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UA70U8#wasThisHelpful","R2MZBCGX6DHD4O","AUZ96COITGKE3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUZ96COITGKE3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a thing of beauty! EVERY LOVE is a story of hope, acceptance, and sacrifice. This is an engaging love story about two people who are constantly fighting against their past. They shed light on each other's darkness. They chase away each other's demons, and as each day passes they slowly chip away at each other's walls, only to find bits and pieces of a broken heart inside. But with each smile, each laugh, and with each tender moment, they come closer to making one another whole again.EVERY LOVE moved me so much. It evoked such intense emotions out of me and had my full attention from the first few pages. It broke me in the best way possible. With each chapter came one more emotion that rocked me to my core. I didn't know what to expect with Nate's story. This man has been through Hell and back getting a second chance at life, only to have his heart destroyed when coming back home. It's rare you read a story where the hero get's a third chance at life, and Collins executes beautifully with EVERY LOVE. This author always pushes all the right buttons for me, making me feel emotions that I never thought possible. I was extremely excited for Nate to get his HEA, and Collins did his story justice. It's hard to beat the first two books in this series, because those characters held such a strong place in my heart, but Nate did wiggle his way in, even after all of the frustrations I had with him, and dug himself deeper than I thought possible.If you are EVERY looking for an emotionally gripping, real to life, beautiful love story, LK Collins is your author.*Gifted copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJJMXJFF1MUZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014RSRUZS#wasThisHelpful","RJJMXJFF1MUZZ","AUZ96COITGKE3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUZ96COITGKE3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"WOW! This was so brilliant! One of THE BEST erotic romances I've ever read!I don't even know where to begin! I am so incredibly IN LOVE with this book! Beth Kery is one of those authors that just pop up out of nowhere with a FABULOUS read. I've only read one other novel by her and it was fantastic as well. I've become addicted to her writing style and every single thing that comes with it. It's a curse and a blessing that I didn't find out about this series until it was all bundled up in one pretty HOT package. It's a curse because, HOLY ****, where the **** have I been, living under a rock I guess. How did I not know about this? The blessing is because, THANK GOD, I would have gone absolutely bonkers if I had to stop for one second in Emma and Michael's story. THE AFFAIR is over 500 pages of delicious and erotic exploration. It's an explosion of  lust, sensation, and passion. This book oozes eroticism like no others before it. I'll say it again...ABSOLUTE BRILLIANCE!OMG! I'm so in love with these characters and their incredible journey they take together. I adored Emma. She is going down as one of my favorite heroines of all time. She is so strong, so complex, and yet, so new to the kind of passion that Michael brings to the table. I love her vulnerability and her courage. But most of all I love how she takes care of Michael. She breaks him down and builds him back up. She shows him his strengths and teaches him about forgiveness and acceptance. Oh, and Michael <insert sigh here>. I have fallen hard for this character. He is tortured. He is possessive. He is filthy rich and gorgeous. And like Emma, I admire the vulnerability he shows to Emma and Emma alone. He needs to be in control, but when Emma walks into his life, she steals it away, along with his heart. He has been through so much pain and suffering, and to him, Emma is a breath of fresh air in his life. She makes him feel alive and more important she just makes him FEEL. Together these two are explosive!I felt curiosity and excitement. I felt giddiness and a sense of adventure. I felt happiness, sadness, and so much angst. In the end I felt a profound sense of peace. The entire time I was reading this novel I was FEELING. It was refreshing and so **** perfect. I was utterly captivated by Emma and Michael's grand passion. This is a story I will always remember. These are characters that will forever be in my heart. This is the book you keep on your favorite bookshelf and every once in a while you look over at it and it just makes you smile. That my friends, is what you call an EPIC ROMANCE.*Gifted copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R205XCE9G1FBPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VR39M6M#wasThisHelpful","R205XCE9G1FBPX","AUZ96COITGKE3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUZ96COITGKE3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LOVED it! UNSAID was one of the better MM Erotic Romances I've read in a while. There is SO MUCH going on but not so much you get lost in the mess of things. It's complex, hilarious, and ridiculously steamy! Chock-full of drama, witty banter, and rich people problems, UNSAID played out like a TV show in my mind. It was incredibly enjoyable and warmed me in all the right places.If you are looking for a story with humor, romance, and all of the feels, UNSAID is the book for you.

"Love Love LOVED this novella! STRIPPED DOWN was an all around SEXY good time! Steamy, sexual, and plenty emotional, this little gem of a book will bring a huge smile to your face, a blush to your cheeks, and a heaviness to your heart. BIG things come in this sexy little package!OMG! There is plenty of dirty talk right off the bat. Lorelei James wastes NO time at all. I could NOT stop smiling the entire time. I adored this premisebest man hooks up with maid of honor. I mean COME ON, that is PERFECT! Wynton Grant and Melissa Lockhart were SO GOOD together. So fun, light, witty, and ridiculously sexy. They will go down as one of my favorite couples from this author. Flirting turns into so much more in this Blacktop Cowboys novella. I loved how open and honest both characters were. They werent trying to hide or sugarcoat what they wanted from each other. They wanted to get down and dirty, simple as that. But a steamy hookup opens up the possibility of MORE. A secret withheld, brings out feelings that they never thought possible.STOP what you are doing and READ this quick and saucy love story! Hardcore fans of Lorelei James, like myself, will bask in the glory of her awesomeness with STRIPPED DOWN. Want a little taste of James style? Are you ready to become addicted? STRIPPED DOWN is a marvelous start down a journey you will never want to leave. Its SEXY! ROMANTIC! EMOTIONAL! The intense passion in this book will make you shiver. The emotional connection between these characters will make you sigh. The sexy as sin male lead will make you SWOON big time, as do all of Lorelei James heroes!Saddle up ladies and gents!

"""Rattlers"" is a film made to watch under the stars at your local drive-in, along the lines of other such 70's ""nature-gone-crazy"" flicks like ""Grizzly"", ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" or ""The Pack"". Is it a good movie? I guess not, at least I don't think people looking for a great story, compelling characters and top notch acting will be interested in watch ""Rattlers"". But if you enjoy a so-bad-it's-good type of film, then this is definitely worth visiting.Something seems to be driving the rattlesnakes crazy, and forcing them into populated areas attacking people even when not being provoked. After two young boys are killed on a camping trip, the local police bring in a professor from the local college to help investigate the rash of snake attacks and the odd behavior of the reptiles.I think that what I love most about these cheesy 1970's critter features, is the use of real snakes. This may be a cheesy B-movie, but if the sight of snakes wriggling around in your bathtub or crawling up your pant-leg doesn't give you the uber-willies, then you have to be made of stone. There are some seriously goosebump raising scenes in the film (the bathtub scene in particular gave me the heebie-jeebies).Streaming for free for PRIME members, so check it out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G5NO59VMIQXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VSSQMA#wasThisHelpful","R1G5NO59VMIQXA","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I picked this up for a pretty selfish reason. I actually have no issue with just grabbing a quick glass of water straight from the tap, I guess having well water as opposed to ""city"" water can make a difference? Either way, my wife says that the water from the tap tastes ""gross"" so every week when we're grocery shopping, we always pick up a case of water....and that thing is HEAVY!! I honestly got tired of lugging the things up the steps into the house every week.I grabbed the Ultimate Pitcher for her to try (along with a sport bottle she can take to the gym), and so far it seems to work great. We simply fill the pitcher as needed, the little filter LED lets her know the filters are working and she claims the water, right from the tap, tastes great. The PUR says the filter will last for 2 months, or 40 gallons, something like that.

"If you want a solidly built watch, with a classic look, then this Invicta is for you. I was surprised at the weight of the watch, and the feel. It's heavy, but I like that feature. If I'm going to wear a watch, I want something with a little heft and bulk. I see some other reviews claiming the watch face looks ""cheap"", I don't find that to be the case. I think is has a classic look, and it's actually quite striking.While I usually only wear watches when I'm wearing a suit for work or going to visit clients, this may be a watch I wear more often.

"I vividly remember seeing this box on the shelf in my local video stores, and thought it might be fun to give this film a try sometime. Well I guess I waited long enough and found this on TV one late night (on Turner CLASSIC Movies of all places???).  I guess if you've never seen a killer fetus movie, you might as well pop in ""It's Alive"".Hoping for a cornball, so-bad-it's-good movie, I sat down to watch this thing. And while it does have that 70's aesthetic I like, I found myself bored about 20 minutes in, and as the film played out, it just became a chore to sit through.A married couple are about to have their second child, they've waited awhile, (10 years or so?) and the mother has been on birth control pills. When the labor pains kick in, they drive to the hospital where is soon becomes apparent that something is wrong with the baby. Once the little thing pops out of the womb, it starts murdering the doctors and nurses (no, we don't get to see any of it) and takes off through a skylite. Of course the murders are big news, and the family's life is wrecked as it becomes known that they conceived a little monster.Somewhere in here, there is a fun movie, but the slow pace, the lack of any decent horror or suspense, and the complete lack of cheesy fun make this one difficult film to slog through. Maybe if they chopped the running time down to 80 minutes, I would feel differently, but at an hour and 45 minutes, this is painful.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2323R9CVGQ5AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074BLPC0#wasThisHelpful","R2323R9CVGQ5AH","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally got around to watching this latest entry in the ""Child's Play"" series, and I went in with very low expectations. While I loved ""Bride of Chucky"" and the sense of humor that film brought with it, ""Seed of Chucky"" went a loooong way in killing off any interest in this series. I knew this had come out, and I also knew it went straight to video, which is never a good sign, so ""Curse of Chucky"" fell off my radar pretty quickly.Stumbled across the Blu-ray at a yard sale a few weeks back and picked it up for $2, I figured I couldn't really lose at that price. Popped in the movie last night, and me and the kids had a BLAST!! This honestly may be my favorite film in the series.As the movie opens a young woman in a wheelchair living with her mother in their old house receive a large package from Fed-Ex. Inside the package is a Good Guy doll, neither express much interest in the thing, and neither know who sent it. Forgotten they shove it in a chair and forget about it. Later that evening the mother ""commits suicide"", and her extended family come to the house for the funeral, giving us a large pool of victims for Chucky to work through.""Curse"" isn't just a re-tread, it adds some new, fun twists to the story. I really liked that the film featured a young woman in a wheelchair as our protagonist, I'm not sure I've ever seen that in a film before? (No.....just no.....""Mac & Me"" doesn't count!!!). I like too that while they kept a touch of comedy in the film, the suspense also made a nice comeback. Now, I won't try to convince anyone that ""Chucky"" is scary, but they do a good job of building up the suspense in several scenes.If you are a fan of the series, you'll enjoy all of the flashbacks, and ties this film has to the previous films in the series, but even if you haven't seen any of the other films, you'll still be able to enjoy this movie.

"While I enjoy these film adaptations, I want to highly recommend you read the novels first. While the film's are done very well, each novel is filled with such rich detail, you can't help but lose quite a bit of magic in transition from page to screen. Specifically starting with the third novel, ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" and through the end of the series, so much is trimmed for the purpose of the film running time, that whole chunks of story and sometimes even great characters and character development never makes it to the screen.Harry is returning to his 6th year at Hogwarts, but after the events in ""The Order of the Phoenix"", he finds himself a bigger celebrity than ever. Voldemort is gaining more power and his Death Eaters are bringing havoc to not lonely the Wizarding world, but causing harm to the muggle world as well, killing or kidnapping anyone that gets in their way. Harry, Ron and Hermione suspect that Draco Malfoy has joined the Death Eaters, and suspect that he is plotting with the Dark Lord to overthrow Hogwarts.I will say that this film seems to change the most from the source material. Yes the basic storyline is the same, but tons of details are swapped around. For instance in the novel, Dumbledore warns Harry against being ""collected"" by Professor Slughorn, when in the film it's said that Dumbledore wants Harry to become part of the ""Slug Club"". Sure it's a small detail, but it the shift changes the characters, and their actions, quite a bit from the page to the screen. There are similar changes throughout the telling of this story, with some fantastic character development surrounding Voldemort that is completely left. out.This film seems much darker in tone, even in the way it's shot, there are no sweeping shots of the castle or grounds. When Hogwarts is shown,  it's usually in the dark or the sky is murky cloudy. The wonderous, magical quality is toned way down in the film, so that instead of fantasy, you feel uneasy about what has happened in Harry's world. A good film, but bit more morose and melancholy than what's come before it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXG1Q0ZQO8QRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PMV9FG#wasThisHelpful","RXG1Q0ZQO8QRF","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are a fan of this series, you will love this book.....but, you'll hate this book at the same time, and one thing is certain,  you won't be able to put it down. I would say that this is Rowling's most challenging novel of the series. Unlike the previous novels in the series, ""The Order of the Phoenix"" really feels aimed at an older reader, tackling subjects such as; losing as loved one, life after death, aging, isolation, political machinations, bureaucracies, higher education, etc.Before Harry can even think about returning to Hogwarts for his fifth year of education, he has to get through the Summer with his obnoxious, borderline abusive, ""muggle"" family. While trying to keep and eye and ear open for any sign of ""You Know Who"" after the events of the previous novel, he's having a hard time adjusting to non-wizarding life, and feels cut-off from his friends and the secret world that he loves so much. Not know what is happening with Voldemort and feeling that his friends have abandoned him, Harry is dealing with the mounting of tension, waiting for Voldemort to strike, and when he's forced to use magic one Summer night, Harry soon finds out that even the Ministry of Magic may be compromised.If you thought Voldemort was horrible, he's nothing compared to Rowling's creation Dolores Umbridge. You will despise this character, she is simply horrible....delightfully horrible. I honestly cannot tell you how wonderfully awful this character is, and you'll want to continue reading this novel in the hopes that she will get what she deserves. by the end of the novel.With that said, I think this may be the weakest novel in the series. Not because of Umbridge, she is a wonderful addition to the story, and a much more grounded evil for Harry to fight. I had a few issues with the novel, first and foremost was Harry himself. He's kind of jerk throughout this novel, whining and full of self-pity one moment, losing his temper and raging at those around him the next. Harry also seems to have suddenly gotten a bit stupid between books, as he makes dumb mistake after dumb mistake in this novel. I always like Harry prior to this novel, but he just comes off really badly in this entry. I would also say that ""Order of the Phoenix"" is the first time where I really think Rowling's editor should've done a bit more chopping, and tightened up the story a bit. Even after the climax of the story, the book drags on as we get quite a few chapters of exposition where two characters sit and talk for page after page after page. While the info being discussed is important to the story, it's written here as an information dump, just page after page of dialogue. This info should've been doled out in a different way, or sprinkled throughout the story instead.I do want to end on a positive note, and will say that I loved the introduction of Luna Lovegood, and I really enjoyed leaning more about Neville Longbottom, and ""Order of the Phoenix"" really builds to the final two books of the series as Rowling has created real stakes for her characters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TRX4G45YNM5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0439358078#wasThisHelpful","R1TRX4G45YNM5D","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I remember when this book came out, and I was amazed that kids were lining up to read a 1000+ page novel!! (I have to admit I was right there in line with them), and while I read the novel, I kept wondering just how in the world they would ever be able to make a film adaptation. The novel is PACKED with tons of new characters, the Quidditch World Cup, the Tri-Wizard tournament.....just tons of stuff, and I thought for sure it would have to be split into two films. When I found out that ""Goblet of Fire"" was going to be a single film, with a running time similar to the earlier films in the series, I figured they would be cutting the story to the bone, and was prepared to be disappointed in the movie.I will say that they story is cut way, way down. We go from the opening at the Riddle house to the Weasley household to the World Cup to Hogwarts within the first 10 - 15 minutes of the film. What took a few hundred pages in the novel takes up almost no screen time. The storytelling in the film is crisp and while huge sections of the novel are glossed over or left out completely, the film is very entertaining and coherent, but quite a bit of character building is lost in the process. The leads get their time to shine, but the supporting case doesn't get to do a whole lot. Snape is relegated to the background for most of the film, and Rickman's portrayal of the Potions Professor as been a highlight of the series so far. We don't really get to know the other competitors in the Tri-Wizard Tournament either, specifically Cedric Diggory. It's a shame that we can't really get invested in these characters as they play such a vital role in the overall story. The F/X again are top notch, and again the three leads really feel natural in the roles now, they've made these characters their own, and it shows.I really think this film should've been split into two movies. There is just so much lost in the transition from Page to Screen, that while this film does feel complete, fans of the series know there was a much bigger, and better story to tell. As it is, ""Goblet of Fire"" is a good movie, but it's not a great movie.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RS0HVRL1JIMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E6EK2Y#wasThisHelpful","R3RS0HVRL1JIMP","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" may be my favorite book in the Harry Potter series, and while I was excited to watch the film adaptation, I was a bit worried about what would be left out of the film (so many wonderful parts of the books never made it onto film with the first two movies), and I also worried that the filmmakers would tame down the exciting climax, because this is, after all, a ""kids"" movie.I will say right up front, that the film makers nailed the climax, and while some details are changed from the source material, the climax to this film is absolutely nail-biting fun. The F/X are top notch, and the score this time around is a bit less ""fantastical"" and a bit darker, almost horror-like. As we see Harry return once more to Hogwarts School for his 3rd year of wizarding study, we learn that an infamous wizard known as Sirius Black, suspected of being one of Voldemort's supporters, and a convicted murderer, has escaped the wizard prison of Azkaban. Due to Black's escape the countryside and Hogwarts school is being patrolled by Dementors, the nasty wraith-like Azkaban guards who are searching for Black. It is thought that Black is coming after Harry to finish what Voldemort was unable to.Lots of twists and turns, and the supporting characters get to shine as much as our hero. With the introduction of Professor Lupin, Rowling creates one of the most endearing characters of the series. Alan Rickman as Snape, gets a bit more to do here than in ""Chamber of Secrets"" and steals every scene he's in. I think what really lifts this third film in the series over the previous two is that the kids feel more natural here. Instead of constantly wearing school robes, we see them running around in jeans and t-shirts. This film also doesn't feel so ""by-the-numbers"", and while some of the stuff I loved about the novel is missing, the film doesn't suffer for it. Best film of the series to this point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XF2ZM4P8LUDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00271DNP4#wasThisHelpful","R2XF2ZM4P8LUDC","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who knew that those old Church hymns such as ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"" or ""Bringing in the Sheaves"" could send chills of terror up your spine?""The Night of The Hunter"" is a fantastic film, chock for a atmosphere, chills, thrills and one of Robert Mitchum's greatest performances as psychopathic preacher Reverend Harry Powell. As the film opens we see a group of children playing hide and seek when one of the kid's stumbles upon a woman's body shoved into a cellar. We then meet the murderer, the ""Reverend"", as he's talking to God, already on the lookout for his next victim, targeting young widows. The ""Reverend"" spends some time in the local jail for car theft, and his cell mate happens to be a young man about to hung for the murder of two bank clerks that he shot in the middle of robbery. The Reverend soon learns that the man made off with $10,000 from the robbery, and that he's left a young wife behind, and two children, and the killer now knows who his next victim will be.There is so much to enjoy about this film, from the stark black and white photography, lit and shot for maximum atmosphere, to the haunting soundtrack. But honestly, this movie is worth the price of admission for Robert Mitchum. The menace just drips off the screen making Harry Powell one of the greatest villains in movie history. Charles Laughton's direction is fantastic, it's really a shame this was his only film behind the camera. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQUS5HLR05WMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZYU3U0#wasThisHelpful","RQUS5HLR05WMF","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will say that the first 5 minutes of this film had me hooked. Two hillbilly delivery guys delivering toxic materials riding along a country road, hit a deer and container of their poisonous goo falls into a small, beaver infested lake. We then meet three girls on a weekend country getaway...and the film starts to go downhill. It's usual horror movie set-up where the girls are soon joined by their boyfriends at the rustic cabin, and the next thing you know, zombie beavers are attacking.I'm normally a big fan of stupid. I willingly admit, I enjoy more than a fair share of those lame Syfy movies, and with a little editing, ""Zombeavers"" could almost go into steady rotation with ""Snakehead Terror"" and ""Lavalantula"". Where the film loses me, is the supposedly ""clever"" dialogue, which just.......doesn't........stop. The jokes fall flat, and the dialogue feels like the writer sat down and reach a bunch of ""witty"" comments on Facebook and incorporated them into the film. Even at just over an hour and 10 minutes, this film feels drawn out, and exceedingly dull.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D0DF0J62SJXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZARI64#wasThisHelpful","R1D0DF0J62SJXM","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the second installment in the Harry Potter film series, we get a nice bump in the visual F/X, and a story with a bit more edge than ""Sorcerer's Stone"". Unfortunately, some of the best elements of the novel, and from the first film are left out. Again, I want to state that if you are only familiar with the world of Harry Potter because of the films, you are really missing out. J.K. Rowling packs so much into each installment, it would be impossible for any film to capture it all, and some of the greatest bits of the novels don't make it onto film.As we pick up Harry's story, he's trapped with his abusive ""muggle"" family waiting to return to Hogwarts. We learn that Harry has been pretty much cut off from the wizarding world thanks in part to his nasty Uncle, but also in large part to a small house elf named Dobby. The small creature is doing his best to protect Harry from returning to Hogwarts in fear that Harry's life is in danger. With the help of the Weasley's, Harry is soon back in Hogwarts ready to start classes again. It's not long before students are found petrified, and bloody messages are written on the walls proclaiming the ""Heir of Slytherian"" has opened the Chamber of Secrets, and has unleashed the monster that resides there.There are some really fun scenes here, and a few that will make the goosebumps pop (Ron and Harry in the forest!!!!), and the story is a bit more complex this time around. The special F/X are top notch in this entry, and the CGI work, specifically on Dobby, is fantastic. While I really wish they could've squeezed in more scenes with Alan Rickman's Professor Snape, I did thoroughly enjoy Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart. This was Richard Harris' last film and while Dumbledore doesn't play a large part in the film, it was a nice send off to a great actor. Finally, Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy is wonderfully evil. Isaacs was born to play this role (and almost every bad guy...ever! Would love to see him in a James Bond villain role?!), and he steals every scene he's in.Really good film, and the series only gets better from here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H80LUSB0TAPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002DQDV6Y#wasThisHelpful","R1H80LUSB0TAPR","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I want to start this review by saying that if you are only familiar with the film versions of ""Harry Potter"" and have not read the original novels by J.K. Rowling, before you push play on this DVD, pick up a copy of the novel and read it before watching this film, or any film in the series. Yes, I like this movie just fine, but Rowling packs so much into each of her novels, and so little of her rich storytelling actually makes it onscreen, you're missing out on quite a bit if you've skipped the novels.With that said, I'm not sure that I really need to go into the plot of this film? I think that ""Harry Potter"" and his story have entered the public consciousness in the same way that other films like ""Jaws"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" have. People know the story even if they've never cracked a page or seen a flicker of the films. This first film tackles Harry's first year a Hogwart's School of Wizardry and Witchcraft, we meet Harry's friends and foes, and see Harry adjusting to life as a young wizard.The special F/X are a mixed bag, at points capturing the wonder and feel of real magic, but at other times, the CGI work is pretty poor, and it feels cartoon-y (the troll attack and the centaur Firenze looking especially poor). But the setting, the castle, the Quidditch scenes all look great. If you're a fan of the novel, you'll probably like what they've included in the film. The cast is pitch perfect, in particular Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. His menace just oozes off the screen.I guess what it really comes down to for me, is what is left out of this film. The real character development, the friendship between Ron, Hermione and Harry. In a novel as packed as ""The Sorcerer's Stone"", I fully understand the film makers dilemma of wondering what to include, but this film feels like they were so concerned with hitting key points from book, that they've forgotten to develop the characters. While the film does capture some of the wonder of Rowling's material, it lacks the heart. I wonder what this movie could've been if someone like Steven Spielberg had been behind the camera?","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2751GHTEYJ8G0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002DQLGHU#wasThisHelpful","R2751GHTEYJ8G0","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We usually have a big 4th of July party every year, and I like to make sure there are lots of things to do for my yard full of guests. When the kids were little, it was easy, hook up the sprinkler or the slip n' slide and for the adults it was usually horseshoes, ladder ball and a cooler full of beer. Not much has changed really, I guess the kids have outgrown the sprinkler (but probably not the slip n' slide?) so I've been looking for new and different things to try. I saw this hook and ring game and thought, that might provide a little distraction (especially combined with the cooler full of beer), and it does the trick....for a short while. We had a bonfire the other night, and I saw several people stop to give the game a try, and I would say at one point in the evening almost everyone gave the ring a toss or two, but they quickly lost interest. It's actually pretty difficult to get the ring on the hook!! It probably didn't help that it was almost 95 degrees out and pretty humid, so that even swinging in a hammock could make you sweat.

"I'm really glad I""ve decided to go back and re-read the ""Harry Potter"" series. It's been years since I had first read these novels, and I was hoping that they were as fun and imaginative as I remembered. With the film adaptations, which I'm very familiar with, you forget all of the little things in the novel which never made it onto the silver screen, and for that reason alone, you should make sure you read Rowling's series and not be content with the films alone.""The Chamber of Secrets"" features Harry's second year at Hogwarts School, but getting to the school in the first place seems to be a challenge, with both magical and mundane obstacles out to stop the young wizard. As the school year begins, someone or something is attacking students, seeming to pick on wizards born to ""muggle"" families specifically. Because of his fame, and his history, suspicion soon falls on Harry, and he must prove his innocence and stop the attacks before someone dies.With ""Chamber of Secrets"" Rowling proves that she is more than a flash-in-the-pan, and that her imagination is astounding. From the ""Headless Hunt"" on Halloween, to pruning the garden gnomes, to a forest full of nasty spiders, fantastic images and passages drip off every page. And not only does Rowling provide a fun and imaginative ride, she writes it so well, building on the foundation of her first novel, and expanding her magical universe in a way that pulls in readers of all ages.Captivating, full of wonderful characters, scary monsters, and at times a wonderfully morbid sense of humor, ""Chamber of Secrets"" is a fantastic novel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16PJRTJBYYSS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0439064872#wasThisHelpful","R16PJRTJBYYSS6","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I knew little to nothing about this novel when I pulled it up on my Kindle. I had heard of the title, but I think that was in relation to the movie (which I've never seen?). I have to say that I was hooked almost immediately, as I like this style of narrative. Like Fannie Flagg's ""Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Caf"". ""Water for Elephants"" is told through a series of flashbacks by the elderly narrator, and one of my favorite writing styles is where I'm reading, but being told a story by the narrator.As the novel opens we are witness to a ""murder"" and a horrible ""accident"" under a circus big top. We then meet 93 year old Jacob, a former veterinarian who is having a difficult time getting used to life in a retirement home. The entire home is abuzz due to a circus arriving in town. Jacob soon begins to recall his youth, and the time spent as vet on the Benzini Brothers traveling circus.Jacob's times spent with Benzini and the people who run and worked that show will pull you right in. This is the first Sara Guren novel I've read, but it won't be the last. She creates wonderful characters, that you both love...and hate.

Actions such as strap a set of electrodes onto your head and onto your neighbor's head, and they have to choose whether to shock themselves or their neighbor.

"When it comes to recommending this series, I really have to say it depends on the person I'm speaking to. ""Sons of Anarchy"" is a gritty and brutal TV show, with shocking scenes of violence and for a television show, quite a bit of sex. With that said, it also features some of the best characters I've seen on TV this side of 'Breaking Bad"", and several episodes that are edge-of-your-seat nailbiters.The Sons of Anarchy are a motorcycle gang that operates out of the small California town of Charming. Through the series we follow Jax Teller, the son of one of the club's founders as he's making his way through the ranks of the club. His step-father is the current president as the show opens, and his mother, Gemma, is the de-facto den mother to the whole club. As the series progresses we see that Jax is determined, like his father, to get the Sons away from the outlaw activity they've gotten pulled into over the years. Jax wants a better life for his family, but extracting the club from the criminal activity is much trickier than he knows.Power struggles from within and from without the club, rival gangs, the local cops, the federal government, and even the IRA all have some sort of claim on the Sons. Watching Jax try to maneuver through this minefield, all while dealing with the various personalities in his club makes for fascinating viewing.I know that the show's star is supposed to be Charlie Hunnam's character Jax, but I have to say that the reason I kept turning back in was to see what Gemma (Katey Sagal) was going to do in each episode. Gemma is that rare TV character, like ""Walter White"", where despite their despicable actions, you still like them. Ron Perlman as ""Clay Morrow"" is another huge reason I recommend the show. There is just something so charismatic about Perlman and his character, you get pulled in one episode after the next. The acting across the board is first rate, as you get to know the club members, you really begin to like so many characters. And I have to say that ""Sons of Anarchy"" doesn't pull any punches with the fates of it's characters, there are certain episodes where you'll sit with your jaw on the floor, and a tear in your eye when the end credits roll.The only thing holding me back from a full 5 star rating is there are two seasons which hurt the overall story. During the 3rd season, the club gets stuck over in Ireland for a large chunk of the show. Taking the club out of Charming just didn't feel right, and having them roaming the Irish landscape with the IRA just didn't click for me. And I have to ding the show for the final season. Without providing spoilers, they basically turned the entire core premise of the first six seasons on it's ear, and it dragged on a few episodes too long.This is a compelling show, full of unforgettable characters, and definitely worth checking out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17564CLP4F549/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S9S12ES#wasThisHelpful","R17564CLP4F549","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm honestly not sure how many times I've watched this film, a few dozen since my first viewing in the theater probably? I love this movie, it has everything you could want, great action, extremely quotable, a cool synth heavy 80's score, great F/X, and Schwarzenegger at his physical peak.Does anyone really need a plot synopsis of this film? I can't imagine there are too many people new to this series or story, and even someone seeing this film for the first time probably already knows the basic idea. Mankind is nearly wiped out in the future by machines, but a leader emerges that unites the survivors to fight back against the machines. In order to stop this leader the machines send back a terminator, a robot designed specifically to kill a specific target, in this case the leader's mother, Sarah Conner. The human send back someone as well, someone to protect Sarah from the mechanized killer.I think what I like best about this film, is that it's a sci-fi film wrapped up in the trappings of an 80's slasher horror film. When you get down to it, there are very few differences between The Terminator and Jason Voorhees. And unlike later entries in this series, there is still a grit here, it's not all shiny and glossy. This is another 80's classic, and one you should definitely add to your collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIV2PGFJ564G0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005N5S5#wasThisHelpful","RIV2PGFJ564G0","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I honestly don't know what I could say in a review of this novel that hasn't been said already, and judging by the overwhelming number of 5 star reviews posted here, it's easy to see this is one of the most loved books you can find on this site. I've decided to re-visit the world of ""Harry Potter"" for the second time, specifically to re-read all of the novels in order to see if they still hold their magic all these years later, and if my rating is any indication, the first story is as good, if not better the second time through.I won't bother with a plot summary as I think this story is so well known, it's like ""Huck Finn"", ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" or ""Carrie"". The story simply entered the public consciousness that I would figure even people who've never read the books or seen the movies could still tell you the basics of the story. With that said, you are really doing yourself a disservice if you skip this book and only watch the film adaptation. ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" is so jam packed with imagination, and fun little detail, I truly think you could read and reread this tale several times, and pick up something new with each reading. J.K. Rowling not only creates wonderful, lovable and horrible characters, but she also builds an amazing world to place them in. I was so impressed with the work Rowling built for her story, and upon this reading, I was fascinated to see all of the little things she drops into her first novel which play a much bigger role in the whole story, right from the beginner, the building blocks are in place for the larger tale, and it's really fun to go back and pick up on the clues she's sprinkled around.There's are good reason this novel, and this story captured the world's attention, and if you are reading it for the first time (I'm envious of you), or for the 50th time, you are going to have a great time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGZ4I6QU1KXQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=059035342X#wasThisHelpful","RGZ4I6QU1KXQ7","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had no clue that this movie/mini-series even existed? Flipping around Netflix I stumbled onto it, and figured it was a remake of the Drew Barrymore film, so I popped it on. I didn't realize until it started rolling that I was looking a 3 hour film viewing. Apparently this was a mini-series for the SyFy channel back in the early 2000's, that most likely explains why it flew under my radar. As a big Stephen King fan, I'm usually on top of any made-for-tv or theatrical films made which are based on his work. But once SyFy canceled MST3K, they kind of dropped out of notice.""Firestarter 2-Rekindled"" is a remake in a way, but it falls more into the sequel territory. They do re-tell the McGee's story through flashbacks, and the expand a bit about what the Shop was doing with Lot 6, so if you aren't familiar with the original film or King's novel, you can get caught up to speed pretty quickly. As this film opens though Charlie is in her 20's and has been hiding from the various agencies and people that want to study/capture her. A young man who thinks he's tracking down people to help settle an old lawsuit has inadvertently been tracking down the survivors of the old Lot 6 experiment, and he manages to track down Charlie. John Rainbird, the assassin from the first film survived the events of Charlie's run-in with the Shop, and he's expanded his role to caring for several ""special"" children, each with a unique power or ability. Rainbird wants to use Charlie to demonstrate the abilities of his new children.While not exactly good, ""Firestarter 2"" isn't horrible either. The cast is really good with Dennis Hopper & Malcolm McDowell chewing up scenery. The F/X are about on par with your typical SyFy film, lots of CGI flames, but again it's watchable. The story is also kind of fun as it plays out like ""Firestarter vs. X-Men Babies"". The film lacks any real punch or excitement, but it never really drags either. I would say give it a view if you have nothing better to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but doubt I would buy the DVD for repeated viewings.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLCMN8F5MS4F8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006CXH0#wasThisHelpful","RLCMN8F5MS4F8","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you love 80's horror movies, like I do, you'll probably enjoy ""Survive the Night"". It has all of the tropes of a classic slasher, with a variety of stereotypes getting offed while enjoying a rave in an abandoned NYC subway tunnel.Casey, a one-time soccer champ is just getting out of rehab after dealing with a nasty pain pill addiction. Casey tells her parents that she's going over to her former soccer teammate's house for a sleepover, but soon after her father leaves, Casey's ""real"" friends show up. Julie, Aya and their leader Shana leave with Casey to go into the city to watch Casey's ex-boyfriend play a gig. While at the club, Casey begins to think back on her actions, and her stint in rehab. She regrets how she her relationship with her boyfriend ended, and she's not too sure hanging with Shana and her friends is the best thing to do so quickly after getting clean. The night's events get amped up a notch when the group goes in search of an epic rave they've heard about, a ""Survive the Night"" rave, which won't end, and participants are unable to leave until the following morning. Once the group find the rave, it's not long before people begin turning up dead, and the survivors learn that something is stalking them through the mold covered tunnels.I have to say, ""Survive the Night"" threw me a few twists, I won't spoil anything here, but what at first appears to be a straight ahead slasher, becomes something else about 3/4 of the way through. The characters aren't developed very well beyond Casey and Shana, but if you're a genre fan, then that's nothing new. ""Survive the Night"" is a quick read, and it's pretty enjoyable if you just want something quick and nasty.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33DAPH7B9AI14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595147241#wasThisHelpful","R33DAPH7B9AI14","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was never a big fan of this movie and I wasn't quite sure why? My wife on the other hand loves it and while flipping around the channels looking for something to watch, we happened across this film, and showed it to our kids. I'm pretty sure that everyone knows the plot of this one, and it's entered the public consciousness, but just in case there are a few cave dwellers out there.An obnoxious voice-over artist gets fired from his latest job, and travels over to his kids' school to pick them up so that he can throw his 12-year old son a birthday party, even though his son has been told by their mother, that no party's are allowed. The party soon gets out of hand with petting zoo animals running wild, loud music and police arriving to shut everything down. The mom arrives home in time to see kids literally swinging from the chandeliers, and horses roaming through her living room. She is so furious with her oblivious husband she demands a divorce. Instead of learning anything from his wife or the experience, the actor pouts and places all of the blame on the mother. Being without a job and without a decent place for the kids to live, the actor loses custody of the kids. And unless he can prove that he can hold down a job, then his visitation will be restricted. The mother, needing some help with the kids and house, puts an ad in the paper for a housekeeper. Her now ex-husband sabotages the add, and answers the add himself, dressed in an old woman disguise.I think some age has put into perspective why I never really liked this film. Robin Williams' ""Daniel"" is a horrible person, just completely unlikable. He's a jerk, he's rude, he's awful to the people around him, and he honestly doesn't care. As the film opens we see him wasting thousands of dollars by refusing to stay on script while voicing a cartoon, he the proceeds to throw his wife under the bus by throwing a huge party trashing their house, and then whines when she says she's had enough. Then, instead of securing a job and finding an apartment, he belittles his case worker, refused to clean up his house, and talks trash about his ex-wife to the kids. Then instead of sucking it up, and getting on with his life, he deceives his entire family by showing up in disguise, and then tries to manipulate each of the kids and his ex by insulting the new boyfriend of the mother. Daniel tries to sabotage the relationship at every turn. And, if all of that weren't bad enough, when Daniel does find a new job at the local TV station stockroom, he manages to destroy the career of a long-time TV host by trashing the host's show to the station manager. Daniel deserves none of the good things that happen to him over the course of this film, he's a horrible, manipulative person.With that said, there are some laughs throughout. Williams' does a fantastic job of bringing the titular character to life, and Sally Field is always fun to watch, it's just a shame she's stuck on one-note for most of the film. Pierce Brosnan doesn't get much to do here but play the generic handsome love interest. If ""Daniel"" were played by someone with less charm than Robin Williams, then this film would be unwatchable, but thanks to the manic energy and humor Williams brings to the role, you can't help but get a smile or two.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHRO6139LRLKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QQLVPQ#wasThisHelpful","RHRO6139LRLKA","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've just finished reading ""The Talisman"" for the third time. The first was when it was first published, the second when ""Black House"" came out in 2001 and just now as I'm going through King's stories in chronological order, and with each reading I find something new to take away from this collaboration with Peter Straub, and once again I'm reminded why ""The Talisman"" is one of my favorite novels as the story is so compelling and imaginative.Jack Sawyer, a 12-year old boy is taken by his mother, Lily to the off-season beach of Arcadia in New Hampshire. Lily is dying, and she wants to pass in peace, away from her late husband's pushy business partner, Morgan Sloat. Morgan has been harassing Lily about signing over her husband's share of their talent agency. Jack, having very little to do in the nearly deserted resort spends his days roaming around the hotel or the local arcade. While killing some time in the arcade, Jack meets Speedy Parker, and old man that refers to the boy as ""Traveling Jack"", a nickname Jack's father also called him. Speedy seems to re-awaken memories in Jack, memories of a ""daydream"" land, a place called the Territories.Jack soon learns that this mystical place is real, and that he has the ability to flip between our world and the Territories. Speedy tells Jack that the boy can save his mother, and also the dying Queen of the Territories, if must go on a quest for ""the Talisman"". And object of immense power that lies on the Western Coast beyond the ""blasted lands"" in the Territories. But the Quest is not an easy one as not everyone wants the Queen to be saved, and they will stop at nothing to make sure Jack fails in his quest.Populated with wonderful characters, from a companion werewolf, to a murderous TV evangelist, to ghostly knights, ""The Talisman"" features something for everyone. There are strong parallels to King's ""Dark Tower"" novels, but it wasn't until ""Dark House"" that we actually see a definite tie-in. I will say that if you are interested in King's ""Gunslinger"" series, but worried about jumping into an eight novel commitment, give ""The Talisman"" a read first. If you like this story, you will most likely enjoy King's epic tale as this novel feels like a condensed version of that much bigger tale (with a much more satisfying ending to boot!).Great novel, and I almost wish King & Straub had revisited the Territories more often through the years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16PLD0K9P6V3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=145169721X#wasThisHelpful","R16PLD0K9P6V3C","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether or not you enjoy this film comes down to whether or not you like Musical Westerns? Yes, the entire cast of the film is comprised of little people, but honestly that novelty wears off after about 10 minutes, and ""Terror of Tiny Town"" becomes a by-the-numbers 1930's western.Two ranchers are heading toward a range war when an outlaw begins playing the two cattle barons against each other. The outlaw is stealing cattle from both ranches, but framing the neighboring rancher for the theft. Standing in the way of the war are two lovers from opposites ranches who are trying to find out who is at the bottom of the cattle rustling and why.Filled with some quirky little tunes (""Mister Jack and Missus Jill"" is an earworm you'll find yourself humming all day), and some bizarre visuals; cowboys walking into the saloon under the batwing doors, cowpokes riding Shetland ponies, little people toting around huge mugs of beer and standard size six shooters.I enjoyed the movie, it clocks in at just over an hour, and as someone who grew up on westerns, I still have a love of the genre, but if you don't really like this type of film even when it's played straight, you probably still won't care for this film even with the novelty approach.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NUKO6I3XZTP3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000784XL2#wasThisHelpful","R1NUKO6I3XZTP3","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I normally lug my winter clothes downstairs, stuff them in either trash bags or use an old plastic tub when the weather starts hitting 60 degrees regularly, and I repeat the process every September when it's time to store my summer clothes.

"I really wanted to like this movie, and it does pull you in within the first 5 minutes, but it quickly goes downhill from there.As the film opens we meet a DJ who's hosting a New Year's Eve rock-a-thon on TV, she is celebrating the New Year across the US Time Zones, and as her show gets underway, she begins taking calls. The second phone call she gets is from a guy she calls ""the Phantom"", who is using an amazing voice disguiser. The Phantom promises to kill someone on the hour through the night, until he can finally kill the DJ at Midnight, local time. We are then treated to a bunch of scenes of the killer as he wanders 1980's Los Angeles looking for women to kill.This isn't scary, and it's not the so-bad-it's-good kind of flick that you can sit and laugh at. There are moments, like when the Phantom uses the kazoo thing to hide his voice where you'll get a chuckle, but those scenes are way too few and far between. For the most part it looks like a bunch of extras off the set of Magnum PI that got together to make a horror film.I will give the movie and extra star for the soundtrack, which I'm going to see if I can hunt down, but beyond that, this is a dull, bloodless slasher.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WLYAK0GHO9JF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9UVB5Y#wasThisHelpful","R2WLYAK0GHO9JF","A34IBXM7E8CPWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34IBXM7E8CPWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can hear the influence of a lot of 90's rock in Cinder Road, with flourishes of Soundgarden & Pearl Jam, mixed into a classic road sound gives the band a unique sound, and you'll be hooked by the 2nd tune on the disk.If you want to check out the band by downloading a tune before picking up the disk, I highly recommend ""Sex Savage"", the 2nd tune on the disk. It's catchy as hell, and you will instantly be pulled into the song.

"Wonderful book for anyone be they Christian or Jew. I love knowing all the background of the Feast. As the Rabbi goes thru each food on the seder meal I was able to make the Christian meaning and fulfillment of each item. It is a very faith building book and is central to Christians. I study all I can on my Jewish roots as a Christian. The preparation for the seder starts 30 days before with the removal of every crumb of leaven from the house. Leaven is symbolic of sin for Christians. It is thought that this cleaning in the Spring for Passover is where ""Spring Cleaning"" comes from.Everything has a reason and represents an event that needs to be remembered. Passover is one of God's seven feasts that we are commanded to keep forever. Jesus was celebrating Passover on the Night we call the Last Supper. I learned so much like why the Jewish people no longer offer animal sacrifices. I know why Christians don't as Jesus was the final sacrifice. They no longer do because the temple was destroyed that is why there is just a lamb shank bone on the seder plate with no meat.Reading this book has made communion different for me. Knowing how Jesus celebrated and what he did for me that last Passover he celebrated makes it even more deeply moving. I see how very important it is to search out the sin in my heart before taking the symbols of his sacrifice. I highly recommend this book. I understand more of what it means to be Jewish now. I have a love of Israel and the Jewish people Gods chosen ones.This book was a spiritual experience for me kind of hard to put into words. It really is a must read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YKEV1FLK9IVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426791569#wasThisHelpful","R1YKEV1FLK9IVT","AJQDIT55SZ3ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJQDIT55SZ3ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I will be getting a new laptop within the year I hope so I will love it being even faster. The unit is so small about half the size of my Samsung phone and very light weight. It allows you to set up password protection so your data is safe. The unit gets slightly warm while it is plugged into the computer and you are downloading.I like the easy interface of this unit. I can look up a file quickly. I look forward to using it to transfer these files to new computer when the time comes. You don't have to be a computer whiz to use this storage unit.

"I have used this product for a few years in the granular form. It works and the smell is actually pleasant. I witnessed today how very well it works. I put it all along my back fence and above it truns the telephone line. Squirrels come and run that line all yhe time which causes the two dogs next door to bark constantly,  gets old fast. I was looking out and saw a squirl run the line and stop dead in his tracks when he hit my property.  I got my camera and did an 80 x zoom and he was sniffing and did not move forward. I let my dog out to see if he would run forward, nope turned around and went back into woods. Yay. I get skunks, raccoons,  deer, I think I have moles too. Very happy to keep them out of yard.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJA6ROLCYAHOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009QAPT24#wasThisHelpful","RJA6ROLCYAHOX","AJQDIT55SZ3ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJQDIT55SZ3ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sturdy little workhorse.  The unit is very durable. I used it the car first, it was sitting on the garage floor and kept falling over every move I made, very aggravating.  Then I stool holding it with my feet and it was fine. The suction is strong and cleaned the car well. I am disappointed in the length of the power cord as I had to use extension cord. I used it in the dry mode. I continued to use it all over the garage and was pleased with the results. The only thing it didn't work so well on was an astro turf rug I guess it was a making contact issue.It comes with a limited 5 year warranty which is great. Will be very useful in garage and for car.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BQCHUDJXTWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9M3K1I#wasThisHelpful","R1BQCHUDJXTWG","AJQDIT55SZ3ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJQDIT55SZ3ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Withe the space between the neck and top of apron it really lookes like headless Elsa no your head on her body, kinda errie. The rubberised application of Elsa is plealed off at every fold so it looks old right out of the bag. The quality of the apron is fine the black material is sturdy.

"Very unhappy doesn't work and Amazon will not take it back and send a new one. The Fire TV customer service even said it doesn't work in all HDMI ports. Right out of the box it took 30 mins to fuss and get it to work. When you do get something to play like Sling TV get interested in a show it just goes black. It is not my internet as tablet and laptop are fine. My HDMI ports work fine with DVD players. I got it free with 3 months prepaid for Sling TV but it is money lost as I cannot use Sling without the fire tv stick working. Was going to get Roku but this value seemed better, not so. 1 year warranty I have had just 36 hours and they will only switch out one part at a time. I said well at least I have Prime ship it fast.

"This is so well made and will provide hours of creativity for children 2 yrs and up. I think most 20 month olds will be able to do it as well. The pieces are too big for going into the mouth and being a choking hazard. The only hazzard I see is if all the pieces are off and the child falls on it but that can be said about anything. Children this age are hopefully not playing unsupervised anyway. I love toys that are made to stimulate the imagination.  I can see this being used for counting as well in older say 3 to 4 yr olds. Would make a great gift as it is not so commonly seen in stores.

You simply go to the Google Play store and download the Omron fitness app. Then make sure the pedometer is on and pair it with the app, really fast. Now I can just look at my phone and see my steps and calories burned. I am using it with a Samsung Galaxy S lll phone and it is workinh great. It is compatible with iphone as well. Love the daily graph that shows hour by hour how much I have walked. It truly is an incentive to go just a bit further each day. I am in the process of losing weight and it's a great tool.

Looks like a little mantel like it belongs in a playhouse. I'm going to use it in my finished basement where my exercise bike is. Now cannot say it is too cold down there. Very good just to heat the area you are occupying at the moment. Be sure to not leave it unattended or where children can get close it does get hot unlike my floor model. It is well made, metal not plastic, well most of it at least. The top doesn't get too hot I will put a little framed picture on it.

I'm talking cleaning tops of picture frames glass on the picture frames window seals things that don't get done every couple of days.

I will say the scent is not bad but the aerosol caused me some coughing from asthma.  It does warn not to spray close to face and I didn't but it did cause a problem.  I will use this when I can spray outdoors before swimming I can have some spray my back. You spray in hands then apply to face avoiding eyes.

"I have a pair of these I got about 10 years ago they cut up to 1 inch thickness and have been great. These are a fantastic upgrade. They cut up to 2 inch thick branches and my yard was in desperate need of them. As we get older always looking for garden tools to make the job easier. These are non stick and carry a lifetime warranty. They are very sturdy and cut through wood just about like a knife thru butter. The very thick branches take a few more ratcheting cuts but the effort is small.  The orange stripes are helpful as well when you lay them down in the yard they are easy to spot.

It tells your steps, calories burned, aerobic steps, miles walked and current time. It resets at midnight and you can look back at previous days data.

"I am setting aside my personal taste preferences here. I eat 85 % dark chocolate usually so I am not afraid of the bitterness. This chocolate and coffee is so strong on the coffee it was bitter and unpleasant to me. I however pressed on and evaluated it for quality. The chocolate is smooth and very high quality no problem there the coffee tastes like expresso to me very strong. I usually love anything called Mocha this I did not. It would be unfair to rate it bad due to my likes. I had a few others taste these and they got rave reviews. So if you like strong coffee you will like this. If like me Mocha means a milder coffee with cream kinda taste then perhaps not. I do wish they came with nutritional information. I checked the website but couldn't find it  you must have to call them. I decided not to call and find out.I was surprised they just come lose not wrapped in plastic but they arrived in perfect shape.

I have dropped the phone a few times and not even a mark on the case this is the kind of protection I was looking for. I also love purple so it makes it look super cool.

"This blender makes a wonderful smooth protein shake. I have also made a slushy lime drink and it had no trouble getting the ice into a consistent smooth slush. I do have one thing I dislike there is a space between the lip and the lids pop up lip that liquid spurts out when running on the 4th speed even when making a 12 ounce shake. The lid only fits in one exact spot and is closed there is just a gap. I know I have to hold my finger over it now. It has cord storage under the unit which I like. There are 5 speeds if you count auto which varies as it determines the need. There is a pulse mode as well. The container sits firm on the base during use. It is too tall yo sit under my kitchen cabinets so the pitcher has to go into the cabinet not a deal breaker for me but to some it may be check your measurements if that matters to you. Overall I like this blender a lot especially since my diet protein shakes made with ice are as smooth as a milkshake. I do recommend this unit.

"There was no warning posted on website that people with Kidney Disease should not use this without first consulting physician.  I had washed and dried the pitcher and was waiting out the long procedure of running 2 pitchers of water thru to activate the filter so I was reading the rest of the manual and under important notes it states if you have kidney disease talk to your doctor before use due to the potassium that is added about like a banana per liter. I drink 2 to 3 liters a day per doctor order he would never allow 3 bananas a day.The pour spout lid also falls off mine. It takes a long time to get it full then it is quite heavy to lift and just barely fits in my side door of the fridge. It is very nice looking I will give it that. I did just taste a sip of the water and it still has tap water taste not as good as my pur faucet filter, guess I will be staying with that.Because of the lack of health warning Amazon is graciously taking it back which I appreciate.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJQKWY4OMB3RZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KPKS26#wasThisHelpful","RJQKWY4OMB3RZ","AJQDIT55SZ3ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJQDIT55SZ3ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are so many features with this phone I have not used all of them yet but with ATT you would be paying big bucks for all these things. I have not imported my number yet as I am still in the evaluation stage. You can pick your number from ones in your area code, city or state. I liked picking a number easy to remember. You can add a second line free as well. The plans and costs are a bit hard to actually figure what you will be paying. I saw $8.33 a month and thought yay then I see that is prepaid for a year plus taxes. It looks like you can get a 2 yr contract and pay around $15 plus tax a month, or go month to month for $20 or so. When you sign up you get a $79.00 credit to your account so that helps making the unit free.it looks like I will be staying with the service and importing my number as my ATT bill keeps going up. Hate to give up the land line as I like being able to call when power is out with my old rotary phone but then there is the cell phone backup. If the cell towers are down we have more to worry about anyway. I have 3 months to fully evaluate so I will retutn with an update. I want to learn how to send my calls to my cell when not at home and start blocking numbers that pester me. At this time I took off 1 star as the humming is on local calls if that stops then it will be 5 stars.customer service has been great you get a real person. I was having trouble with my international call and they even tried the call on their ATT land line. The trouble was the number I was given by my friend now that it is vorrect there is no problem. The ability to call England free is wonderful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AEH88O9G9GIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D30Y9CE#wasThisHelpful","R2AEH88O9G9GIX","AJQDIT55SZ3ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJQDIT55SZ3ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm very early in the process and so far, as someone who has never tried to grow anything,  I love it.  So very easy.  No figuring out what pots, soils, plant foods, etc.October 19 - Item arrived and was set up at around 6-7 pm. The quick start guide was all that was necessary as set up is super easy.  You can unbox and have your pods planted within minutes.  Fill with water, place pods according to the guide (shorter plant in front, taller in the back and middle), add the amount of nutrients it tells you to.  Done.October 22 around 11 am - I looked and found a itty bitty baby sprout on the Thai Basil.  So not even three full days for the first sign of life.  So far so good.  Next update will be when I notice the next plant sprouting or in about a week, whichever comes first.October 23 - Checked in in the evening.  Thai Basil about doubled it's baby sprout.  The Genovese Basil has now also sprouted.October 25 - Dill sprouted.October 26 - Thai Basil and Dill had their domes removed.October 28 - Mint sprouted.October 31 - looks like Cilantro and Curly Parsley are starting to sprout.November 1 - Pruned the dill as it was closing in on the lights which I am not ready to lift due to the other baby sprouts.  I also had enough faith in this to order more pods (lettuce, tomatoes, and peppers).Nov 2 - Light came on asking to add nutrients.Nov 3 - Cilantro dome came off.Nov 9 - Curly Parsley dome finally came off.

"Battery:  Mine arrived at 74% full according to the app screen battery reading.  It's a CR2032, for those who wonder about replacements.Advantages:  This thermometer is fast.  Way faster than the current digital thermometer we have.  Seems to be accurate.  Because there is an app attached to it, you can easily keep track of your temps, symptoms, etc. Works with the iPhone health app.Disadvantages: There is no display on the thermometer itself.  Wondering how much battery life is left?  Grab your phone, turn the thermometer on, go into the settings menu to find out.  Need to take a temp quick?  Grab your phone, choose a profile (if you haven't set one up and want to track your temps, then create the profile), then turn on the thermometer.Overall:  Fast fast fast temp readings.  If you don't mind having to have your phone handy when you want to take your temp then it's fine.

"So basically you should ignore all of the miraculous claims you might see about belts like this.  You won't lose weight.  You won't magically have a 6-pack.  You will feel your muscles working.  I gave it a shot because I'm pretty limited on what workouts I can do.  I'd started hula hooping just before getting this and figured it couldn't hurt.  I so definitely feel the muscles contracting as I use this.  I can get through about 3/4 of the settings so far.  You won't really feel it unless you start out at level 20-25 at least.Should you buy it?  Mixed feelings. If you're already doing some form of exercise but aren't very fit yet, it can't to add this to the mix.  If you're already pretty fit and exercising, you probably don't need this. If you're not doing anything?  This will keep those muscles active but it won't help you to get fit.Keep in mind you'll need to buy replacement gel pads every few months, so the cost of the belt isn't the final cost associated with regular usage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4LRMF1QX4VB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0YTB1K#wasThisHelpful","R4LRMF1QX4VB9","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:25 Mins I've included a video to show you my personal experience with leakage (which is none).  It is a larger bottle than most personal sized infusers (to go larger you may need to move into pitcher territory).  The infuser itself is large enough for a bottle of this size.  The part of the lid that opens (via push button and a latch both) has a small extended piece that fits perfectly into the drinking spout and seems to prevent leaks.  My only complaint with this bottle is that the lid for the infuser section and the hinge both feel a bit cheap compared to the rest of the bottle.  I guess I'll see how long it holds up.Although I personally haven't experienced leaks, if you are carrying this or any liquids in bags with electronics and other valuables, I'd recommend storing the bottle in something like a small wet/dry bag just in case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WM5C92JJPIJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZUAQB9Y#wasThisHelpful","R2WM5C92JJPIJ0","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I have to give this a middle of the road review as there are two of us in the house.  One loves it (me) and one doesn't (the hubby).  My hubby has virtually no sense of smell.  He can handle a litter box that went one day too long and not smell it at all.  So this was mostly for my sake.  One of the few scents he can smell is Ozium air freshener.  To him, this smells like the cousin of Ozium.  To me, someone who can actually smell normally, this smells lovely (after you let it sit and mellow for just a few seconds - it can be strong at first).I doubt this would be some sort of miracle if you have serious toilet odor issues. It's more like preemptively spraying the air freshener right at the source.  I find that a couple of sprays in the toilet as you're leaving the bathroom keeps the scent nice and light fairly constantly.Not perfect and not a scent for everyone.

"So this pillow arrive in a cylinder zipped plastic bag.  I am amazed they got it in the bag at all.  I struggled to get the pillow out.  Finally a mix of pulling at the pillow while rolling the bag down allowed it to be freed.  Any of these pillows that arrive in any kind of packaging need to sort of fluffed and sat out to get to their full pillow shape (when I bought one at a bedding store, they recommended stepping on it even).  After being in such a tight package, once freed it looked a bit bigger than a queen and a lot flatter.  If your looks like that, don't panic.  While they say up to 12 hours, it generally takes a few minutes of real fluffing / beating your pillow up for it to get into its pillow shape.  I was a little worried this wouldn't fit in my queen pillowcase - it did, but just barely.  Feels a bit squishier to me than my pretty solid memory foam pillow.  Quite comfortable.  Not so sure about keeping your cooler or lessening your migraines.  It's pretty hot here and I didn't notice a change with this pillow.  With memory foam pillows all you can really do is look at the price and the comfort level and decide if that's a pillow worth having.  I have really cheap ones and an expensive one.  This falls in the middle price wise and comfort wise.  I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who prefers memory foam pillows.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AYV3NSGENGAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012B78114#wasThisHelpful","R1AYV3NSGENGAA","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm posting a pic of my hair pre-bleach, post bleach, and post pink dye. I probably didn't need to bleach it but the last time I tried to dye my hair with pinks (two different brands) it just didn't take very well.This took very well. The kit includes all you need (I used different gloves just because I prefer others). The directions are simple and complete. I would say that if you have hair longer than chin, maybe shoulder length, you will need at least two boxes. I have a pixie cut and used about half of both the bleach and dye. I always follow the direction when bleaching and did follow their directions. I never follow directions when using these ""Direct dye"" bright colors. Instead of the 30-60 minutes, I left mine in for 5 hours. I got a very vibrant pink (a little more fuchsia than the pictures on the box).My one complaint is that this definitely left me with more dye rubbing off than some other brands have. When I used other brands I might wake up the next morning to a streak light on my pillow and that was with lot of hair. Using this on short hair, my pillow looked like a pink paintball fight happened. This and all dyes like it will dye anything and everything they touch. So I highly recommend two things - 1. protect everything (your skin around your face and neck with Vaseline) 2. If possible do NOT rinse your hair in a shower/bathtub. If you have access to a stainless steel sink or some kind of utility / laundry room sink where stains won't matter, that is so much easier to clean.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NEJ275UP71TV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001540XWK#wasThisHelpful","R3NEJ275UP71TV","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I want to start with a warning about the shipping and not the product itself -- This has a sliding open close hole at the top of the container.  It takes very little effort to open or close it.  I have no way of knowing if it shipped in the open or closed position, but it arrived open with a bit of powder having spilled.  Not a lot (it takes a bit of effort to shake out more than say a teaspoon full).  Still you'll want to be careful when opening the packaging.Now onto the product.  I really only got this because who knew there was such a thing as a powder cleanser?  Okay, probably lots of people knew, but I don't keep up with beauty product trends at all.  I had no idea what to expect.  I always need products that are truly gentle. All of them say they are, but with sensitive skin, allergies, auto immune issues, etc my body is extra sensitive.  The wrong smell or chemical and I'm in migraine hell or getting rashes, etc.  So far, this does seem to fall into the truly gentle category.  My skin is extra dry now because it's been hot here and my skin doesn't like hot weather.  I used this and bam - instantly softer yet tighter feeling skin.  It does have a very light scent but it's totally inoffensive and not at all overpowering like some other cleaners.  You should be able to get a lot out of this sized bottle as you only use ""a small amount"" each time that you wash your face.

Both have 65 MG of Caffeine, while this has 325 MG Acetaminophen vs 250 in Excedrin Migraine.  This has 500 mg of Aspirin vs the 250 in Excedrin Migraine.My migraines are pretty severe and are treated by a neurologist.  I've found that while preventative therapies do help me a LOT, the treatments for during a migraine do little.  Over the counter puts as big of, if not a bigger, dent in my pain than the more expensive migraine pain relievers.  Because of this, my neuro recommends I use Excedrin Migraine.  It generally does not kill a migraine but does put it on a tolerable level.  This does basically the same thing but in an easier to take form (for those of who hate swallowing pills anyway).  It doesn't taste great but not horrible either.  You do want to have water at the ready.It works as fast, or faster than Excedrin Migraine.  You could probably use it on other aches and pain in a pinch but the caffeine content is definitely a headache thing.  It might take the place of Excedrin Migraine in my medicine cabinet.  Not sure yet but it's close.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R271WQTT7502AD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZEMPFWC#wasThisHelpful","R271WQTT7502AD","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"People seem to either love or hate these.  And the basis for both love and hate seems to be about the same issue - the size.I got these because of the size.  We've cut way down on our use of paper towels and instead have been using actual towels and these square microfiber rags we found in the cheapie aisle at the drug store.  They work fine.  No wasting paper.  Wash them, re-use.  But once in awhile something comes along where you instinctively grab for the paper towels.If you're like us and only use them occasionally for small to medium messes, or maybe to keep around you while eating for example, then these are perfect.  I tested these by holding them under a running faucet.  Once drenched they did hold up pretty well.  I could tear them easier than a dry sheet but they didn't fall apart on their own.If you're constantly using a giant sheet and feel like you're wasting them? This is a perfect solution.  If you have a lot of messes and paper towels are your go-to solution?

"So for this price range, these are a really decent art tool. Usually when I want to do anything with colors I just use Derwent Inktense pencils, but pencils aren't always good for covering a lot of space and I've just not been very artsy lately so I couldn't bring myself to spend the extra money on the Derwent Inktense Blocks. I thought this would be a good cheap alternative for now. I've included an image (done on cheap printer paper, so excuse the quality) showing all of the colors (except white) in both a small thin line without water and a thicker line where I used a waterbrush (my own because I prefer waterbrushes to the regular brushes like this set comes with). I then also did a small patch of red going into light blue going into the darker blue and ran the waterbrush over that as well.Some blend better than others. The tan color really fades pretty bad even with just a light brushing of water so to get a decent color out of it you'd have to do several layers I think. Running the stick flat on a smooth surface gets choppy coverage instead of a thick smooth line so for coloring in wider areas, you'll want to run the stick over the area more than once for full coverage. The colors do seem to stick pretty well, I washed my brush right after and couldn't get all of the color out.All of that said, I do still like them. They definitely work far better than some other ""on the cheap side"" of water media pens/sticks/etc. Next time I'm feeling artsy I'll likely order their metallic set.  Unless you need top of the line artist quality supplies, this set will probably work fine for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R241F1DEMEEJUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UE85EE#wasThisHelpful","R241F1DEMEEJUU","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've only tried one other wet skin moisturizer (Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer, Monoi Oil, 10 Ounce so I don't have a lot to compare this to but I will say that I had high hopes for this one.  It's Nivea, so a decent brand.  I's Cocoa Butter, one of the only scents I can pretty much always tolerate.  It's for wet skin, aka easy to apply on wet skin if you're like me and get out of the shower and head for the lotion - that can be a mess.Sadly, it didn't live up to my expectations.  With the Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer you apply it after turning the shower off, then pat dry.  This Nivea in-shower lotion starts out that way - you turn off the shower and apply the lotion but then you turn the shower back on to rinse it off and rinse off the tub.  Another words any of the convenience of a wet lotion is lost.But hey, still cocoa butter and for dry skin, so it's perfect beyond that?  Nope.  The scent was just weird to me.  I can't really explain it.  It just smells wrong.  For the first two hours or so after using this my skin felt nasty.  Not quite sticky, but close.Nice concept but a total failure for me at least.

"So my cat has shorter hair and has always been pretty good at grooming herself with no hairballs as a side effect.  As she gets older she is shedding more and getting hairballs more.  So it was time to find a miracle brush.  Not sure I'd call this that but it's still pretty decent.  My cat is a bit of a princess.  I've found that she likes to have this used on her so long as she cannot see it.  Once she knows something other than us is touching her, she's out.The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is that while it does a good job at getting all of the loose fur to the top of her coat, it only actually picks up like half of that onto the brush.

"Before I go further on this review I just want to say:  I have an iPad 3.  I realize it's not listed as compatible.  My mistake. It's probably the heaviest of the entire product line. The case is propped up by a magnet and unless I am on a perfectly level surface it just falls closed.  It's possible that the lighter versions of the product wouldn't have this issue.  I am, however, spoiled by the smart-case I purchased for it on launch day.  This product needs stronger magnets, if it had them I might give it 3 stars.The keyboard itself is okay but it does, in effect, turn your iPad into a laptop.  Or, to put it another way, it's a boat-anchor.  If you want to lay in bed and, say, play Angry Birds, you need to remove the case because otherwise you're trying to hold the case open and keep hitting the buttons.  It's not comfy.  Also, while the case is on, you're not using the camera since it's blocked, I realize this is my error since it's not on the list of compatible devices, but I also didn't care about camera access so for me this is a non-issue, for others wondering about if it works with iPad3 it does except for the camera access.I'm not a fan.  I prefer another KB I have where, instead of being part of the case, it's more like a dock you just drop it into the top.

"I have only two complaints with this1. the scent is pretty strong for me personally but most scents and I don't agree so your mileage may vary2.  It doesn't work quite as well as my traditional moisturizers.That said I still really liked it.  The scent is a lot stronger if you use this on dry skin than when you use it as it's advertised for on wet skin - maybe the patting of the towel helped? Whatever it was, the scent was much more tolerable when I applied it on wet skin.  It definitely left my skin feeling really good after the shower.  While I've never tried any other lotions meant for wet skin, I have made the mistake of using regular moisturizers when I hadn't dried off enough and that was a mess.  This was easy to apply and didn't leave behind any gunk.I don't think it would totally replace my usual moisturizers but it's definitely good enough for me to use after every shower and when in a rush.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27LS62G5R2FVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB87WX2#wasThisHelpful","R27LS62G5R2FVW","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The description of this book stated that no experience was necessary.  Id say that is definitely not true.  Ive tried crochet before and failed to really get it.  So I tried this book.  It didnt help me any though it did inspire me to go search the internet for videos again.  And this time I did pick the basics up quickly, so yay for that.  I still wouldnt feel comfortable with some of these patterns yet.  Some because they seem overwhelming (a single bedspread that requires breaking out the daisy loom as well as 32 balls of crochet cotton).  Some because they seem too fine for a newbie.  Some because theyre meant to mimic tatting, and I find needle tatting much faster and easier.  So thats the bad.The good is that if youre already comfortable with crochet of all sizes (specifically smaller hooks / motifs here), youll sure enjoy this book.  Aside from the patterns it attempts to give us some history of crochet.  Though the patterns are the main aspects of the book.  From gloves, to edgings, to blankets  theres a little of everything using primarily smaller motifs.  Much of it is meant to mimic more Victorian styles with little to no attempts to modernize those classics.Id recommend the book for advanced crocheters or those comfortable working with smaller hooks.  For newbies and those not comfortable working smaller, Id skip it.* Disclaimer: I received this book at no cost in order to review it.

"I like the concept I hated the book. It feels like a love triangle searching for a story.America Singer (no surprise, shes a musician) is of an age where she can sign up for the selection. The selection being where families pimp their daughters off in reality show style competition for the love of a prince. Pimping feels like the right word even for the girls dying to compete. Families get paid for the weeks their daughters are away. Win or lose the winning girl steps up the social ladder. Ones caste is very important  if your number is too low, good luck finding a man, unless hes in your caste, no one wants a spouse of a lower rank, except maybe the prince. When a girl can raise her status by simply trying to impress the price, well, why not. Sure theyre told that they must do anything the prince wants, even if they dont want to do it ANYTHING. Small price to pay for not wondering where your next meal comes from. America (named for the country too disgraced to hold onto its name but not so disgraced that you wouldnt want to name your daughter after it) didnt really want to sign up for consideration. Her boyfriend (Aspen) and her mom nagged her into it.Once at the castle the chosen girls meet Prince Maxon. Despite meeting the top of the top at parties and the like, Maxon has developed no social skills beyond table manners. Everyone is his dear. Everything everyone does and says is a shock to him. America, staying for the money her family will get makes a deal with Maxon to be his eyes and ears among the girls and hell let her stay as long as possible. Win win - her family will eat and Maxon will know whos worthy of being his wife. He, obviously, falls for America. She doesnt understand why. I mean she does everything right, wonders why everyone isnt more like her yet finds herself to be a no one.The worst part of the book is that nothing happens. Sure there are rebels who give the castle a good scare now and then. Thats it. The girls get their pictures taken and rebels (never seen) show up. The end. The prince hasnt truly made a decision though hes let America know his thoughts. Despite being madly in love for years, America and Aspen havent worked anything out in their relationship (all of their drama is stupid and forced). I think Ill just read spoilers to see who wins. This is obviously a member of the every book must be a trilogy (and beyond) club. Which is pretty insulting given the first book isnt even a complete story in any way shape or form. If youre stretching your characters lives into 3 (or more) books, you better make me feel like I read some kind of complete story in each book. So disappointing.

"I've used these for Kumihimo and they're great for that.  But that's not my craft of choice so I was worried they'd mostly sit unused in my craft desk.  Then I realized they're perfect for holding crochet cotton while I needle tat.  People who have cats know that nothing attracts them more than thread (maybe the laser).  Seriously my cat hears thread.  She'll be dead asleep, I put thread to needle and she's wide awake trying to help.  I love the little monster but it can be very inconvenient, not to mention what her claws do to the thread she grabs as it leaves the ball.

"I prefer needle tatting because I was able to teach myself the basics (DS, picots, and rings) in minutes using videos I found online.  Shuttles are far more frustrating for me but I'm trying them again as some patterns / tutorials just seem to be easier with shuttles.  I have two of these and two Clovers.There are two main differences -With these you wind the thread onto a bobbin. Each shuttle comes with two bobbins and you can buy more.  If, like me, you jump around from project to project this way of winding thread is probably better.  Instead of needing a lot of extra shuttles or cutting your current project off the shuttle and winding your new thread, you just slide the bobbin out.With the Clover shuttles, you wind the thread directly onto the bobbin.  I just explained why that is bad.  It can be good though.  If you have extra shuttles or don't bounce from project to project, these accommodate a little more thread.The second main difference is the tip of the shuttle -These shuttles have a tiny crochet hook as their tip while the Clover shuttles just have a pointed plastic tip.  This would come down to preference.  I find the tip on these far more useful than the plastic tip style.  This makes joining much easier where as the shuttle with the plastic tip had me just using a separate tiny hook anyway.Less important but may matter to those who use them a lot = color and weight.  These Aerlit shuttles do come in various colors as do the separate bobbins so it's easy to mix and match to your personal liking.  The Clover shuttles also come in various colors though it seems the pink and blue combo is the most common.  Both being plastic you could always find ways to make either suit your look (I've seen some decopauged over).  They're comparable in weight though this one loaded feels just a little lighter than the Clover.  Some might like the added weight, some might like lighter, so again just preference and not a huge difference.Overall -If I had to do it again, I'd have bought these first and just added extra bobbins.  I don't hate the Clover shuttles, these are just a little more suited to my likes.  If you're new to tatting and debating between shuttle and needle -- I'd say go with needle but if you try both and still decide you prefer needles, don't feel like you wasted money on these.  Even when needle tatting I find myself using these -- much easier to keep the cat away when I just have a little thread wrapped around these in my hand than when I have a full ball of thread and plenty of room between me and that thread so she can ""help"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C4NFEB1UISUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C1M2JS6#wasThisHelpful","R2C4NFEB1UISUP","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't know what I expected, but I think I was expecting more than it is.First off I should say that if you have two cables exactly the length of this that you always need together, it'd be a nifty idea.I have two items that I tend to keep side by side, so this seemed like a nice way to keep the cables together, classier than the twist ties I'd been using.  One of them was just a few inches too long and the other is about a foot too long.  I decided to try sort of double over the extra foot in a way that added as little extra cable as possible.  It fit, kind of but getting the zipper to close was tough.  Some of the wire inside was exposed instead of sewn into the little casing for it.  To keep it wound tight, it'd need a stronger wire or you'll have to use a rubber band or twist ties or something to actually keep it tightly wrapped.  Its a nice concept, but the execution just failed.  The one bright side is you'll definitely find the cords in a bag now, they just won't be any more protected or better wound up than without this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16K2AU9WBQBJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRGBNG0#wasThisHelpful","R16K2AU9WBQBJE","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:Easy to use - spray it on or in the case of your face spray it into your hands then rub it in.Good level of protection (held up to half a day walking around in the CA sun)Dries quicklyCons:The scent.  I dislike 99% of scents as many of them trigger migraines for me.  This wasn't quite strong enough to be migraine inducing but it is also not a scent I'd choose.  I can't even describe it -- the best I can do is say it's some blend of a generic aerosol scent mixed with a flowery perfume.  Luckily it does fade rather quickly.The price.

While I thought the first book was well written, it just felt like it was lacking something.  Everything good about the first book is in this book and then some.Told from Adam's point of view, we're led through the accident's aftermath.  While both Mia and Adam have reached a level of success that most people would envy they've also dealt with their losses in very different ways.  Mia is the happy go lucky girl who decides to put on a brave face, leaving Oregon and everything in it behind her.  Adam is the brooding rock star who used his pain to write the lyrics that would change his life.A not so chance meeting leads the duo on a farewell tour of NYC.

"Because I had only minimal knotting experience (think old school friendship bracelets) I wanted a book that has very clear instructions.  This is definitely that book.  I did find the layout of the book a bit odd.  Unless you have memorized every symbol they used for every knot, you'll be flipping back and forth between the front of the book and the pattern you are working on.  Some of the samples in the book were shown on like colored backgrounds, making it less than ideal while you're trying to examine the details.  The photos of the completed projects are not near the instructions, which can also lead to a lot of flipping back and forth between the sections of the this book.Still, despite sometimes being awkward to use this book, the instructions are so good that I'd still recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NQRVQL6NEJYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250034019#wasThisHelpful","R1NQRVQL6NEJYB","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Me and the hubby saw it in a store locally and agreed we needed this.  First off, right out of the box -- the battery compartments are screwed down with tiny tiny screws that none of our screwdriver sets would work with.  I was thinking we'd be running to the hardware store when the hubby finally found one that work -- not a screwdriver most people with just a basic tool set will have handy.We did play with it for a few hours.  Much of that time was trying to figure out the controls.  They should not have gone wireless with these controllers.  The line of sight for them is very very very picky.  Our cat walked by and oh hey, cannot use the controller.  Stretched out on the floor, moved a toe, oops the controller no longer works, get back into position.  If you find and use real atari controllers, you'd probably like this more than we did.Still we do have to give it credit in that some of the games are definitely still playable.  If you are of an age to have known Atari, the nostalgia factor is there.  You will be saying ""Oh yeah, I played this one!"" on games you thought you didn't recognize before loading them.3 stars is  a kind of high review for this to be honest but we did enjoy some of the games.

"I've owned two slow cookers.  The first was a nice size, ceramic, but it didn't have a removable pot and had a plastic lid.  Needless to say I kind of hated it as the plastic lid eventually cracked and it was tough to clean since you had to take the whole cooker, cord and all to the sink to clean it.  The second one I got (the one I was using until this item arrived) was a rice cooker / slow cooker combo.  Electric with timers.  Metal pots that can be tough to clean.  It was fully enclosed so you couldn't see inside to be sure there was enough fluids without opening it.  Then comes this one.  I really like this one (enough to put my old one in the cabinet instead of on the counter).  It has the heavy duty ceramic style pot (removable).  Glass lid. There is no timer, just the High, low, and warm settings.Obviously the one thing that makes this different is the whole ""wrap and serve"" concept.  To be honest, it's kind of gimmicky.  It ships with a blue/white zig zag wrap, a red with snowflake wrap, a football wrap, a birthday wrap, red white and blue stars wrap.  You can also buy separate ones (currently about ten dollars for two at the company's website).  I suspect you could use a blank plastic sheet and create your own.  If you're the type to decorate for events, these could be a nice simple way to do that.  But since most people would take the pot and lid out to set that on the table, I really don't know how useful these are, even for that.  The wraps are on the machine itself.  Unless people will be seeing your entire cooker, they're what I said -- a gimmick.It is a really good slow cooker (if you don't need a timer feature).  The wraps are a cute idea, but probably not something most people would benefit from beyond sprucing up the kitchen.Disclaimer - I got this item free for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7EV1OPWAKFNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQTE1FM#wasThisHelpful","R7EV1OPWAKFNT","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You know who loves old Hollywood?  Me,  I do.  Id heard of William Desmond Taylor before reading this book.  Id heard only the basics.  After reading this book, I feel like I know a little, but not much, more.  A lot of this book is more about setting up the Hollywood scene than it is about William Desmond Taylor and his murder specifically.I had this one as an audio book from the library.  I think I liked it more as an audio book than I would have as a text copy.  The narrator sets the scene well.  Still, the book jumps around a lot.  At times I felt I should grab a notebook and start doing some how is x connected to y kinds of crime charts.  In the end, I think I'd find that x and y were barely connected, if at all.At one point, I wasnt sure I could carry on. There was an hour or two where it felt like the book was about poor Will H. Hays being used and abused by Hollywood and what could the poor sap do, after all they were paying him a fortune so he owed it to them to sell out his morals.  Riiiiiight.  Poor guy couldnt say no to the big money.  Those mean studio heads forced him to be the face of self censorship and he just happened to get rich in the process.I also felt, at times, as though a non-Hollywood junkie would learn more about the Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle trial than they would about William Desmond Taylor.  I happen to love the Fatty Arbuckle movies and am fascinated by his story, but that wasnt really what I signed up for with this book.Overall, its a really decent Old Hollywood primer.  It, by no means, solves the case though we do eventually get to a decent enough theory.  I guess, in the end, I had a love / hate relationship with this book.  I loved it more than I hated it. Still get ready for a dizzying ride that will take you right up to a point and then zig zag and loop around to something totally unrelated only to slam right into the end.Torn on the star rating.  I went with 3.  It's somewhere between a 3 and 4 just barely leaning toward the 3 side of things.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2008DOEZ7L2T1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OGOP3YO#wasThisHelpful","R2008DOEZ7L2T1","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like every Aussie product I've tried... until now.I tend to have sensitive skin and am super sensitive to scents.  Not that I cannot tolerate any of them.  Things the the cleaner aisle and the perfume aisle do trigger severe migraines.  A mild scent here and there, that I can tolerate.  The other Aussie products I have used have scents I find quite enjoyable.  This shampoo?  Not so enjoyable.  If you've ever walked into a hair salon and thought hmm this smells like they've been mixing every stinky hair product by the gallon all day long, well the fine folks at Aussie have bottled that scent and poured it all into this dry shampoo.Still, although the scent made me want to grab for my migraine meds, the dry shampoo was already in my hair.  So let's work it in as we're instructed.  Maybe the scent will tone down.  I should note that I have a pixie cut, so I don't have a whole lot of hair to work this into.  What I found is that it is good as a touch up -- for that point when you're missing the freshly washed feeling but your hair isn't really looking nasty.  It's not so good if your hair does look even a little dirty.  In fact I think it made my 1 1/2 day w/o shampoo hair look nastier than it did before applying it.  So for that level of dirtiness, this is no miracle.  Also, I washed my hair after testing it, and I'm still smelling that scent, blech.If you don't mind very strong scents, this will be fine for you.  It's super easy to use.  It does a decent job of making borderline hair look refreshed.  For actual dirty hair, just go straight for your normal shampoo.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HKMV7AF51Y3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP23U24#wasThisHelpful","R3HKMV7AF51Y3C","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The story of Grubb (like the worm, with two Bs). Grubb had no family but had been put to work as a chimney sweep by a less than kind man. After a bit of trouble, Grubb accidentally escapes to Alistair Grims place. But Alistair Grims place is not a typical home, its odd. Brooms are seen sweeping. Silent Samurais protect the residents. Watches talk. None of that really matters to Grubb though, what matters to him is that Mr. Grim is not punishing him for his stowaway adventure, instead he seems to be rewarding him with a decent job and a bit of a mentorship.When things are as odd as they are at the Odditorium sometimes people get curious. Especially curious are the investors who keep the building funded and the nearby residents who would like to know exactly what happens in such a mysterious place.As Mr. Grim sets out to put on a show, we learn that not everyone is simply curious. Some people dont like Grim and they might have a bit of oddness on their side as well.A charming story. If someone stuck some Dickens and some Harry Potter into a blender, theyd likely end up with something just like this.Not sure how I feel about it being a series yet, but this did give up a fairly complete story so whether you would read on or stop at just one, youd be satisfied.* Disclaimer: I received this book at no cost in order to review it.

"Stars: 4 out of 5Pros:- Audio quality is pretty good.  I'm not an audiophile but I do think they do their job just fine- I like that the mic only works when you have it unfolded, making it easy to mute.- Reasonably comfortable and solid constructionCons:- I think their instructions for installing the headphones could have been a little better.  You have to search their app store to find the headphone app to install, something as simple as putting the search term in quotes would have gone a long way.- It did take a good half an hour or so to get the install downloaded, and I did have to unplug it a couple of times to make it work. (Only had to do this on the first day, though.) Frankly I'm surprised that it wasn't as simple as ""just plug into USB port and go"".  I have another headset where you *can* do that.  It's weird.  But you only have to do it once.- The volume controls are, for stylistic reasons, only embossed in the plastic.  They did not paint the letters white or anything, meaning you have to angle the remote a certain way to find out which buttons you're pushing.  I get the minimalist style, but it would have been helpful if they had painted in the letters to make them legible.- *wife note* they leak sound out quite loudly so people around you do hear everything or nearly everything depending on how loud you have them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RBQQMMIFQX49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NE5D4SS#wasThisHelpful","R2RBQQMMIFQX49","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off, they probably have the best sound / sound control of any headphones I have.  Most have one pre-set setting and you cannot change it.  These offer you the ability to choose between several pre-set settings (good if you listen to lots of types of music as one setting does not always flatter everything you might listen to).  The only downside is if you leave your music on while shifting through to find the best setting, you'll hear the voice telling you what setting you're switching too over the music, so you'll likely want to pause the music, change the setting, listen, if not the setting you need, repeat.The ability to have them paired with both your computer and your phone and use both at the same times is awesome.  Many do let you pair to multiple devices but you can then only use one at a time.  This is ideal for accepting calls while on the computer.It comes with all of the cables you could need.While not noise-cancelling, they do offer a bit of what I'd call a sound buffer.  They're not totally blocking out sound before you turn them on, but they are greatly reducing it.  Once on, almost no noise gets in or out.You'll probably need to read the manual.  There's a lot more buttons that the usual 2 or 3 - the right cup housing bluetooth on/off/pairing, volume,  and the mic mute button, the left cup houses the buttons for powering on / off, adjusting the sound settings, and the mic settings (there are also multiple mic settings).The only real downside for me is comfort -- The ear cups having the ability to move is nice as are the ear cups themselves.  That said, my ideal headphone has some give to it.  I'm prone to severe migraines and ear infections so any headphones that feel like they're sort of gripping my head end up leaving me miserable.  These definitely have that clamped down feeling.  A little more give to them and I'd have loved them, as they are I just like them but cannot use them very long.  Someone not as sensitive will likely love them.The transmitter is easy to figure out as well, though honestly I really only used it to mute something much quicker than trying to remember what button was where on which ear cup.Although the fit wasn't for me, I'd still recommend them for most people.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTF2EHU19XZS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDNO5WY#wasThisHelpful","RTF2EHU19XZS5","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Feeling his father was weak, he wanted to be everything his father wasnt.  First being taken under the wing of the neighborhood psychic and then later a master photographer, Eddies life isnt glamorous but it is fairly stable.  Until he witnesses the end of a vicious fire and becomes involved with the case of a girl missing since the fire.As the novel progresses it becomes more and more obvious that Coralie and Eddie are destined to meet, likely under less than ideal circumstances.My main issue with this book, the issue that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is that this book feels as though it doesnt know what to focus on.  Should it be the story of our characters or the story of NYC and what it was during that time period.  It leaves both feeling a little underdeveloped.  Its still a lovely book.  A book that tells a complete story without needing a trilogy to do so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYSVTVC0EQH8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPM7YM2#wasThisHelpful","RYSVTVC0EQH8E","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave this two stars, not because it's a bad product, but because it's actually a really neat product hindered by some poor choices.  Let me be clear:  This drone demos really well.  You control it with your smart phone, it beams video right to it, it *jumps* which is really cool.  It can flip in either direction and the video always shows you which way is up.  If you saw this in a mall you'd probably plunk your cash down on it right away, and for ten minutes you'd be really happy!  Except...... You can only do 90 degree turns.  No, seriously, you can only move this thing like a chess piece.  Intuitively you think you could drive it like a tank, but I've yet to actually get the control to work this way.  Since the thing bounces around a lot you almost always knock it off in a random direction, meaning you're zig-zagging it back to you.  I would add one star to this review right now if somebody showed me how to get more fine-tune control to the steering.  *update* Thanks to a comment we figured out we can turn while accelerating.  Still a very awkward control.  Cannot watch the video screen while controlling it.  What I would like is tank like controls.  Cannot turn the thing unless it is moving forward.There's one more serious problem that, frankly, I'm surprised made it out the door.  They claim you can add a memory card to this thing and record video.  What isn't clear until you buy it is that the type of memory stick it uses is not widely available.  Instead of using a standard USB port so you could plug in one of the three-hundred or so thumb-drives you have scattered around your domicile, it uses some mini or micro-USB port that ... well I've never seen a drive that will fit that port, I don't think anybody reading this review will either.  You will not be recording video with this device unless you make it a serious project to find the memory card you need to do so.  If they changed the port design, that would be one more star I'd add.One last problem is it doesn't really work on carpets that well.  I mean it kinda does, but I utterly failed to chase my cat with it.  This thing really is very light-weight and low power.  I'm an apartment dweller that has both hallways and a big parking garage to play with this this thing in, your mileage may vary.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NAGF3OTVTP27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQPPH7A#wasThisHelpful","R2NAGF3OTVTP27","A2E0TJ49NACDBA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E0TJ49NACDBA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This formula definitely gets the job done but can be too effective.  My newborn was having constipation issues with Similac Advance formula so I decided to give this a try.  It took about 28 hours to work, but after that he had steady diarrhea (very, very watery).  We cut back immediately and now use this in a ratio of 3 parts Similac to 1 part Reguline.

Now we throw other toys in there and she ""fishes"" for them amongst the balls.

"I love this case!  Finally something that doesn't cover up the color of the phone.  It's sturdy, doesn't have flaps over the ports (I hate the flaps on other OtterBox cases), and it's versatile in terms of designs that can be used in the window.So far the window is very scratch resistant, which was a concern of mine.

"I recently purchased a lake home and it had drainage problems in the past which caused water damage in the basement.  The timing couldnt be better to receive this product because I just took it to the lake house and used it in areas where I thought there could be moisture issues.A bathroom flooded in the basement which ruined the vanity cabinet and part of the wall.  There was obvious mildew and mold present throughout bathroom.  I was very curious to understand if moisture was still present in the area.Using this FLIR moisture meter is extremely easy for a layperson.  Im not a mechanic or someone who works in an industry where testing and measurement equipment is readily used (Im a corporate guy).  Quite literally, I turned on the device and held it in front of an area where I thought there could be moisture and it quickly provided useful data.  Thankfully I did not find any new moisture in the bathroom, which means the previous drainage issue has been resolved.PROS durable construction and nice rubber grip extremely easy to use onboard software navigation and feature selection is exceptionally easy taking pictures is intuitive using the laser pointer is very useful because sometimes it is hard to tell from the device image what youre looking at until you shine it with a laser extracting pictures from the device to my computer was extremely easy and follows the exact same process as removing pictures from a cell phone.  The device acts as an external USB hard drive.  Simply navigate to the picture folder and transfer the pictures the device powers on quickly so there is no need to wait for the unit to boot or warm-up there are multiple uses for this device other than looking for moisture.  I examined my garage and easily identified drafts, hot water pipes, ducting, and anything with temperature differentiation.  I plan to examine each door and window for weather stripping issues. it easily picks up the heat generated from electronic devices moisture sensing ability is highly impressive, incredibly sensitive.  I grabbed a large beach towel with wet hands and placed it on the counter.  Given the size of the beach towel and the limited amount of water I transferred to it from my hands, you could barely feel any moisture in the towel.  I used the device and quickly spotted the wet spots which I could not perceive visually (or barely by touch).  It is amazing how accurate and sensitive the device is.CONS for the price I think this moisture meter should come with a case. The device comes with an accessory to more accurately measure moisture which consists of a two-pronged pin connected to the device by an Ethernet port.  I tried to use this accessory and couldnt figure it out by stumbling through it.  This is not necessarily a negative for the device, but using the accessory requires careful reading through the digital manual to really understand the purpose. I think this device should come with a printed manual other than the quick start guide which comes with it.  It is absolutely ridiculous how many languages are printed in the quick start guide, like every language on Earth (or so it seems)!  I think there should be a US version with the complete user manual and a charging receptacle just for US electrical outlets.  The device comes with electrical fittings for every possible international electrical outlet you can imagine.Overall I really like this device because moisture is a significant enemy to homeowners, especially those owning a lake house.  This device has prompted my curiosity into other measurement devices like high-end thermal imagers.  It is amazing what the human eye cannot detect but can be easily seen by this device.  Im sure there are a lot more uses that Ill stumble across in the future, especially figuring out how to use the pin accessory.  I am very pleased with how easy it is to use and its unbelievable accuracy.  I would recommend this device to anyone with potential moisture problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NVUJZPNPNQ66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2PTJK6#wasThisHelpful","R3NVUJZPNPNQ66","A2PLGB52VCSYHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLGB52VCSYHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two babies that are 14mos apart in age.  Both have Britax carseats - one is the Marathon (pink giraffe print) and the other is this one.  Although the marathon is great, this Boulevard model is definitely a step up with more adjustments, easier adjustments, and better padding.  It is also much heavier than the Marathon (not sure why).We've used them both rear and forward facing in a Yukon Denali and also a Ford F150 pickup truck.  The latch system is super easy and the extra toggle straps make this seat secure even if not in the perfect position (this has occurred a few times during travel).  The kiddos are comfortable overall, my only issue being that the seats hold heat in the summer time.  I don't think that is any different than other car seats though.Overall we've been extremely pleased with this brand and model of car seat... they're just plain easy and reliable.

"I'm on the fence over this bag.  It's a nice size, holds its shape, and seems as if it will be durable for rough treatment.  However, I have a list of dislikes as well.As I said above, the bag holds its shape - but this makes the material stiff and not smooth or soft.Also, the opening is a double zipper pullback and while that gives great visibility and packability, it's also a pain at times when you want to just quickly reach in and grab something.  The waterproof flap that covers the zipper will be great for weather protection, but makes opening not so smooth at times.The HUGE lettering and even the size (70L) are plastered on the bag and I feel like I'm a walking advertisement.  I prefer nice things that are much more understated.It smells like a pool flotation device when you first open it - I believe it's similar material used to make this bag so water resistant.  The smell does fade though, which is a plus.Bottom line, it'll get the job done by holding a bunch of stuff, staying intact, and not being ruined by the weather.  The downsides are primarily related to user friendliness.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R63MT90UIBKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9QGXZI#wasThisHelpful","R2R63MT90UIBKR","A2PLGB52VCSYHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLGB52VCSYHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It comes in a large box (the largest box Ive ever seen for a watch) that would make for nice presentation if it werent for the very strong solvent smell that I detected when opening it.  I sniffed around - its the watch, not the box that has the odor.  The white mother of pearl dial is only mildly lustrous with minimal pearlescence (see photo).

It's also an intuitive design so adjusting the wheels from a trike to a 2-wheel style is very easy and won't require looking up instructions or storing parts for later on.The sounds are fun, the buttons are engaging and the fit is right on for her at 33"" tall (legs are bent and able to propel scooter forward).

"I have two FP Snugabunny style swings and also 2 Graco gliders.  This Ingenuity swing rounds out my collection of baby motion devices.  I've found these items to be so very helpful in soothing a fussy baby and helping the baby to sleep (and stay asleep).  The somewhat unique features this one offers:- removable seat (but not that handy to do so)- lights in the mobileAll the swings rotate in multiple directions as this one does, which I think is crucial.  Some babies like back and forth motion and some prefer side to side.  That alone can make all the difference.  Music and the mobile are on par for a swing, but the lights really are a neat extra feature of this one.  Very young babies seem to be mesmerized by the lights, whereas my other devices (no lights) didn't really capture babies' attention until they were older and starting to reach for things.All swings seem to have wide bases for stability, and this is no exception.  Not the handiest things to move, which is why I have more than one!  My biggest beef with this unit is the timer on the swing.  I want the swing to run forever, not shut off after 60 minutes max.  My babies have gotten the best sleep of their young lives in swings and usually within 10 minutes of one stopping the baby wakes up.  The FP models run for 4 hours which I greatly prefer.  Hardly ever does a baby sleep that long, but when they do it's pretty exciting for a sleep-deprived parent.Overall this is a really nice unit with good features and quality fabrics.  Yes there are pluses and minuses, but this is definitely worth considering when you're in the market for a swing!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QJP1PWL7ZCNW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VRB3NTQ#wasThisHelpful","R1QJP1PWL7ZCNW","A2PLGB52VCSYHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLGB52VCSYHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cute little toy that's engaging.  It's colorful, has a button that makes squeaky noises, and lots of fun parts to play with.  My daughter is 13mos and carries the top (minus the bowl) around with her.  I think she likes all the shape holes - she uses them has handles.  So far, my biggest concerns were that it's not the smoothest on the backside (of the top).  There are some ridges and screw holes, some of which aren't what I'd call sharp, but they're not smooth and rounded either.  So far no issues though, so perhaps my concern is unfounded.  The only other issue to note is that the button (nose) that makes the squeaky noise would be impossible for a child to get a squeak out of.  My daughter loves pushing the button anyway, but it takes a focused effort for adults to get a squeak out of it using fast/firm motions.Overall, this is a toy that I think will be a staple in the long run.  The bowl is fun, the top and parts are colorful, and I think it'll be included in lots of activities.

"This glider is nice because it has a smaller footprint than standard swings - less space, easier to move.  It also puts the baby at a slightly higher level so its easier to get in/out of.  We used to only use a swing, but this glider has the advantage of the removable bouncer seat, which is great!  Imagine the baby being all comfy in a bouncer but they cant quite fall asleep with this glider you just pick up the bouncer, pop it in the glider, and set the motion/songs as desired.  With a swing we wouldve had to pick up the baby and start all over again in the swing.  Portability is a huge plus!  The main glider seat (removable bouncer seat) also has a vibrate feature which can be handy with a gassy baby. Ours has gotten relief this way when nothing else helped.One other nice feature is the timer (and lack of a default shutoff). This machine will run until you turn it off. This is great when baby is taking a super long nap. Other swings we have automatically shut off at 4 hours and this is no big deal, but once in a blue moon the baby takes a super long nap and the last thing I want is an interruption because the swing stops! This glider will keep running until it is turned off, so thats a huge bonus in my book.The fabric is soft and easy to wash, the music and volume are both par for this type of device.  My biggest beef is the location of the buttons.  They are on the side of the unit and our toddler is very keen to press them.  Im not sure how else the design would work though, so I cant really ding any stars from the review.The only other consideration for parents shopping this type of device is direction of motion.  Some babies dont like moving back and forth - they only like side-to-side.  We had one like that who didnt do too well in the glider.  It made her a bit motion sick I think.  Thats how we ended up with a swing, because swings usually do both motions: side-to-side and front-to-back.  It might be worth trying in a store or at a friends house to find out.  Otherwise, this is a great piece of baby equipment that Id definitely recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5QGMEPLLKQFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y286O6U#wasThisHelpful","R5QGMEPLLKQFP","A2PLGB52VCSYHG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PLGB52VCSYHG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a busy looking product that draws a child's attention.  We have a 1yo and she isn't entirely sure what to do with it... I can see that many people have this for older children and perhaps that's why.  We do play one-on-one with her and the toy to show her how the magic points work and she enjoys the songs.  She just hasn't quite gotten it for herself yet.  I think this will come in time.My biggest beef with this product is it's busy-ness extends into assembly.  It comes in so many pieces!  Most kids' toys come fairly assembled with only large pieces to attach, but this was much more involved.  Don't expect to pop this out of the box and have it ready in a flash - not happening!Overall I think this is going to be a very good long-term toy, especially due to the interactive nature and colorful setup.

So you just can't zip coat up with out pushing that piece of fabric away with one hand and then zip the coat up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROLFLWOZ7YHCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZZ8U3E#wasThisHelpful","ROLFLWOZ7YHCU","A2S6QCNNN8AK91","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2S6QCNNN8AK91?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As always Book*sense deliver a fantastic summary and analysis.  This time the book is ""X (Kinsey Millhone Book 24.)  I have never read any of the other books in this series, but my wife kept insisting that I would love them.  So I read book 24 and I really did enjoy it, but I could not help feel I was missing something from not reading any of the previous books.  I bought this summary and analysis and it helped me very much.  We are implementing a new trouble ticker system at my job so I have been very busy and have had very little time to read.  That caused me to take a much longer time than usual to finish Grafton's book.  Book*Sense showed me that I had missed some key points and it helped me to be much more satisfied with the novel.

"The book and movie market is very saturated with zombie tales these days, so it takes a lot for a particular title to grab my attention and earn my praise.  ""The Rise of Macon"" is one such book.  I very familiar with the setting, Oak Island, so I can attest to the fact that author's descriptive powers are dead on.  Gurley's prose is crisp and moves along quickly and his characters, both healthy and otherwise are very well defined.  The story is not without its humor as well which makes for great comic relief between the more intense scenes.

"I first read this story using my Kindle Unlimited Subscription, but I ended up liking it so much that I bought it so I could reread it as many times as I wanted.  It is a very funny love story filled with goofy tongue-in-cheek humor, lots of sexy sex stuff, and one particularly crazy death scene that has to be read to be believed.  Jennifer Tate is a fantastic author who has managed to take a traditional love story and set it on its ear.  Her characters are larger than life itself and you will either root for them to win or root for them to die a horrendous death.

"Imagine being a female living in a world where rape and sexual slavery were legal.  Imagine being female and a virgin in a world where bedding a virgin is said to have medicinal properties.  This is the world the protagonist in Mya Robarts' ""The V Girl"" is forced to fight to survive in by any means necessary.  The novel is very well written and contains some very brutal and horrifying scenes that do indeed make it suitable for readers no less than 18 years old.  Robarts' characters are very well developed and the main character, Lila is instantly likable and sympathetic.

"The mother and daughter writing team of B.F. and A.J. Harrolle have a unique way of blending their voices together to keep the narrative of ""Jessica's Truth"" flowing in such a way that the reader cannot tell that it was written by two different people.  Even in book's like ""The Talisman"" by Stephen King and Peter Straub, it was easy to tell where one writer left off and the other picked up because of their unique story telling style.  ""Jessica's Truth"" tells the sad tale of a prostitute who is forced to work the streets under a vicious pimp named Sweets.  Jessica missed her family very much, but she knows if she tries to leave, Sweets will track her down and destroy everyone she cares about.

There is Celtic mythology, dragons, highlanders, and my personal favorite shape shifters who can shift into dragon form.  As always Gimpel's characters are fun and multidimensional.  The dialogue, though even from another era, still feels natural.  The story grabs you right from the beginning and keeps you reading, hoping the fun never ends.

"Very rarely does a debut novel come along that contains beautiful prose, elegant landscapes, and multidimensional characters while taking on potboiler topics such as bigotry towards Jews and homosexuals so successfully. There are so many twists, turns, and trysts in this book that it becomes unable to put down.  The romantic scenes are steamy, but still tasteful and the addition of a gay couple really heats things up and shakes the status quo to the core.  Bruce Benzel is definitely a voice to watch out for.  I love the fact that he doesn't allow himself to be defined by one genre.

"""Driving Grandpa"" is a sweet and funny read that will be over long before you want it to be.  You keep wanting to hear more and more of Grandpa's stories because the character feels so real.  There is a certain bittersweet sadness that comes from reading these tales because of Grandpa's advanced age.  While I am sure the narrator may have heard many of these stories more times than he could count them, there always had to be the worry that this time could very well be the last.  My grandfather served in WWII, Korea, and Vietnam and he was always full of stories to tell.  He would not talk about the wars himself, but had many a great story about being a fighter pilot and the men he flew with in combat.  I think that's why I liked this so much.  There are quite a few parallels with the Grandfather in the book and to my real life grandfather.  Author John Redstand has said these are fictionalized accounts, but I am all but 100% sure that he has heard many of them in real life because they seem so sweetly familiar to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EWT37P2BE6IE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZZ7SA78#wasThisHelpful","R2EWT37P2BE6IE","A3QJEHLUAGY03C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QJEHLUAGY03C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When you read Stan, you are not only reading wonderful works of speculative fiction, but you are also being given a shared ride through the philosophies and beliefs of the author.

"""The Raping of Ava Desantis"" contains some of the most horrifically terrifying scenes of any novel that I have read in quite a while.  While the rape itself is not told of in detail, the aftermath of the act, and specifically the harm done to the body and psyche of young Ava will chill you to the bone.  Ava was a freshman in college when she was invited to tutor the handsome son of a furniture magnate for twice the amount she was making as a waitress.  Things go horribly wrong on the first night and Ava is brutally gang raped by three men.  Wesley, the young man she was supposed to tutor comes from very old money, so Ava was coerced by her attacker's family and even her own father to accept a substantial amount of hush money to keep quiet.  As time passes, Ava's rapists become successful and she was just a speed bump on their road to success.But then, strangely enough, people start turning up dead and the past comes rushing back like an out of control freight train.  Carbia flexes her literary muscle and delivers a story that is both compassionate to victims of sexual assault and truly terrifying at the same time.  Its horror is unflinching and grips you so tightly that you keep turning the pages even though you know what's coming next will scare you witless.Even with its dark themes, the novel is not without a sense of humor.  I would add a 6th star if I could just for the line about a room looking like it was decorated by two straight men on a dare.""The Raping..."" is stark, blood freezing horror and any fan of a good scary read should snag this up as soon as possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10WQCILD4T19S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015N5D8WS#wasThisHelpful","R10WQCILD4T19S","A3QJEHLUAGY03C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QJEHLUAGY03C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Myasthenia Gravis is a heartbreaking disease.  It is caused by a dfect that causes a disruption of nerve impulses to muscles. Myasthenia Gravis causes antibodies to block and destroy these nerve signals and stops muscle contraction.  This can be something as minor as an eyelid not working properly to something much more serious like being unable to swallow or even take a healthy breath.The author Margaret Kane suffers from this horrible disease and she tells her story within the pages of ""Patient Zero.""  Margaret was misdiagnosed so many times, and went through so many unnecessary and harmful treatments that they caused her more harm.  Finally, after way too many years of ineffective treatment and being given only 3 years to live, Margaret finally finds a treatment program that works.  Granted it is very unconventional treatment, but it stops her own body from attacking itself.Margaret's story is touching, heart rending, and beautifully told.  Being the father of two children with rare genetic disorders, I feel closer to her frustration because I have lived it myself.  Watching your own children suffer and feeling helpless takes its toll both physically and mentally.I really loved reading Margaret's story.

I know I'll never take up smoking actual tobacco cigarettes again, but I may just consider vaping now that I've read this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J4HB0RRVIR08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01378TBJ2#wasThisHelpful","R2J4HB0RRVIR08","A3QJEHLUAGY03C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QJEHLUAGY03C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Make Me"" is easily one of Lee Child's best books.  It is a multifaceted mystery that leads Reacher and his companion on a state to state investigation that leads to a horrifying revelation.  My mother-in-law is coming to town and she REALLY loves the Jack Reacher series.  She can recall every little detail and talk about it for a long time.  Even though I read the actual novel, I knew that I didn't retain enough to hold a conversation with her.  This Summary & Analysis from the Book*Sense folks is a fantastic way to get everything out of the novel that you paid for.  The review at the beginning was spot on and even touched on the one glaring fault that through me off a bit too. I really like railroads and their history, so there was no way it would slip by me.  After the review there is a list of all the major characters and then the always excellent chapter by chapter summary come next.  After reading this Summary & Analysis, I am ready for my other-in-law.  :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EM6SJ0N5IZ0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DAB4WO#wasThisHelpful","R1EM6SJ0N5IZ0B","A3QJEHLUAGY03C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QJEHLUAGY03C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""A Twin's Redemption"" is a unique reading experience.  It is written from the point of view of two 4 year old twin girls who have telepathic abilities.  I will give full props to Yassy F for taking on such a daunting task.  It is quite a different use of the unreliable narrator and I have not seen it used this way before.  The book's characters are very well developed and it really does seem like you are looking at life through the eyes of Pre-K children.  I really enjoyed reading this book.

"Unchecked anger is a horrible problem.  It can ruin relationships, destroy families and careers, and even cause critical illnesses.  We live in a society where living under pressure is considered part of the norm and all of the stress can easy boil over into anger issues.  ""Anger Management"" by Luis O Moreta is a well written and concise guide to getting to the root of what is causing your anger, how to take back control of your emotions and your lives, and to mend and sustain your relationships.  It is a great book and should be read by anyone who is looking for assistance in getting their anger under control.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AROH62KYMXNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BIX426#wasThisHelpful","R2AROH62KYMXNP","A3QJEHLUAGY03C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QJEHLUAGY03C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Dead Nolte"" is not an easy book to categorize because to do so would somehow reduce the effectiveness of Wilder's unique storytelling style.  It is at times hysterical, revolting, scary, surreal, and exciting.  At times it manages to be all at once.  It's one of those books that make you wonder just what you may have gotten yourself into at the beginning and then by the end you wish there was still more to read because you don't want it to be over.  The story is great, the character, especially Nolte, are fantastic.  This is easily one of my favorite books I've read this year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VBS06S5VRTYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013N6E2YC#wasThisHelpful","R1VBS06S5VRTYS","A3QJEHLUAGY03C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QJEHLUAGY03C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This DSLR messenger bag by Manfrotto ranks, for me, as an almost, not quite. Meaning that, while are some very good to excellent features there are also a few where it falls horribly flat. Fortunately, I was able to purchase this for far below the list (and even Amazon Prime) price. That helps.There are definitely some very good points about this bag. I can fit my D7100 with 24-70 lens attached, along with my D7000 with 70-200 f4 attached (laying at an angle), as well as my 18-105 in its cloth bag, all in the main compartment. That to me is huge - lenses attached on both bodies and ready to go with quick access via a quick-access top zipper. There is a zippered bottom compartment that perfectly stores my two SB-600 Speedlight flash units in their original soft cases, and I do mean perfectly. The zippered organizer pocket inside, also accessible through the top zippered opening, holds all manner of smaller items from phones to batteries to business cards, etc., etc.  A full-length narrow pocket (with Velcro hold-down strap) exists at the back that, due to the overall size of the bag, allows me to carry my 17"" MacBook Pro, along with the camera gear, though that does make for a pretty hefty load.Where the bag falls short lies in some design flaws. There is only one carry handle meaning that if you lift by that method the bag leans away from you, so you really cannot carry it that way at all.  The shoulder strap, while having great adjustable length, is permanently stitched to the bag meaning that if anything happens to the strap your bag becomes fairly worthless.  I am not sure if this is common to the bag but the plastic buckle on mine is, at times, difficult to get fully locked into place (though the Velcro on either side does a good job keeping the flap closed).  However, the biggest disappointment (though I knew this going in) is that there is no way to lock the bag to help protect the contents.  That feature, for me, would be great as I would like to stow this in the overhead bin when flying but, for safety reasons, slide it under the seat in front of me.Normally, with the fall short items I listed I would typically rate this as a 3-star. However, due to the fact that I can easily carry so much gear, as described above, that pushes it closer to a four.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QJXBR8X1FH61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TA71Q8#wasThisHelpful","R1QJXBR8X1FH61","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a future that could, conceivably, be a heartbeat away. Literally. The tech that is shown in the series for the most part is known to exist and it is not hard to believe that what we don't know about is already out there or being played with in secret. Also, keep in mind this was aired in 2008. I am not a conspiracy theorist, but I do know with certainty that individual freedom is eroding in the name of making us ""feel"" more safe and secure.In ""The Last Enemy,"" the protagonist, Stephen Ezard (played brilliantly by Benedict Cumberbatch), becomes a sort of unlikely hero. Well, sort of. I am not going to spoil anything for anybody. Suffice it to say this show is full of drama and suspense and is one where you are never really quite sure which side anybody is really on, except for Ezard and his murdered brother's wife/widow, Yasim Anwar (Anamaria Marinca). And, while viewing there are lots of privacy, moral, and social concerns that the Total Information Awareness (TIA) system brings to mind.This is another great BBC production and is one where you need to keep your attention on the show, the characters, what is said, and how it is said. While it is not filled with blow-'em-up action, there was not any time where I was not involved in the show due to the overall plot, and all the intersecting sub-plots.

"For the price, I don't think you can beat these Wrangler Cargo Twills. They are lighter weight than pure denim cotton which is nice, making these extremely comfortable. The pockets are roomy and plentiful. The fit was as expected. I like the metal button for closure, as opposed to sewn-on buttons, as they always seem to pop off. The rear pockets are patch with no closure, but I am fine with that, I don't need to have them secured. The two main front pockets are fairly deep which is good. The hook and loop closures on the lower front pockets will help keep whatever is stashed fairly secure. As a bonus, above and behind each lower leg pocket is an open small pocket. My iPhone 5c fits perfectly, though, keep in mind, that pocket is not secure. Overall, considering the price these are outstanding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVUPXTDYSDEL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKYS3ES#wasThisHelpful","RVUPXTDYSDEL8","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ok, yes, I am a Mitch Rapp junkie, and have been since 1999. In April this year I became an official Mitch Rapp Ambassador (via the Vince Flynn website and newsletter) and one perk of this taskforce was being able to receive an Advance Readers Edition of this latest Rapp installment, The Survivor, written by Kyle Mills, for an honest review.As a note, I did re-read The Last Man (Nov 2012), the final Rapp story penned by Vince Flynn before his untimely passing (Jun 2013), as a bit of a comparative. So, upfrontwhile this is not Flynn, may he rest in peaceIMO it is hard to tell the difference as Mills obviously immersed himself in all things Rapp. He did extremely well keeping the style, pacing, flavor and feeling of Rapp in tact for the millions of die-hard fans who have enjoyed Rapps wild and heroic exploits over the years.The Survivor does pick up where The Last Man left off, though you can read this one and not be lost. The CIA must, at all costs, recover classified information that was compromised when Joe Rick Rickman, long-tenured CIA black ops master in Afghanistan, went rogue and staged his own kidnapping and beating. He had really put the information and himself for sale to the Pakistanis. Rapp thought that he had ended the threat when he killed Rickman. Unfortunately, he was wrong. From seemingly beyond the grave, a video from Rickman is delivered and reveals he knew way too much about way too many things he should not have known. As it says on the Vince Flynn website: Now its a deadly race as both the Pakistanis and the Americans search for Rickmans accomplices and the information they are slowly leaking to the world. Uh-oh.If you have been a Flynn/Rapp fan, rest assured, you should not be disappointed with Kyle Mills now writing the adventures. He expertly utilizes some of our favorite series characters in this intricately plotted thriller, including CIA Director Irene Kennedy, Rapps pal and former SEAL Team Six Commander Scott Coleman and Stan Hurley, Rapps trainer. For those new to Rapp, the first published book about the counter-terrorism expert was Transfer of Power (Jul 1999) when I got hooked. After many rousing adventures Flynn gave us two books with some back story, thus becoming the real start of Mitch Rapp and his series. They are American Assassin (Oct 2010) and Kill Shot (Feb 2012). All of the books are stand-alones but if you really like political thrillers and great action, you may want to start at the beginning and enjoy the ride, after you read this one, of course.Keeping everything in context with authors and books this rating is a bit tough. For me, it was not a quite a solid five, but definitely higher than just a four...somewhere in between. Unfortunately, there are no stars between those two numbers. So, I rounded it up. Sit back, read, enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP8RSR5LTIJ5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476783454#wasThisHelpful","RP8RSR5LTIJ5S","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have used these Key to Fractions books for over a decade in tutoring programs with tremendous success, particularly with middle and high school students who struggle with math. Rassmussen does an outstanding job guiding the student through the process of working with fractions. The first book is fraction concepts, the second covers multiplication and division of fractions, the third adding and subtracting fractions and, finally, mixed fractions.

"The Gotham series tells the pre-Batman tale and does so with great style. The primary focus in the series is on rookie cop James Gordon, who sees far too much corruption in the Gotham City Police Department and City Hall at the hands of competing mobsters. It also, however, chronicles the development of young Bruce Wayne (and his ever-present butler Alfred Pennyworth) and shows us the bits and pieces that will drive Bruce to eventually become our beloved hero. Suffice it to say that the entire casting has been great. While the key players around those characters are too numerous some of my faves are: Selina ""Cat"" Kyle, Edward ""The Riddler"" Nygma, Fish Mooney and, of course, Oswald ""The Penguin"" Cobblepot. While Gotham does not necessarily follow all of the various plot lines of the comics, it is highly enjoyable watching the interplay between characters, especially in the settings and circumstances in which they find themselves, knowing that some will be tremendous adversaries in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16A9R6DT6GW3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5D4I0Q#wasThisHelpful","R16A9R6DT6GW3S","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blindspot is off to a pretty good start. I do have to say that I love Jaimie Alexander and this role, as the full-body tattooed Jane Doe, allows her to expand her acting abilities, though she is still one kick-*** lady in this series. She is joined by FBI agent Kurt Weller (Sullivan Stapleton) and FBI Director Bethany Mayfair (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) in search of her identity along with why she has all the tats. The acting is solid from all of the cast and the show moves at a good pace. At the end of the first episode there are a couple of mysteries laid out to us regarding what will/may be coming, though we do not know exactly what they mean, nor when we will find out, nor in what context. It is not quite a 5-star, but I think the potential is definitely there. A lot will depend on what direction they take this, and how they get the series there.EPISODE 2: And it continues ... the tattoos provide clues ... people die for some reason yet we do not know why ... there is more backstory, not just for Jane Doe, but also for Weller ...

As thrillers (not mysteries) go, this is a bit predictable at times but overall there is enough good action and suspense mixed in to the (not overly original) plot and sub-plots to keep one entertained.

"I was able to find an absolutely mint condition used Nikkor 80-400 FX lens to couple with my Nikon D7000 DX body, which basically converts to a 120-600mm 35mm equivalent range lens. I earlier owned the Sigma 170-500mm and while the range of the Sigma went a bit further, the lower band is definitely better.One of the beautiful aspects with this glass is that it has VR (Vibration Reduction), where the Sigma did not, meaning that I do not have to use a tripod for most shots. When shooting handheld the percentage of in-focus shots, not blurry shots to shake, is nearly 100%.  With fast action shots there may be some blur due to the speed of the object in motion, but certainly not always.  And, some of those look pretty good anyway.There certainly are times when the lens does not focus as fast as my prime 50mm or even my 18-105mm but the difference has not caused me to lose any shots I really wanted.  And, if you don't need the full range there is a ""Limit"" switch which, when turned on, allows for faster focus.  For me, the primary reason for my purchase is the long range so I really do not use that feature.The colors are crisp and clear with great contrast.  The zoom is smooth throughout, with no stickiness anywhere.  The collar can get in the way when focusing so mine is off most of the time.  Like many lenses, there may be some chromatic aberration (CA) in really high-contrast situations where the background is quite bright and foreground objects are extremely dark.Keep in mind that this is a pretty heavy piece of glass.  That said, I have not suffered any lens creep issues, like I did with the Sigma.This lens does not have the Nikon Silent Wave Motor (i.e., it is not an AF-S version) which means that it will work in both AF and MF mode only with camera bodies that have the motor to drive the lens, such as a D80, D600, D4, D7000, etc.  But, it will only work in manual focus mode on models without the motor, such as the D40, D60, D3100, D5300, etc.I love this lens.  For the money paid, I am ecstatic with my Nikkor 80-400mm and would highly recommend it to anyone who must have greater than a 300mm focal range.  If I had the money to get the 80-400mm AF-S model would I?  Not sure.  This is working perfectly for me, with the caveats as above.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXROVZYE6XEM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005LEOO#wasThisHelpful","RXROVZYE6XEM9","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As you watch, season to season, the characters become more and more real and, for many, much more complex, and everyone I know who watches Downton has their favorites, for a variety of quite different reasons. There are definitely scenes that will make you quite happy, and, conversely, quite sad. The series, at one time or another, touches on about every emotion that a person has. This is one of two TV shows that I own the entire lot on Blu-Ray (the other being Game of Thrones) so that I am able to watch whenever I want, but also so that I may loan to others to enjoy.

"Great series, Nikita has it all. Though Maggie Q had been in earlier flicks, I fell in love with her in MI3 and Live Free or Die Hard. When this series was first announced I couldn't wait for it to air. Maggie Q is, IMO, fabulous in her role as a trained assassin gone rogue, and on a mission. The other main and supporting actors also do extremely well in creating characters you will either love or hate, or, in some cases, can't make up your mind because you really aren't quite sure whose side they are really on. One of the great features about the series is that most of the episodes are self contained, though all of them build upon each other, including the use of flashbacks, to further develop characters and plots and sub-plots (of which there are several).

"Let's face it, if you enjoy Arnold it is probably because of the action and adventure and, lots of times, the campy fun that his flicks tend to deliver. For me, The Last Stand is a bit of a throwback to his 80's movies but with much better Fx. Overall, this is quite fun with Arnold as a long-time cop who saw it all in Southern California and is now enjoying his final working years in peace and quiet as the sheriff of a small Arizona town, near the Mexico border. That all comes to a horrific end with some very bad guys, including a very rich cartel boss, heading his way. There are some great chase scenes and a wild and crazy shoot 'em up. A very good cast (including Forest Whitaker, Jaimie Alexander, Eduardo Noriega, to name a few) adds to Arnold keeping his town ... uh ... sort of safe.

"I have loved drinking coffee for over 40 years. While I do sample other flavors hazelnut has been my all-time favorite. Over the past decade or so I have gradually been switching my eating and drinking to natural and organic fare. For the most part it has been pretty easy and I do feel better. Then about a year ago I decided that I had to go decaffeinated. Unfortunately finding an organic decaf hazelnut (or almost any flavor for that matter) that is not artificially flavored has been a serious challenge. Thus, when I ran across Latitude 23.5 ""utilizing only organic flavors with no PG's, artificial stabilizers or preservatives"" I was thrilled and ordered it immediately. Though it was delivered mid-afternoon, I had to try it. Opening the package offered a very nice aroma, as did the brewing process. The coffee has an excellent nutty flavor with no unpleasant after taste. If you want organic dcaf hazelnut -- this is the one. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RELEM0K6HOO98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V54DUYI#wasThisHelpful","RELEM0K6HOO98","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When travelling I feel safe knowing that this case will protect my drive from pretty much anything.

"****************** UPDATE: Sept 22.Back down to $54.99 as of this morning, Better but still should be in the $40s.****************** UPDATE: Sept 19.While I am glad I pre-ordered this at $54.99, I was hoping that with the low price guarantee that the price would go down, not up...way up. Amazon should be ashamed gouging their customers at $71.99 on the day of release. However, that will not lower my star rating for the series itself, as those 5 stars were earned. Amazon, however, gets 0 stars for extreme price fixing on this ""exclusive.""****************** ORIGINAL REVIEWSeason 2 definitely takes off where Season 1 ended, with S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division) having collapsed due to extensive infiltration by Hydra. The principal cast, consisting of Clark Gregg (Phil Coulsen), Ming-Na Wen (Melinda May), Brett Dalton Grant Ward), Chloe Bennet (Skye), Iain De Caestecker (Leo Fitz), and Elizabeth Henstridge (Jenna Simmons) are joined by Nick Blood (Lance Hunter) and Adrianne Palicki (Bobbi Morse) and all turn in excellent performances. There is a lot more action and suspense in year two with various sub-plots occurring to keep you on your toes. The very much improved special effects simply adds to the overall value. One of the aspects that makes the Marvel Cinematic Universe so great happens to be the wealth of characters and being able to draw on them. Appearances by Lady Sif (Jaimie Alexander), Timothy ""Dum Dum"" Dugan (Neal McDonough), Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), to name a few, along with interweaving story arcs from the movies adds a great deal to the entertainment of the series. Then, let's just add some outstanding Edward James Olmos (as Robert Gonzales) into the mix and see where you peg him. If you followed Season 1 during the building stage of this intricate show then you really need to get Season 2. IMO this is a definite must have for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans. Pre-ordered and waiting. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FKROFM72GCSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0117UHFU4#wasThisHelpful","R2FKROFM72GCSZ","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After first meeting Hayley Atwell as Agent Peggy Carter in Captain America The First Avenger I definitely wanted to see more of her. Then Marvel announced her own mini-series for TV. While it was only 8 episodes long the plot and sub-plots worked very well. As an agent at the SSR (Strategic Scientific Reserve) Carter finds herself seriously undervalued - and unused - by the other agents, which was definitely par for 1946, despite her accomplishments during the war. When Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) is accused of high treason it takes all of her wit and wisdom to assist him. During her escapades she is aided by Edwin Jarvis (James DArcy), Stark's butler. The addition of the Howling Commandos during one episode was a great surprise and quite fun. Overall, for me, Agent Carter offers great characters and is a nice addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Pre-ordered and waiting!******************** UPDATE SEPT 21My 5 star rating stands as that is for the series itself. That said, I was truly hoping the pre-release price I paid would have gone down into the low-to-mid $20's because a 2-disc set (8 episodes, 6 hours) is just not worth $36, especially as the only extras are a few minutes of bloopers. And, there is no iTunes Digital Copy nor any UltraViolet HD for VuDu or Flixster. Disney and Marvel need to seriously examine how to keep their fans happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27Z71YB7MZIRH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0117ULG36#wasThisHelpful","R27Z71YB7MZIRH","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one is probably my favorite of all the wild and crazy Die Hard movies. Though 12 long years passed since the previous installment, this flick is fully updated, except that John McClane (Bruce Willis) really isn't, and that is why it works so well. Teamed with a young hacker, Matt Farrell (Justin Long), that he ends up having to protect from cyber terrorists, McClane simply does his thing. As with all the Die Hard movies, as well as most anything nowadays, don't look for a whole lot of realism. This is all out, over the top, fun. There are lots of explosions, some great chases and all-around fantastic action, making for pure a adrenaline rush. Timothy Olyphant and Maggie Q make for a dangerously bad duo.

"I enjoy pretty much anything related to the legend of King Arthur and Merlin, the key word being legend. The Last Legion is, once again, a different take on the tale and an enjoyable one at that, adding a lot more Roman lore into the story than others I have watched, and with a few twists of its own. It is certainly not the best and far from the worst Arthurian-based film. Colin Firth, Ben Kingsley and the beautiful (and deadly) Aishwarya Rai headline a cast protecting a young and newly crowned emperor Romulus Augustulus (Thomas Sangster). Kingsley is great as Merlin/Ambrosinus and Firth does a very good depiction of Aurelius. Rai is superb as the Keralite warrior, Mira. There are some good action scenes, the pace moved along well and there were ample battles (not overly bloody), many of which Rai flat out steals the scene. My biggest quibble would be the final battle, not bad but not as good as it could have been. Still, The Last Legion was an overall entertaining Arthurian-based movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RXG1MUC0BVB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IF4EX2#wasThisHelpful","R1RXG1MUC0BVB3","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As long as your DSLR is UHS-compatible this SD card is a great deal for price and performance. The 94mb listed is, of course, for read speed. The write speed is about half of that, but is a great deal nonetheless, especially for the price Amazon sells these for, and an even better deal if you catch a lighting deal. I had used Sandisk Ultra for many years and decided to give the Sony a try during a lightning deal and I am more than pleased with the results. For most people this card should perform very well. This one is in my Nikon D7100. Do keep in mind those speeds are while in the camera. On a computer both will be slower on USB 2.0, but should be near the same with USB 3.0.

"The first thing you notice with B+W filters is the weight. The rings are constructed of brass, not aluminum, making them more sturdy and they will not bind as aluminum filters may do. I have also found that threading the filter on my Nikkor 70-200 f/4 is easy and smooth. The next thing is that this UV Haze filter is actually clear, there is absolutely no sign of slight tinting that I have noticed with other UV filters I have used in the past. This, of course, means that the optical quality of images remains true. The Multi-Resistant Coating (MRC) on B+W is amazing. To me they seem much easier to clean than other brands I have used. I typically use just a microfiber cloth which does the job just fine. Having a lens filter also makes sense to protect your front element from scratches or even breakage because, well, it is much less expensive to replace a filter than the lens. In terms of my pinch-style lens cap, no issue, the cap stays on and fits perfectly. I am sold on B+W, they are pure quality, and have them mounted on all of my lenses.

"With Pierce Brosnan as the bad guy assassin (codename The Watchmaker) and Milla Jovovich the heroine (security expert Kate Abbott), you are set for an entertaining game of cat-and-mouse espionage. Abbott is at the top of her game in security within the US State Department and gets transferred to the Embassy in London. Unfortunately for her, she steps into the middle of intricate plans already in play by terrorists and she ends up not knowing whom she can trust. I am not going to nit-pick the plot or what shoulda coulda woulda been done in real life, as even the best of flicks suffer in some way with the same, but suffice it to say I was engaged. Survivor does not have the volume of blow-em-up sequences as a Bond or a Bourne, but has some good sequences of suspense and action. As the end neared I was wondering how Abbott was going to stop the attack. Jovovich delivers a strong performance and while Brosnan takes getting used to as a cold-blooded villain he pulls it off well. Other notable performances by Dylan McDermott, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster and James D'Arcy. Not a five star but I definitely enjoyed it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WURXSO9O68J0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UL9055U#wasThisHelpful","R1WURXSO9O68J0","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Amazon production of Bosch does credit to Michael Connelly's character, Hieronymus (Harry) Bosch. I read about 7 or 8 of the novel series years ago and enjoyed them and the TV series captured the essence of Bosch, especially what makes him tick and what gets him ticked off, very well. I found the casting to be very good, overall, and the pace moved well. His friends (like his partner and the Lieutenant), his lover (a female rookie cop), his biggest enemy (the Captain) and his sometimes ally when it suits him (the Deputy Chief) add great dimension and, at times, tension to the show. Don't worry if you haven't read the books, you will see Bosch the way Connelly created him, and if you have read any of the books you will most likely appreciate how true the storyline of this series is. This is ten shows. As with a captivating book, be prepared to continue, though other things call for your attention.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26SA4LLIB3MRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3MMLHC#wasThisHelpful","R26SA4LLIB3MRB","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I will not give away any of the basics that make it so, be prepared going in that this 10-part series is unlike any other cinematic version in the Arthurian legend category. Despite that major difference (this is ""Hollywood"" after all), the lone season was entertaining although incomplete. There is no Season Two, due to schedule conflicts with major members of the cast. Even though many modern historians debate/dispute the actual existence of King Arthur, as most of the details concerning Arthur, during the late 5th and early 6th centuries, come from folklore, the legend continues and, if nothing else, provides wonderful entertainment. IMO Eva Green, as Morgan, absolutely stole the show in Camelot. She was completely captivating and convincing as the conniving sorceress daughter of Uther Pendragon. Claire Forlani was beautifully cast as Arthur's biological mother, Lady Igraine. It was, at first, hard for me to accept this depiction of Merlin, portrayed by Ralph Fiennes, but the character grew on me as the season progressed. In terms of Arthur and his men, I was a bit disappointed with Jamie Campbell Bower as Arthur as he does not fit the ""mold"" that has been set for this legendary king. That said, the rest were very good to great, especially Clive Standen as Gawain. This series is not on the same scale as Game of Thrones but, overall, the costumes, sets and locations were done very well. If you are looking for something that follows the traditional Arthur storyline, this is not it. If you are looking for a new twist on the tale you may want to explore Camelot. As a note, this is definitely an r-rated version of the beloved story of King Arthur.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OG0L4DMK6S5G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LROMSY#wasThisHelpful","R2OG0L4DMK6S5G","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TAK3N involves the same main characters as the first two (Liam Neeson, Famke Janssen, Maggie Grace, Leland Orser) and adds a new one (Forest Whitaker) along with a whole lot of gun fights and car chases. It seems Bryan Mills (Liam) just can't catch a break. He is framed for murdering his ex-wife, Lenore Mills-St. John (Famke). He is chased by LAPD Inspector Frank Dotzler (Forest) and his team. All the while, Mills is chasing down leads on Lenore's murderer, with help from his closest covert co-workers and friends, particularly Sam Gilroy (Orser), while trying to keep his daughter Kim (Maggie) out of harm's way. And, of course, then there is the ex-Spetsnaz businessman and his Russian thugs thrown in for good measure. This is not a complicated whodunit, but it is entertaining for those liking action/adventure movies, as well as Neeson fans. Do keep in mind that this is a movie and there are many things that just could not/would not happen in real life. However, that is the case with pretty much anything produced in Hollywood.

Anyone who has played the game Battleship will recognize the weapons fired by the aliens, a nice touch to tie in the game and movie.

"I thoroughly enjoy Marvel's Agent Carter and Hayley Atwell plays the part of Peggy perfectly. Her role at SSR is something she has to deal with in a male-dominated workplace, where the men don't care for a female in their midst. Her flashbacks about Captain America keep things in perspective and provide more insight to what goes on in her universe as the season goes on and she earns her place in the boy's club. The other main characters, as well as recurring and guests, add their own unique quirks and twists to the show. The fact that Howard Stark is on the run as a traitor to the US provides a story where you are not quite sure how he will be cleared, assuming that he will be. Having the addition of the 107th (the Howling Commandos from Captain America: The First Avenger) join in was a brilliant play by the writers.

"This is another enjoyable Sean Dillon (and Company) caper, the 21st featuring the former Provisional IRA enforcer, turned agent for the British Secret Service. While not my favorite in this long-lasting franchise, it carries most all of the hallmarks that have come to be known throughout. The main difference being, in the last several books, that Dillon, who is now about 62, is not as spry as he was when the series started, though he is still feared and a threat to most. The plot is fairly typical with Dillon and his cohorts (Brig Gen Ferguson, Capt Sarah Gideon, Maj Charles Roper, Billy, and his uncle Harry, Salter) having to ""save the day,"" so to speak, this time from the plans of an Al-Queda man, known only as the Master who is unknown outside the circle of his Council and who has utter control over several assets worldwide. The identity of the Master does add a twist to the story. They are joined in their escapade by none other than former US President Jake Cazalet (who first appeared in the series in the 1997 book ""The President's Daughter""). I will admit it is not one of Higgins' best works, with incorrect details such as a non-existent protection detail for an ex-president, but for a Sean Dillon fan, it was an enjoyable read, containing plenty of action with some twists and turns along the way. The main action takes place in Nantucket (Massachusetts, USA), Drumgoole (Ireland), Paris (France) and London (England), with a few other locations thrown in for good measure. I rate this book half way between a 3 (due to a few detail inaccuracies, though many popular authors suffer from this) and a 4 (as I like the characters and the plot with sub-plots), so will round it up. For those interested, the Sean Dillon tales begin with ""Eye of the Storm"" (1992).","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23IHBPUAVC72U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399171940#wasThisHelpful","R23IHBPUAVC72U","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was very easy to get connected and start calling and receiving calls. I then moved to Florida a year later. It was a breeze to reconnect and get a new local number. I appreciate the low cost (approx $12/mo including taxes) vs most carriers. While BasicTalk is not as cheap as MagicJack, I had owned that before BasicTalk and it was not nearly as good, in quality and clarity, something to me that needs to be as near to perfect as possible. The only thing I ever experience with BasicTalk is that once in a while, usually after a short outage or power surge, that my Caller ID doesn't work. I discovered that all I have to do is reboot the little black box and it works again. So, 4.5 stars rounded up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A2MZGMQ698PW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1U2UBC#wasThisHelpful","R1A2MZGMQ698PW","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have owned these for about five months and they have been working pretty much as advertised. I needed to have some illumination in areas where the light switch is located in the dark and there were no outlets nearby to place a night light. Not sure about a three meter (roughly 10 feet) range but for sure within about six or seven feet they do come on. Unless there is continual motion they only stay lit about 20 or 25 seconds, which for me is plenty of time to hit the light switch and is also good for battery life. There are three settings: auto (ie motion sensor), continuous, and off. Mine are set to auto. One is in a higher traffic area and the original batteries (three AAA) are still in. I like that they can be mounted with either screws, by magnet or can be hung by a handle that flips up from the back. I have had no issues with the one using magnet, it has never moved from where I placed it. As a note, when they arrived one was defective but it was rapidly replaced by the company.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E5GT6FF9RPL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQS172G#wasThisHelpful","R3E5GT6FF9RPL1","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novella by Hubbard is extremely fun and entertaining. And, yes I did say swashbuckling (as in pirates) and fantasy. The story, written in 1940, is quite original and is very much along the lines of tales that are found in, for those who remember, Rod Serling's ""The Twilight Zone."" The protagonist, a struggling New York pianist named Mike de Wolf, suddenly finds himself on a Caribbean beach as a 17th century villain (Spanish Admiral and Pirate, Miguel de Lobo) in his friend's (Horace Hackett) upcoming but behind-the-deadline high-seas novel, ""Blood and Loot."" Knowing as he does the fate of the bad guy in virtually anything written by his friend, Mike must use what little free will he finds that he has in order to work out his hoped-for escape from the inevitable. To make matters worse, there are those times when Horace changes his mind and, thus, changes the story, further complicating Mikes plight. Along the way, Mikes encounters in this fictional - yet possibly deadly for him - world are expertly handled. A very enjoyable escape from the every day world and recommended to anyone, especially adventure, fantasy and science fiction readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AMCRLSX85FB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008Y8CL5M#wasThisHelpful","R3AMCRLSX85FB2","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Puma's fit well and are definitely comfortable, as well as having some great style. The construction seems good, the arch support is nice, and I received them with no loose threads. For me the fit was good. I wear a 13, ordered a 13, and they were slightly snug when I first wore them but loosened up just a bit. They are good for longer walks though not sure how long they would last if done continuously. The only thing I really have a gripe about is that they do not breathe that well.

"The movie is set in 1991, a couple of years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In Washington DC, it is the last day working at the CIA for Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) who he is packing things in his office, ready for retirement. Then he learns that his protg, Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), had been captured and is being held in China. To complicate matters, the US and China are in trade talks. The bureaucratic CIA is, obviously, less than thrilled that the brash and bold young Bishop has threatened the diplomatic goings-on and there are those determined to abandon him. Muir decides to help the task force who are deciding how best to handle the issue but has his own plans, including the possibility of getting Bishop out of captivity. Muir plays a very adept chess game with his counter-parts at Langley, seemingly working with them by providing background etc on Bishop, all the while maneuvering various players in this Spy Game to achieve his goal. Redford and Pitt are perfect for their roles, and there is ample suspense and some good action in this suspenseful tale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGDEVV18KMUDZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001JI8IJW#wasThisHelpful","RGDEVV18KMUDZ","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an outstanding charger. I have a smaller portable (3200 mAh) but needed to get a charger with more juice, especially when travelling, as I hate having to look for wall outlets. There are four LED lights on the front, each signifying about 25% so with 2 lights there is about 50% remaining. When you connect a device to charge you must push the 'on' button to start the cycle. When charging the RAV, the LED lights flash, otherwise they are solid. A huge benefit is that you can charge two devices simultaneously (ie, two phones, a phone and a tablet). The unit itself arrived charged and first use was with an iPhone 5c (using the Apple cord), which went from 20% to 100% in just under 80 minutes, or about 1% per minute, and the 4 blue LEDs still glowed (though the 4th was weaker). I have charged my phone 5 times and still had one LED glow. To protect the charger, I carry it in a Case Logic QHDC-101 Portable Hard Drive Case...it fits perfectly, along with 2 cords. Any price at two Jackson's (or less) is a bargain for the quality and convenience that this RAVPower charger provides.

"The tires need replacing after only 30,000 miles. I purchased these tires a bit over 4 years ago for a Mitsubishi Outlander (though the warning states it does not fit my vehicle). I am your average driver, and did a good mix of city driving with highway mixed in and then, towards the end, a 1,200 mile move. The alignment and balance were always kept in so I am not sure why they did not last longer. I lived in Pennsylvania and was not too impressed with either snow or heavier wet-road conditions, as there was not much grip. I can state that the tires did ride fairly quiet and on dry road conditions the stability and traction were definitely above average, which is why I am giving a two star rating instead of one. But, overall, I am disappointed in these tires.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38VP1PFE906SP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RENI3I#wasThisHelpful","R38VP1PFE906SP","A2FSOHSM9X13JT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FSOHSM9X13JT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The set-up is very quick with its gold-plated USB connection with either PC or Mac. I have both and have tried it on each of them with very good results. For best performance read the instructions because you may first experience background noise but this is easily handled by going to you mic settings and turning the AGC off.

"As a casual hybrid bike rider, I find the Green Guru narrow strap to work very well. Mine measures just slightly over 14.25"" in length and is 1"" wide.

The stitched-on silver piece is reflective but I do not count on that as a life saver at night, as I have spoke lights, as well as front and rear lights that I use for safety precautions. The Velcro holds tight and definitely protects my pant leg from getting anywhere near the gears, which is exactly what it is supposed to do.

I have owned it for a few months and gone through numerous spikes (five within two hours on one day) and two outages so far and this has performed seamlessly. The battery and surge outlets totally protect my iMac, modem, printer, and two phone lines, while the surge-only outlets take care of digital photo frames and some lights. And, it is totally quiet. The size (approx. 4""x9""x10"") is great, the gloss and matt black color combo looks good and it certainly seems to be built well. While it claims a runtime of two minutes at full load, I am nowhere near full and know for sure it goes more than five with what I have connected, based on one particular outage.

I already have a few packing cubes, which are the eBags brand in the medium size.  These C+F packing cubes are just as nice as the more expensive eBags packing cubes that I have.  I actually like them better, because they are an inch deeper which is convenient when packing bulkier items like pants and sweatshirts.  There is a mesh panel on the front of the cubes, which allows for ventilation and also allows you to see what is packed at the top of each cube.  Each cube has 2 heavy duty YKK zippers.  Two zippers make it easy to close each cubes up, as opposed to only having one zipper and having to pull it all around the cube.  There is a handle on the top of each cube, allowing for easy handling.  The cubes are made from a lightweight but very sturdy nylon.  The attached tag states they can be hand washed and drip dried.  The stitching is even and well done.  My only small complaint is that these do not come in various colors at the present time.

"We have 3 cats, and over the last several years I have bought a couple of different litter mats to try and control the mess.  This is my favorite one so far.  The best thing is the size (35"" x 23"").  It is big enough that the cats usually walk on it when exiting the litter box, instead of just jumping over it like they did with the smaller mats we owned.  The feel of the mat also seems to be pleasing to their paws.  It is soft, but textured to catch the excess litter.  I have walked over it barefoot myself, and it does not hurt my feet like the previous mat we had.  One of my cats likes to nap on it, so I am assuming it is comfortable.  If I had to bring up one small negative, the mat smelled of PVC when it first arrived.  I laid it out on the covered porch for a day, and it did air out quickly.  I typically clean the mat by using the vacuum cleaner hose.  Once every week or two, I carry it outside and give it a good shake to knock out the litter.

I've bought personalized labels from Dinkleboo and Lovable Labels for a lower cost per label.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LMNRXR1GT5VR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVUQ52C#wasThisHelpful","R1LMNRXR1GT5VR","ALQ4USPEQ9L5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALQ4USPEQ9L5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this Kyocera Ceramic Nonstick Fry Pan from the Amazon Vine Review program.  To be perfectly honest, I wasn't expecting much.  My only prior experience with a ceramic nonstick pan is an ""as seen on TV"" pan that my parents own.  So I was pleasantly surprised when I received this and saw how nicely it is made.  The pan is a nice weight, and well balanced.  The handle is attached with 3 sturdy rivets.  The ceramic nonstick coating is very smooth.  I tried cooking an egg in the pan with no oil, butter, etc and it didn't stick at all.  The instructions say to not use anything higher than the medium setting on your stove.  I especially like the deepness of this pan (about 4 inches), and I plan on using it the next time I make a stir fry.  My only small disappointment is that a lid isn't included.  Only time will tell how long the ceramic nonstick coating will last, but I'm only using nylon and plastic utensils to protect the finish.  The pan is hand wash only, which is not an issue, since it only needs a quick wipe with a soapy rag or brush to clean.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TQS6X85ARCA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5HE646#wasThisHelpful","R2TQS6X85ARCA4","ALQ4USPEQ9L5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALQ4USPEQ9L5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't have a brand loyalty for toilet paper.  Depending what is on sale, or what I have a coupon for, I buy Charmin, Quilted Northern, Cottonelle, etc.  One thing that I have noticed, that regardless of whether I buy single ply toilet paper or the expensive thick stuff, my family still uses the same length of paper.  So, we never save money by purchasing the thicker paper, and the thicker paper is more likely to clog the toilet.  (Especially with a 4 year old child who thinks that more is better.)  This Charmin Basic is thicker than most single ply papers, so it's strong enough to handle messy jobs.  The ""huge"" rolls are indeed big, and I don't have to change the roll quite as often.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BBHELSG3DZ9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L3EA4P8#wasThisHelpful","R1BBHELSG3DZ9H","ALQ4USPEQ9L5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALQ4USPEQ9L5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this Bissell Bolt cordless vacuum cleaner from the Amazon Vine Review program.  The floors in my house are wood and tile.  Other than a couple of small area rugs and carpeted stair treads, we have no carpeting.Setting up the vacuum was very simple.  It consisted of unfolding the handle, snapping on the brush head, and plugging in the charger.  All in all, it took less than 5 minutes, including opening up the box.  I left it on the charger overnight, and it was ready to go the following morning.  The charger plugs directly into the vacuum cleaner.  Unfortunately, the nickel-metal hydride battery is not replaceable.This small vacuum is great for quick pickups.  It runs for around 13-15 minutes, depending on whether the brush roll is being used. I have used it a couple of times of my stairs, which is much less cumbersome than using a full size vacuum cleaner.  I clean up under my kitchen table at least a couple of times a day, and I use it occasionally to pick up scattered cat food, cat litter, etc.  It isn't a replacement for a full-size vacuum, but a very convenient item.  It is light, and fairly easy to maneuver.  My 4 year old daughter uses it after meal times to clean up the mess that she usually makes under the table.The brush roll can be turned on or off, which I appreciate, since I don't want to damage my wood floors.  The unit has a removable hand vacuum, which is convenient for tight areas such as behind the toilet.  The handle of the vacuum folds for more compact storage.  I store mine in the coat closet, and when folded, it is short enough to go under the hanging garments.  The vacuum does tip easily when left standing though because it is so lightweight.  I personally think this problem as well as the maneuverability would be improved if the base of the vacuum cleaner weighed a few more ounces.  I also own a Hoover Linx cordless vacuum cleaner (now discontinued), which has an 18 volt battery, and because of that works much better than this 12 volt Bissell Bolt.  Bissell does make a similar cordless vacuum in an 18 volt version, and I would be interested to see how that compares to the Hoover Linx.  Overall, I rate this as a 5 star item, especially with the current pricing.  Don't expect it to replace your full sized vacuum cleaner, but you'll definitely be pulling out that cumbersome item much less frequently.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO166S56Q0AIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LASI4BI#wasThisHelpful","RO166S56Q0AIZ","ALQ4USPEQ9L5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALQ4USPEQ9L5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this Lincoln Logs Little Prairie Farmhouse Building set from the Amazon Vine Review program.  I played with Lincoln Logs when I was a child, and I bought my older child a set for his third birthday.  My daughter is 4 1/2 years old, and had absolutely no interest in her big brother's set of Lincoln Logs that I brought out of storage.  She insisted that it was a toy for boys, and wouldn't even try playing with them.Her attitude changed drastically when the mail truck came last week with this package of Lincoln Logs with pink windows, door, and gate, girly colored ponies, and figurine.  She has played with these for at least an hour per day, and quickly forgot her prior protests about Lincoln Logs being only for boys.My major complaint about the set is that there aren't nearly enough big pieces.  Of the 101 logs in this set, over half are mini logs, which are hard to build houses with.  My daughter was getting frustrated, and lost interest in the toy after the initial 10-15 minutes.  I ended up adding her older brother's traditional set of Lincoln Logs to this, which gave her plenty of larger logs to build with, as well as the old fashioned wooden slats that used to serve as roof pieces.  This could easily be a 5 star product, if only the manufacturer would spend the extra few cents for more larger logs.I can only recommend this Little Prairie Farmhouse Building set if you plan on buying it as an addition to a larger set of Lincoln Logs that contains more of the longer logs.  As a standalone toy, this particular set has very little versatility on its own.  If you want your child to have the Lincoln Log experience that you had as a child, you'll definitely need more logs that what are included in this set.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38PL6FLKWNJVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Q826EW#wasThisHelpful","R38PL6FLKWNJVX","ALQ4USPEQ9L5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALQ4USPEQ9L5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 4 year old daughter recently started pre-kindergarten, and all of her new little friends are great at sharing.  By sharing, I mean sharing their germs, as well as toys and classroom supplies.  She came home from school a couple of days ago complaining of a sore throat, and by the following morning she had developed a cold.The recommended dosage is by age, not weight.  A measuring cup comes with this, but we prefer using an oral syringe.  She only complained mildly about the taste of this medicine, but she is old enough to realize that she would rather take a small dose of not-so-great tasting medication, rather than feel sick.  This does contain acetaminophen (also known as Tylenol), so it's important not to accidentally overdose your child and their young liver.  This can be taken 5 times per a 24 hour period, and I've been giving it to my daughter every 5 hours, except when she's sleeping at night.  It is controlling her cold symptoms of a low-grade fever, cough, and stuffy nose very well for about 4 hours.  I like that this doesn't contain dyes like most children's medications, and is clear in color.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36U1N3767VHGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEQFOE6#wasThisHelpful","R36U1N3767VHGA","ALQ4USPEQ9L5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALQ4USPEQ9L5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Note that Crenova provided me with this product in exchange for an impartial review.The Crenova High Pressure Garden Hose Nozzle Sprayer is a well built solid basic adjustable hose nozzle sprayer.  It is constructed of metal which is covered in a thick rubber coating, black near the inlet and red closer to the nozzle.  An optional quick-connect adapter is included (I did not test this out as my hoses are not quick-connect).The Crenova Nozzle prayer works like any other nozzle sprayer as it adjusts by turning the outer (red) part of the unit.  However, it is a bit unusual as OFF is the the fully extended position; turning the adjustment backwards gets you a powerful jet / less powerful jet / shower / ""flood"" setting.  The only disadvantage I see is that the water flow is pretty much at 100% for all of the adjustments; there is no way to get a light shower or mist setting.Overall a solid nozzle sprayer that meets almost all my needs and should last a long time.

"My ASUS RT-N66U Dual-Band Wireless-N900 Gigabit Router is in one corner of my basement and is required to supply wireless on both the 2.4 Ghz and 5.0 Ghz bands in my three level home.  Although I think that the Asus does an admirable job doing this, sometimes the wireless strength can be a bit iffy in the far corner of the 2nd floor, esp. with the 2.4 GHz band which is rather crowded due to about 20 other signals I pick up from the neighborhood.  So I was happy to give this set of Linksys High-Gain Antennas a try.So here are the test results I got from using Inssider Home software.  Note that with both sets of three antennas I observed the power vary considerably over time, so below I have listed the best case (highest signal) observed.** RT-N66U using the stock antennas (advertised peak gain 3dBi/ 5dBi) - measures -50db max at 2.4 GHz, -60 dB max at 5.0 GHz (closer to zero is better).** RT-N66U using the Linksys antennas (advertised peak gain 4dBi/ 7dBi) - measures -49 dB max at 2.4 GHz, -50 dB max at 5.0 GHz.So in my house, after tweaking the antenna positions a few times, I ended up with an insignificant 1 dB improvement at 2.4 GHz and a surprising 10 dB improvement at 5.0 GHz.  Now it is possible that my old stock antennas were not in an optimal position, since a 10 dB improvement is way over what I should have expected with this upgrade - however it is clear that these antennas did give me a stronger 5.0 GHz signal in the farthest reaches of my house.I do have two issues with these antennas.  The first is a complete lack of documentation; there is nothing inside the product box other than the antennas themselves.  I would have hoped at least for some information on optimal positioning of the antennas.  The second issue is the high price - I was provided a set of these for review but even with the improvement observed I could not justify spending more than about half the current price on these.  But if you really need that last bit of 5.0 GHz signal strength, and can get these for an acceptable price, then the I would the Linksys High-Gain Antennas a recommended upgrade.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ML2FLT4EZNZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YJJAUSA#wasThisHelpful","R3ML2FLT4EZNZG","A1ILWPH1GHUXE2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ILWPH1GHUXE2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Also note that this is being sold at a very good price, but does not include cushions - and I never realized how much some of these cushions can go for!

"The Nutro Company Adult Cat Chunky Loaf Chicken Dinner certainly has an appetizing and nutritious list of ingredients for cats: the first four ingredients are chicken, chicken broth, chicken liver, and pork broth, and does not contain any grains or any fruits / vegetables that I assume any self-respecting cat would not eat on its own.Unfortunately, only one of my two cats found this wet food agreeable.  The other took a nibble, thought about it for a few seconds, and walked away.  The other one thought it was great, but I am less likely to stock a cat food that only one of them enjoys.  If the younger second cat changes his mind and starts to eat this stuff, then the quality ingredient list could make this a five-star product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HYIZG0K5KE71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZMCB06#wasThisHelpful","R2HYIZG0K5KE71","A1ILWPH1GHUXE2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ILWPH1GHUXE2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In initial testing, Cat's Pride Fresh & Light litter seems to work as advertised.  It helps to keep the litter box smell down, is a clumping litter that I prefer, and is in fact lighter than comparable litters that our family has used in the past.However, considering the cost of this litter compared to what I pay locally for competitive brands like Arm & Hammer, I can't see switching to this litter permanently.  (36 pounds of this product costs up to 3x what I'd pay locally for 40 pounds of other litter products.)  Perhaps if the cost of this drops significantly I'd consider using this as our standard litter box product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I44EYUJAHO65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6EXLDA#wasThisHelpful","R2I44EYUJAHO65","A1ILWPH1GHUXE2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ILWPH1GHUXE2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is now overall my favorite portable wireless speaker.  It has OK bass considering its small size, and clear midrange and treble.  Comparing this to my previous favorite, the Harman Kardon Esquire Portable Wireless Speaker, it has a bit less low end bass but has a much clearer midrange and treble.Other benefits of the Braven Balance are its water resistance (I don't have the courage to actually dunk this in water, but I have no doubt as to its protection from splashes and rain),  and it's ability to serve as a charger for smart phones and other USB devices.  It's also very easy to pair this to your Bluetooth device.The only thing I don't quite get is the ""boost"" feature.  Holding down the Power and Volume+ buttons together for a few seconds adds a boost to the output volume.  At first I thought this was a neat idea, but just like in This Is Spinal Tap movie you have to wonder why Braven included a special control to set the volume to 11, when it would have been much easier just to make 10 louder?  But I will admit that every time I ""turn the volume up to 11"" I chuckle to myself a little bit.Despite that idiosyncrasy, highly recommended.----------Nigel Tufnel: The numbers all go to eleven. Look, right across the board, eleven, eleven, eleven and...Marty DiBergi: Oh, I see. And most amps go up to ten?Nigel Tufnel: Exactly.Marty DiBergi: Does that mean it's louder? Is it any louder?Nigel Tufnel: Well, it's one louder, isn't it? It's not ten. You see, most blokes, you know, will be playing at ten. You're on ten here, all the way up, all the way up, all the way up, you're on ten on your guitar. Where can you go from there? Where?Marty DiBergi: I don't know.Nigel Tufnel: Nowhere. Exactly. What we do is, if we need that extra push over the cliff, you know what we do?Marty DiBergi: Put it up to eleven.Nigel Tufnel: Eleven. Exactly.

"My wife bought two of these Better Homes and Gardens Chaise Lounges from another site and I put them together.  Assembly really wasn't an issue, less than 30 minutes each.  The design was quite handsome, and the included cushion was really nice, shame we can't find a nice thick cushion like this for our other chairs.But we had to return these for two reasons:1.  Poor quality control, esp. of the main seating surface.  Both had noticeable dents that could be seen even with the cushion in place, and one had a bent leg.  You might blame shipping for this, but the shipping boxes arrived in pretty good shape.2.  Rusts!  There was visible rust spots within one week of these being placed outside in the weather, and the rusty water marked up our brick patio.

"A quick, easy, fun read for the target audience of second and third graders.  Parents reading along may enjoy the chapter titles that are references to old songs and will likely go right over their children's heads (Don't Go Breaking My Spine, Stuck in the Puddle with You).  What I'm a bit less enthused about are the political references / jokes in the early parts of the book that will also sail over the target audience's heads but will probably annoy about half of the parents out there.One other thing of note is that the boys travel 20 years into the future and find themselves married - one to a woman and one to a man.  The same sex marriage was done so subtly that I didn't even notice until a page or two later - Pilkey never mentions it in the text, so it is not presented as ""good"" or ""bad"", just ""whatever"".Overall another good entry in the Captain Underpants saga.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MV1FTPFX5US/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545504929#wasThisHelpful","R1MV1FTPFX5US","A1ILWPH1GHUXE2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ILWPH1GHUXE2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off, I'll say that I am a fan of Lightroom and have been using it since Version 3.  It is my go-to program for importing / editing / storing photos both from my Canon DSLR and my family's smartphones.However, I was unhappy about how long Adobe took to fix glaring issues in their previous Lightroom 5, and now Adobe's new policies for Lightroom 6 are another thorn in my side.  Specifically, the policy that standalone versions of Lightroom 6 will get no feature updates is just a poor way to treat new and long-time Lightroom customers.Looking at updates to the *previous* Lightroom 5, there were bug fixes of course, but Lightroom also gained the following functions:- Lightroom 5.2: added Feather control for the Clone/Heal brush, added Smoothness adjustment slider for Color Noise Reduction.- Lightroom 5.4: added support for Lightroom Sync.- Lightroom 5.7: added integrated Aperture/iPhoto importer.Nothing huge, but definitely some useful features.Now with Lightroom 6, features added to the CC (subscription) version are being specifically excluded from the standalone product.  The first of these is the Dehaze slider, but I guess there will be others in the future.  And once again my opinion of a good product is marred by the poorly thought out and greedy policies of Adobe.  I'm not sure what the correct policy is - but I do know that the current policy is the wrong one.I've read in a few places that Adobe claims the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 prevents them from adding new features to products already paid for.

"Sample provided for review.The Mengo Lightning Cable seems as though it is a clone of the Apple Lightning cable.  It is a thin, flexible cable that is similar in color to the official Apple cable.  It has a very small Lightning plug that should fit just about every case designed for the iPhone 5 / 5c / 6 / 6 Plus.  (The only case that might have an issue is the Lifeproof case - and I don't have one of these to check.)  The cable has a strain relief on both ends that should help to prolong its life.  I used the cable to both charge and sync my iPhone 6, and the cable worked just as expected with no errors.There are actually a few Lightning cables I've found that were a bit better made than the Apple original.

"My family currently uses a HON Volt H5703 Task Chair with Synchro-Tilt for Office or Computer Desk, Black SofThread Leather.  When I got the opportunity to try out this basyx by HON Executive Chair, I thought it would be good to compare it to the ""standard"" HON we already have.Assembly - very easy.  Attach the two arms to the seat and back (which is what holds the back to the chair), attach the seat frame to the bottom of the seat, pop the wheels onto the base, and place the rest of the assembled chair onto the base.Build Quality - basyx by HON appears to be an ""entry level"" chair compared to the ""standard"" HON 5703.  However, I see very little external difference in the build quality of the two chairs.  Both have reasonable quality leather upholstery, what seems to be a wood frame, substantial cushioning in the back and seat, and a resin base.  The only real difference that is obvious between the two is the warranty - five years for the basyx by HON vs. lifetime for the HON.  Obviously, if continued use uncovers any deficiencies in the basyx by HON chair I'll be sure to update this review.I also have a bit of concern about the back of the chair, which as noted above is only attached to the base by the plastic arms and four screws. But so far no issues.Comfort - this is the one area where the basyx by HON doesn't quite measure up.  Both have similar adjustments - height adjustment, tilt, tilt tension adjustment, and a tilt lock that prevents the chair from tilting.  (The HON 5703 features a ""syncro-tilt"" that tilts the back a bit faster than the seat, but I really don't notice much difference between this and a standard tilt mechanism.)  But the basyx by HON seat cushion is surprisingly hard - perhaps it will break in a bit over time but as of now it is too firm to be comfortable for long periods.  In comparison, the cushion of the HON 5703 is perfect - firm but still with some give.One other issue - the basyx by HON chair has plastic arms that are not padded and not adjustable - and in my case are too low to be of any use.  I realize that executive chairs usually have fixed arms and I am fairly tall, but I was surprised that the arms on this were so low.Overall, I think this basyx by HON chair is a very good chair.  But the hardness of the seat and short arms may be a drawback to some.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R116BJGNXR6SPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVKEZO8#wasThisHelpful","R116BJGNXR6SPR","A1ILWPH1GHUXE2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ILWPH1GHUXE2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I agree that this is a very good performance of Mahler's Symphony No. 3 by Abbado and the Berliners - I'll save judgement of the interpretation and skill of the performers to others who have heard far more versions of this work than I have.That said, I just cannot enjoy the recording as much as I should because of the recording level choices.  Parts of the work are recorded at an extremely low level, and at the beginning and end of the 4th Movement I literally cannot hear anything unless I turn up the volume on my home theater or portable device to near max volume - and then what little I hear is masked in noise.Perhaps this extreme dynamic range is Abbado's preference; in a summary of this work elsewhere a reviewer mentioned Abbado's ""obsession with pianissimos.""  Or perhaps it is due (or exacerbated) by the BBC / DG recording engineers.  But in any event the result is having to tweak the volume control while listening to this recording, which takes some joy out of the experience.I don't quibble with those willing to overlook these issues and concentrate on the performance itself, but to me these sonic issues get in the way of the performance.  I purchased this as an alternative to the Sony and DG Bernstein takes on the 3rd, but due to the sonic issues noted it is hard for me to place this in same league as those Bernstein recordings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LXE1TLO4KDSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000063TAJ#wasThisHelpful","R1LXE1TLO4KDSQ","A1ILWPH1GHUXE2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ILWPH1GHUXE2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*** Note that a sample of this product was provided to me for this review.When I was offered a set of Aduro Amplify SB10 Bluetooth Headphones for review, I was not expecting them to compete with other Bluetooth headphones costing $100 and $200.  But I did want to see if they could function for those unable or unwilling to spend three figures on a set of wireless headphones.  After trying them for a bit I think they fit that purpose very well.Build / fit - the SB10s are relatively lightweight and are made mainly of plastic, with a bit of metal visible in the headband.  The construction is fine for the price, but to be clear these do not appear to be built to withstand rough use.  (From reading other reviews the top plastic band has a seam in the middle that appears to be a common source of failure.)  I plan to treat these gently, and I'll be sure to update this review if any issues arise - but so far so good.  Fit and comfort are fine.  Note that the earpads sit on top of the ear and are not a ""closed"" design; these are not designed to block out external noise.Sound and use: Sound is good for games and voice, marginal for music.  The SB10s are able to reproduce bass down to 25 Hz or so and are quite good up to 1 KHZ or so; above that the upper midrange and treble drop off noticeably.  When listening to music the loss of midrange and treble makes the sound warm and quite recessed - not a good result for music.  However these characteristics don't impact gaming and voice use much at all, and the SB10s are well suited for these purposes.Two other small issues I want to point out:- There is no Mute function included on the SB10s, which is unfortunate.- A good headset will ""feedback"" some of the microphone input back to the speakers.  The SB10s have little or none of this ""feedback"", so it can sounds strange when speaking on the mic.Considering the price, I'd say that the SB10s are good headphones despite their limitations.  I'd have no problem recommending these for someone looking for an in expensive set of Bluetooth headphones for voice or gaming use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WW3GHTFR3B6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYP53SM#wasThisHelpful","R1WW3GHTFR3B6C","A1ILWPH1GHUXE2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ILWPH1GHUXE2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*** Note that a sample of this product was provided to me for this review.I have had the opportunity to try multiple vendor's Lightning cables since I first purchased an iPhone 5 several years ago.  Up to now I've tried a few good cables, a few so-so cables, and a few cables that were deficient and that I would not purchase again.  But in all cases I always thought the official Apple Lightning cable was the best.  (I'd still venture to an off-brand like Amazon Basics to get a length that Apple doesn't provide.)But now in this K-ble Lightning cable, we have a cable that IMHO bests the Apple Lightning cable.  It is MFi certified, and works to charge or sync my family's iPhones (5, 5c, and 6).  The Lightning plug and housing is just marginally larger than that of the Apple cable, and will present no issues with *almost* any case.  (Apparently LifeProof cases will work only with the OEM Apple cable.)  The rubber strain relief on each end seems quite sturdy, and the cable itself appears to be of very high quality.  In other words, I would pick this K-ble product over the Apple Lightning cable if given the choice.My only suggestion for the K-ble is that they come out with a short (2 to 3 foot) and long (10 foot) version - sometimes these other lengths come in handy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37DTC14LM897S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TA3VMSW#wasThisHelpful","R37DTC14LM897S","A1ILWPH1GHUXE2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ILWPH1GHUXE2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note that these are listed here as ""Wilson Jones Frosted Front Report Covers with Pocket"", but the actual product received was ""GBC Impact Professional Designer Frosted Front Report Cover.""  From everything I can these are the same product.No matter what the name, these Frosted Front Report Covers are quite impressive.  The combination of the lightly frosted front cover and ribbed embossed paper used for the rest of the cover creates a impressive, professional image.  The pocket in the inside of the rear cover is a nice touch, and has cutout in it to attach a business card or photo.  Just be careful when using this - one of the pockets ripped a bit when I tried to insert a business card.The one negative I could assign to this product is that is not of ""heavy duty"" construction - the back cover is about as heavy as construction paper, as I mentioned it ripped in one spot when using the back pocket, and this would likely not stand up to the abuse kids would give it.  But for college papers / office presentations I think this cover is just right.It's difficult to assign a ""value"" to a product like this since the retail price often has little relationship to the actual selling price - but for now this report cover is similarly priced to popular covers from Mead and Avery, and to me the features and quality of the Wilson Jones / GBC cover makes it a top choice if durability isn't the primary concern.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TMJG760U81FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TGRIAE#wasThisHelpful","R1TMJG760U81FM","A1ILWPH1GHUXE2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ILWPH1GHUXE2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Avery 05689 White Postcards For Laser Printers is a good product and useful for mass printing of postcards.  They come 4 postcards to a sheet, and a finer perforation that allows the cards to be separated rather easily after printing.  However, you can tell the difference between the pre-cut edges vs. the perforated edges, so if you really need a perfect edge you will need to manually trim the perforated edges.  (See attached photo).As for the paper itself, it is a good quality matte finish card stock (seems similar to index cards to me) that works very well in laser printers.  I would also expect this to be usable with inkjet printers, but since it is not a coated paper the results will probably be similar to using plain paper - in other words don't expect outstanding results trying to print multi-colored drawings or photos.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KBABGOJATJIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PMC4TW#wasThisHelpful","R2KBABGOJATJIV","A1ILWPH1GHUXE2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ILWPH1GHUXE2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sennheiser HD 518s are a decent set of headphones for their current price.  But to be honest, if you are looking for great sounding open headphones, I think it is worth the extra investment to move up to the HD 558 or HD 598 (the set I currently own).My main issue with the 518s is the sound signature.  The treble is slightly subdued compared to the 598s, and despite the open design the 518s just don't match the airy, open sound of the 598s.  In addition the 518s have a lot of mid-bass boost around 200-300Hz which creates a boomy bass on a lot of my music.In addition, I find the material used on the headband and the earcups to be scratchy and very annoying, esp. when compared to the leatherette and velour used on the 598s.I was hoping that the 518s might serve as a backup to my 598s, but after comparing both I realize now that just isn't going to work out.  I strongly suggest moving up to the 558s or 598s for just a bit more.  (Note that I have never tried the 558s, but I'm going on numerous reviews that say they are very comparable to the 598s.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32LOD0J9UF5TY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042A68R8#wasThisHelpful","R32LOD0J9UF5TY","A1ILWPH1GHUXE2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ILWPH1GHUXE2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not going to go into excruciating detail here, since there are so many excellent reviews posted already - but the HD 598 is to my mind the best set of headphones in its price range, and one of the best headphones available at any price.These headphones are almost entirely plastic to keep a light weight, but still feel solid and substantial.  And they are definitely the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn.As far as the sound, they are exemplary and *almost* perfect.  The treble response is a tiny bit brighter than the HD 595s they replaced, but still sound natural and not over-emphasized.  The bass is low and deep while still being controlled - no over emphasized bass here.  And the open design creates a mesmerizing airy sound that i can listen to for hours.Now there are a few design considerations that one needs to keep in mind with the 598s:- As an open design, outside sound is not isolated at all and some sound leaks out to the outside world.  So these are not the headphones to get if you're trying to block outside noise (subway) or if you do not want someone sitting next to you to hear your music (airplane, quiet library).  That said, I have used these in a office cubicle and with typical ambient noise someone in the next cubicle over cannot hear anything.- 598s do not over-emphasize bass; according to frequency response graphs at headphone dot com, they are pretty much  3.5dB from 25Hz to 1000Hz.  But in today's world many consider that a shortcoming.  In a perfect world the bass response of the 598s would be flat all the way to 20Hz or below, but in practice almost any headphone that can do that ends up with a large bass hump in the mid bass.- Almost without saying, if you are a fan of huge bass, these are not for you.  Something like the Sennheiser HD419 Over-the-Ear MP3/iPod Black Headphones or one of the Sony XB models might work better.- At 50 ohm nominal impedance, the 598s do not *require* an external headphone amplifier to get to moderate listening levels.  I never used one with my 595s (also 50 ohm) and I do not have one for my 598s.  But there are a number of users who recommend using one, and I may try one someday.- If using the 598s with portable devices with a 1/8"" headphone jack, I strongly suggest *not* using the included 1/4"" to 1/8"" adapter.  This will put a lot of strain on the tiny headphone jack and could damage your portable device.  Instead get something like Hosa MHE100.5 Right Angle 1/4"" to 3.5mm Headphone Adapter/Extension) that will not place undue stress on the headphone jack.  (I still don't get why Sennheiser doesn't include this type of adapter with their headphones.)  Alternately you can completely replace the included cable with 1.8m NEW Replacement Audio upgrade Cable For Sennheiser HD598 HD558 HD518 Headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S24ENOTGAKKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042A8CW2#wasThisHelpful","R3S24ENOTGAKKH","A1ILWPH1GHUXE2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ILWPH1GHUXE2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had been contemplating getting a heavy duty stapler for work since (1) my standard Swingline Stapler, Rio Red (74736) is limited to about 20 sheets and (2) the common area heavy duty stapler is often jammed or out of staples.  So when I was offered this Rapesco X5-90PS Less Effort Heavy Duty Stapler for review I was happy to try it out.Note that for my review copy a small box of Rapesco 10mm (appr. 3/8 inch) staples were included.  No staples are normally included with the stapler; Rapesco staples in sizes 8mm / 10mm / 12mm are available, or you can use widely available Swingline / Stanley heavy duty staples.The first thing to note is that this stapler is larger than a standard stapler (8 x 2 x 6.5 inches vs. 7.5 x 1.5 x 2.5 inches), but is quite compact for a heavy duty stapler, so it doesn't look out of place sitting on a desk.  The outer shell is heavy plastic, with the innards made of more plastic and stamped metal.  It's heavy enough (1 pound 9 ounces) toi inspire somne confidence, and I wouldn't expect any issues with durability for moderate use.  Loading the included 10mm was easy - just lift up the handle and drop them in.As far as stapling ability, I used the included 10mm staples on a few sets of 33-page handouts, no problem at all.  I grabbed a stack of Swingline 1/2 inch staples to try on a larger stack of paper, and I was able to staple a 90-sheet stack of paper with ease.  Note that you *can* use ""standard"" wire staples in these, but more often than not the Rapesco will use two of these staples at a time - probably better to keep that Rio Red Swingline around for light duty work!Overall very impressed with this compact but beastly stapler.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM6K1GP8L0JPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D7IMP4Q#wasThisHelpful","RM6K1GP8L0JPF","A1ILWPH1GHUXE2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ILWPH1GHUXE2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Generally speaking, over the past few years Prima guides haven't really been bad.  In fact with how useful their Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition guide was and how incredibly handy it was to have their HUGE Skyrim Legendary Edition guide, I was expecting a bit more from Prima than this.  This guide is big.  You'd assume a really big guide would be jam packed with information, but it isn't.  Not only does Prima's Fallout 4 guide require a LOT of navigation to get all the information you need out of it, but the information itself isn't in depth in any way.To begin, the guide looks pretty good.  The cover (at least of the collector's edition) is very nice and the pages are perfectly glossy (even if a little thin).  But the layout and design are usually pretty simple to follow.  It doesn't quite thematically breathe Fallout the way the Fallout 3 guide did, but upon first flipping through it you'd be forgiven for thinking that it was a really in-depth guide.  After all, it's thick, every page is filled with screenshots, tables and what looks to be information.  But... what does that information say?  How does it guide the player?  This is where the guide becomes problematic.The guide jumps right in, attempting to help you understand the game.  It'll tell you about the basic things that the game itself will tell you.  For those hoping to get more information on the various systems and how they work the guide doesn't go far. It doesn't necessarily have to, but it also doesn't spend a lot of time here.  Once we get to the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. perks, though the guide begins to show the flaw that's going to keep players from truly mastering Fallout 4.  Everything concerning your attributes and perks are things the game itself already tells you.  There are no suggestions as to how to utilize or suggestions for players who wish to play a specific way.  So much of what's here is ripped directly from the game itself.  There's no real strategy or suggestions of how to utilize the perks to your advantage.Going beyond that the guide mostly talks about other basics.  It'll tell you things such as how combat works (a very basic rundown) before going on to detail the enemies you'll run into.  There are only a couple of paragraphs.  No strategies on how to fight these enemies, or suggestions but I suppose that I can deal with.  We then go into things like your inventory where there are lots of tables.  I don't have too many qualms here except for one: Your weapons.  The guide only tells you the most basic of basic things about the weapons.  Every now and then there are some tips, but the guide spends far more time telling you ABOUT the weapons rather than giving tips on how to USE the weapons or how best to customize the weapons.  The guide talks briefly about mods... but once again it spends a lot of time telling you ABOUT them and not how to utilize them.Even if you manage to get through all that, the walkthrough itself is going to be terribly problematic.  Before the walkthrough there is a list of all the quest, but I found this to be quite useless in comparison.  For instance, it's great that it tells me the quest type, but... I'd like to know where it is.  It tells you what page to find the quest on but say you want to do a quest in a specific location... it won't tell you.  It just won't tell you where it is in the game.I understand that Fallout 4 doesn't exactly present a great main story.  The joy of Fallout 4 is roaming the wasteland and finding and discovering the individual quests, not necessarily your own.  The world is pretty cool.  Apparently Prima thought similarly.  The guide only takes twenty pages or so to cover the main quest.  This is because each quest is only given a handful of paragraphs dedicated to it.  Sometimes those paragraphs are used to tell you absolutely nothing.  Near the beginning of the game when going through Sanctuary, for instance, the guide tells me to explore, but at no point helps point me in the direction of potentially useful items or prepares me for some the hazards I might face.  At times the guide MIGHT mention enemies you might encounter and at other times it doesn't say anything.  The hazards is a far worse, though.  Certainly it's important to explore without really knowing what's coming.  But if I'm going to spend a good deal of money on a strategy guide (whether for a collector's item or not) then it's not unfair to expect the guide to give me as much detail as it possibly can.  At no point has this guide made me feel secure in what it is I'm doing.  There's usually an enemy it doesn't mention.  A hazard it doesn't talk about.  It rarely points items out in the walkthrough.There are more quests the guide covers beyond the main stuff, but it's mostly the same.  A lot of paragraphs that usually describe the quest but don't guide you through it, while explaining to you what the game is already telling you.  There are hardly any real details on what to do.  Usually it's something basic like... ""Explore this area.""  Each quest usually has a list of objectives and places to explore listed as well.  This is great, but going beyond this the guide doesn't feel it needs to tell you HOW to obtain those objectives or what's worth exploring.  The guide will usually point you to somewhere in the middle to look for a map.  We'll come back to this as well.  The point is that the walkthrough and quest guide don't feel complete.  They are peppered with good looking screenshots, but again, it's that you don't get enough details about these quests.  And sometimes inbetween main quest missions it doesn't tell you what to do inbetween.  Things you need to be doing inbetween quests the guide isn't always telling you about.  Going from one main quest to another, for example, might actually require you to go through other areas.  But since it's not a ""quest"" the guide just simply opts not to mention anything about it.  It's SOMEWHERE in the walkthrough, but because it's not a ""main"" quest it's not going to be found in that section.  It might show up in one of the other quest sections, but you're going to have to basically flip through the guide to find it.The walkthrough also has lots of helpful tips from Vault Boy... but often it's just repeating a lot of things the game itself is actually telling you.  They're not so much helpful as they are redundant.  And the entire walkthrough is sometimes written in this manner.  The game will tell you something and you'll often read the walkthrough to find it describing what an NPC just told you and not necessarily how to go about it.  There's so much fluff in the guide at times that it was usually better to go online to figure out what I was looking for.  To spend this much money on a guide to ultimately need to go online for information is pretty bad.  In this day and age, a strategy guide is a supplement and not a necessity.  Often they are collector's items.  That isn't a good reason for a poorly constructed walkthrough, however.  The Fallout 4 guide either holds back on a lot of detail or it just simply gives you the most basic of basic information.  It's the difference between someone backseat gaming and someone playing the game with you.After the walkthrough and quest guide we come to the workshop chapter.  As with the rest of the guide it tells you a lot ABOUT the workshops but isn't going to help you utilize them.  At times the Fallout 4 guide feels less like a strategy guide and more like a bloated instruction manual.  After the workshops we then come to the maps.  The maps section is the biggest section of the guide by far.  Taking up HALF the guide itself.  Sure enough most of these maps are good.  It shows you a huge map before going region by region.  In each region it'll then go through all the primary locations where it actually shows you the area itself.  The guide is less interested in showing you all the wilderness in between these primary locations.  Each section in the walkthrough usually will send you to the map if you want a good idea of what the location looks like.  While some of those items are shown in the walkthrough, they're definitely shown on the maps.  You get an optimal route to get through an area and then they point out a few items.  There are even small snippets of information here that even tell you some things you might want to do in these areas.  I'm not sure why those things weren't included in the walkthrough.  Sometimes it's even more precise in fewer words.  At times it made more sense to just flip to this section of the guide than it was to use the actual walkthrough.At first it seemed odd that the maps weren't in the walkthrough itself, but after utilzing the guide for a bit, I'm glad they weren't.  The walkthrough would be far more hazardous to use.  It made using the walkthrough a lot easier.  The maps section also shows all the secondary locations.  There aren't maps for these, but they're usually places on the over world map with a small bit to tell you about it.  It's actually not a bad section.  The only major nitpick here is that the legend only appears on the first page or so of the section.  There are a lot of symbols to memorize.  You might have to flip back to it from time to time.The biggest problem with the guide isn't necessarily it's lackluster walkthrough.  The bigger problem is definitely navigating the guide itself.  Useful techniques, that even Prima used in the past, aren't used here.  Most guides have a decent ""tab"" system.  This is where you can get an idea where you should flip by looking at the tabs usually in the margin of the page.  Each section has a tab at a different spot.  A tab system helps players get an idea of what section starts where and how large it is.  When flipping through you'll know if you've gone too far because the tabs have changed.  I'm not sure why Prima didn't use a good tab system.  Especially when they've used one in previous guides.  Worse than a tab system, however, is the lack of an index.  This guide is huge.  Being able to pinpoint a quest (in more than just a list) would've been nice.  There were times when I wanted to know WHERE a quest was and I had to flip through the guide endlessly to find it.  An index would've easily solved these issues.  Not just that, but for those who purchased the collector's edition guide... ribbon bookmarks would've been a nice addition.  It would've helped with the page flipping.Strategy guides are not really a necessity anymore.  Guides are often supplements or collector's items now.  Sometimes strategy guides can enhance the experience of the game.  Prima's Fallout 4 guide doesn't really do anything.  It doesn't supplement the game or enhance the experience.  The extras included with the collector's edition guide are hardly enough to make up for how much information the guide just doesn't have.  Prima's Fallout 3 guide felt complete.  It was huge, but justifiably huge.  Here the guide feels incomplete.  Were it not for the maps it'd likely just be an overblown instruction manual.  A walkthrough needs to do more than tell me what the game is telling me.  It needs to actually guide.  It needs to actually dive.  For collector's the guide will certainly looks nice on a shelf.

"When the Uncharted series first debuted in 2007, it was largely seen as something of a Tomb Raider ripoff (of the original Tomb Raider games, that is).  The series, however, quickly established itself as being something separate from the old Tomb Raider games (with the reboot now strangely being referred to as an Uncharted ripoff which is also... wrong).  They were pulp adventures, largely, filled with action and adventure, peppered by some fantastic set piece moments.  With Uncharted 4 on the horizon, the Uncharted collection is here to remind fans of what it is they loved and to introduce new players to the series.  These remasters are nice, but it also serves as a great way to see how the series evolved.  How it went from the style of the first game to the epicness of the third.So let's start at the beginning.  The first story centers on Nathan Drake's quest to find Eldorado. As a descendant of Drake he is pretty smart about finding lost treasures and following clues to connect things. Here he wants to search for the Lost City of gold following clues that he has left behind. Along with his partner Sully and love interest, Elena, they travel across the world. Along the way they face pirates looking for the same treasure. What unfolds is a story that is so much bigger. What has often made the Uncharted games fun storytelling is that the games themselves have relatively simple stories... but they have fun, charming characters. The writing is fantastic, the sense of humor impeccable. It goes to show it isn't just the idea the story has going for it, but how that story is presented. Clearly Uncharted has borrowed cues from Romancing the Stone, Jewel of Nile, Tomb Raider and (most obvious of all) Indiana Jones. It's action packed, with spectacles all around.You needn't play the Uncharted games in order to understand the story at all.  While games might make references to each other they're fairly episodic in nature.  If you're new to the series, however, I'd recommend starting with the first one just to get it out of the way.  Uncharted 2 and 3 are so much better games you'd likely never want to play the first one again afterwards.  The games are fun, but the first is most certainly the weakest in the series.  It's the one which features the most boring gameplay and most tame set piece moments.  The gameplay of Uncharted is very similar to Gears of War.  You play through each game and get into fire fights.  During these fire fights you can always take cover behind whatever structures are in the area.  Nate can carry two weapons at a time.  He can carry one two-handed weapon such as a shotgun or an assault rifle, and he can carry one pistol such as a handgun or desert eagle.  As fire fights commence you'll pop out and shoot and take cover.  Sometimes you might be chased out when enemies throw grenades or when your cover gets destroyed.  Nate can also grab grenades which, thankfully in this collection, don't require the motion controls to use anymore.This makes up the basic frame work of all three games, but in the first Uncharted it's a somewhat daunted by these mechanics.  Not because they're bad, but because the first Uncharted doesn't fully know a lot of variety.  For the most part, the first Uncharted isn't a properly paced game.  For the most part you're constantly running from one gun fight to the next without a whole lot to break up the monotony of the gun fights themselves.  There are a good variety of weapons, but for the most part it's just mowing down bad guys in tense firefights.  There are a few set piece moments like an exciting jeep chase and a part on a jet ski, but aside from these moments the first Uncharted is definitely the game in this collection that hasn't aged very well at all.  The way melee combat works in the game is also a sign of this.  It feels loose and clumsy and, for the most part, isn't really necessary at all.  The first Uncharted also has a terrible implementation of quick time events.  The kind you're likely to fail because you're surprised the game has them in the first place.  These things don't make the first Uncharted bad.  It's a solid game.  They do, however, help you realize just how poorly the game has aged in comparison to the next two.Uncharted 2, on the other hand, pretty much went above and beyond the first in almost every way. Where as the first begins with you on a boat digging up a coffin. Uncharted 2 opens literally with a bang. You're in a train teetering off the edge of a cliff and you have to climb out before it goes. But you've also been shot and you're bleeding out. The game then flashes back to the events which lead up to it. Like the first, Drake has found information about a famous explorer. This time Marco Polo. Apparently he found the lost city of Shambala and now Drake must find it. Sully and Elena return but we're also introduced to new characters such as Chloe and Flynn. But more than that, the story really amps up this time around on both an emotional level and on an adventurous one. The villain, for instance, is much more threatening and lethal. You won't find yourself in fear of the first game's Gabriel Roman by any means. But Zoran Lazarevic is so much more intimidating.There are tons of areas where Uncharted 2 does better than the first. Even in specifics to gameplay. The platforming is more refined. Even more than that the gunplay is the most well tweaked. You now have a reticle for blind fire. You can throw grenades seamlessly and fighting hand to hand is simpler. It's complete with counter attacks. The story also paces so much better. The first Uncharted had a few big adventure moments such as a short jeep chase, but Uncharted 2 had so much more. A daring chase across rooftops as a Helicopter tries to gun you down, a fantastic train sequences, a game of cat and mouse with a tank... and it keeps pace brilliantly. Because of all this refinement with pacing, storytelling and gameplay, Uncharted 2 is pretty much the go to example of how to make a sequel better than the original. It outdoes the original in every way.The pacing is improved because instead of running from gunfight to gunfight there are things that break up the action.  Uncharted 2 makes good use of downtime. After a tense helicopter chase, for instance, the game dials it back to giving you some simple platforming afterwards, a puzzle before it slowly starts to ramp up the action again.  Uncharted 2 does this again and again.  The puzzles aren't exactly hard, but they make for a nice break between the action.  In comparison to the first Uncharted which kept throwing armies of enemies at you from one room to the next, Uncharted 2 has a lot of variety.  It's a near perfect game.  If there were any problem with Uncharted 2 it would be that the game's final encounter feels pitiful compared to the rest of the experience.  It's simple and repetitive for a game that spent so much time giving us a lot of variety and gameplay improvements.  But after the final encounter we get back to doing what Uncharted 2 does best: set piece moments.  The first Uncharted combined a lot of gameplay mechanics and experiences from other games, but Uncharted 2 masters this combination to make a game that's really fluid.Uncharted 2 is often cited as one of the greatest games and sequels of all time.  When Uncharted 3 came out, there wasn't really a lot of improvement needed.  Yet, it was also important to make the game feel somewhat different from the second game.  The third game centers more so on Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan's relationship in terms of story.  Not just showing how they came to be allies, but also showing how deep their relationship goes.  Other characters from the series return such as Chloe and Elena, but the game tries to firmly keep to Nate and Sully.  The game is also constantly questioning Nate as it goes on.  What makes someone a madman?  And why does Nate always have to be so obsessed with treasure and danger?  Nathan Drake doesn't fear death... he welcomes it.  The adrenaline he receives from these moments gets him high... but when does the obsession end?  The game is constantly asking this question as it progresses.  It's certainly the best story in the series because of its focus on characters and themes, but it's also likely the best game to play.  It's the Uncharted that even manages to improve on the second one.Yes, it uses the same basic gameplay.  Taking cover and popping up to fire.  But even Uncharted 3 makes some slight improvements.  For instance, you can now toss grenades back at your enemies.  There are also a larger variety of weapons.  Yet where Uncharted 3 really improves are its set piece moments.  Certainly Uncharted 2's helicopter chase and train sequences were phenomenal, but Uncharted 3 does better.  Some set piece moments include playing as a young Nathan Drake escaping dangerous agents, and Nathan Drake also being on a capsizing cruise liner.  They are intense moments that really show the strength of the Uncharted series.  The melee combat is also better.  This time around it feels more influenced by the Batman Arkham games than anything... but it works and feels fluid.  And unlike the second game, the third game's final encounter is definitely more exciting by giving you the best of Uncharted.  Uncharted 2's final encounter feels out of place... but Uncharted 3's final encounter drops silly gimmicks in favor of simply having you do the things Uncharted is best at: Platforming, melee combat and shooting.The pacing in Uncharted 3 is also the best.  Uncharted 2 has great pacing, mind you.  It really does.  The third one has more moments of downtime and retrospection for the player.  The Uncharted games (specifically 2 and 3) show how important down time in a game can be.  To take time to breathe in the experience of a game is important.The Uncharted games are also beautiful.  They have a lot of eye-popping visuals, but the style of the game also works.  Again, the first game was released (as well as the second) where so many developers weren't using a ton of lighthearted aesthetics when they wanted to be serious.  Uncharted opts to be light while peppering moments of seriousness.  The characters are always bantering with each other as you run through areas with them, but they're beautiful areas that are well presented.  The experience is even better on the Playstation 4.  It's in 60 frames per second and looks a lot cleaner and smoother.  This is on par with Naughty Dog's remaster of ""The Last of Us.""  It's not quite as good, though.One point of contention I have with The Nathan Drake Collection is that the asking price is pretty high.  While the improvements are great, it's a game where you're likely going to play it because you haven't played them before.  In all honesty, it feels like this is the only reason you'd really want The Nathan Drake Collection.  Sixty dollars is a lot to put down on a remastered collection.  Especially when the first three games on the PS3 are exceedingly cheap used.  This isn't like finding a remastered PS2 game where the presentation has been changed to wide screen and the visual improvements are much more noticeable.  For some, the upgrade in visual fidelity is going to be hard to spot with a game remastered for the PS4.This brings about the question, as always, as to whether or not it's worth buying the Nathan Drake Collection if you still have your trilogy of games on the PS3.  In all honesty, if you own the original three already and you want to experience it on the PS4, it would probably be better to simply wait for a price drop if you HAVE to experience them.  The second and third games have aged relatively well that any improvements to the games don't have an enormous impact on the package itself.  If, on the other hand, you've never played the Uncharted games before and you have a PS4 this is a good time to experience all three games.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI9DHZTP7QEWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQM1PNY#wasThisHelpful","RI9DHZTP7QEWA","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been an astonishing four years since the first Dark Souls hit the scene and the game still gets talked about as though it's still a fairly recent release.  This despite the fact that it has a sequel and a spiritual successor (Bloodborne).  Of all the games of the PS3 and XBOX360 era, Dark Souls is perhaps one of the biggest sleeper hits of that generation.  But why?  What was it about this game that enamored so many people and turned so many heads?  In four years most games would've died down considerably in popularity, but Dark Souls cult following is just as strong now as it was during it's original release in 2011.  It has entire channels dedicated to it on YouTube, a thriving community that still comes together to play the game in jolly cooperation and gamers who still insist on challenging themselves by doing their own custom play throughs.  Can you complete the game at level 1?  Can you complete the game without dying once?  Can you complete the game quickly?  Can you get through without summoning?  Can you get through at level 1 with only your initial equipment AND without summoning?  These were various challenges and more the community came up with.But why Dark Souls?  What was it about this game that was so mystifying?  Even now I still put Dark Souls into my PS3 and even now I still get something out of it and I've played through the game dozens of times.  Each time still feels like a new and harrowing experience despite that I can get through much of it in my sleep.  If I even see the words ""You Died"" on screen I have to take a moment to figure out what happened.  I mastered Dark Souls (as difficult as that was) but I still come back constantly to experience the majesty of this game.  It's probably in part because it's one of the few games that does almost everything right.  It's one of the few games so meticulous in its design that if you discover something and ask yourself, ""I wonder if the developers intended for it to be done that way?"" and the answer might actually be ""Yes.""  Dark Souls quietly snuck into the gaming culture and grasped a following that refuses to let go.  There may be bigger and better games out there... but none of them are Dark Souls.No doubt, the most common thing everyone hears about Dark Souls is how challenging it is.  And make no mistake the game is challenging.  Yet if this was all that made Dark Souls a curiosity it wouldn't be worth discussing in such detail, nor would it be a game that amassed the following it has.  Other games are challenging and difficult, but they don't retain the following that Dark Souls has.  No, there's so much more to Dark Souls than just difficulty.  And we're going to talk about it at length in this review.So let's dive in.  This review is long and filled to the brim with love for Dark Souls.  This is your warning.Dark Souls isn't known so much for its story as it is the lore.  The game begins with a short cinematic explaining how Gwyn and his knights went to war against the dragons.  They won and thus began the age of fire.  But in the world of Dark Souls everyone is hollow.  It's not at all a bright and sunny story.  You play as one of these undead who has been trapped in an asylum and once you get free you go off to Lordran.  When there you slowly realize what your quest is.  As an undead you are tasked with bringing in a new age or continuing the rule of it in this decaying world.  But that's really all you get.  The game isn't heavy on exposition, yet Dark Souls actually has a huge story to tell.  It's just not given to you in mouthfuls of exposition like other games.  Most video games make sure the player understands at all times what's going on, what the goals are and rarely do you have to venture outside of the beaten path to uncover more.  But Dark Souls isn't most games.  Dark Souls wants you to explore and put pieces of the story together on your own.  Who are you battling?  What's the significance of all this?  What is up with the places you're visiting?  The game doesn't wish to explain much of this to you.  Instead you need to make sure you examine and read a lot of what you find.  The flavor text on items and weapons can often add a lot to the story on its own.  The world the game takes place in works in a similar fashion.  It wants you to understand that the world, items you find and weapons you use all have a story.  And by putting all of these together Dark Souls not only forms a coherent narrative but also a coherent world.  It doesn't fill in all the holes, though.  There's still a lot left to interpretation, and fans all around the world have come up with various ideas.  Dark Souls is a world full of mystery where you won't always get the answers to the questions you ask.  But if you're willing to go a little further and examine the items you find or talk to various NPCs you won't be left swimming without a life-preserver.The gameplay is not your standard action game either.  You'll begin by making a character and a class.  In the game's opening dungeon you can't really do much.  The opening dungeon is nothing more than a crash course.  If you can beat it, then anything in Dark Souls is manageable.  Once you get to Lordran (the main focus of the game) many elements come together.  You'll begin to battle and collect souls which you can then use to either buy items from merchants or use them to level up.  Souls are both currency and experience.  You can dump levels into various stats.  There is no ""best way"" to level, it all depends on how you wish to play the game.  Those who rely on magic, for instance, aren't really doing themselves a lot of good by putting levels into their strength.  Although you may have to anyway.  The levels of your stats don't just determine how strong your weapons are, but also if you can use them at all.If you've played Bloodborne you'll no doubt realize the game puts a lot of emphasis on offense.  Dark Souls is the opposite.  It puts a lot of emphasis on defense.  When playing you have a stamina meter.  It depletes when you attack, block attacks or dash around.  When it runs out you have to wait for it to replenish.  It actually replenishes quite quickly so there's no harm there.  But a lot of the combat in Dark Souls focuses more so on knowing the weapon you're using as well as learning the attacks of your enemies.  You'll spend quite a bit of time running around with your shield raised.  Dark Souls works in a trialed manner.  That is to say that it's a game you're supposed to learn through play.  Like many games that came out during the NES and SNES era, Dark Souls expects you to learn through observing your enemies and then using what you've learned to win.  At first this might be intimidating, but this also means that once you recognize certain attacks Dark Souls can actually be a breeze.  Every enemy has a way of telegraphing their attacks and pretty soon you'll learn the best tactics to dodge, block and also learn when it just isn't worth it.  This makes Dark Souls a game of mastery and skill.  But this also makes Dark Souls a game of patience.  If you aren't willing to actually learn your enemies and you decide to try and rush through everything without actually knowing, the game will punish you over and over again.Dark Souls is not forgiving, but it is meticulous.  You can rest assured that most of the time when you die it was through your own doing.  Most games don't have a large penalty for dying, but Dark Souls actually does.  If you die, you'll lose all your souls.  This means that if you had a lot you have levels you might otherwise be able to gain or items you could buy.  And you won't necessarily want to farm for all of them again.  You have a chance to recover them by going to where it is you died and grabbing them.  The thing is, though, whatever killed you is usually lying in wait.  It's still there.  This is especially taxing if you're constantly losing to a boss over and over again.  Dark Souls does, at least, have checkpoints scattered throughout the world.  There are bonfires all over the place and if you light one you can rest at it.  You will always respawn from the last bonfire you lit.  You also cannot be attacked when you're there.  This is also the time when you'd repair broken weapons or distribute your souls for experience.  It's also where you'll use humanity that will get you more invested in the PvP.Dark Souls has two unique features.  The first is that if you are connected to the internet you'll commonly come across messages left by players on the ground.  These messages can help you a great deal, or doom you.  It depends on who left them.  Some will give you hints or warn you about traps.  Others might lie to you and get you to attack walls that don't break... or more devious than that, cause you to die.  You can rate messages as well.  The other, however, is the games PvP.  This requires you to have a specific item in your inventory: Humanity.  Using humanity will relieve of your undead state.  You can then summon other adventurers into your world to help you for whatever tasks you need done.  You can summon two players at once.  There's a catch to this, though.  You can also be invaded by other players who will try to kill you.  Being human means that you are always subject to this rule.  The thing is, though, Dark Souls PvP is entirely unpredictable at times.  Summoning allies is always a unique thing, but when your world is invaded by a player you never know how things can go.  Some people invade you and try to kill you immediately.  Others might give you items and THEN kill you (but they usually give you really helpful items) and others aren't interested in anything at all but to try to show you things.  It's unusual, but even the people who invade your game might be out to help you instead of hinder you (though you should assume an invasion is a bad thing).  Dark Souls is an unusual game, but this makes the experience unique to play.The game also allows you to join various covenants throughout your quest.  Some utilize the PvP very nicely.  One clan you join, for instance, gives you the opportunity to bring about judgment on players who constantly invade other players.  You'll randomly get called to their world to kill them.  Another clan in a forest will summon you any time you're wearing the ring they give you to defend the forest from intruders.  Other clans, however, aren't meant for PvP.  They either provide more lore or give you items.  For the game's most famous clan (the Sun Covenant) you get sun medals every time you help someone defeat a boss.  Give enough of these to the sun alter and you'll be given more spells.  It all depends on how deeply aligned to the clan you are.All of this is very complex stuff.  It feels like a lot but when you actually play the game it actually becomes easy to learn.  The hardest part of the game, truthfully, is getting to the bosses you'll face.  The enemies along the way are tough, but the environments are also filled with their own traps and hazards.  When you finally do get to the bosses, though, this is where you'll really learn the meaning of the game's slogan: Prepare to Die.  You will lose to the bosses countless times, but they're just like most of the standard enemies.  Pattern recognition is all you need.  Each boss telegraphs their attacks, they just usually have more of them.  Yet if yous tick to it most bosses can be overcome through this pattern recognition.  Dark Souls is one of the few games where defeating a boss feels extremely satisfying.  Each boss explodes in a flash of white dust as the game proclaims your victory and you're awarded with thousands (sometimes hundreds of thousands) of souls for your victory before moving on to the next area.Dark Souls may be out to punish you but it rarely seeks to do so unfairly.  There are always bonfires close to the bosses (both before and after) and the open world makes sure to stick several shortcuts in the mix so that you can always return to the games main hub area, The Firelink Shrine.  The game also provides you with the ability to warp at some point between bonfires.  Particularly when you get deep enough into the game that traveling back on foot or no shortcut is really all that handy.  And it balances this incredibly well.  Players who get deep into the game will know that there's always a safe zone close by but it also lessens the sense of abandonment as you get deeper into the game's core.  The difficulty, by extension, also rises gradually.  Since the focus is more so on being meticulous, patient and recognizing patterns, the world also works this way too.  Combat is like this.  The story is like this.  But more importantly the world the game takes place in is like this.You'll slowly begin to realize that Dark Souls actually does slowly lead you from one key point to the next, even if it isn't always telling you.  But you'll also realize that there's a lot of exploring you can do.  There are tons of side areas and character arcs to explore throughout the game.  You'll often run into NPCs on their own quest and you can always choose to help them.  At times this will build your relationships.  And depending on how you go about these particular quests, NPCs might die or they might go hollow and start attack you.  Thanks to the good characterization (mostly through showing rather than telling) the game actually makes you care about some of the NPCs you encounter that when some of them bite the dust... it can be heartbreaking (though for some it'll be because they were a merchant that sold you something).  When NPCs are gone, they're gone for good.  Yet the rewards for helping them through their journey are satisfying.  Most lead to weapons or valuable items.  Others might net you fantastic spells if you manage to go through them without fault.  As with other aspects of the game, Dark Souls doesn't really tell you how to go about it.  You just might be battling in a dungeon and an NPC is close by waiting to speak with you.  Other times you might rescue them from a terrible fate.  But the NPCs are also unpredictable.  Some will be your allies and help you out at first, but then they betray you or other NPCs and you have to fight them.  It all adds to the world Dark Souls takes place in.Graphically Dark Souls is a good looking game, but the part that really stands out is the art design and aesthetic appeal.  The world of Lordran looks like it's been lived in and inhabited.  There will be locales in ruin and you'll often find characters willing to speculate about its mysteries.  It's also usually dark and gloomy and evoking a sense of dread.  The sound also helps in this.  No background music plays throughout your journey.  The only time you hear music is when you're in a boss fight, and the music always reinforces certain characteristics about the bosses themselves.  When fighting Ornstein and Smough in Anor Londo, for instance, the music reinforces that they're powerful warriors while the music for Sif, the giant wolf, reinforces how majestic he is.  Aside from boss battles the lack of music even adds to the game.  The game wants you to feel alone and isolated.  This is why so many areas are dark.  This is also why you can't talk to your friends via an in-game voice chat.  Dark Souls wants you to feel like you're being helped by a stranger and it reinforces this through the fact that you can't hear their voice... but you can still communicate through gestures.  The game wants to evoke a sense of dread and often it succeeds.  The first time through it's not uncommon to find yourself fearing what may be around the next corner.  Are you strong enough?  Would it be too much to go back to a bonfire and restore your health?  But if you do that you'll have to fight through everything again.  Dark Souls is challenging the player constantly.All this forms a near perfect package of a game.  But Dark Souls isn't perfect.  It has a huge following but the game hasn't even escaped criticism from that following.  The first and most important thing to talk about is how Dark Souls sometimes performs.  The game insist on not really loading.  The game is an open world experience and all the areas are interconnected.  This means it almost never loads.  At first this is good, but it brings about major performance issues from time to time.  Namely that Dark Souls often buckles under this weight.  There will be times when the frame rate drops.  Sometimes not so much, but other times (most notoriously in Blighttown) it's a huge problem.  For a game that is this meticulous and asks for this much precision, frame rate drops can, quite literally, be life threatening.  The other is a nitpick.  The ragdoll effects.  Over time they've become endearing for the community.  But sometimes they can actually get in the way of a good time because you can see the sacrifice the developers had to make in order to achieve the incredible lighting and graphical effects they already have.  Enemies will bug out and get stuck to you.  And while for standard enemies this is sometimes okay, sometimes for stronger enemies it's quite laughable and can take you out of an otherwise serious game.The online connectivity can also be a bit of a problem.  The game goes online, but when you jump online you need an established connection constantly.  If you lose connection during play while you're online (regardless of whether you've been summoned or not) the game will always kick you to the title screen and then switch to offline mode.  This also brings about a unique issue.  The core of Dark Souls is experiencing its online aspects.  When the servers go down for good, how magical and meaningful will Dark Souls be?  Dark Souls has thrived largely due to the online world it creates.  There's even a boss battle in the game designed specifically so that you need to summon (it's still possible without summoning, it's just that much more difficult).  When those servers finally shut down for good, I have to wonder if Dark Souls will still thrive triumphantly.But now for the other big thing to address.  Is Dark Souls really that excruciatingly difficult?  At one point in time... it was.  Dark Souls was a punishing game.  One where learning it meant dying several times in order to get an idea of what you were up against.  There isn't a soul that could complete Dark Souls the first time through without dying.  It's a shame that Dark Souls doesn't have a death counter to let you know how many times you died.  The first time through the game is difficult and some players might even think it's unfairly difficult.  In particular there's a notorious moment in Anor Londo that many players dread.  But Dark Souls is a game that's all about learning.  You're going to screw up when you don't know how it's done, but every obstacle can be conquered if you're patient.  Dark Souls begins as a relentlessly difficult game, but it won't end that way.  It's a systemic experience.  One that becomes easier to more you play and the more you observe.  Players used to rushing into any situation with abandon will find themselves thoroughly (and deservedly) wrecked by Dark Souls.  This isn't a fast-paced, action packed, hack and slash game.  This a meticulous game that thrives on you learning from your experiences and screw ups.  Simply put, Dark Souls is all about dying and you'll definitely do a lot of it.  But once you do learn the game in and out... it is actually a fairly easy-going experience.  Since every boss and enemy telegraphs their attacks you can dodge or block anything.  Boss battles that were a nightmare suddenly become cakewalks. Dark Souls does have a New Game+.  And it actually increases the difficulty in it.  Each time you beat it on the same file the enemies get harder and harder in each new game+ you do.  But again, it's not difficult if you recognize patterns.  For the most part enemies just hit harder and take less damage on a New Game+.So if Dark Souls actually becomes relatively easy with practice... why do people keep revisiting it?  Well, because it does so much right beyond that.  We revisit easy games all the time, but Dark Souls has its reputation steeped in it being a particularly difficult game.  But it's other reputation (the one less talked about) is that it has an amazing world and an amazing journey.  The narrative, the lore and the world of Lordran are exciting.  It's a world I want to go back into and explore over and over again.  The way the stories of the NPCs work out also add to the replay value of Dark Souls.  Perhaps in one play through Solaire, the Knight (who just loves some jolly cooperation) will die... so you resolve that in the next one you'll save him.  Perhaps what really gets people to go through Dark Souls again is that the game gives you enough to put a story together... but leaves out JUST enough for you to want answers.  And so you play through again hoping you'll find them.  It's rare to have a game that does this.  Of course, in 2015 there are a myriad of games that do this now (Five Nights at Freddy's in particular), but Dark Souls was a game that took a very different approach to story telling.  It took a minimalist approach.  It's rare to play games that don't insist on explaining everything to you.  That leave no stone unturned and give you all the answers without forcing the player to think or dig deeper.  Developers spent time creating this world, as a player we should want to invest in it.  Dark Souls asks you to dive.  If you're willing to jump in, the experience will be rewarding.  If not and a good challenge is all you're seeking, then you'll be left scratching your head wondering what the big fuss is about.  Dark Souls was so unique for its time that only its spiritual successor, Demon's Souls, could really draw comparison.  But Dark Souls manages to be a better game overall.  This isn't to say Demon's Souls is bad, it's only to say that the lasting impact from Dark Souls was amazing.If there was any shortcoming in Dark Souls storytelling and narrative it would be that the ending (either one of them) is a letdown.  Not in a thematic sense, but in an accomplishment sense.  After you've slain the final boss and seen the ending it's going to feel a little empty.  It takes a lot of work to get through Dark Souls and defeat every challenge it throws at you.  Defeating the bosses fills you with a sense of accomplishment.  Completing the entire game, however, doesn't leave you with this same feeling.  For as majestic as that opening cinematic was it's surprising to see that Dark Souls ends not with a bang... but with a whimper.  Yet at the same time right after it's over the flame is going to beckon you again.  Dark Souls can be forgiven for having a lackluster ending.  The world you inhabit is rewarding enough.All told, Dark Souls still holds up well.  There are few games like it, actually.  Demon's Souls and Bloodborne come close, but they aren't Dark Souls.  They're fun and enchanting games... but they aren't Dark Souls.  Had I played them first I might feel differently.  But alas, I ventured to the land of Lordran first.  I dived in and died many times before I saw the fruits of my labor rewarded.  If you have not played Dark Souls, and you want to give it a try, do so.  Not because it's challenging, but because the experience is still unlike a lot of games you'll play.  Dark Souls II is a good game, but it lacks the polish and meticulous refinement of the first game.  It misunderstands what makes Dark Souls special.  It's not just how challenging Dark Souls is that makes it stand out.  And it isn't just the challenge the game puts on your skill that makes it stand out.  Dark Souls II seemed to put an emphasis on how challenging it could be, but it always failed at making the world come to life the way the first Dark Souls did.  So jump into Dark Souls if you're looking for a game that still manages to feel different... but that will also challenge you in other exciting ways.  Prepare to die.  But also prepare to be absorbed in its fascinating world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8FYGABU0B3SQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GCBPGF0#wasThisHelpful","R8FYGABU0B3SQ","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The very first video game I ever played, like so many people born around the same time as me, was Super Mario Bros.  I was a kid who had never played a video game before and it blew me away.  And like every child I had all the Mario games on the original Nintendo (and later the Super Nintendo).  You'd think that as I grew older I'd outgrow Mario... but no, I still have quite a bit of love for Mario.  It's hard to abandon the first game you played.  Mario has been the reason I've purchased several Nintendo consoles over the years despite having a wide range of games to choose from.  And like so many children, I one day dreamed of creating my own levels.  Mario Maker gives you the chance to do that.  It also gives you the chance to showcase your creativity.  And there are a lot of assets for you to use in doing so.  The game is so massive and huge that I don't think it's possible to cover every nook and cranny in a review.  So instead let's just run through some of the basics and talk about some of the level design.When you begin the game it has a tutorial that will make you finish creating a level.  In doing so you'll learn the basics of dragging things from your tool bar and placing them in the level.  You can create bricks and ground and place items in question mark blocks if you so choose.  Once this is done the game throws you into the course maker on your own.  There are lots of tools to unlock, but the game doesn't make them all available from the get go.  Originally you had to wait nine days to unlock everything.  Nintendo patched this just before launch, but now the stipulations aren't always clear.  You CAN unlock everything in a day now, but the ""wait a day for this..."" method is still there.  As you create levels you'll get a notification stating that certain tools will be available soon.  Despite telling you to wait a day, you can still get access (it seems by waiting).  With this in mind you are still able to do the method where you set your Wii U forward a day (but only after you've gotten the message that new tools will be available).There aren't a lot of games for the Wii U that make excellent use of the gamepad.  Mario Maker almost feels as though it was designed around it.  It's the best use of the tablet the Wii U has right now.  You use the stylus to select tools and place them in the level editor.  It's quick and easy.  The interface of this game is brilliant in this regard.  Sometimes if you shake certain assets they'll change.  Take a koopa trooper.  By default it's green.  But as you're dragging it, shake it a little and it becomes a red one.  Shake bullet bill and instead of its bullets flying straight they become homing bullets instead.  It'll be no surprise that you'll start shaking, well, everything at some point to see what it does.While I don't like waiting, it makes sense that Nintendo would want to ease players in.  The manual you get on the disc isn't quite as helpful as you'd have it believe.  However, that being said, it's not really hard to learn Mario Maker on its own.  There are a lot of tools and a lot of things you can do with them, but the level editor allows for a lot of experimentation.  And the level editor is actually really well designed.  You can place Mario anywhere and hit ""play"" to see if something works.  You don't always have to test your creation from the start.  This allows you to see how it is in practice instantly.Players can change between the games in the level editor instantly.  You can create levels for Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World and New Super Mario Bros. U.  You can also change the setting in any of these levels as well.  You can create typical ground levels, underground levels, underwater levels, castle levels and airship levels.  And these can be used with any game.  Even games that didn't have them.  Super Mario World, for instance, doesn't have airship levels but you can actually create an airship level now.  What you CANNOT do, however, is combine Mario games.  It is not possible to make a portion of your level one Mario game and make another part of the level a different Mario game (for instance, if you wanted to enter a pipe and have it change from Super Mario Bros. to Super Mario Bros. 3 you can't do that).The other thing to keep in mind is that the four games still utilize their own unique styles, in spite of everything.  So when you create levels it actually is important to remember which you game you've created the level for.  Each game does pull its own play style.  You can't, for instance, use a raccoon leaf in Super Mario Bros. because it doesn't exist in Super Mario Bros.  Players also have to keep in mind certain mechanics.  There's no spin jump, for instance, in Super Mario Bros. or Super Mario Bros. 3 so you can't hope to do that in either game.  So if you're thinking of making levels where you spin jump on thwomps, better make sure you create it in the right Mario game.  This all means, of course, that you can use these mechanics to suit your style.  New Super Mario Bros. U allows players to wall jump and you can totally design levels around this mechanic if you want.  This means in some games you may run into limitations while in others you won't.But there are things that you can use and do pretty universally as well.  Not every Mario game had Magikoopa, but you can put him in all of them.  Not every game had Bowser's flying clown car but you can put it in everything.  The game also has fun things you can do as well so that you aren't only limited to doing the things Nintendo did.  You can give enemies Super Mushrooms and make them larger versions of themselves.  You can also do such things as make bullet bills spit out power ups if you want... or shoot out enemies.  You could make question mark blocks throw out enemies if you want.  The possibilities here stretch well beyond the limits of what Nintendo originally placed in these games.The only particular urksome downside to the level editor is that Nintendo didn't make a way for you to put checkpoints in the levels.  There's no halfway mark or anything you can place.  So if you've made a particularly challenging level and you wanted someone to be able to restart halfway through after getting beyond a certain point you can't do that.Players are also going to want to play test their levels extensively.  This is especially true if you want to upload it.  In order to upload a level you have to actually complete the level yourself.  In other words, the level needs to be beatable.  That's not to say you won't run into ridiculously hard levels.  You will.  Lots of them.  They're quite prominent in the community (as well as levels that either play themselves or where you merely need to keep running to the right or something like that).  It is only to say that no matter how hard the level is, it's possible to beat it.  When playing through other peoples levels online there will also be notes left by those who have also played it.  When you die, you'll also see places where other players have died.  It's only a day after launch and there's already a booming community on Super Mario Maker.  You can leave comments on other levels and you can also give them a star if you liked it.  It's interesting to play the levels and see what everyone has done.  You may even find inspiration for your own levels.If you don't wish to hop online there are other things you can typically do to pass the time.  If you're not interested in playing other users levels or if you don't want to play your own you can go and play the 10 Mario Challenge.  This is basically a mode where you play through eight levels on only ten lives.  These levels are made by Nintendo and most of them begin as pretty easy levels.  They do, however, get harder.  You go through them in sets of eight but you can keep coming back over and over again for new levels.  It is clear, however, that one of the tenants of this mode is to show everything you can do in Super Mario Maker.  If you're nervous about building your own levels this is actually probably the best place to start.There is another mode that involves you going back into the community, however.  The 100 Mario Challenge.  In this mode you'll play through several levels pulled at random from the community.  The point to playing through this mode is that you have a chance to unlock more content to use.  More specifically you can unlock lots of costumes for the original Super Mario Bros.  If you've got Amiibos you'll find that you can use them to unlock most of the costumes, but you'll still have a lot to unlock even if you have every Amiibo at this point in time.  If, on the other hand, you're not into collecting Amiibos you can still use the 100 Mario Challenge to unlock all of the costumes.  Each costume also has its own unique theme surrounding it (if you complete a level in costume the victory fanfare is different).There's a lot of content in Mario Maker and we're only really scratching the surface.  There are so many things to do and to create in the game itself.  By going into the community you'll definitely learn a few things about what drives other players and they may even help drive you.  There are a couple of downsides to the community, though.  The first and most annoying, is that the game doesn't make it easy in anyway to share with your friends.  So if you have friends there isn't a separate list to look at specifically their creations.  The other is less daunting.  Several players will have likely played any level you're going into, and they'll leaves notes.  Lots and lots of notes.  Sometimes this clutters the screen, but more often than not you'll find that many players ruin the surprises that most creators have thrown at you.  On the other hand, the Mario Maker does make it easy to continuously find your favorite content creators.  You can also see how many people attempted a level and how many completed it to give you an idea of how difficult it might be.With all that being said, Super Mario Maker is amazing.  It's loaded with a lot of content and will keep you busy for hours.  Either by creating your own levels or by seeing everything that has already been created.  Super Mario Maker is amazing.  If you've found yourself in love with Mario for any time over the past three decades, this game is for you.  There's a lot to do and a lot of hidden goodies and secrets.  But more importantly, playing through the creations of the community is the absolute best part about it.  There are so many amazing levels and the experience can be as everlasting as you want it to be.  For fans of Mario (particularly his 2D games) this is a love letter.  More than that, though, it can be one of the most amazing Mario experiences you'll ever have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPVGKBNWP5MCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWFCSB2#wasThisHelpful","RPVGKBNWP5MCZ","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Metal Gear Solid V is a huge game.  It's a very huge game.  It's also a game that introduces a lot of new elements for series fans.  A strategy guide can come in handy.  Piggyback Interactive has made tons of Metal Gear Solid guides and they've all been very helpful.  But Metal Gear Solid V is a totally different beast.  With how unique it is the focus of a guide might also need a unique focus as well.  This is what that guide does.  It provides the tools for you.  In short, Piggyback Interactive is more about helping you understand Metal Gear Solid V just as much as it is about helping you get through it.  This is the most exhaustive and unique Metal Gear Guide I've ever seen.The guide begins with a fairly touching foreward from Hideo Kojima.  Seeing as how this may very well be his last Metal Gear game, Kojima lets us know that he gave Metal Gear Solid V his all and that he also wants you to enjoy this particular strategy guide.  Once we've gone from this we jump into learning about the basics of the game itself.  Even veterans of the Metal Gear Solid saga might want to make a stop here.  Things are incredibly different in Metal Gear Solid V and you'd do well to make sure you know how all of its systems work before really diving in.  This is all the stuff for beginners, though.  Once you learn the basics of the system, the guide has more information you may want to utilize later.  We'll get to that.  First, the part that most of you are wondering about: The Walkthrough.Is the walkthrough good?  Yes, but it also has to take a different approach than most previous guides by Piggyback.  In previous games, Metal Gear was particularly... predictable.  Not so in this.  Thus Piggyback can always tell you what to do and where to go, but it can't always offer up strategies for how to do everything.  It can't tell you much about patrol routes or even how many patrols are in an area because Metal Gear Solid V is changing this stuff up constantly.  It doesn't mean you can't get help.  You can.  The guide provides a few basic tips before it actually dives in.  It's going to let you know how the guards can change and show you a few ""points of interest.""  Each mission always begins with a few ""notes"" and addresses your first play through.  Each section also has very detailed top down maps.  It then utilizes a waypoint system.  It'll show point 1 on a map and then you need to find the ""1"" in the walkthrough and read it.  But for those who just want a quick reference, you can just look at certain call outs on the map itself.  It also takes some time to map out how you should go about your mission.  As I said, though, it can't really show you guard routes or account for certain things like environmental changes or what happens during the night.  It can always point out objectives and intel, though.  And it's a good thing the guide comes with a huge map of both Afghanistan and Africa.This layout means that each mission it can detail quickly.  But whenever new enemies are introduced or there are new boss fights, the guide goes into a lot more depth.  It might seem like the walkthrough is flying by, but you'll get quite a bit out of it.  You won't always learn patrol routes, but the guide will actually help you out in other ways regarding that.  The guide also covers side ops, but not with the same amount of depth.  Since the side ops are typically not as long or as important you mostly get a screen shot and the details.  The guide and walkthrough are organized the way they are so that it can avoid as many spoilers as possible and so that it can be used more so for a quick reference rather than being used in an in depth way.The guide also has a section dedicated to Mother Base.  You'll get a lot of details here.  There are maps and information on your entire arsenal here.  You can also learn about development and how to manage it too.  This section of the guide is valuable because you'll get the most out of development and recruitment this way.  Players new to the concept of the mother base should spend time in this section.  Probably even more so than the walkthrough at times.In most strategy guides, the walkthrough is the meat and bones.  It's the section you buy a guide for.  I would argue that in the case of Piggyback Interactive's Metal Gear Solid V guide the reason you should buy it is the analysis and references chapter.  The guide cautions against using this section until you've completed 31 missions, but the first couple bits of advice are valuable to beginners and experts alike.  In particular, if you want to learn more about how your enemies function and work... this is where you want to go.  And believe me, you want to know how your enemies function and work.  But you'll get more than that.  Here I was able to learn about Metal Gear Solid V's dynamic difficulty and learn more about the response system and how the game changes based on your style of play.  All of these things were important to the core experience.  How your enemies work is invaluable, though.  How far can you enemies see?  This section tells you.  How about their health levels and various body parts?  It's all here.  Yeah, the walkthrough can't tell you about patrol routes or anything, but the enemies section can help you understand everything about them to aid you in how you go about it.  The guide also details the entire score system to help you get the best rankings on every mission.There are some spoilers in the references and analysis chapters, however.  In particular, a certain recruit is detailed in full that might be a spoiler.  The guide, of course, has already warned you that there would be some spoilers in this section.  You'll also get information on a lot of bosses here as well.  This section is here primarily for advanced players of Metal Gear Solid V.  In reading this section you already need to understand the basic systems of the game to begin with.The Extras chapter can help you learn some secrets about the game.  This is nice, but the real treat in the extras chapter is actually the entire story recap.  Piggyback has always done this with their Metal Gear Solid guides going all the way back to Metal Gear Solid 2.  And in each new guide they release they always recap the entire story and give an interpretation of the events that have happened.  This particular guide opts to cover every last detail you need to know in the story.  It'll also do so in chronological order.  Meaning it details the events of Snake Eater, Peace Walker, Ground Zeroes and Metal Gear Solid V before it goes into the plots of Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2 and finally Metal Gear Solid 4.  The guide also provides profiles for other characters throughout the saga.  If you've gone through the entire saga, this guide will help you begin to make sense of it.The paperback guide ends after you've read the whole synopsis.  The collector's edition, guide, however, has an art gallery with commentary by Kojima himself.  This alone makes the collector's edition worth a buy.  Here you'll get to learn about some of he development of the game and learn about some of the symbolism found in the game itself--directly from Kojima.  And it's brilliant looking artwork as well.Most strategy guides tend to be about making sure you get through the game.  They have a walkthrough and some secrets but that's about it.  Piggyback's Metal Gear Solid V guide, however, is trying to enhance your experience of the game.  It provides advanced data on enemies, environments, mother base etc., but give us more by providing a story analysis and some artwork with commentary.  For a collector, the guide is worth the purchase because you're getting far more than just a strategy guide.  You are getting an analytical tome.  This guide will really help you understand this complex game.  The most helpful bits aren't even in the walkthrough but rather in all the data which surrounds it.  The guide is more about helping players understand the game and its unique systems more so than just getting you through it.  This makes the guide helpful to beginners and experts alike.  If you want to understand Metal Gear Solid V and still find enjoyment in the game's surprises then this is pretty much the perfect guide.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVWLA5C90XU9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1908172762#wasThisHelpful","RVWLA5C90XU9W","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:+Amazing Presentation+Engaging Story, For the Most Part+A lot of different gameplay elements at hand+A lot of things to keep you busy.  Several missions and side opsThe Bad:-There might be a little too much to do.  Metal Gear Solid V is amazing, but there's a lot of side ops and moments of padding.-The story is good, but doesn't quite have the emotional pull of the previous games in the series.  The cutscenes are less about character building and more about plot exposition.  Considering all the things Metal Gear Solid V wants to say, it's amazing that not more of these things are conveyed in the game amazing cinematics.  Instead, much of what you learn in the plot and story is put to cassette tapes---NOTE: The Following Review is LongFor years Metal Gear Solid has been a staple in storytelling and gameplay innovation in video games.  Each new installment has either offered up a unique challenge (usually intellectually) or has offered up high stakes drama.  Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots saw the conclusion of Solid Snake's story, but Big Boss's has yet to come full circle.  With Metal Gear Solid V, the series finally comes full circle.  It's a unique experience, unlike anything Metal Gear has ever really done before.The game begins with you as Big Boss awakening from a nine year coma.  You're a legendary soldier and as such you are also hated by much of the world.  When you awaken you are missing an arm.  Just as you're recovering in the hospital, however, the facility is attacked.  A mysterious man named Ishmael is helping you get through the endeavor.  By the time Metal Gear Solid V's prologue ends you're left with more questions than answers.  The prologue is intense.  Metal Gear Solid V seemingly wants to dive in immediately.  Unlike previous games, Metal Gear Solid V doesn't dwell too much on things that have already happened.  It expects you to know them already.  They'll make references to other games but not explain them.  It brings up story elements and proceed as if you know this stuff already.  And frankly, I like that.  Metal Gear Solid V wants to be more to-the-point.  It's a lot better than hearing characters literally explain all the previous games to you the way some did in Metal Gear Solid 4.When the game starts it can be jarring for players because everything about it is so new.  Even Metal Gear Solid veterans might have to take time to adjust to the new stylings of Metal Gear Solid V.  For those who played Ground Zeroes this isn't a big deal.  But for those who did not, Metal Gear Solid V is a game that has a steep learning curve.First, the game is more open world.  You've got various locations on the overworld map.  You can set markers (and you'll have to) to mark certain objectives, enemy patrols or even just items in the area.  The world is huge and expansive.  There's a simple mission set up structure, but for the most part MGSV lets you tackle the missions any way that you want to.  You can either blaze into enemy territory guns blazing or you can sneak around.  Either way it's important to take in your surroundings and plan accordingly.Metal Gear Solid V doesn't want to remain consistently easy.  Or predictable.  Metal Gear Solid V utilizes dynamic difficulty.  In previous installments there were different difficulty levels to choose from.  Here, the game adjust the difficulty based on your performance.  And sometimes your enemies will learn from you as well.  Are you placing too many headshots?  Well then, they'll start wearing helmets.  Are you waiting until nightfall to complete most of your missions so that the patrols have a harder time seeing?  Then they'll start using night vision goggles.  Are you using a sniper rifle too much?  They'll start deploying more snipers.  There's more that happens, but the game will also mix and match these.  If you're a sniper going for too many headshots, for instance, you'll start coming up against snipers in full body armor.  Metal Gear Solid V doesn't just change this up for difficulty sake.  The game also wants you to experiment and play in various ways.  The game adjusts to your play style.  But if you're also failing a lot it'll take time to actually dial it back.  Except it doesn't just end there.  Nothing your enemies do is going to be terribly predictable in Metal Gear Solid V.  Unlike previous games in the series, the patrol routes of your enemies can change at any given time for no real reason.  You can't simply map out enemy patrol routes and memorize them.All of the new gameplay elements in Metal Gear Solid V make for a game that plays so radically different from previous installments that you'll need to adjust (unless you played Ground Zeroes).  It can take time to learn Metal Gear Solid V, but once you do the play is smooth.  The controls are very tight and function incredibly well.  Of course, the untold precision of the controls means you need to be precise as a player.  There are times (not many but a few) where you can easily screw up a plan of attack simply because you haven't taken into account just how precise everything has to be.  For instance, getting someone in a choke hold and slamming them to the ground is mapped to the same button.  One requires a simple tap... the other wants a firm press... but the distinction isn't always obvious.  Sometimes I grabbed an enemy when I wanted to slam them to the ground.  The game isn't demanding by any means, and punishment for failing a mission isn't harsh at all.  When you do go into an alert phase, however, the game will become unlike anything you've ever experienced before.In previous Metal Gear outings, getting spotted usually resulted in an alarm being lifted and an ""Alert Phase,"" wherein you had a counter that counted down.  Eventually you'd go into ""evasion"" phase which meant the enemies weren't in pursuit and that they were looking.  Finally there was a ""caution"" phase which meant that there were more patrols temporarily.  Metal Gear Solid V more or less does away with ""phases"" and just has it all play out organically.  When you're spotted and fail to dispatch the enemy who saw you while in reflex mode, the game enters a high alert phase.  There are no counters and there is no real waiting anymore until the dust settles.  Everything just simply plays out in real time from here on out.  Enemy patrol routes (as unpredictable as they already are) become impossible to predict.  If it's at night they'll use flares to find you.  Other bases near you will also go on high alert.  It's not just enough to leave the area and wait.  When an alarm is raised it's going to be raised for a while.  Enemies will also start using mortars, if they have to or call in reinforcements for strikes.  When the enemy spots you, Metal Gear Solid V doesn't mess around.  The enemies go into high alert but the game will more or less continue as normal.  The lack of phases means you have to be very careful upon being spotted.  They do eventually leave you alone, but you have to be listening out for enemy radios in order to do so.  This doesn't mean everything is fine.  They'll go and search the area where you were last spotted.Getting into a fire fight has almost always been discouraged in Metal Gear games, but Metal Gear Solid V is perhaps the first one where getting spotted actually FEELS like a stealth game.  Your ammo resources aren't always going to suffice to survive a firefight.  You have to suddenly take different sneaking approaches to get through areas should you be spotted.  Enemies going on high alert doesn't necessarily mean they're going to give chase and shoot at you with abandon like in previous games.  Simply put, Metal Gear Solid V is one of the most intense stealth experiences I've ever had with a video game.  There is never a ""best"" way to go about anything.  Strategies that worked one time won't always succeed the next time.  Even veterans of the Metal Gear Solid saga will find themselves having to think and plan out their actions more precisely than in other games in the series.  And the precision is important.  The games controls can be a little too tight.  It's easy to mess up a set up either because you didn't press a button hard enough or because a shot you took didn't land exactly where it needed to.  Once you get this down, at least, the game is more manageable.There is a lot to do in combat, but sneaking is often the best way to go about it.  While getting into firefights can be fun based on how much you can experiment, what you really want is to be able to send troops to Mother Base.  When you knock out enemies you can attach a pack to them that sends them back to mother base.  While they're there you can start sending them to different work centers where they can develop new things for you.  You can get better weapons, better sneaking suits and various cardboard boxes.  It's pretty vital to keep up with Mother Base.  If the game begins getting too difficult, it might be because you haven't developed a lot of resources at Mother Base.  And if you haven't developed a ton of resources, it might be because you haven't sent a lot of people there.  But it isn't just important to send anyone.  It's important to send the right people and place the right people in the right jobs.  Constructing and maintaining Mother Base is a game in and of itself.  Without taking time to construct mother base and get new recruits you're greatly limiting your arsenal.  The only way to get to the best of Metal Gear Solid V is to keep up with Mother Base.A common criticism about the Metal Gear Solid games is that they have a ton of cutscenes.  In particular, Metal Gear Solid 4 couldn't seem to stop with cutscenes.  A fun game to play... but too many cutscenes.  Metal Gear Solid V is different.  The open world experience doesn't cater to cutscenes nearly as much.  There is a lot of drama within the game, but most of the cutscenes are just used for you to gain more information.  And they're much more to-the-point than previous games.  The bulk of the story is actually told to you through various cassette tapes.  If you aren't listening to briefings you're going to miss out on a lot.For those who were upset that Metal Gear Solid 4 had too many cutscenes (even for Metal Gear) you'll be glad to know that Metal Gear Solid V features a lot more gameplay than cutscenes.  And I do mean a lot more.  Since it's an open world game, it's divided into missions.  There are about 50 missions central to the story, but there are also plenty of side-ops as well.  All told, Metal Gear Solid V has about 200 missions.  This means that not only is there far more gameplay than story... but that Metal Gear Solid V can keep you busy for a long time.  Previous games in the series relied heavily on replay value where you could discover more secrets or find interesting ways to go about things.  Here, it's not uncommon for the experience to last hours upon hours.  You're not going to finish Metal Gear Solid V in ten, fifteen or even twenty hours.  Especially if you decide to tackle everything.  This game is going to keep you busy for a very long time.And even some of the side ops are important.  Through these you can get new recruits for Mother Base and build your army.  You can also get more intel or you can get more allies and supplies.  One side op, for instance, has you getting an interpreter so that you can understand what the enemies around you are saying.  Others might have you rescuing prisoners.  All of this is usually for Mother Base so that you can develop better weapons and equipment.  The game is going to encourage you to do a lot of side ops to better your resources.All of this makes Metal Gear Solid V a great experience.  It's a fun game to play that has all the elements needed for a great gaming experience.  However... given all that Metal Gear Solid V has, it's also a good example of a game that is ""overdeveloped.""  Metal Gear Solid V is a game that's huge and after a few dozen hours with it you'll begin to realize it may be unnecessarily so.  Afghanistan and Africa are enormous locations, for instance, and after a while traversing the landscape feels like padding.  It takes a long time to get from one end of any zone (even stuff restricted to missions zones) to the other.  And while it's huge, that doesn't mean it's really populated.  There's a lot of empty space.  Sure you can pick up plants, but for the most part running from one point of interest to the next is going to feel long and tedious.  Thankfully you'll be able to get vehicles later, but the point is that Metal Gear Solid V sometimes feels far too big for it's own good.  The various side ops are great, but after a while they too become repetitive and monotonous.  Most side ops eventually become busy work.  After a while a lot of side ops have the same objective.  Go to a particular location and extract a specific soldier (or eliminate a team of some sort).  You'll revisit the same regions of the game constantly, but so many side ops go this route that they feel less like they're adding to the experience and more like the game trying to justify it's length and give you things to do.  Other tasks involve you disarming mimes or capturing animals.  They are predictably boring tasks.  Metal Gear Solid V is fun, but it is monotonous too.  In comparison, previous Metal Gear Solid titles that didn't exactly have a lot of free roaming felt engaging and urgent.  The experience wasn't long enough to be bothersome.  The games got to the point and that made the experience one I was comfortable having again and again.  Metal Gear Solid V is sometimes so big that it actually loses out on having the same kind of heart and charm that previous games in the series had.Perhaps Metal Gear Solid V's worst trait may be the story itself.  As I stated, it's not bad.  It's actually good.  It has moments where it leaves you thinking (albeit, sometimes for the wrong reasons), but it's a terribly paced story thanks to the design of the game.  The majority of your missions are lengthy more so because you have to take time to get to your target or destination.  On the other hand, the story mostly suffers because so much of what you learn has to be done through cassette tapes rather than cutscenes.  While it's not necessary for every cutscene to be long, Metal Gear Solid V's cutscenes don't always carry the emotional weight of the previous games.  It's great that the game gets to the point.  And it isn't completely devoid of emotion, but it has less emphasis on character as a result.  This is largely because the most important story points are separated by a lot of missions at a time.  Not only are the most important story beats separated by the main missions, but the game is also expecting you to do other things in between as well.  The game is always pushing you to be active in some way such.  Either you need to be doing side-ops, developing Mother Base or developing weapons.  There are even moments where you can't progress further in the story because there might've been someone in a main mission you didn't extract that lets you upgrade something you NEED for an upcoming mission.  It's just too easy to get distracted from the story at hand.  For as good as the story can be, the game keeps you away from that story for a long time.  And because the bigger story beats are separated by several missions this means you may go for hours at a time before actually seeing the next story moment.  But it won't matter as much because Metal Gear Solid V doesn't appear to have a lot going on in its story until late in the game.There are not moments that are nearly as hard-hitting or as impactful here.  Remember Liquid's impassioned speech about how much he hated Big Boss in the first Metal Gear Solid?  Nothing quite as impactful here.  Remember how upset fans got when Metal Gear Solid 2 pulled the bait and switch and had you play as Raiden instead of Snake?  There's nothing that daring here.  Remember how emotional the ending to Metal Gear Solid 3 was?  Not quite as emotional here.  Remember how you used to get these moments where characters would take time to talk about themselves or you could just call them up and have these weird conversations in these games?  It's not here either.  The story feels pretty bare bones that it feels kind of weird giving it praise sometimes.  Rest assured it's a fairly good story, but it only becomes that when you're willing to dig by listening to conversations that sentries are having or by listening to all the cassette tapes in the game.The characters suffer the most, through this.  Metal Gear Solid V may have a lot to say, but it isn't a story-heavy game.  The game paces quite poorly and the characters also don't add a lot simply because there isn't enough story in the games cutscenes for them to do so.  As mentioned, the cutscenes are mostly designed to push things forward, not to give you greater insight into the characters or the situation.  The cast in this game is unusually quiet.  Something is, well, missing.  Characters that were previously interesting (such as Ocelot) are now boring, serving merely as a means to give you information and pass off exposition but not to engage you in the game's narrative on an emotional level.  In previous games the cutscenes could be quite engaging by giving you a glimpse into the characters or the situation.  Here they're largely just there to pass information along.  Say what you will about previous games engaging in long cutscenes, but at least they felt like they added depth and meaning to the overall narrative.  Metal Gear Solid V doesn't seem to care.  The moments in which the cutscenes hit the emotional highs of previous games are few and far between.  The story isn't as rewarding simply because the design of the game's open world keeps it from reaching that pinnacle.  It's as though the game knows you're just playing to mess around in the open world and so it tries very hard not to keep you for a long time.Metal Gear Solid V is designed to let you play the way you want.  You don't need to be stealthy.  Some of the best experiences I've had with Metal Gear Solid V have been simply playing the game in free roam and getting into combat situations and experimenting with all the things I could do.  Were it not for the gameplay, Metal Gear Solid V would probably be a more forgettable Metal Gear outing.  But instead the gameplay makes the game so much fun.  There's a lot of experimentation.  Each mission also has different missions objectives and tasks to give you different ways to play them.  One moment you're playing just to get it done, the next you're taking a totally different approach so that you can complete all the optional tasks such as rescuing prisoners or listening to conversations between sentries.  It gives the player incentive to keep replaying missions, but also encourages players to play differently.  There are a lot of things to do, a lot of ways to play and the fact that the game spends of lot of time changing things up so that you'll fell compelled to play differently is why the game is so much fun, and probably why it's assured you'll get several hours of gameplay.  Like I said, some of the combat moments were some of the most intense in the series for me just because they were so well crafted and constructed.  It's gameplay is really good.  The only problem with it is that it might require players to be patient.  A lot of things you do are set on a timer.  A literal timer, not the in game clock.  When you develop weapons in Mother Base, for example, you actually have to wait a certain amount of time for them to be developed.  If you expand platforms or send recruits out on a dispatch you have to wait in real time for those things to be done.  While waiting you could probably do more side ops or mess around, but the point is that for as much fun as the game is, it still feels the need to slow down so that you still have to experiment and play in different ways.What the game lacks in story, the gameplay more than makes up for.  However, this does mean that hardcore fans who were really hoping for a great story won't get it.  The story isn't bad, it's just not the central focus and the game is constantly reminding you of this.  It feels content to take a breather from the story in all kinds of ways and force you to do other things to trigger certain story events as opposed to reaching them.  If you've valued Metal Gear for having a large emphasis on its story then the fifth game will take getting used to.  In the past I have valued this quite a bit.  And sure enough, it keeps Metal Gear Solid V from being the best the series has to offer.  As far as I'm concerned, Metal Gear Solid 3 is still the greatest achievement the series has had.  Metal Gear Solid V may be big on its gameplay, but at it's core you always get the sense that it's missing something that should've been there all along.  Whether or not that's the point of The Phantom Pain will probably be debated among players for quite some time.Graphically, Metal Gear Solid V is definitely a gorgeous game on the eyes.  As usual, the attention to detail is very good.  Considering how huge this world is, it's amazing they were able to put this much detail into it.  The voice acting is going to be hit or miss, though.  Since the game doesn't have a huge emphasis on the cutscenes, you get a lot of moments of dry voice acting since so much of what the cutscenes want to do is explain things to you.  Strangely enough, the voice acting on the various cassette tapes is far better than in the actual cutscenes because this is mostly where the heart of the game's voice acting is to begin with.  As I said, Metal Gear Solid V has a good story... you just have to dig to unearth it and a huge part of that are the cassette tapes.  It's remarkable just how much story is on those tapes.It might seem like I've been quite hard on Metal Gear Solid V for what it does with the story.  Guilty as charged.  That being said, though, the experience of Metal Gear Solid V is still pretty amazing.  The gameplay is engaging, even if the story isn't always engaging.  I've poured hours into this game and haven't tired of it yet.  For as much as Metal Gear Solid V stumbles, it's strengths stand just as tall.  Fans should play it just to get the full story.  On the other hand, though, it's lack of emphasis on the storytelling might be hard for some of the most devoted fans of the series.  It has its moments where it'll challenge you and make you think, but the story is not quite as engaging as the gameplay itself is.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the time I've spent with Metal Gear Solid V.  It's not perfect and it doesn't hide its blemishes as well as other Metal Gear games, but even with its flaws in storytelling I found myself unable to put it down.  For that, I can recommend Metal Gear Solid V.  Even if it can't quite reach the heights of the previous games in the series, Metal Gear Solid V is still a great game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28PGQM8TH30GH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKM06HG#wasThisHelpful","R28PGQM8TH30GH","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:+A Very Strong Story That Gets to the Point+Complex and immersive gameplay+Beautiful art design+Incredibly beautiful music+It's got great presentation all around+Very imaginative battles+A lot of replay valueThe Bad:-The controls won't sit well with some people-Sometimes mounting Agro is needlessly difficultShadow of the Colossus is a near perfect game.  There are very few games you can say that about.  Especially ten years after their release.  Shadow of the Colossus is one of the few games where every element is very meticulously crafted to have weight.  There's nothing thrown in to make it feel ""gamey"" and nothing thrown in to inflate the length or anything.  It's straightforward in its minimalist approach and doesn't spend a lot of time holding your hand.  It's an immersive experience that's going to leave you breathless by the end.  Few games manage to weave and tie everything together as well as Shadow of the Colossus.You play as Wander.  A man who has come to a Forbidden Land he has only heard about.  He has brought along his lover who has lost her soul and he wishes to revive her.  He seeks Dormin, a God that is known to bring souls back from the dead.  He brandishes the Ancient Sword to do so.  Upon seeing his valor, Dormin tells Wander that if he wishes to save his beloved's soul he needs to slay the sixteen Colossi that roam the land in order to complete the ritual.  Of course, Dormin also warns that it may cost him dearly.  Wander does not care, though and is more than willing to take up the mantle.  Beyond this most of the story of Shadow of the Colossus is left up to us to piece together on our own... but it doesn't leave any large gaps in plot to do so.  What is this land?  Why is Wander here?  What is the Ancient Sword and how did Wander come to possess it?  The game actually shows us all this.  It doesn't explain it, it shows us.  The story seems incredibly basic but by the time you reach the end of the game it is so much more complex, emotional and thought provoking than most games out there.  The story is simple, sure, but doesn't lack depth at all.  Of course, this stands to reason that the game might also not be for everyone.  Some of Shadow of the Colossus's amazing twists aren't likely to go over well with some gamers.  Shadow of the Colossus only appears straightforward, by the time you reach the conclusion you may have more questions than answers if you're not willing to invest the time to observe the world you're in and pay attention to the visual elements of the story.  This isn't a game that will explain everything to you.  If your eyes and ears aren't open you will miss things, no matter how subtle they may seem.As the game isn't one to waste a lot of time throwing in elements it doesn't need, you can expect the gameplay is just as straightforward as some of its storytelling.  The forbidden land is completely vacant of enemies.  There are only sixteen colossi to fight.  In essence Shadow of the Colossus is primarily a game that is nothing but a boss run.  That's not to say that all you'll do is fight colossi.  The game has no enemies to slay on the over world because we are told from the outset that no one is allowed in this land.  That doesn't mean that Team Ico was lazy about it.  The land in and of itself is dynamic.  You can always hold up your sword to guide you to the next colossus.  Getting to each one is straightforward at first, but as the game progresses reaching each new Colossus proves to be a challenge in and of itself.  This is also how the game becomes fun to explore.  The game is straightforward in its gameplay, but like the story... this doesn't mean it's simplistic.You also have your trusty companion, Agro.  Agro is a horse that Wander has come to this cursed land with.  You can ride Agro all over the world, and sometimes she's even necessary to battle some of the bosses.  Unlike most games, however, Agro truly does feel like a companion.  You'll traverse the world with her and she's always right behind should you choose to tackle things on foot.  She never leaves your side.  There's a sense that Agro truly is your horse.  This is counter to many games in which you can just get on any horse.  This is emphasized by the fact that you can call Agro by name if she isn't close by.  As you play through the game you will most likely form a bond with Agro.When you finally find a Colossus the battles are, again, straightforward... but not simplistic.  Each Colossus has a magic sigil that you have to find and stab it with your sword.  This seems quite simple in and of itself.  Sure enough, it is at first.  Yet it's getting to these weak points that is the challenge.  Most of the colossi are huge.  As such you need to not only figure out how to attach yourself to them, but also to scale them.  Wander can only hold on for so long, though.  You have a stamina gauge that will deplete the longer you hold onto a Colossi.  At times you'll have to find a spot on the Colossus to rest.  Some Colossi have weak points beyond just their magic sigils that you have to get at.  Doing so causes some of them to stagger and fall, allowing you to grab onto their fur and climb your way up.  As you can expect, though, this only seems simple at first.  Pretty soon the battles become more complex, however.  To the point that they're actually puzzles.  In one fight, for instance, you must trick a colossus into shattering it's own armor.  In some battles you have to use the environment to your advantage.  In others the environment works against you.  No battle will ever feel like any other battle throughout your journey.  Each one is unique because they all require their own approach.  If you can't figure it out, it's no big deal.  The game isn't trying to punish you.  Should you ever die you respawn right where the battle began and you have a chance to try it again.  There's not a lot punishment to be dealt out.What makes the game so good in regard to the battles, however, is that the game is always willing to throw a new twist at you.  Each time you think you've figured it out, Shadow of the Colossus makes sure to change things up.  The first Colossus, for instance, has its magic sigil right on its head.  Scale it, stab it a couple of times and your done.  But then the second colossus has two magic sigils you have to find to defeat it.  The third then throws in a puzzle element where you must figure out how to expose it's weakness and a path to it.  Each new battle becomes less straightforward as the game progresses onward.  The first time through the game it isn't uncommon for some of these battles to take you an hour to do because you always have to figure out what to do first.That being said, it should come as no surprise that Shadow of the Colossus is short.  After all, with only sixteen battles it can't be a game that will last twenty hours.  On the other hand, this doesn't mean the game isn't epic in its own way.  I don't mean epic in the casual sense of how people use it to mean awesome.  I mean epic in the sense that the visual and cinematic flair make the battles feel larger than life.  The colossi are huge, always towering over you.  The game uses several wide shots to show them.  The camera always pans in such a way that you really get a sense of just how small you are beside them.  The whole thing brings a new definition to the term cinematic in gaming.  All the battles feel like a David versus Goliath showdown.  The game may not be short, but it doesn't mean it slouches in its presentation by any means.  The art direction and environments are breathing with life.  There are forests, lakes, underground caverns.  You can see pieces of earth falling or water splashing.  The environment is alive.  This is all accompanied by great music and sound design.  As you travel the world there is no music, but in each battle with the Colossus the music hits strong, emotional chords that not only add to the battle... but the story and narrative as well.  The music isn't there to serve as spectacle, but to help tell pieces of the story that the game itself isn't verbally providing.  It works.  And when you finish the game for the first time you'll realize it works all too well.Shadow of the Colossus doesn't pad the game length out by any means.  To anyone the game is definitely going to feel short.  Unlike so many games that come out, Shadow of the Colossus doesn't throw in a ton of things.  There are no useless enemies thrown in your way for you to slay as you make your way to a boss.  There are no lengthy drawn out cutscenes (save for the beginning and the end) and the game doesn't slow down to catch you up on things.  It can be over quickly for anyone who figures out the battles sooner rather than later.  This doesn't mean Shadow of the Colossus doesn't have replay.  It has plenty of it.  Once you complete the game you can attempt to do it again in hard mode.  If that doesn't do it for you there is also a time trial mode where you can defeat the Colossi as fast as you can.  You'll even get rewards for doing so.  Throughout the land you can also shoot down fruits that are on the trees to increase your health, or hunt the elusive white tailed lizards so that you can increase your stamina gauge.  For a game with such a minimalist approach you'll find a lot of things to do.  I would suggest anyone playing the game do so twice.  The story, for as impressive as it is the first time around, will make a lot more sense in a second play through.There are a few things worth nitpicking at, however.  Shadow of the Colossus is a game that's quite difficult to find flaw with.  The most stand out one, for instance, is that mounting Agro is sometimes needlessly difficult.  The button to climb onto Agro is the same as the button to jump.  There were many times when I tried to mount Agro only to watch Wander jump over and over again.  Another sticking point with some people are the controls.  Yet, I didn't find the controls too bad for the simple reason that they reinforced the actual game narrative themselves.  The reason some of the controls feel clumsy and slow is because Wander himself is clumsy and slow.  You are meant to struggle in the same manner that Wander sometimes struggles.  The controls are seen more as an extension of character rather than just the outside experience most of us are used to.  This is why you have to continue to hold down a button as you climb, or release a button to jump as opposed to just pressing one.  It's also why, when controlling Agro you can only turn, but you can't exactly do much more than that.  Agro will often run to where you need to go just fine, though there will be times she might get caught up on pieces of the environment.  Truth be told the controls didn't come across as frustrating... though I wouldn't say they were simple either.  Shadow of the Colossus can take some time to get adjusted to and the game doesn't exactly wait for you to do so.  Once you get past that first Colossus it's pretty much going to cut you loose.If anything the strongest part about Shadow of the Colossus is how much attention it puts into the narrative it presents.  There is narrative and storytelling dripping from everything.  As the journey goes on, for instance, Wander becomes more tired, dirty and haggard.  His clothes begin to rip, he begins to get covered in the blood of his enemies.  The colossi feel like they have personality.  The animations of Wander, Agro and the Colossi are also really impressive that they feel lively and complex.  We also learn about and begin to like Wander despite him never really saying a word.  Shadow of the Colossus does the ""show"" part of its storytelling so well you might notice just how deep it is upon first playing it.  Again, it's why I recommend two play throughs.  As you notice more and connect more with the story and narrative it becomes immersive.Shadow of the Colossus is near perfect.  It shows the strength of the video game medium in a way that few games can even hope to do.  It is a game that shows you don't require needless padding, rooms full of enemies all over the place or a bloodbath to be entertaining and immersive.  It is no surprise that in the years since its release we haven't really seen anything quite like it.  This game is a must play for anyone seeking good storytelling and complex gameplay.  It's that good and shouldn't be missed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYRY2VZCCJ0PS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009I6S0O#wasThisHelpful","RYRY2VZCCJ0PS","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this day and age, strategy guides are collector's items.  Does this mean the quality of the guide doesn't matter?  Just because you can find the info online does it mean the quality is insignificant?  The quick answer is no.  A strategy guide still has to live up to a standard regardless of whether or not the information is online.  Years ago, Bradygames used to make strategy guides exclusively for Squaresoft (now Square Enix).  These were guides for Final Fantasy VII, VIII and IX.  While the Final Fantasy VIII guide was surprisingly good, the Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy IX guide were really bad.  We're talking really bad.  So of course when I saw the strategy guide collection--along with them advertising that the guides would be updated I merely thought it would be a chance to actually get the correct info.  After all, if you've never played Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VIII or Final Fantasy IX it would certainly be great to have a guide to help you along the way.  Instead what you're getting are the exact same strategy guides you got 18, 16 and 15 years ago respectively.  Even for the ardent Final Fantasy collector or strategy guide collector this is not worth the money.  And for those who are embarking on their first Final Fantasy adventure these guides (save for perhaps the Final Fantasy VIII guide) are not particularly useful.  At the very least, the Final Fantasy IX guide no longer directs you to play online.  Nevertheless you are still paying too much money for three guides that are already out there and can be found relatively easily for much cheaper.I'll take each strategy guide individually and try to go through them as quickly as possible.  There are no promises.  I will then go over the entire package as a whole.  It is also important to know that Bradygames and Prima teamed up and gave you this guide collection together.  It is not strictly a Prima Games publication.FINAL FANTASY VIIBack in 1997, the official Final Fantasy VII strategy guide was billed as the only official guide.  One where you could get the secrets straight from Squaresoft.  Unfortunately, back then the guide was completely blown out of the water by the Unauthorized Guide from Versus Books.  Here, you're only getting a reminder of just how painfully bad the Bradygames guide was.  The walkthrough was pretty standard.  It spoiled all the plot details.  While it had some nicely detailed maps and was able to get you from point A to point B with ease, that's about where the usefulness for the guide ended.  In particular the original Bradygames guide missed a lot of key details or got some things just plain wrong.  And despite the packaging here saying it's been ""updated,"" this is not the case by any stretch.  The guide is literally exactly the same.  This includes every typo, every bit of wrong information, every spoiler... even every screenshot.  Every ""Note,"" every ""Tip,"" every note of ""Caution,"" is exactly the same.  This also means that if you are (for some reason) actually using the guide itself it has the same errors.  How do you get the Final Attack materia?  The guide still says its a prize in a chocobo race.  Want some advanced materia combos?  Too bad, you get the exact same basic combonations.  Enemy skills?  Guide is still missing a lot.  How about that bestiary?  It was an incomplete mess in the original guide... well, it's a complete mess here as well.  Every typo is the same.  How hard could it have been to actually update the guide with the correct information.  For heaven's sake, they should've just grabbed the Versus Books guide from a while back (just selling one box set of this would've made sure they got their money back for that one) and used that information.The Bradygames Final Fantasy VII guide was one of the worst strategy guides out there and it's STILL one of the worst strategy guides out there.  There are enemies missing from the bestiary as well as information that's still wrong (the one which urked me the most was telling readers the Master Tonberry had 8000 HP... a typo that, you guessed it, is still present here).  There are items that aren't included in the list.  Even the walkthrough is still confusing at times because it can't decide whether it wants to use waypoints or not.  In some places ""A"" can either be referring to an item in the area's item list or it could be referring to a point on the map you need to go to.  And in some cases it'll represent both... leading to two ""A's"" on the map.  One referring to the item and one referring to a point where you need to go.  If that sounds a bit confusing... imagine what actually using the walkthrough is like.So was there anything different?  Yes.  The layout.  That's about it.  It's layout is designed to have more in line with the recently published Final Fantasy Type-0 guide.  And yes, it actually is cleaner and easier to read... but it doesn't make the information correct.  When they said the guides would be updated I thought it referred to more than just the layout.  The layout is definitely a lot better... but because the walkthrough, tables, charts, bestiary and even worldmap are all copied and pasted (just with better looking text bubbles and clearer font) it's still a relatively bad strategy guide.  And while I don't really mind spoilers in a strategy guide, for anyone who was a little upset that the Bradygames guide did spoil everything in Final Fantasy VII, all those screenshots (every last one) is here too.Worst of all, however, is what the guide didn't have that it still doesn't have.  Yeah, fonts and texts are easier to read but they're still missing key secrets such as how to get the Final Attack materia.  They don't tell you the secrets of every character's ultimate weapon.  They tell you HOW to get them, but now how they WORK.  For example, Cloud's Ultima Weapon deals more damage based on Cloud's current HP levels, while Red XIII's Limited Moon deals more damaged based on his MP levels.  Things like this the guide doesn't tell you. It still doesn't tell you that you can go to Bone Village and dig up any important items you might've missed.  Of the three guides here, Final Fantasy VII was definitely one of the guides that was in need of an update because there was so much information that was completely missing to begin with.FINAL FANTASY VIIII never thought the Bradygames Final Fantasy VIII guide was actually bad to begin with.  It did the step by step walkthrough thing, while explaining all of the more complicated ones.  It actually made the walkthrough easy to use (albeit, confusing at first) and managed to keep some spoilers to a minimum.  The Final Fantasy VIII guide didn't run into a ton of problems.  If anything the guide was a little overdeveloped at times.  The bestiary being as detailed as it was is certainly nice, but it's really only good at gauging the stats of a monster because it can't show all 100 levels... just by each tenth (10, 20, 30 etc.)  Yet it was still helpful.  I was also able to find just about all the sidequests and even defeat the Omega Weapon using the strategy outlined here (with a couple of tweaks for my own pleasure).  It'll also help you find every GF (even pointing out how to get some GFs you might've missed), understand Triple Triad and outline everyone's ultimate weapon.  If there was any issue I really had with the Final Fantasy VIII guide back in the day it was that the area maps were in the back of the guide.  Although I didn't need them, it was still annoying they were back there to begin with.  And they were mostly just screenshots.  They pointed out items and draw points but I failed to see why they weren't included in the walkthrough itself.As with the Final Fantasy VII guide, the Final Fantasy VIII guide is word for word exactly the same as the Final Fantasy VIII guide published by Bradygames in 1999.  It was, believe it or not, the best of the Bradygames guides and that is still true to this day.  It's still rather good looking and worthwhile.  The only difference is that some of the layout is different.  Again, to have a more uniformed look with the Type-0 guide and to look more closely with the Final Fantasy VII guide included in this set.  It's cleaner, but unlike the Final Fantasy VII guide... the original Final Fantasy VIII guide actually had a nice looking layout.  Here things like some of the artwork and gorgeous watercolor backgrounds aren't present.  This guide may be cleaner, but the original guide published in 1999 is still more fun to flip through because it looks so characteristically like the game itself.  The guide is still organized and helpful, at least.  This one even fixing a couple of typos the original one had.  For instance, in my 1999 edition of Final Fantasy VIII under the boss fight ""Ultima Weapon,"" that guide shows Ultima Weapon has 1068 hit points.  Obviously that's wrong, and it's corrected here.Again, though, if you already have the 1999 version of the guide... there's not much reason to get too excited here.  After all, all of the text, words, screenshots are exactly the same, save for only minor fixes such as a mistyped HP listing every now and then.  It's organized and will carry you through the game, this time even pointing out all the actual secrets.  It's still useful here.FINAL FANTASY IXOf all the Bradygames Final Fantasy guides, the Final Fantasy IX one was the worst.  In 2000 Square introduced us to Play Online.  As such, the original Final Fantasy IX guide often times told you to go to Play Online.  It made sure to give you keywords to search for to get the information.  Wanted to know a secret?  You had to go to Play Online.  Wanted to know where a certain hidden item was?  Go to Play Online.  Want an actual boss strategy?  Go to Play Online.  Want to actually FIND a hidden boss?  Go to Play Online.  That's what the original Final Fantasy IX guide was like.Here is the good news.  The guide, thankfully, doesn't send you to Play Online.  Even if it did Play Online no longer has any of the information for Final Fantasy IX to begin with.  But that's okay because now all that information is actually in the strategy guide.  And yes, this makes the Final Fantasy IX guide actually pretty good now since you are no longer being sent to Play Online because the information is actually here.  To put it into perspective... the original guide published in 2000 was 208 pages.  Here it's now 224  In particular, the secrets section is much more detailed and no longer useless Remember, for instance, when you had to go to Play Online for every boss strategy?  Well, now every boss strategy is actually here in full.  Remember how you had to use Play Online to actually find Hades and Ozma?  Well, now it actually tells you in the guide.  When I was comparing this side by side with my old Final Fantasy IX guide I was astonished.  Every mention of Play Online in the original 2000 edition of the guide suddenly had a note that explained exactly what I was looking for.  In fact, were this guide to have been released separately I would've actually bought it because it's the only guide here that actually WAS updated and includes information the original print didn't.  And were it not for the fact that all this info was online, this would be a pretty cool guide to buy by itself.  But this whole boxset isn't worth forking money on just because the Final Fantasy IX guide no longer sucks.Almost everything that was on Play Online is now included in this guide.There were maybe only two things that were originally found on Play Online that aren't here.  The first is Excalibur II.  The guide tells you that you'll have to get through the game incredibly quickly but it fails to say HOW quickly and also WHERE you'd get it from.  But let's be honest, what I was really hoping for was some advanced strategies to actually ensure I could do it in the time frame necessary.  Here, the guide just wishes you luck without actually giving you the information you'd actually need.  It was, of course, stupid of me to expect Bradygames to actually go the extra mile but I thought maybe--just maybe--they might actually consider it.The other thing is that the bestiary went with the more basic stuff from the original guide as opposed to getting the more expanded version from Play Online.  Meaning that you don't get all the enemy info such as what they're weak to or what they absorb or what they're immune to.  But at least you know HP levels and what you can steal from them.  You get the basic stuff and while I wish for the more expanded stuff... it's good enough for me.Lastly--and this one is important--there are no maps. Lots of items pointed out and the walkthrough is actually not bad... but there are absolutely no maps whatsoever.  For a JRPG including maps is a must and the fact that we don't even get area maps in the back is kind of a bummer.  That being said, though, my point still stands: The Final Fantasy IX guide is no longer useless.  Unfortunately it's also 15 years too late.  The guide is actually pretty serviceable now, but the fact that we had to wait fifteen years for a decent Final Fantasy IX guide kind of sucks.THE PRODUCT AS A WHOLETwo things are particularly bothersome about these guides.  The first is that they're billed as collector's items but, let's be honest, they come across like a cheap cash in.  They're in hardcover, sure, but aside from the Final Fantasy IX guide there are no serviceable updates.Let me give you a point of reference:  When Prima released the boxset of those six collector's edition Zelda guides there were a few noticeable things.  In particular, they realized the original Skyward Sword guide was pretty bad and updated it so that it would actually be a good guide.  They made sure to fix the errors, make it easier to read, and expanded it to include anything they may have missed.  They also made other changes. They made the Ocarina of Time 3D guide easier to read and made sure that the legendary checklist in the Twilight Princess guide was more legible and detailed.  It wasn't a lot of updates, but it was enough that it didn't feel like a cynical cash grab so much as a love letter to Zelda fans.  Considering how much this particular boxset was delayed you'd have thought they were actually releasing totally different (and better) guides.  They didn't.  Instead we got the exact same guides with a different layout, but no errors or anything like that being addressed at all.  We got the same Bradygames guides we got years ago... but with Prima publishing them.  At no point did anyone think to oversee some of this.  This would be a lot less frustrating if it wasn't for the fact that these errors have been well known and documented for over fifteen years.There were a couple of extra things, but nothing worth paying so much money for.  You get lithographs of artwork that's been floating around for an incredibly long time.  Each guide also has a ribbon book mark but you're not going to need it.  These aren't huge thick guides like what you get from Future Press where a ribbon bookmark (or two... sometimes even three) would be beneficial.  About the only thing nice was the box the guides came in.  It was pretty darn gorgeous.  Aside from that the only ACTUAL worthwhile thing you get from this set is a Final Fantasy IX guide that doesn't suck.  Aside from that you could not only get the guides for much cheaper used, but get the same information.  And while the layout is better here and more clear, it's just not enough of a change to warrant putting THIS much money down on strategy guides you likely already have with no new information.Even for collector's... this is hard to recommend.  The reason why that Zelda Boxset of guides is so amazing and worthwhile is because those guides were actually good guides to begin with... and some of them were tweaked to be better.  The Skyward Sword guide, in particular, is almost a completely different guide because they realized the original one was so bad.  So they fixed it.  And that updated guide was released two years later.  There was actually a lot of love and care into making those already pretty good Zelda guides better.  It worked, the boxset was amazing to have.  These Final Fantasy guides have been released over a decade later and they still have the same problems they did before with no real care put into them.  This feels like nothing more than a cynical cash grab.Included with my boxset was an ad saying that another boxset was on the way.  The next set will include the Final Fantasy X, X-2 and Final Fantasy XII guide.  If this boxset is any indication of what that next one will be, I wouldn't hold my breath.I can't recommend this boxset.  If you collect strategy guides... avoid this one.  If you're a hardcore Final Fantasy fan... avoid this.  There's nothing here worthwhile that you can't already get separately for a cheaper price.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBKA0JL1OB6CG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101898046#wasThisHelpful","RBKA0JL1OB6CG","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's only been a year, but Final Fantasy X/X-2 is already getting another release in such a short amount of time.  The following review is long.  First, we'll go over the two games.  Not much has changed from the actual release a year ago.  First we'll go over the two games before talking about the actual PS4 port.  The long story is simple: If you have it on the PS3 already, there's no need to get it on the PS4.-----In 2001, the original Final Fantasy X came out and single-handedly brought the JRPG into the PS2 generation. It was a remarkable feat. It had a brilliant story, a good combat system and a soundtrack that was to die for. It quickly became recognized as one of the greatest JRPGs you could find on the PS2. It has had it's ardent fans and ardent haters alike. It is a game that garnered a lot of strong responses from gamers. Square-Enix is a little late at jumping on the HD bandwagon, but if there was one game in their catalog that definitely deserved one, it was Final Fantasy X. Final Fantasy X-2 is here as well, but it did not make the same splash as its predecessor. There are some things about Final Fantasy X that are still brilliant. It's nice to relive it and to experience it again. As for Final Fantasy X-2, though I would not claim it to be as memorable as the first one it had some great gameplay elements that still hold up well today.Final Fantasy X centers on Tidus. He is a star Blitzball player, like his father before him. One night during a game a mysterious entity called Sin attacks and takes Tidus from his home and sends him into the land of Spira. There he meets Yuna, a summoner about to go on a pilgrimage to the various temples in Spira so that she can have the power to destroy Sin. Final Fantasy X has a lot to its story. It had a lot of well developed characters, but mostly it was willing to tackle a lot of themes. In particular, the large amount of time it spends looking at the fictional religion of Yu Yevon and the teachings present. It's quite a story. It is only a shame that the voice acting isn't that especially good. Final Fantasy X didn't have great voice acting in 2001 and it's certainly not better now. It's a good story but the voice acting takes some time to adapt to. Final Fantasy X-2, by comparison, does a slightly better job (although not by a whole lot).The gameplay in Final Fantasy X still resonates quite well. There are random battles to be fought, but the battle system was quite intuitive at the time. You always know the order in which you and your enemies will take action. This allows for lots of strategy and planning as opposed to being quick on your feet. For some this made the game easy, for others it allowed for them to have more control over combat. Each character also had an overdrive gauge which was very similar to Final Fantasy VII's limit breaks. When the gauge is full you can use an overdrive attack, which is a powerful attack. Each character also has their own uses and ""job"" in battle. Tidus is good at hitting agile enemies, Wakka hits flying enemies with ease while others miss, Auron has piercing attacks, Lulu casts her magic, Rikku steals and disassembles machines and Kimahri can absorb abilities of his enemies and use them. But the most interesting is Yuna who can summon aeons that you'll use in battle. Each with their own set of abilities and attacks. You can also switch characters in battle at any time provided that they are not knocked out. Every character shares in experience.The most amusing aspect of Final Fantasy X was the sphere grid. The sphere grid is Final Fantasy X's unique level up system that has certainly influenced some RPGs (most notably Tales of Xillia). Each character gains sphere levels and follows a path along the sphere grid. You activate various nodes using spheres to raise your stats and learn abilities.In a nutshell many of these elements in Final Fantasy X still hold up. Final Fantasy X-2, on the other hand, was somewhat polarizing back in 2003. Yet, for what it's worth, over a decade later it's really not a bad game by any means. The story is not as strong and neither are some of the characters. On the other hand, it is a more open world than Final Fantasy X. In particular, the battle system is still fast paced and fun. It goes back to the ATB battle system instead. Each character has access to dress spheres where they learn various abilities to be used in battle. The jobs affect how fast they attack and this makes Final Fantasy X-2 a fun game to battle in. The system is unique. Each job plays its own role. White mages heal, thieves steal and warriors attack. Final Fantasy X-2 has such a non-linear approach it can come across as quite tough and challenging at times.There are some moments in Final Fantasy X-2's tone that certainly clash from time to time with Final Fantasy X. Where as Final Fantasy X is quite sad in many respects and downtrodden, X-2 is a lot more upbeat. Both games are rather fun to play, but fans probably still see Final Fantasy X-2 as being a less ""serious"" game. Originally when I played Final Fantasy X-2, I did not care for it. Here, I'm okay with it. The battle system is fun. And while the story isn't nearly as good as the first one, it's not necessarily bad either.The HD Remaster has quite a few things of note, however. While I would like to point out the HD visuals first, I'd rather start with the fact that this is the international version of the game. Meaning that for North American players there's a wealth of new content. First and foremost, the sphere grid. There is now a standard and expert version of the grid. The expert grid allows for slightly more flexability. Where as the standard grid kept most characters contained to their own section, the expert one lets you divert a lot sooner. This means characters may learn other characters abilities sooner rather than later. It is also a less straightforward path. The expert sphere grid will require more grinding. There are more paths that diverge. Where as the standard is a more straightforward path, the expert sphere requires you to be a lot more aware of what you're doing. You might find yourself going back one direction just to get an ability you missed. The standard sphere grid will, for the most part, take every character to every ability along their path, but the expert sphere grid is less concerned with that. It can make the game harder or easier. The reality is that you need to zero in on what you want sooner rather than later. The expert sphere grid alone can give you a totally different experience with Final Fantasy X. I would highly recommend veteran players go with it. Newcomers should stick to the standard grid.The other big addition are the dark Aeons. In 2001 North American players completely missed out on this optional quest. These are ruthlessly challenging bosses with millions of HP, requiring the best and boldest from players. Likewise, there is another hidden boss called Penance These bits of extra content are worth your time if you're willing to invest it. But most of all, they make Final Fantasy X worth revisiting even for those who mastered it over a decade ago.Final Fantasy X-2 doesn't really include much (if any) extra content, unfortunately. No new bosses or story elements. But the collection as a whole does include ""Final Fantasy X-2"" Last Mission as well as a prologue to Final Fantasy X-2. There is also an audio credits sequence. There's a lot of content here.There are smaller things that I'm somewhat picky about. Chief among them is that Final Fantasy X spends a lot of time expressing its dialog in various cutscenes. The option to skip them isn't present. I wish Square had added that for when one decides to replay as some moments can get a little dragged out. Likewise, with the audio there are moments when the game has small hiccups or pauses before other characters begin speaking. The dialog doesn't always flow naturally because there are moments when the next line has to load. Those nitpicks aside there isn't much reason not to get this HD collection if you loved Final Fantasy X and X-2.-----When the PS3 version came out, the HD visuals were astonishing.  It was almost like getting a whole new game with some of the nice additions.  The pre-rendered sequences were also touched upon.  Where as many other games released HD remasters without touching the pre-rendered stuff, Square actually did.  It made Final Fantasy X/X-2 easily one of the best HD remasters out there.  In all honesty, the PS4 version really isn't worth getting if you've already got it on the PS3.  There isn't enough new stuff here to really warrant another purchase.  Especially at a fifty dollar price tag.  In such a short time the HD remaster was already put out one more time.  It was a glorious update on the PS3 but the only reason to get the PS4 version is if you actually missed it already.  There's something here that makes this remaster of a remaster come across like a cash grab.  It's too expensive for another version of Final Fantasy X/X-2 and the updates to the PS3 version released earlier just aren't enough to justify a whole other purchase.If you've already got the PS3 version there's nothing here that is going to convince you to buy the game again on the PS4.  There are a couple of new features, but nothing too particularly exciting.  You have the ability to hear the original music in Final Fantasy X instead of the newly arranged tracks.  You also have the ability to carry over your save data from either the PS3 or Vita version.  This particular remaster seems to be here explicitly for those who didn't bother getting the original remaster at all.  If you want to play these games but never got a hold of the PS3 remaster then the PS4 one is certainly the most visually striking... but again, it's not exactly worth putting down fifty dollars for this version when the PS3 version is already so much cheaper for what is essentially the same game.Final Fantasy X/X-2 isn't bad by any means.  It's a good remaster.  It's just that we already got this remaster a year ago and there's nothing here that's going to be make it worth purchasing again.  You'd be better off saving your money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BDMTOVPBQ5UZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URE9SSE#wasThisHelpful","R1BDMTOVPBQ5UZ","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:+The story starts off engaging+Really engaging and complex battle system+A really good music scoreThe Bad:-The story begins with engagement but isn't always coherent-The characters are also not as well developed-For the most part, the remastered presentation is severely lacking---Note: The Following Review is LongIt's hard to believe now, but once upon a time Final Fantasy was a name that was revered in gaming.  No fan can quite point to when the decline began, but one thing is for certain, in the Post Final Fantasy XIII world, Final Fantasy doesn't resonate the way it once did.  The release of a Final Fantasy used to be something to be excited about, now each one is meant with skepticism.  Final Fantasy Type-0 tries a new approach with Final Fantasy.  And this is a good thing... I'm just not sure the PS4 was really the way to experience it.As most know by now, Final Fantasy Type-0 HD is a reissue of a PSP game originally released in 2011.  It is a way to sort of try and rebrand Final Fantasy and re-imagine it.  When a game advertises itself by saying it's now ""mature"" it's usually the first instinct that the game will be anything but (if you have to draw attention to it, you're still a work in progress, sorry).  Here Type-0 tries to skirt that with it's incredibly powerful opening moments that show, immediately, this isn't the Final Fantasy we all grew up with.  In the beginning we get a great big prologue about a nation named Orience that is under attack.  The enemy has employed a crystal jammer which keeps the citizens of Orience from using magic, easily allowing the city to be overtaken.  There's just one catch, an elite unit called Class Zero that isn't affected by this crystal jammer at all.  The opening sequence is bloody, emotional and does a great job grabbing your attention.  At first I simply thought the blood was how they fashioned Final Fantasy to be mature, but in some ways it's really not just splatter.  The use of blood here is used to show the horrors of war.  The maturity doesn't come from the use of blood, though, but a particularly deep political story.  Like some of Final Fantasy's best moments, Type-0 opts to tackle a lot of big themes in a more in-your-face manner.It's just a shame that Type-0 can't keep this up throughout the entirety of the game.  While the story has a very powerful start, it's not long before it starts to dwindle.  And pretty soon.  The story isn't always coherent, often taking huge leaps in logic without really explaining much and instead asking the player to just accept certain events and circumstances.  Granted, many games do this, but Type-0 doesn't have enough distractions or depth to make sure you don't notice this.  One of the reasons for this is because the game is filled with a huge cast of characters.  Most Final Fantasy games take their time in introducing you to the major players.  Type-0 just dumps them all on you from the start.  That's not to say they don't have personality or that they aren't developed.  They are.  Some of them better than others.  But the game also waste no time jumping into the plot either (the dreaded ""Ultima Bomb"" in the beginning is a great example that the game wants to hit the ground running) which means in the process... some character development has to be sacrificed.  Were every character likable this wouldn't be a problem.  Except that isn't the case.The game also isn't helped by some poor writing and some bad voice work.  As you can imagine there are some cheesy lines for a game begging to be taken as seriously as Type-0.  Except... sometimes cheesy and bad lines are quite endearing in a JRPG.  But when the lip synching doesn't match up it can be problematic.  Granted, this is from a different region.  Totally shouldn't be perfect.  But when a character simply gives a ""Hmmm..."" and their lips are moving well after the aforementioned ""Hmmm..."" is done we've got problems.  Again, though, some of that stuff is quite endearing.  It's just that even at their worst, Square-Enix usually doesn't let the dubbing get this bad.The story may not be the best, but the gameplay certainly helps some of the cases with the game.  The gameplay is more action-oriented than it is turn based.  The closest contemporaries that come to mind would be Crisis Core or Kingdom Hearts.  You can set certain actions to certain buttons and use them.  Each member of Class Zero uses their own unique weapons and abilities.  You can also switch between members on the fly.  Three characters enter combat at a time.  You control one, but all the other characters are readily available in the reserves.  Should someone fall or you need to change up your strategy you can switch them out.  You'd think this one particular aspect would make the game easy, but it doesn't.  Type-0 is not for the novice player.  The game can sometimes be quite brutal.  Enemies hit for lots of damage at a time.  Likewise, the game doesn't let you coax through just using the same party over and over again.  You will be forced, at times, to change it up.  Not because the game will force you to use certain party members, but because their abilities have a great impact on the battle.  There's a really nice strategic component to Final Fantasy Type-0.  For those looking to meet the challenge, it's quite fun and engaging.The battle system also has some fun additions to keep you on your toes.  When you defeat enemies you have a chance to absorb some health and MP from them.  You'll want to do this a lot as spells cost quite a bit of MP.  You've also got a lot of action abilities to help you dodge and defend in battle.  Again, for each character they're different.  As you gain experience and level you have to decide how to divide your ability points to get more abilities to assign to your characters.  Since you can't have them all equipped at a time you've always got to be cautious in what you assign.The game is done in a mission based format and when you aren't battling, you'll be in Akademia, your base of operations.  In between missions you'll have a few game hours to explore some story elements or do a few things around the base.  Such as shopping.  There are save points throughout that you'll have to utilize.  And you will use them.  You can change the character you're running around Akademia as, but you can only do it from a save point, which can be tedious when trying to figure out which character triggers which event.  At the very least it adds a much needed layer of character development.  On the other hand, you won't be able to explore all of the events in a single play through.  Once the next mission begins that's it.  The next time you're in Akademia things will usually change.As mentioned before, Final Fantasy Type-0 was originally a PSP game.  This is an HD upgrade.  Simply put, some games from the handheld aren't always suited for an HD remaster.  Where as Square-Enix has done justice to the likes of Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep, no such fortune comes to Type-0.  It is a game that is too noticeably from the limitations of a handheld.  The character models are given a nice redesign.  I should say some of them are.  The main characters in particular.  A lot of the other character models were not.  Some of them even major characters.  And watching sleek and redesigned Class Zero cadets standing opposite some of the characters that were untouched in their transition from the PSP to the PS4 is quite noticeable.  Character models around Akademia are mostly untouched as well.  Even the environments suffer a great deal.  Again, because a lot of the game isn't given as much of a touch up here.  PSP games are usually pretty good at giving the illusion the world the game takes place in is bigger than it is.  Games like Square's own Crisis Core or Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep were really good at this sort of thing.  Type-0 mostly has corridors to explore without much to really get in your way.  The environments looked good, but were never too populated or detailed to begin with.  The situation on the PS4 makes this much more noticeable and that much worse.  You'll still notice a lot of muddy textures.  And now that some of it has been blown up to be on a bigger screen you'll also notice a lot of strange jagged edges as well.  Considering how much care Square gave to the Final Fantasy X and Kingdom Hearts Remasters... it's actually quite surprising that here the remaster is so lazy.On the other hand, though... the music is nothing short of amazing.  Of all the things about the game's presentation the music doesn't skimp at all.  It sounds as bombastic and epic as you'd expect a story filled with political intrigue to sound.  The dramatic and battle themes increase the tension.  Battles actually feel fast paced thanks to the music at play.  Final Fantasy may have fallen in some areas, but one area it still manages to shine is the music.All this brings up the question... is this really worth spending sixty dollars on?  The gameplay is fun and exciting.  It's engaging and will keep you busy all on its own... but the complete package itself is still important as a whole.  As gaming grows it can't just survive on its gameplay alone.  At least not when it falls as short as Type-0 does in other areas.  Despite how tarnished the name ""Final Fantasy"" has become, the series still has a legacy that many longtime fans are hoping a game in the series (whether spin-off or not at this point) can live up to.  Type-0 isn't that game.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32JC8NXP79F6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWJ4JW4#wasThisHelpful","R32JC8NXP79F6M","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's a little hard to talk about a strategy guide for Final Fantasy IX.  Squaresoft, back in 2000, started Play Online.  Which was a website that was made for players to go to as a means of getting information for Final Fantasy IX.  While a lot like to think it was Bradygames... it was pretty much all Squaresofts.  The idea behind it was to use the online guide to enhance the strategy guide itself.  This brought about a lot of questions.  Such as why buy a strategy guide if it was going to force you to go online?  Well, because the online was 100% accessible without knowing certain keywords that were located in the guide.The Bradygames Final Fantasy IX guide turned out to be a disaster as a result.  Namely because everything from the walkthrough, to the secrets to even the items list could not be accessed in the guide.  The information was simply not there at any point in time.  Everything you wanted to know you had to go to play online.  If you wanted maps, item locations in certain areas... you had to find that online.  It was a disaster simply because the guide itself was, well, useless.  The guide would introduce a mini-game to you, but tell you to go to Play Online for the rewards.  No matter how miniscule they were.  For a while I searched for another one.  And I've been finding more and more by Piggyback Interactive.  So of course when I found the Final Fantasy IX guide, I simply went for it.Piggyback Interactive has similar issues to the Bradygames guide, they just aren't as well pronounced.  At least not in the same way.  The Bradygames guide is ONLY useless.  Piggyback is much greater in so many ways.  The problem is that Squaresoft's insistence on Play Online keeps the guide from being perfect.  There are things that do, indeed, make it far better than the Bradygames guide.  But Play Online is still here.  And the guide isn't as useful because Play Online isn't really a thing anymore.  So the keywords are useless.  On the other hand, at least with Piggyback not all of them are actually needed.  That being said at least there are some things worth using the guide for.Normally I break it down and talk about each section of the guide, but this time I'm simply going to summarize what you'll need to know much more quickly.  The main moment where you are directed to Play Online are actually in the walkthrough.  I was quite surprised just how little this guide actually sends you to play online.  Some instance where it sends you to Play Online you'll actually found the answer later on in the guide.  In particular, the random encounter ""Quiz"" that pops up from time to time.  Despite at one point mentioning to go to Play Online for the answer... they're actually all located in the Secrets Section.  Likewise none of the appendices will send you to Play Online.  I was especially infuriated that Bradygames Bestiary made me go to Play Online for the breakdown of all the enemies (a full breakdown) where as Piggyback Interactive just includes everything I need to know without worrying about it much (and even provides a small strategy).  It was quite surprising how little I was referred to Play Online.  Had I been using this guide back during Final Fantasy IX's original release I might have actually accomplished more in the game.That being said, it also goes into a lot more depth than Bradygames does on other things.  For instance, there is a much greater breakdown of Tetra Master.  Where as Bradygames, once again, made you go to Play Online, Piggyback actually explains everything about it without making you go through that nonsense.  A mini-game that was, at one point, very confusing (as even the game itself shys away from explaining too much about it) is suddenly approachable.The walkthrough is really good too.  The information is far more organized.  And for Piggyback in 2000 that's saying a lot.  Their Final Fantasy VIII guide is good, but will look disorganized to some.  Here it's a lot more clear and easy to follow.  There are actually maps too.  Although, the downside is that they aren't of every area.  But when they show up they usually guide you quite nicely and they also show you the location of items. It works out quite well.  The walkthrough guides you well.There is a downside, however.  There are some things that the guide simply doesn't even mention.  They don't send you to Play Online either.  They just simply don't mention it.  Things like, Excalibur II aren't really touched upon in the guide.When the guide DOES send you to Play Online it is quite annoying.  Not as annoying as Bradygames, but still annoying.  This is why the guide still lacks.  There's so much information that simply isn't here as a result.  The assumption is that Squaresoft wanted players to jump onto Play Online so badly that they simply wouldn't let some of the information be published OFFLINE (and sure enough, quite a bit is published online you won't find in either guide).  Final Fantasy IX is so chalk full of secrets that it's a shame so many could only be accessed by going online.It's hard to judge the Piggyback guide... and the Bradygames one for that matter when you realize that Squaresoft may have actually done that.  The information in the Piggyback guide is great.  The stuff that's there.  It's well organized, tones down on the references to play online.  However it's just hard to shake that you still have to deal with Play Online in the first place.  That the information that should be in the guide is not there because someone decided that players should have to go online for that info.  It still begs the question, even years later, as to why anyone SHOULD buy a guide to FFIX?  If I buy a strategy guide I should not have to go online for the information.That being said, as a collector's item it's actually quite nice.  Going along with previous designs, the guide itself will really compliment the game.  And yes, if you need help getting through the main story, Piggyback's guide will certainly help.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUO52U4RT6Q3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1903511100#wasThisHelpful","RUO52U4RT6Q3K","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those who have followed Nintendo Handhelds, the very idea that they'd release so many different versions of one handheld is nothing new. The original Gameboy eventually had the Gameboy Pocket and then Gameboy Color. The Gameboy Advance had the SP and the Micro. The DS had the original release, the lite, the DSi and the DSi XL. The 3DS already has the original and the XL. It seemed strange that so soon after the launch of the 3DS XL we'd find ourselves with another DS release. This is the 2DS. On the outside it doesn't seem like much, but once you get it in your hand it's actually pretty solid.As a note before beginning: The following review assumes you are quite familiar with the 3DS already. In reading this I am assuming you are familiar with the 3DS interface and features. They will not be detailed here. Just know that they all work exactly the same.There are only two major differences between a 2DS and 3DS. The first is that there is no stereoscopic 3D. This means those hoping to play their games in stereoscopic 3D won't be able to do it. For someone like me who insists on playing his original 3DS with the 3D slider turned off anyway, this is no problem. It doesn't bother me in the slightest. The second major difference is that the screen doesn't close like other DS models. Other DS models had a clamshell design that allowed you to fold the screen down. Both screens are visible at all times. If you plan on getting this for a child I would strongly suggest buying screen protectors.Aside from those two things, the 2DS pretty much does everything your 3DS does. All the channels are still there. You can still access the Nintendo eShop. There's nothing really ""stripped"" away. There is still a place for your SD card on the side. All games are inserted into a slot that is located on the top of the 2DS. The camera still works just fine. The interface is still fine. The stylus is located in a slot on the back about halfway down the right hand side. Anything you could do on your other 3DS systems you can do here. It also retains being able to play your original DS games, although it doesn't look like there's a chance of it playing GBA games for those who are wondering.For those curious about the size of the 2DS, it's relatively small. The screen sizes are that of the original 3DS and not of the XL. So you won't have to worry that it's ""too big"" for the little ones. Although the DS itself might be a tad small if you've got big hands. Other differences include the fact that the L and R buttons are a lot bigger and easier to press. The button placement itself actually works. The face buttons (A, B, X, and Y) and circle pad are located next to the top screen while the directional pad is located closer to the bottom screen. The start and select button are also located near the bottom screen off to the side just below the face buttons. They're all very easy to get to and because it's not too big it's perfect placement. Also, and I must say this is especially nice, there is a switch that allows you to put the 2DS into sleep mode. Since you can't fold the top screen down they built in this little switch to compensate for that. Just a flick and your 2DS goes to sleep. A flick back and it wakes up. Perfect if you need to put it away for any reason.There are only a couple of gripes with the 2DS. None of them large. The first is that I think I'd have preferred a clam shell design. The 2DS is quite a remarkable device. Yet a fold down top screen would've still been nice to have. That way you could easily stick it in your pocket and not have to worry too much about scratches on the screen. Both screens could've been protected this way. This is pretty minor, but something that would've been nice, nonetheless. The other thing is that if you are getting this to replace a 3DS or 3DSXL some accessories don't work. Those who got a Circle Pad Pro, for instance, won't be able to use it. I'm sure there will be brand new accessories to go with it, but at this point it feels odd that Nintendo isn't simply making a model with a second circle pad always there. Likewise, if you're actually getting this to replace your 3DS, Nintendo has made it very tedious to transfer your data. As you must perform a system transfer. So if, for any reason you plan on trading in your old 3DS for a 2DS for any reason, keep in mind that you need to do a system transfer before handing it off. You can't simply pull out your SD Card and put it in another system.This, of course, brings about the question always asked when a new model of a system comes out. Is it worth it? The answer varies from console to console. But here I'll say simply that the 2DS is definitely a cheap alternative to the 3DS if you don't have one. The price isn't bad. This is especially nice if you have a young child. If you've already got a 3DS there's no particular reason to get a 2DS. It does all the same things. The only reason to really replace a 3DS with this one is if you really like the design (or if you're looking for a cheap alternative should you need to replace it). Nevertheless it's not bad by any means. As a cheap alternative it's perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JYYRLRCFIU1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZPCWWA#wasThisHelpful","R3JYYRLRCFIU1K","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1997, in Japan, an RPG dropped down on the Sega Saturn that caused a fuss... Grandia.  It was so original and so unique.  Unfortunately, back then it was overshadowed quickly by Squaresoft's Final Fantasy VII.  Then, in 1999, Grandia is ported to the original Playstation as well as being released outside of Japan.  While it caused quite a stir in Japan (selling over a million copies) in North America Grandia was overshadowed by... Squaresoft's Final Fantasy VIII.  Nevertheless, if you were playing several RPGs during the RPG rennaissance of the 90's one that probably stands out as being among the best is the original Grandia.  It's not just one of the best Playstation games out there, but among the best RPGs I had the pleasure of playing in the late 90's.  It's a special gem, deterred by only a few small issues.Justin lives in the city of Parm.  And in Parm he one day dreams of being an adventurer like his father.  He has a small remnant left over from him.  A shard of something only known as the Spirit Stone.  One day he and Sue go out to the ruins.  This is where their adventure truly begins as they come face to face with an empire that wants the Spirit Stone because it may lead to uncovering an ancient secret.  But how terrible is that secret?  And just how much adventure and excitement can Justin handle?Grandia's story was, especially for its time, quite original and unique.  The game is divided into two discs.  And the first discs consists of nothing short of character development.  Plot points are introduced but the game itself doesn't really start diving into the plot itself until the second CD.  As such those who are okay with a slower paced story and who thrive on character development will have no qualms with this.  Especially because Grandia goes to great lengths to make you love the characters you'll be spending time with.  Much of the cast will come and go.  But each time a member of the party leaves it's quite sad because we've come to know them so well.  Grandia gets quite in depth with its character development.  As I said, the first disc spends quite a bit of time just helping Justin grow as a character.  Before he can set out to save the world he has to learn about what it means to actually be a hero and what it means to be brave, depend on friends and about making the right decisions.  As we get into the second disc and the plot really picks up, Grandia turns out to be an unusually deep story filled with enormous plot twists and a large amount of originality.  And it does it without being so convoluted about it.  It's a surprisingly straightforward story for a JRPG.  The fact that it's also quite light serves as a nice touch as well.  Many JRPGs released in the late 90's often starred protagonists that were either very apathetic and brooding (Cloud or Squall) or were unusually cold, dark and mysterious.  Grandia eschews all that to make an RPG from 1999 feel quite fresh in comparison to others around it.  Grandia goes to great lengths to develop its characters.  They make jokes and have side conversations, but perhaps the most amusing is that from time to time characters will sit down to eat and discuss what's happening in the game or just talk among themselves.  It's pretty cool stuff.  Few games go to the lengths which Grandia does to develop its characters.That being said, Grandia's gameplay is much more complex than the story it tells.  The battle system is a mixture of turn based and active battling.  Every battle is contact based.  When beginning the battle, every character (enemies and allies alike) move along the IP gauge.  Once at a certain point you'll get to choose what action you want to do.  Choose to the attack and you immediately go to the action point where you can attack.  Choose to use magic or tech skills and you'll have to wait for the action to be performed for a moment.  It seems complex, but Grandia has built in things.  Since the combat works in such a manner you can usually cancel actions that enemies are attacking with and sometimes you can even counter them and deal more damage.  It's actually quite straightforward.  The special attacks you can use must be charged, however, by waiting for your character to actually get to the action part of the gauge.  The more you use a special attack, the faster they'll initiate it (with some attacks it's instant when it's at Maximum efficiency).  Spells work in a similar manner.  The more a character uses it, the better they are at casting it and thus they perform it faster.Grandia has a unique battle system.  Unfortunately while it comes across as complex at first, you can see just how easy Grandia really is when all is said and done.  It's not a challenging game at all.  The battle system is easier to take advantage of.  There are also quite a few things Grandia provides for you.  Many RPGs make the health of your enemies a mystery.  Grandia typically lets you see how much HP your enemies have at any time.  Likewise, you will ALWAYS know when they're preparing an attack and just what it is.  Giving you ample time to prepare.  Some may argue this makes Grandia too easy, but I'm willing to bet that those who don't take time to really get to know the battle system might struggle from time to time.There is, on the other hand, a lot of grinding to be done in Grandia.  Everything levels up within this game.  The weapons you choose for your characters determine the skills they learn.  They can only be learned by using them over and over again.  Keep using a sword and it levels up.  Every skill requires either one or more weapons to be level up to a certain level before a skill can actually be learned.Spells are quite similar as well.  Throughout your journey you'll find mana eggs which can be used to teach you one spell of an element.  As you continue using spells, however, they'll level up and you'll learn other spells.  As you obtain more mana eggs and teach your characters more elements they can also be combined to learn a lot more spells.  There are A LOT of spells and abilities to learn within the game.  And to learn them all you'll spend quite a few hours doing it.  The only actual problem with Grandia is that Mana eggs are hard to come by.  There are a finite amount of them.  Which means it's possible to get through the game not finding them all.  Not only that, but it also means that not every character will learn every spell should you miss one.Grandia is a fantastic game otherwise, however.  The battle system is unparalleled for its originality alone.  And the amount of grinding that can be done is never ending (or so it seems).  What's a shame, however, is that there aren't a lot of side quests.  There's an old theory about JRPGs.  The more story centered the game is, the more linear it tends to be.  In some games this is perfectly fine (Lunar Silver Star Story Complete is a near perfect game BECAUSE of this).  In Grandia it can feel too linear.  You won't get distracted by sidequests but there is also no way for you to get off the beaten path.  There's no world map to run around freely on.  Were it not for the good story, characters and the fact that most dungeons are huge this might be a problem.  But the quest in and of itself is lengthy enough that sidequests would probably be a bigger problem.  The structure of Grandia makes it so that you won't find yourself wanting to do too many.  That's not to say there are no sidequests at all.  There are.  There are at least two optional dungeons that have great rewards.  It's only to say that Grandia puts the story front and center and doesn't want you to waste time not experiencing it.  This seems to be especially true in the latter half of the second disc.  This is especially nice because Grandia is a nice long game.  Clocking in at around 40 hours (many hours more if you decide to master every spell and ability) Grandia is an epic quest.Visually Grandia is a good looking game.  A lot of RPGs in the late 90's tended to use a lot of pre-rendered backgrounds.  Grandia, instead opts to use full 3D environments and gives you the ability to rotate the camera.  From time to time it can be easy to get turned around.  You've got a compass to point you in the right direction, although having an ingame map might've helped out a little more.  Some dungeons in Grandia are huge and it can be easy to get yourself turned around if you're not careful.  Luckily Grandia has a plentiful amount of save points and you can restore your health at all of them with ease.The soundtrack is also very good.  Especially the battle themes which are very good and quite addicting to hear.  The only thing that may grate on our nerves is the voice acting.  Like so many video games of the time, the voice acting isn't the best.  Many times they've got the right voices but the tone doesn't always match up.  Much of the time the voices are robotic and there are weird pauses from time to time during speech.  There aren't too many voiced moments in Grandia but the voice acting isn't great.It can be a little strange to justify five stars when really getting down to it.  The reality is that Grandia is a great game for its striking originality and it's fantastic story that really draws you in.  It is a little slow, but the quest itself is pretty lengthy and its filled with fantastic characters to help it become such a strong tale.  Graphically it excels over several Playstation games.  But most of all it was just a lot of fun to play.  Battling was more fun than most JRPGs out there.  Grandia was, and still is, a gem of a game.  I wouldn't want it any other way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3POPJ5X6XJ4UP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003A03AKY#wasThisHelpful","R3POPJ5X6XJ4UP","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I dived back into Vagrant Story, I picked up two different guides. The first was the official guide by Bradygames.  Lately, I've been particularly curious about Piggyback Interactive.  Since they are based in the UK, however, getting a hold of their older guides can be taxing.  Yet I managed to get my hands on this fantastic gem of a guide.  It is definitely one of PIggyback's best.  Organized, clear and detailed.  It blows the Bradygames guide out of the water in a lot of areas.  That being said there are maybe one or two small problems with the guide, but nothing that'll annoy you too much.The guide begins by introducing us to the cast.  Here you'll come to see that much of the guide is written in such a charming matter.  Not only is it very conversational but it even has a bit of wit to it without getting sidetracked.  What may actually be a bit of a pain that the paragraphs are pretty much jumbled together.  Unlike later guides by Piggyback this one doesn't really have a line break between paragraphs.  You'll quickly get used to this and it'll cease to be a problem, however (especially in the walkthrough).  The guide then goes into all the basics of the game in and of itself.  The battle system and what everything means.  There's a bit more depth here than the bradygames guide, giving you more into on things such as RISK or Damage Points and Phantom Points.  It's all good stuff, but the best part doesn't come until after the walkthrough.The walkthrough itself is very good.  Each area begins with the maps.  Every room on each map is labeled (1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2 etc.) and when that happens just look for the room in the corresponding text and it'll tell you what to do.  The maps aren't as detailed or as colorful as the Bradygames guide, but you'll make due as it points out all items and doors etc.  It'll also call out all the bosses, detailing what strategies work.  While there are times when the Bradygames guide most certainly offers better boss strategies, Piggyback certainly doesn't do a bad job by any means.  Always getting you prepared well enough.  This guide doesn't mess around in helping you prepare for anything Vagrant Story has to offer.  Much like the Brady guide as well, the maps always assume you're facing north.  So keep that in mind.For the most part the walkthrough is incredibly helpful, but what is more helpful is all the stuff that comes beyond that.  Bradygames really dropped the ball in helping people master Vagrant Story.  It missed out on helping players learn everything they could about combining weapons and making the best weapon they could possibly make.  Piggyback delivers on this in some pretty big ways.  Not only do they have texts that perfectly describes how to get every affinity and class ranking to 100%, but they also provide charts so that you ALWAYS know what you're getting when you combine any two weapons.  Likewise, they actually have a complete items, weapons and armor lists.  Again, something the brady guide was lacking.It doesn't stop there, however.  The Brady guide also missed out on really telling you how combining weapons affects class, affinity and the like.  This guide does.  It tells you everything you need to know.  There's nothing left out.  For those who want to really master and learn Vagrant Story this is definitely the guide you should be looking for.  It does the same thing with armor.  Charts detailing everything.  Just for all the weapon combinations and tips for getting the ultimate weapon alone is reason enough to own the PIggyback Interactive guide to Vagrant Story.The guide also gets into the clear game area, giving more detail than Brady as well.  Though not always by much.  The strategies for the bonus bosses are no where near as good and neither are the descriptions of some of the dungeons.  At the very least this guide is leading you to believe that Sydney drops his sword.  And this one also even has a complete monster list that misses no enemy whatsoever.  And it'll tell you their class and what affinity they're strong against and weak against and then give a little strategy for it.  Everything about this guide is just that much more detailed.With all this info it's also nice that there's an index provided.  Although that's not as helpful as it sounds.  Piggyback always has an index, but in this case what I really wish they'd done with it is actually put the names of the areas detailed in the walkthrough.  Sometimes when flipping back to the weapons chart I get lost in all the details and have to go flipping through the guide to find where I am in the game.  The index takes you to areas like each boss encounter or an enemies listing in the monster appendix but it doesn't actually take you to any major area of the walkthrough.There aren't a lot of complaints.  There is the occasional typo that pops up (in particular the fact that the guide spelled it as ""Finaal Boss"" annoyed me) but nothing too drastically big.  At least none of the info is wrong.  Some of the detail here an be intimidating, really because there's so much.  This guide was made with the veteran and beginner in mind, and it shows.One thing that is of note, however, is that being that this is before Piggyback Interactive began releasing guides in the state it covers the PAL version of the game as opposed to the NTSC version.  In some guides by Piggyback this has made a huge difference (those who imported their Final Fantasy X guide from Piggyback certainly know what I'm talking about).  Here the biggest difference I saw was that HP listings for some enemies differed from the American guide.  Some enemies appear to have less HP.  At the time of this writing I don't know if one guide is inaccurate or not or if this is just how the guides vary.  That being said, this is hardly that big a deal.  What's more important is that most of the info here is correct.If you do find yourself in need of a guide for Vagrant Story this would be a much better guide to pursue.  It's not perfect, but it's certainly more helpful than the alternative.  The downside is that because you'll more than likely have to import it (or purchase from a seller who imported it) the asking price is considerably higher than most guides.  Particularly from American sellers.  You might be better off going to the UK side of Amazon in that case.  Either way, the guide is pretty expensive going for around thirty or so dollars quite easily.  And unless you're a collector that's a hefty price to ask for a guide to a game that has been out for so long and where all the info is probably readily online as a result.  Nevertheless it is a good guide.  Probably the best Vagrant Story Guide you'll be able to find.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UZZ2K7VZABHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1903511003#wasThisHelpful","R1UZZ2K7VZABHP","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vagrant Story is a strange kind of game.  One that takes a lot of time and patience to learn when compared to its contemporaries.  As such, it's one of the few games where a strategy guide is more beneficial to players, even the first time through.  And for getting people to understand all the basics of Vagrant Story this guide is particularly useful.  That being said, however, for those who want to truly understand everything Vagrant Story has to offer, you'll need more than this guide.  To put it in a simple way, Vagrant Story has so much depth that until you really start digging in, you won't realize just how much this guide is missing.  The main walkthrough is, for the most part, really good.  Getting beyond it, though, there are some problems.  There are not A LOT of problems but they are big enough that anyone looking to master Vagrant Story should definitely think twice about buying this guide and instead going with an alternative or online FAQ.The guide begins by introducing us to the characters as well as the main situation at hand.  That's as far as spoilers go, however.  Beyond the character introductions the Official Strategy Guide for Vagrant Story is spoiler free.  No major plot twists are ruined here and no major story elements are given away that you won't learn just by playing through the first ten minutes or so of the game.Once we're beyond this introduction, the guide goes into the basics of the battle system.  And for the most part it's not all so bad.  Vagrant Story has a complex battle system and this guide will certainly make it approachable.  It won't help you full master it, but that's okay.  This is one moment where much of the mastery is going to come primarily from reading what the guide is telling you in the walkthrough and understanding WHY it works.  It's much more important to understand THAT part about Vagrant Story's battle system as opposed to just learning about targeting different areas.  The guide will explain class and affinities.  But again, mostly just the basic stuff.  It doesn't really tell you how it all balances out or anything like.  For instance it'll mention that attacking humans raises human class, but it neglects to mention that other class rankings will drop.At the very least some of the information is pretty invaluable.  It then goes into all the charts and such.  Items, armor, weapons etc.  You won't need this as badly as you may think in Vagrant Story.  It's also nice that it mentions that some forms of weapons are more powerful than others.  For instance, you might get a ""knightley"" blade or something and it's nice the guide mentions that.  But given the nature of Vagrant Story some of the stuff you read in those charts will be wrong.  There are some hiccups here, however, but more on that later.Once we get beyond items and spells and the like, we finally get to the actual walkthrough.  This is where the guide is probably at its best.  The layout and design is easy to follow and easy to use.  Each area begins with a map of the area in question and then a step by step walkthrough.  Each room on the map is labeled (A1, A2 etc.) for each area.  So if you're in the room labeled A1 on their map just find A1 in the text and it'll tell you what you need to do in that particular room.  The guide is very good about noting when there are chests to be had, when special conditions have to be met to open the locked door, or sometimes noting when new and powerful enemies show up.  The maps are also colorful and very well labeled.  The maps alone are good enough to help you through many of the dangers of Lea Monde.  The only to really note about the maps is that the guide always assumes you're facing north.  It's important to remember that.The best part about the walkthrough is actually the boss strategies.  Since Vagrant Story has such a meticulous approach, the guide is often quite useful for many boss encounters.  Getting by bosses in Vagrant Story is much more about knowing how to boost your class and affinities as well as casting the right spells to raise the effects of your equipment.  The guide is always telling you exactly what may or may not work on a particular boss.  There were many a moment where the guide gave some good advice on certain defense skills to equip or certain gems to attach to weapons and shields.  Many of these moments were much more than just, ""Keep hitting it until it dies,"" strategies that Bradygames was so used to handing out in the past.  They're actually quite useful.  In particular, the strategy for the Final Boss really helped me understand the actual boss fight itself.  Likewise, through some of these strategies you may actually get a better grasp on the battle system.If there was any complaint about the walkthrough it would be that some of the solutions to the block puzzles are needlessly confusing at times.  The directions they give can be annoying because the guide is constantly assuming that you've oriented the map a certain way.  And in some cases the screenshot is from a weird angle that it's hard to actually tell which block they're telling you to move.  Thankfully no puzzle is really that taxing in Vagrant Story, but it's still annoying that the guide has a hard time with directions in some of them.The guide also gives a good indication of all the New Game+ areas you can go to.  But this is particularly where the big problems with the guide start.  First, the guide claims that you can get a hold of Sydney's Sword, but it never happens.  Ever. That's a pretty big mistake to make in an official guide.  I'm used to some secrets being less lucrative than guides claim, but this is one where you probably shouldn't have players spending too much time trying to figure this all out.Beyond that, however, the guide is just missing a lot of info that would otherwise be necessary.  As I said, Bradygames is good at just getting you through the game.  But if you want to completely master Vagrant Story and take advantage of everything the game has to offer, it won't happen with this guide.  And some of the stuff it's missing is baffling.  Take those charts of weapons and armor... more than half of them are completely missing.  And while that may not seem important to some, it's pretty important to a veteran to know which weapons are really good and which ones aren't.  Why?  Because of combining weapons, of course.  But the guide doesn't go into any details on that either.  It tells us that we CAN do it but has no charts or anything that showcase what we could get through doing it.  Instead the guide suggests that the results are ""somewhat random,"" when in actuality, an overwhelming majority of them are not.  It also fails to actually help players create a good weapon in any way, shape or form.  Nothing about how class and affinity transfer over or anything.  Nothing about how to make a weapon into a better material.  It just tells you you're able to combine weapons and well... that's it.  The same goes for armor.  Not all the armor is listed and even then nothing about combining armors.  This may seem like a small tidbit, but if you're going to do everything a New Game+ has to offer it's essential to master the art of craftsmanship and it's definitely important to learn how to forge the best equipment with the best class and affinity damage.  It would certainly help players who would be struggling through the game.  But none of it is there.  It's just inconceivable to have a guide lack so much information on what is easily one of the most important aspects of the game.Going beyond that, however, the monster list isn't much better.  While it lists many a monster, even here you realize that the list isn't actually complete.  I'm not talking that they all come from the Encyclopedia (though that is something of note).  What I mean is that some enemies (particularly the ones that couldn't be analyzed) have no stats.  It just says N/A.  Yet that's not quite as bothersome as the fact that we learn very little about our enemies.  We'll learn their class but it would've been nice to know their affinity.  Some are pretty obvious (you could probably guess what affinity a Water Dragon is, for instance) but many don't wear their affinity in their name.  This also means it's not obvious what type of weapon they're weak against.This is all pretty big stuff to keep in mind.  Particularly the guides inability to teach you about combining weapons.  If your goal is just to get through Vagrant Story then this is going to be a helpful guide.  Going beyond all that, however, the guide is eventually going to serve you no purpose beyond the incredibly detailed maps.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E43SHGO9PKG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1566869714#wasThisHelpful","R3E43SHGO9PKG2","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the year 2000, Squaresoft was pretty much at the top of its game.  In that year they had a string of successes with games like Chrono Cross, Legend of Mana and Final Fantasy IX all dropping by for some time.  Strangely enough one of the most overlooked games during that time was a little gem called Vagrant Story.  Helmed by Yasumi Matsuno (better known as the mind behind Final Fantasy Tactics), it was a game that he knew from the moment it came out would only appeal to a particular crowd.  Vagrant Story wasn't for everyone.  Indeed, many a gamer either couldn't get into it or downright hated it.  Those who did get into it, however, fell in love with the game.  Matsuno has always had that ""You'll love it or hate it,"" appeal.  This may also be because Matsuno's approach to designing a game has always been ""different"" than the typical developer.  There's no game in Matsuno's library that is as complex as Vagrant Story, however.  If you can get into it it's a rewarding and challenging experience.  Patience is required but for the time of its release it was probably one of the most reaching and original games out there.Vagrant Story is set in Valendia.  A cult lead by a man named Sydney have abducted the Duke's son and taken him to the abandoned city of Lea Monde.  As Ashley Riot, your job is to infiltrate the city, find the Duke's son and stop the evil cultists.  Throughout the journey you'll also run into the Crimson Blades who are also out to stop Sydney for their own reasons.  As Ashley enters the city of Lea Monde he gets caught up in a game of cat and mouse with Sydney, who has a mysterious power to see into the past of his victims.  As you play through the game there are many moments of betrayal and characters out to serve their own ends.  It seems like a simple story at first, but as you dive deeper in it becomes more complex and engaging.  Though there are moments when it's slow, Vagrant Story isn't exactly long enough to mind some of its pacing problems, the likes of which are slowed down less by the actual progression of the story and more by the actual gameplay itself.In the year 2000 most JRPGs were the same old typical turn based stuff.  Allies lined up on one side, the enemy on the other.  Vagrant Story does away with that.  Instead it takes on a more active approach to its combat.  You can walk around in normal mode or battle mode.  In normal mode your weapon is sheathed, as is your shield.  In Battle Mode you are ready for combat at any time.  Enemies roam around the map freely.  Vagrant Story fashions itself as a dungeon crawler.  Many dungeons are quite big.  When you enter a room there are usually two or three enemies.  When you engage them in combat you must bring up a battle sphere (referred to as a matrix).  Upon doing so you can select a different part of the body to attack.  Either their right arm, left arm, legs, body or head.  Each one affects different stats in some way and has its own HP listing.  For instance, if you keep attacking an enemies legs you'll reduce their movement.  Keep attacking their primary arm and their attack goes down.  Keep attacking the head and they'll eventually be silenced.  Keep attacking the body and their defenses drop.You can also chain together attacks by setting them to different buttons.  The more you chain attacks together the greater damage you'll do.  Some chain abilities are designed for damage output but others are designed to restore HP or MP while others may silence or paralyze an opponent.  Chain attacks take time to master, however.  Each time your weapon strikes an enemy you have a brief second to hit a button.  If your timing is correct Ashley winds up for another strike.  Hit the button too early or too late and the chain stops.  While it's easy to chain attacks together, the game makes sure you don't take advantage of it by giving you a stat known as Risk.  When your Risk is low your is high and you take less damage.  As your Risk increases your accuracy drops and you take more damage.  On the other hand Risk does have its upsides.  You have a better chance of landing critical strikes and your healing magic will heal far more HP.  So you can take your chances.  Your accuracy is lower but your damage output (if you hit) is higher.  You take more damage but you can also recover more damage.There are also defense abilities at play that work exactly as you think.  When an enemy strikes you, just hit the button corresponding to the defense ability set to it and Ashley defends himself.  As with chain abilities the timing is important.  Some defense abilities allow you to reflect damage, others let you absorb HP and others are just meant to help your defense against certain elemental attacks.Vagrant Story has a deeper system than most games and we've only scratched the surface of what it is.  Certainly there are also various magic spells but they're used in the standard fare you would imagine them to be used in.  First you use a grimoire and then Ashley will master the spell.  Some require specific targeting but for the most part there's little complex about using magic in Vagrant Story.  What is complex, however, is keeping so many things in the background in mind.  For instance, every enemy has a class they fall into.  Human, Dragon, Beast, Phantom, Undead or Evil.  And they're all weak to a very specific weapon type.  We're not talking swords or anything like that.  We're talking either edged, blunt or piercing weapons.  Likewise, you also must pay attention to the elemental affinity of a weapon you're using.  Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Evil and Light.  It seems like a lot to take in at first... and it very much is.  Using the right weapon against an enemy makes the difference between dealing a lot of damage or dealing no damage at all.The good news is that all of this can easily be manipulated through the games various systems.  You might start with a sword that doesn't deal a lot of damage to humans at all... but the more you use it the better it will be against human type enemies.  You can raise any weapons attack against a certain class just by using it on that class.  Thus, you do more damage the more you use a weapon.  Likewise, as you go through the game you'll find various gems to attach to a weapon as well to help improve how much damage you can do to a class.  Some enemies have elemental weaknesses as well which you can also attach gems to your weapon to exploit.  It's not just your weapons, but your shields as well.  You can easily attach a gem to a shield to improve your defenses against various classes and affinities as well.  All this amounts to a fairly complex game when you consider all of this.  But it also means that you'll find yourself constantly micromanaging throughout your journey.  You'll enter one dungeon where a weapon you've obtained and attached gems to works really well only to enter another dungeon where you have to change all of it.  It is certainly possible to go through Vagrant Story with just a single weapon, but you'll feel the need to change it up eventually.  Not only do all those class and affinity matches matter, but eventually you'll want a weapon made out of a different material as well.  You start with a lot of Bronze and Iron stuff that affects class and affinity damage, but you'll also find yourself using better material later that deals greater damage with little or no penalties at all.Vagrant Story is actually a game that, if you grind enough, can be really balanced with its complex weapon system.  Every weapon has the ability to grow its class and affinity damage.  And wouldn't you know it, Vagrant Story makes sure you CAN do this.  Later in the game you'll come across various workshops that will allow you to make and combine your own weapons.  You could easily make a weapon that deals heavy damage to every class and affinity type in the game.  It takes a lot of grinding, but it can happen.What's nice, however, is that outside of the boss encounters the game isn't too punishing.  If an enemy is weaker to a blunt type weapon but you prefer your edge type the damage isn't nearly as well affected as your class and affinity are.  Even so, however, there are lots of spells that can be used to boost any affinity you're lacking or that can be used to strengthen your attacks and equipment.  Likewise, you'll have plenty of spells that can decrease your enemies stats as well.Unlike most games, Vagrant Story wants you to learn and utilize every bit of its system.  Particularly in its boss encounters where knowing the class and elemental affinity of your opponent is your key to victory.  Vagrant Story is a challenging game, but only to those who do not understand the mechanics of the system.  If you're fighting a water elemental enemy for instance, just boosting your attack and casting a spell that boosts your weapons fire affinity (as well as having the proper gems) will save the day.  If, however, you're not willing to micro manage and prepare for each boss, Vagrant Story is more than happy to punish you for it.  This is not a game where just knowing the basics will help you succeed.  This is a game that expects you to actually learn and utilize the system at play and isn't going to hold your hand to get you there.  If you aren't willing to read the game's instruction manual (or willing to read the Quick Manual in the game itself) then you'll find Vagrant Story to be a challenging and frustrating endeavor.  If, however, you spend the time to learn the complexities of the system, Vagrant Story is surprisingly easy.  The most challenging boss won't be a match if you understand what to do.About the only thing that might hold you up is that Vagrant Story is large and sprawling.  The dungeons are huge, but more than that, the game isn't always telling you where to go next.  You'll often come across locked doors that you need to have a certain key or sigil for.  And when you get that key or sigil you'll need to find the door itself.  The good news is that while the game won't guide you back there, it has lots of tools to give you an idea of where you can or cannot go.  Each sigil has flavor text that tells you which dungeon it can be used it while the in game map always marks locked and unlockable doors for you.  Again, if you're not willing to utilize the system you'll be hopelessly lost.  You may still get lost, however.  While you'll know which doors can and cannot be passed through thanks to your map, the game still doesn't tell you WHERE you need to go a lot of the time.  There's a lot to explore in Lea Monde at least.  It's a huge game where there are lots of things to do off the beaten path.  Going back to old dungeons and grabbing equipment from otherwise locked chests or rooms is nice.  It's a shame, however, that most of Vagrant Story's best optional content is saved for after completing your journey.  Much of what you do must be done in a New Game+.  Many of the optional bosses and optional dungeons can only be played on replay.  While this sounds like a chore at first, it's remarkable how fast Vagrant Story moves.  Your first play through may take a moment because you're getting lost, but once you've experienced it once you'll come to learn that Vagrant Story is a pretty short game.  In a New Game+ you'll find these new areas pretty quickly and they'll keep you busy for a while.Vagrant Story is close to perfect for its design.  For everything that seems like it'll give you trouble there is an opposite solution that will always work for you.  However, beyond its complexities what you realize is that Vagrant Story is most certainly not for the fast paced gamer.  It's short, but it won't feel short the first time through.  The battle system will make everything feel slow.  The combat always stops so that your enemies can cast spells and in some cases this is a lot.  Combat may seem very active, but at some point it's the same turn based affair you've always known.  But when enemies and characters take certain action everything stops while it's being executed.  This is not an action/adventure RPG, it's very much just an RPG.  In moments where all you want to do is get through the dungeon without engaging your enemies in combat this is particularly annoying as you'll always be stopped so they can have their attack.  Likewise, as a result of this you'll often have to stop and take a moment to heal any sustained damage.  While it's nice that your HP and MP will regenerate in normal mode, enemies are going to do damage quite fast when you're not interrupting their blows with your own (and even the normal enemies can do quite a bit of damage).Other times Vagrant Story can feel downright unfair.  When I mention about having to really prepare for boss fights or else the game will punish you?  I'm not joking.  There will be bosses that, without the right preparation will take you down with a single cast of a spell.  Other times enemies will employ some strangely strategic tactics to make sure you don't stand a chance.  If you aren't willing to utilize the tools the game gives you it's not going to be a rewarding experience.  In an interview Matsuno described the game as being for ""hardcore"" players (a definition that has certainly changed from what Matsuno meant then) and he is certainly correct in that regard.  Vagrant Story is a game that the player can't hope to succeed in without fully understanding the systems at play, and the learning curve is a pretty steep one.  Many video games really ease you into things and make things quite easy in the event that not everything clicks for you immediately.  Vagrant Story knows no such forgiveness.  As such many a gamer is probably turned away from Vagrant Story because of its complexities.  There are a lot of things to keep track of, a lot of micromanaging to do and a lot of preparation that comes before every boss at a certain point.  All this culminates into what is still widely seen as a very complex game.  In some instances, without the aid of a walkthrough (at least for bosses) Vagrant Story can appear to be needlessly challenging without understanding the fundamentals of the game.Even for hardcore players, however, some of the micromanaging can be a bit much.  There will be stretches where you'll feel like you're spending more time in the menu than actually exploring and playing the game.  As you use various weapons and grow fond of a favorite this will ease off, but until that point Vagrant Story is pretty strict about it's combat system and is surprisingly meticulous.  There isn't room for a lot of error and sometimes this can be grating to those new to Vagrant Story.  Even intimidating at times.  Many of Square's other games are far more accessible than Vagrant Story.As I said, however, once learned Vagrant Story is a surprisingly easy game.  In fact, it can be a little too easy to get overpowered when you realize just how combining weapons and raising affinities really works.  So much so that it can be really easy to take advantage of it.  Once you know what class and affinity you're dealing with Vagrant Story is a pushover.  To make sure you can't get too overpowered, Vagrant Story has limited inventory space.  You can't simply run around with all your weapons.  Eventually your weapon inventory gets full and you'll be forced to dump a few in a container.  The same goes for armor and other items.  It surprisingly balances the game, but once again, can be a big hassle for those who aren't particularly big on micromanagement.As far as Playstation games go, Vagrant Story was among the best looking ones out there.  Certainly games like Chrono Cross look a little better, but Vagrant Story, especially for all it does at a time, is quite a good looking game for its time.  The art style is very nice.  What really makes it work is the tone that goes along with everything.  It's a very dramatic story.  The dialog is some of the best written in any game Square has ever published.  The presentation is just overall very nice.  The dark and dreary tone is enhanced by the soundtrack which is just as magical, dramatic and dark as the game itself.  Everything about the presentation gives you an idea as to what kind of world you're stepping into.  This isn't a lighthearted fantasy.  A great deal of JRPGs have a tendency to go the more adolescent or more juvenile route with a lot of themes and intrigue, but Vagrant Story doesn't do any such thing.  Many characters are put in situations that feel hopeless at times.  It's a dark story filled with betrayal and political intrigue and it will shove this in your face.  And there are A LOT of politics in Vagrant Story.  And the deeper you dive into the story, the more interesting it gets as revelations are unveiled and character motivations come to light.Vagrant Story is not a game for everyone.  It simply is not.  It's complexities and micromanagement systems can make the experience tedious for some players, while others may be turned away by how difficult the game will be without understanding them--especially because the game will punish you for neglecting to learn any of it.  This isn't a game where you learn the basics and keep going.  This is a game where you MUST dig into the systems and the mechanics because it's unrelenting if you don't.  However, those willing to dive and learn the system will see a Playstation game unlike any other they've ever experienced.  With a great story, some great localization and a very creative battle system, Vagrant Story is a hidden treasure.  It may not be simple and it may not fashion itself approachable, but the more you get to know it, the more charming it becomes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NLX167B9R5FB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004SPW9#wasThisHelpful","R3NLX167B9R5FB","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In recent memory, strategy guides have become less of a necessity and more of a collector's item.  For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it.  Sometimes there's a collector's edition guide as well.  For collector's these are sometimes a lot of fun.  For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy.  There is a limited number in print and it's simply amazing to behold.  It's great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors.Before I begin I want to stress that this review won't be going into the content of each guide.  With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide, each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard (and separately released) collector's edition counterpart.  The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon.  Aside from that, the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases.  There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide.To begin, the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest.  When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there.  The covers all look very similar.  Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them.  The covers and the borders are different on each guide.  The six guides included are for Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time 3D, Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD.  All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side.There are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves.  The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped.  This seems a little odd.  It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose.  Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange.  Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras.  Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here.  Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package.  So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck.  That's no big deal.There are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides.  The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide.  Ever.  This is the first time that Ocarina of Time 3D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover.  Originally the guide was only in paperback.  This makes the collector's value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here.  This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it.The second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published.  It has been revised and expanded.  Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself.  It has been revised and expanded by over 100 pages.  It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released.  So yes, this one too is a rarity because you won't have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set.There are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals.  Most notably is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  The original guide was around 224 pages and written in three columns.  Here it's 288 pages and is written in two columns.  It's a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result.  Much of the text isn't so cramped.  Some moments in the Ocarina of Time 3D guide pop out a lot easier.  It just looks better and more organized overall.  The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking.  The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes.  Likewise, the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped.  In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location.  Here it's expanded to be in a table format, the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you what's required.  The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases.  The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well.  So for those wondering about whether or not they've changed some things from the original guides, the answer is yes.  Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read.The set also came with a few bonuses of note.  The first and probably most valuable of all, is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered.  The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark.  For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal.  It's invaluable.  The only thing I wish we could've gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with.  It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package.  Part of what made the guides collector's editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didn't come with the guide otherwise.Nevertheless, for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy.  But let's be clear.  If you are buying this, chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves.  After all, many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and, truthfully, you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy.  They are a collector's item.  And it is certainly a nice one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFC63LSQRB7RU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804161380#wasThisHelpful","RFC63LSQRB7RU","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over 20 years ago, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past came out on the Super Nintendo.  It has been hailed by several gamers as arguably the greatest Zelda title of them all (definitely the best of the 2D Zelda games, at least).  Most everything about the core series formula was pretty much established in A Link to the Past.  As such it's often seen as the most influential of the Zelda titles.  For over two decades A Link to the Past has retained a cult following.  For me personally, A Link to the Past was my personal favorite.  So when I heard about A Link Between Worlds I was filled with joy and worry.  It's the sequel to my favorite Zelda... and the potential for it not to live up to its predecessor was there.  Luckily this isn't the case.  Instead A Link Between Worlds is the best Zelda to be released in a long time.Set years after A Link to the Past, A Link Between Worlds focuses on Yuga.  A villain with the ability to turn the denizens of Hyrule into paintings.  It's up to Link to stop this fiend, and to do so he'll first need to gather three pendants.  It more or less borrows the formula from A Link to the Past.  Once you've obtained these three pendants, you'll then need to do seven more dungeons in order to save Hyrule for good.  This time going between two worlds.  The world of Hyrule and the world of Lorule.  As with A Link to the Past, you'll get the three pendants first and then go onto a bigger quest.  Once you've conquered the first portion of the game, however, A Link Between Worlds turns you lose and you're free to explore as much (or as little) as you want.  The seven proceeding dungeons can be tackled in any order you see fit.  This level of freedom hasn't been seen since the first Zelda.Make no mistake the dungeons themselves are challenging, with a lot of challenging puzzles.  The approach A Link Between Worlds takes is slightly different than that of other Zelda titles.  In previous games you often found the most helpful items within the dungeon you were currently exploring and then having to use said item constantly.  Here, you'll rent items and hold onto them pretty much until you fall in battle.  If you die you'll have to go and rent items again.  If that doesn't work for you you will eventually be able to buy everything you need at a more expensive price and you'll have the ability to upgrade it.  Some items are obtained by other means as well.  Often partaking in a small side quest.  The game is not always going to point this stuff out.  This helps to let players truly explore the worlds of Hyrule and Lorule.  Like the Light world and Dark world of A Link to the Past you'll also find yourself jumping between them constantly.The dungeons are no cakewalk.  The game itself is also no cakewalk.  Many of the puzzles are challenging.  Though there are hints the game is perfectly content to let you figure things out on your own.  There aren't a lot of handholding tutorials or anything of the sort.  A Link Between Worlds has little qualms cutting you loose and letting you figure out the dungeons and where to go on your own.  And make no mistake, the game is challenging.  If you're not ready to explore or to talk to ever denizen you meet it'll be easy to feel lost in A Link Between Worlds.  There's definitely a classic Zelda feel here.  The game rarely points you in any one direction.  Not only that, there are plenty of things to do off the beaten path.  There are always extra items to find, pieces of heart and mini-games to keep you busy for hours on end.  Thanks to the heavily non-linear feel of the game you'll feel like the in game world is bigger than it actually is.  But you'll rarely (if ever) feel like you're wasting time and when you uncover something new it always feels rewarding to do so.  The player is free to tackle the game at their own pace.  And should you ever get stuck, you can bet that there's an item you've missed that will allow you to explore the game deeper.Perhaps the best part is that A Link Between Worlds is almost always surprising you.  The dungeons themselves feel unique.  No dungeon ever feels like the previous one.  They all offer up their own unique challenges.  Just when you think you fully understand everything there is to know about A Link Between Worlds it's willing to add on another layer that not only forces you to rethink that which you've learned, but to try different approaches to each new challenge.  As I said, this is not a game that will hold your hand.  And you'll probably fail quite a few times (it is most certainly not an easy game) but you'll always feel a sense of accomplishment and wonder as you traverse the game.Graphically, A Link Between Worlds is a beautiful looking game.  It retains the feeling of a A Link to the Past.  The enemies themselves look familiar and so does the land of Hyrule.  This isn't a sequel that takes the world it is in lightly.  If you remember the layout of Hyrule in A Link to the Past the world pretty much looks the same here.  It's been given a nice coat of paint.  That's not to say there aren't new things to explore.  It's only to say that it's truly a sequel.  There's much more that'll pop out at you in Lorule.  Either way, the game is absolutely gorgeous.  Often times with a 3DS game I tend to put the 3D slider down.  Many games don't have a reason to play in 3D.  On rare occasions, however (such as Super Mario 3D Land) the 3D is worth cranking up.  The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is such a game.  When you get a chance you'll want to explore some dungeons in 3D.  It's not the gimmicky ""pop-out,"" kind of 3D but rather the kind that lets you see more depth to the world around you.  From a technical standpoint, there are few 3DS games that look this good and utilize the hardware this well.  The soundtrack is even better.  It remixes quite a bit from previous Zelda titles but has a lot of new things as well.The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds beautifully recreates and enhances the best of the older Zelda games.  You can explore without feeling like you're lost.  You can meet any challenge without feeling like the game is leading you through it.  But best of all, it's a rewarding experience all around.  It's lengthy, filled with lots of things to do off the beaten path and will ultimately have you coming back for more.  This is the best Zelda title to be released in a long time and any fan will be happy to enjoy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CVE9NFN02O4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GANWVJE#wasThisHelpful","R3CVE9NFN02O4J","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Rayman Origins hit store shelves it was quickly a well received platformer.  Garnering lots of acclaim and critical praise all around it was actually quite surprising to see the game itself didn't take off right away.  Through fantastic word of mouth, a hefty price drop and long lasting gameplay, however, Rayman Origins became a huge sleeper hit.  In particular many were impressed with the level designs and it's gorgeous looking art style.  Here Rayman Legends takes everything great about Rayman Origins and makes it all better.  Simply put, if you liked Rayman Origins... you need to play this game.Like before there isn't much of a story to Rayman.  You will mostly find yourself in a man hub where you can jump into various paintings to take on the challenges in a level.  In each level you'll collect Lumas like before and be able to earn trophies and completion bonuses in levels for doing so.  But you'll also have to rescues Teensies.  This one is actually important.  The more Teensies you rescue, the more levels and challenges open up and the more partners you get to rescue.  There is no real difference in playing as one of Rayman's allies, though.  All of their moves are essentially the same.  Unlike in Origins, however, a lot of moves you don't have to unlock.  You'll be able to hover right off the bat for instance.  Rayman Legends pretty much lets you jump right into things immediately.There is a small segment of the gaming population that seems to think 2D platforming has been done to death.  These people have never played Rayman Legends.  Each level is sprawling.  Usually divided into three parts.  There are ten teensies in all to save.  Two of whom are hidden in bonus rooms and others who are usually in plain sight, obscured slightly or held by enemies.  For the most part they aren't hard to find.  It's obtaining them that's hard.  The bonus rooms, for instance, are obstacle courses designed to challenge you.  Other times the design of the levels themselves might make it difficult.The levels here are some of the most original and well crafted I've ever experienced in a 2D platformer.  Nearly every level is wholly unique in some way.  You'll rarely feel like you're doing the same thing twice.  One moment I was nearly dodging flames.  The next I was running across platforms keeping up to the beat of a song.  There's so much variety in each and every level.  Most of them are straightforward but you'll definitely find a lot of great stages that you'll probably come back to over and over again.  Rayman Legends is also not a short game by any stretch of the imagination.  It's huge.  There are tons of collectibles and levels to keep you busy for hours on end.  The fact that it has a good replay value doesn't hurt either.There is another new addition to the gameplay.  Murphy.  He's basically a sidekick that shows up at scripted moments.  And with the press of a button you can command him to do certain things such as move platforms, cut ropes or rotate wheels which will also manipulate platforms.  He can also distract some enemies by tickling them.  The actual interface works rather well.  Those wondering about Murphy seeming like he'd be tacked on can rest assured he isn't.  In every instance he's shows up he is necessary.  You won't be able to get through many a challenge without him and the levels are designed with his need in mind.  The action also never slows down as a result.  In one level I had to dash to keep from being burned alive by a wall of fire all the while using Murphy to manipulate walls or be roasted.  The ways in which Rayman Legends mix and matches all its gameplay elements and stage designs means that you'll find yourself constantly surprised.  Just when you think you've experienced enough the game is always willing to throw something new at you.Rayman Origins wasn't a particularly easy game.  Rayman Legends is no different.  Though it is certainly easier to obtain the bonuses for collecting Lumas this time around, the levels in Rayman Legends will really test your mettle.  Luckily, the stages are quite generous with checkpoints.  Should the worst happen you'll usually continue not too far off from where you perished.  There are no lives in Rayman so you are allowed to screw up as many times as you want to.  And you'll probably end up doing so a lot.  Rayman Legends is not unfairly challenging, however.  The levels will surprise you, but the threat is usually pronounced.Multiplayer also returns.  You and a few friends can get together and play.  Though like the first game you might find yourselves having more fun at the expense of each other than actually completely the level.  On the other hand, cooperation is much more strongly encouraged.  Getting certain bonuses or getting through certain areas is just easier.  If one player perishes then they can usually be saved by the remaining players.  There are times, however, when having too many players around at one time may make some levels feel more challenging.  Particularly those in which it is very important to dash.Graphically there are actually few games that look as good as as Rayman Legends.  Certainly a lot of games have photorealism today, but what they often lack is a pleasing aesthetic to compliment their raw power.  Playing through Rayman Legends is like watching a painting come to life.  It's vibrant and colorful, with a unique design to the sprites and the environments.  Certainly Rayman Legends isn't a powerful game.  But what it lacks in power it more than makes up for in raw artistic design.  It stands apart from all other games because no game really looks like it.  There's more style here than anything.  That style is what helps Rayman Legends stand out so strongly.  Like Origins, it may not have a lot of POWER behind it, but it certainly has a lot of artistic flair that is unmatched by many games today.  It's a gorgeous looking game.  The music is just as rewarding.  Having so many different tunes that perfectly illustrate and characterize the levels and dangers you'll experience.  Simply put, Rayman Legends is purely amazing from a presentation standpoint.There really aren't too many things that keep Rayman Legends down. It's artistic style and level design make sure that you're constantly wowed, while it's handful of levels and bonuses make sure that you always have something to do, even when it feels like you're done.  Rayman Legends, like its predecessor, is a phenomenal game.  Those who have grown up with 2D side scrollers such as Mario and Sonic will definitely want to try this out.  It's just an all around fun game that can (and will) keep you busy for a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R243UDFZ9BJKQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BXTKJ94#wasThisHelpful","R243UDFZ9BJKQF","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It feels like it's been a long time since we had a true Ratchet and Clank sequel.  We had spinoffs such as All 4 One and games like Full Frontal Assault that didn't quite feel like Ratchet and Clank.  Into the Nexus certainly feels like a true Ratchet and Clank game, and yet it still falls short of the glory that the two Ratchet and Clank: Future Games released earlier did (not including Quest for Booty).The game begins with our heroes escorting Vendra to the Vartex Detention Facility.  Things don't go as planned, however, when her brother comes to her aid and things get a little screwed up.  It forces Ratchet and Clank to have to stop her.  It's a simple story that contains many of the things you'd expect from Ratchet and Clank.  Though it never really hits the notes of Tools of Destruction or A Crack in Time, the story isn't bad.  The only thing about it is that it's just such a short experience without feeling like a fully complete one in some respects.  Previous outings have typically been bigger and filled with more intrigue but Into the Nexus is short and sweet, even when including all the side quests.On the other hand, those familiar with Ratchet and Clank will, more or less, feel right at home as the basic formula isn't really all that changed.  The game is still throwing various obstacles at you and there's still a lot of fun to be had with weapons.  There's not a whole lot new here.  You've got weapons like the Winterizer that turns enemies into snowmen for good measure.  Other weapons such as one that gives your enemies nightmares for good measure.  There are also some that return like the fusion bombs, but for the most part there's nothing that makes Into the Nexus stand out in the same way that previous games have.  That's not necessarily a bad thing and at this price there's not much reason to complain.  It just feels like it's not quite a leap forward when compared to previous titles in the series.  It's still good and will be loved by any fan of Ratchet and Clank, but it still doesn't quite feel like the next big thing for Ratchet and Clank.Like the gameplay, nothing about the presentation has really changed either.  The character models are the same.  It's still a gorgeous game with a great design.  Though it doesn't look any different from A Crack in Time that's not bad at all.  A Crack in Time was a marvelous looking game and so is this one.  By now we know what the PS3 is capable of and sometimes the aesthetic quality is important.  Into the Nexus has that.  The voice acting and cutscenes are also really well done. Likewise, the music is absolutely amazing here.In the long run Ratchet and Clank Into the Nexus doesn't do anything wrong.  It just feels like it doesn't want to change anything either.  A lot of the stuff here feels like they're running down a checklist of what needs to be included for a Ratchet and Clank experience.  Hunting for those gold bolts or acquiring skill points can't exactly extend the length of the game by very much.  Some gameplay segments are really well done (the opening moments especially) but there is certainly the feeling that this one was a little more rushed out than previous installments.  What's going to keep it down the most is the excruciatingly short amount of time you'll spend getting through the campaign.  And it isn't that the campaign is short that's so strange about it.  It's actually that the story comes to a close somewhat abruptly.  You'll feel like perhaps more could've been done with it.  Nevertheless for the price it's worth checking out for Ratchet and Clank fans","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JIKN5A128MNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DV16N6U#wasThisHelpful","R2JIKN5A128MNV","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Metal Gear Solid came out in 1998, it was a game changer.  A game that redefined a genre and put video games on a whole new level.  It had a great story with great characters and tackled huge themes.  The gameplay was amazing in and of itself.  If anything it quickly became known (at the time) as being one of the greatest games ever made.  It was fantastic.  When The Twin Snakes came out in 2004 my reaction was rather mixed.  It was nice to see the game given a fresh new coat.  But there were some things that seemed to go a little too far ways that may not have been the best.It is best to point out that Hideo Kojima didn't actually direct Twin Snakes.  And it shows.  The story of Metal Gear Solid is well known by now, but it never hurts to go over it again.  Solid Snake has been brought out of retirement.  Terrorists from his former unit (Unit Fox-Hound) have occupied an Alaskan base.  They're asking for the remains of Big Boss.  If their demands aren't meant, they'll launch a nuke.  Solid Snake has two objectives.  The first is to rescue the DARPA chief, Donald Anderson and the Arms Tech President, Kenneth Baker.  The second is to find out if the terrorist can launch a nuke.  And stop them if they do.One of the things that made the original Metal Gear Solid stand out was its unique gameplay.  You had to avoid enemies and sneak by them.  You had some incredible boss fights and some really good set piece moments.  Just thinking about them brings up great memories.  Repelling down a building while a Hind D shoots at you, or the epic battle with REX.  It's all realized here in a brand new light.  This time around, it takes a lot of the gameplay elements from Metal Gear Solid 2.  Meaning you'll be able to hold up guards if you need to and shake them down.  You'll get an M9 to put guards to sleep.  You can now hang over railings and shoot in first person.  This also means that other elements from Metal Gear Solid 2 made their way in.  In the original game, bodies of the guards disappeared when they were killed, but here they actually stay out in the open.  You must hide the body unless you want someone to discover it and call in a search team to investigate.The original game didn't have any of this.  You couldn't shoot in first person (save for the stingers), you couldn't hang over railings and you couldn't hold up guards.  Thus, Metal Gear Solid was designed without any of this in mind.  Adding in the gameplay elements of Metal Gear Solid 2 is actually quite cool.  The only real issue is that a game that was already fairly easy is made easier because it's clear these gameplay elements were never kept in mind to begin with.  Metal Gear Solid was never a hard game, but Twin Snakes is perilously easy as a result.  It's still fun and still cool but some moments are easy not because they were designed to be... but because you were never supposed to be allowed to do certain things in the first place.  Shooting out security cameras has made some parts unusually easy, for instance.  Hanging over railings has made the need to sneak down to the second floor of some areas a non-venture.  It's not exactly a bad thing by any means.  In fact, many a gamer will probably find it to be tame.Other aspects are a little harder to swallow.  As I said, the game wasn't directed by Hideo Kojima.  One of the hallmarks of the first Metal Gear Solid were those cutscenes.  They were quite amazing for their time.  Every cutscene in Twin Snakes has been updated to look better.  The voices have been re-recorded and there is a nice polish.  The thing is... they're not all particularly good cutscenes.  The voice acting (despite being recorded by the same voice actors) doesn't feel as strong as it once did.  But what's really unsettling is that Twin Snakes adds a little too much glitz and glamour to some of its cutscenes.  You get the sense that Twin Snakes wants to be cool more so than tell an actual story.  You have some moments like the meeting with the Ninja that are so over-the-top you begin to wonder if we're watching Metal Gear Solid or The Matrix.  In one scene, for example, The Ninja cuts out a concrete block, it falls, but before it hits the ground the ninja kicks it at Snake who dodges.  It's so over-the-top and just all around cheesy that it even takes away from the serious tone the game has.  Even in scenes that are supposed to be a bit more emotional and heartfelt the game has a hard time keeping from trying to make it look cool and stylish.  If there was anything Kojima was good about it was setting the perfect mood and tone for each cutscene in the original game and keeping it grounded in some sense of reality.  So much so that someone reading minds seemed quite plausible and believable.  Here there is something that feels a lot more artificial.  It's less like I'm seeing a story unfold and more like seeing a game that's trying too hard to be cool.  Twin Snakes isn't bad by any means, but the cutscenes here somehow lose some of their emotional impacts because of relying on a lot more flash in a scene than the actual substance.Twin Snakes is a good game worth playing.  There are some parts that are actually quite well done.  The new soundtrack, while not quite outdoing the old one, has some really good tracks.  Particularly the alert themes.  The production values and graphical face lift is actually quite welcome.  Even though the cutscenes are over the top, Twin Snakes is on par with Metal Gear Solid 2 in terms of a technical achievement.  It's good all around.  The detail here is stunning.  One that'll make you glad to see Shadow Moses in a new light.  All told it's a gorgeous game.It's hard to really gauge just how worthwhile Twin Snakes is.  It's got a lot of replay value as well.  Players can go for different rankings, play through again to get dog tags.  It feels like there's a lot to do.  There are also higher difficulty levels that really do a good job in elevating the threat.  The only thing that just doesn't feel great about Twin Snakes is that some of the cutscenes are over the top... but not exactly in a good way.  Sure they look cool, but the emotional impact from some of them are quite diminished.  It's worth checking out.  But if you played the original Playstation game, Twin Snakes will look better, but might miss the emotional pull that got you so invested in the story of the original in the first place.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L8GVF234FM9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009P50U#wasThisHelpful","R1L8GVF234FM9D","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:+A really good story+Good graphics+Strong voice acting brings it to life+Familiar free flowing combat is still satisfying+Lots of side missions to keep you busy+A strong multiplayer componentThe Bad:-Gotham City feels strangely lifeless-Some of it is just a little too familiar.  There's nothing here that builds upon what Arkham City established before it.  This isn't necessarily ""bad"" but the experience feels far too similar---When Batman Arkham Asylum came out, it was a burst of fresh air and a relief.  For the first time in a very long time the Batman license was put to good use.  Arkham City then turned out to be a really good sequel in its own right with a fantastic story and a fantastic open world, building up on what Arkham Asylum established and managing to feel different just the same.  Now we have Batman Arkham Origins.  A prequel that is set in Gotham just two years after Wayne has dawned the cape and cowl.  It's a good game in its own right, and is really only hindered by the fact that it does little (if anything) to set itself apart from the game that came before it.  But then again... Arkham City is a hard act to follow.The criminal Black Mask has put a 50 million dollar bounty on Batman's head.  As such, assassins from all over are coming to Gotham to take that bounty on.  In conjunction with that, the police aren't sure if Batman is helping to escalate crime or if he's actually stopping them.  Origins actually has a really good story.  It doesn't reach the heights of Arkham City, but it's good nonetheless, establishing the relationships that Batman has with some criminals and with some of the characters we've come to know and love.  The production values are as top notch as you'd expect.  The voice acting, despite a different cast of voice actors for Batman and The Joker, is quite good in its own right.  The game also has a good graphical presentation, making for a good looking game.  Although the one problem I have with it is that the game gives a pitiful excuse as to why there are no citizens wandering the city--a curfew.  In a way it sort of drains Gotham of life and more or less just makes Gotham seem like a bigger Arkham City.  There are side missions but none of them ever really involve saving citizens.  Usually just going around beating up criminals.Speaking of that, the free-flowing combat is exactly the same as you remember.  This isn't such a bad thing.  You'll be beating up thugs and have a chance to counter them just as you always have.  You get weapons that help you in your beat downs, but aside from that this is the same familiar combat system you've always known.  Which is fine and dandy, although this doesn't make boss fights exciting on any level.  In the previous games some bosses there were very specific tasks that had to be done.  The fight with characters like Mr. Freeze in Arkham City come to mind.  But here it's mostly just like fighting another thug.  The boss fights here just aren't that exciting to play.Like in previous games you'll find lots of gadgets for Batman to use.  However, just like the combat, there's not really anything new here.  At some point a lot of ground just feels too familiar.  The new studio behind Batman Arkham Origins seems to have gotten caught in the trap that many developers get caught in.  Certainly you don't need to fix what isn't broken, but there are times when Batman Arkham Origins feels like it's lifting far too much from the previous game without laying down any new track.  It's not really building on the foundation set before it, This isn't quite as bothersome in many regards, but it makes the game feel like baby steps from the previous game as opposed to great strides.  Many of the side missions you'll come to expect such as the Riddler trophies or just running around the city to beat up thugs.  But there are some pretty cool side missions that actually do add to the story and give you the sense of the relationship that Batman has with his adversaries.  That's not to say there is nothing new.  You can actually access the Batcave here.  You can get some advice from Alfred and you can change your suit and go train.  It's nice to have a bit of a hub area this time around.What actually works out surprisingly well is the multiplayer.  I never pictured the Arkham games as needing a multiplayer.  And a lot of the times when there's a multiplayer component added to a game that was clearly not built up for one it's usually pretty poor (Tomb Raider comes to mind).  Here it actually works.  You play as either Batman and Robin or as thugs trying to take them down.  It's actually really intense and quite fun.  Batman and Robin employ various takedowns while thugs have guns at their disposal.  It's surprisingly fun to play.Arkham Origins exceeds on a technical level, having some really good looking character models and good looking environments.  As mentioned it doesn't feel as alive as it could be, but it's not a bad looking game by any means.  The soundtrack is one of the biggest rewards here.  It's a really good one.  About what you'd expect from an Arkham game.  The only thing that keeps Arkham Origins down is that so much of it feels like a retread of familiar territory.  There's nothing here that really tries to build on the foundation of what was already established in the game before it.  Arkham City did a good job of building up on what was established in Asylum despite having a lot of familiar gameplay.  It feels like the developers here were playing it safe.  The good news is that Origins isn't a step back.  It's just not a big step forward.  It does have it where it counts, though.  A strong story and a good narrative to accompany it.  If you liked the previous Arkham games then Origins is worth your time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36EGS9P6DKUJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C7103DO#wasThisHelpful","R36EGS9P6DKUJY","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:+Amazing production values+A fairly good story+An amazing soundtrackThe Bad:-Some very clunky controls-There are many moments where what you do as a player makes absolutely no difference.  Even sitting idly by and watching events results in the game simply pressing forward without the player suffering any consequences---NOTE: The Following Review is LengthyQuantic Dream is best known for producing the very well done Heavy Rain.  The storytelling and real sense of choice in the game made Heavy Rain stand out.  There was no such thing as a game over.  Even if characters perished or you didn't do something a certain way, the course of the game could change a lot.  Beyond Two Souls is the follow up and while I'd love to tell you it's as awesome as Heavy Rain, that's really only half true.  Everything about Beyond Two Souls production values really shines and stands out.  Gameplay wise, it doesn't quite hit as high, however.  There's nothing really ""Bad"" about Beyond Two Souls, but it's not the best follow up to Heavy Rain.Beyond Two Souls focuses on Jodie.  Ever since she was a girl she's always had a ghost like entity by her side named Aiden.  For the longest time it's hard to decipher just what Beyond Two Souls is about.  The story jumps between Jodie as a child, a teenager and an adult.  But it won't do so in any particular order.  The game jumps from one timeline to another quite often in a very non-linear fashion.  There are times when the story comes off as kind of a mess.  What'll keep you going, however, is how intriguing it all is and the desire to see it all come together.  And it very much does.  The only real strange part about the story being told in this non-linear fashion, is that there's hardly a reason to think it should be.  But even if it were told in order you might still be scratching your head for quite a ways into the game.  Mostly because we're introduced to new characters and plot elements that the story is content to turn its attention away from for extended periods of time before returning to them.  One moment we're with Jodie as a misunderstood teenager.  The next we're with Jodie as a scared child... and then an adult before going back to a part of her past.  Each one introducing something new.  Whether plot related or character related.As I said, it's hard to really say what the story is about.  It's really just about Jodie and Aiden.  Their relationship together and their bond. Everything from a production standpoint about Beyond Two Souls is really up there.  The acting from Ellen Page and Willem Defoe is really good.  Even most of the supporting cast is pretty good.  What might strike you as odd is the writing where there are some pretty poor lines every now and then.  And though the performances by most of the cast is good, there are still moments that stick out as rather bland.  Usually from lesser characters.On the upside, though, the game does look absolutely gorgeous.  The character models are amazing.  Beyond Two Souls is simply one of the best looking games on the PS3 right now.  From time to time the game might freeze up for a second or two or even slow down as a result, but the game is still really easy on the eyes.  But by far the best part has to be the games amazing soundtrack.  One of the best ever composed for a video game.  Simply put, Beyond Two Souls is an assault on the senses.  It's just a good looking, sounding and well crafted game.  Though the story can be confusing it's still good and filled to the brim with a lot of interesting moments and emotional highs.  There aren't many games like it on the market.  It's just a shame the gameplay doesn't stand out quite as much.The gameplay in Beyond Two Souls is most similar to Heavy Rain.  The key difference is that you'll control both Jodie and Aiden throughout the game.  When you control Jodie this is when it's most sensitive to Heavy Rain.  You'll wander through certain locales and perform task.  The game will usually prompt you to do something by pressing certain buttons.  Sometimes it's just a quick tap.  Other times you'll have to hold it.  Sometimes you'll have to hold more than one button at a time.  As you can imagine, sometimes the game will have you do some pretty mundane tasks.  For instance, when getting into conversations you're given choices such as whether to lie or tell the truth or stay silent, but these choices hardly really matter in the long run.  They certainly never really change the outcome of events or the characters reactions.There are also combat scenarios in the game as well.  Jodie will at one point train to fight.  You won't be doing a lot of it in Beyond Two Souls, but the mechanics are quite different from any other game.  When Jodie is performing an action in combat you will use the right analog stick to match some of them.  So if Jodie is punching off to the right, you must move the analog stick right.  If Jodie is kicking downward you must manipulate the analog stick downward.  The only problem with this mechanic is that it's sometimes hard to tell just what Jodie is doing.  It might look like she's punching to the right but it's really just a setup for her to hit someone downward, which means that instead of pressing right on the analog stick... you have to press down.  This actually happens A LOT more often than you'd think.  It doesn't matter, however, as the game is not particularly quick to punish you.Playing as Aiden is a different story.  When playing as Jodie, a quick tap of the triangle button will switch you to Aiden.  As Aiden you can phase through walls and manipulate objects.  You can possess some of your enemies and you can also heal Jodie's wounds or protect her from harm.  Aiden doesn't get quite the same combat experience as Jodie, but it's nice to be able to change from Jodie to Aiden.  Unfortunately you can't do this at all times.  The story pretty much dictates when you can and can't switch to Aiden.  It's not something that can just be done on the fly.There are a few minor complaints about the basic structure of Beyond Two Souls gameplay.  For one, the controls are a little clunky.  Even something so basic as walking can feel clunky.  Particularly when the camera angle changes.  It's easy to make Jodie walk into a wall or become disoriented.  Aiden doesn't control much better as it takes a moment to get a handle on his controls.Some of these problems can be softened if you simply download the Beyond Touch app for your smartphone or tablet.  Doing so allows you to sync your tablet or smart phone to the game and control it that way.  Though many a gamer will probably wonder why this is even an option when the controller itself works fine.  In particular, the app is especially helpful when controlling Aiden.  Along with this there is also a multiplayer feature in the game.  One player controls Jodie while the other controls Aiden.The only real downside to the gameplay in and of itself, is that Beyond Two Souls tries to do what Heavy Rain does in many regards in a story that doesn't quite allow for it.  Heavy Rain was big on making your choices matter.  Doing certain things and performing certain actions (or failing to perform them) resulted in some pretty serious consequences for the player.  The story never ended, but characters could die or events could really play out differently.  Beyond Two Souls tries this, but because of how the story is told it couldn't possibly hope for the same results.  In Beyond Two Souls your choices feel rather mundane in the long run.  They often don't mean anything.  When given choices the outcome rarely (if ever) changes based on one of them.  And if it does change, it never really impacts the overall story.This is compounded by how the story is told.  Obviously if you play through a moment with Jodie as an adult and it flashes back to her being a teenager you know that the end result of whatever it is you're doing isn't going to change.  The choices you make and the moments when you can make them are never impactful enough that they'll alter the story (despite David Cage often saying they would).  It's good at making you feel like your choices are important, but they never really make a difference in how moments of the story itself play out.  For instance, in one moment at a birthday party you're given the option to get even with the kids that bullied you there or just leave.  No matter which choice you make it doesn't impact the story.  It doesn't add to Jodie's character... or even help develop her.  It's great that the preceding scenes before it show that Jodie is different and an outcast... but giving us the choice between revenge or not never really plays a role in the game itself.  What you do here doesn't help develop or impact Jodie as an adult and it obviously can't impact Jodie as a child.  The game is full of moments like this.  Choices that are seemingly big but don't really impact the big picture as a whole.  This might be less bothersome if David Cage hadn't spent so much time telling us that they would.The greater sin is when this happens in gameplay.  David Cage, the games writer and director, has been quite fond of saying he's no fan of game over screens.  That the story must go on no matter what.  And in a game like Heavy Rain this is fine.  You're jumping between different characters in what is a pretty linear story.  But Beyond Two Souls isn't like that.  Since there's no such thing as a game over and the story must go on no matter what, the player feels few consequences for anything they do.  Because of how the story jumps around in the timeline there's not really much room for the game to really let you die.  Obviously if you played through a segment as an adult, you wouldn't be able to die as a teenager.  This doesn't stop you from getting in mortal danger where you'll have to make button presses to save yourself or have Aiden save you.  The problem is that because of the structure your success or failure simply doesn't matter.  In one moment I had to out run pursuers on a train.  One of the things that happens in this scene is that you can make Jodie jump over an obstacle in the way or not.  But it doesn't matter whether you jump over it or trip.  She still keeps going either way.  Tripping over it or jumping doesn't actually matter.  You must then fight them off.  Even if you miss every button press nothing really happens.  You'll get captured and have to escape your captive and jump off the train.  If you manage to fight them off?  You still jump from the train.  How you get to point B is different, sure, but the fact that it has absolutely no impact ON Point B itself is kind of strange.  Other times refusing to do a button input simply makes the game stop and all you do is watch Jodie struggle until you do what the game is actually asking you to do.  No consequences for inaction.  No incentive to hurry up (even in so called crucial moments).  You're given choices, but in a game that's so heavily ABOUT choices it's kind of strange that the impact of them isn't there.There are other moments that are a lot worse, however.  In some instances even missing every button press and just watching the scene changed absolutely nothing.  Some of them played out the same way.  In others the game just sits there waiting for your input.  But at no point in time did I ever feel as though making a mistake would ever result in consequences for me as a player.  What's the point of putting button inputs there if nothing changes?  It sort of makes the idea of Beyond Two Souls having difficulty settings laughable.  Needless to say, any player might as well jump right into the highest difficulty setting immediately.  More than that, it sometimes comes across like the game is putting this out there so that you can feel like you're playing a game without actually playing.  Certainly some scenes can feel a little different, but the story will always press on regardless.  And because of how its told there isn't really much room to put consequences on the player.  If you come to a moment where it seems like Jodie should die from your inaction or doing nothing?  The game simply makes you switch to Aiden to heal her.This is actually rather sad because Beyond Two Souls has some really intense moments.  Moments that, had the player felt more like a participant, might have come across as a lot more breath taking.  And believe me when I say... Beyond Two Souls has some really incredible moments.  Some that really hit emotional highs.  But it's hard to feel the impact when you realize that had you done nothing in them the end result wouldn't have changed.  Basically what I'm saying is... even in gameplay, Beyond Two Souls has a hard time making it feel like your choices matter.  I want to know that me NOT making a kick connect might result in some heavy consequences.  Again, in Heavy Rain this wasn't a problem because it felt like the choices you made mattered.  But the story and approach to that particular game allowed for that flexibility in the story telling.  Beyond Two Souls has no such flexibility.  It's not as though the game really has room to let Jodie die if there's still a moment on the timeline we're working up to.The story of Beyond Two Souls will have you engulfed and perplexed.  It's a good story.  One with a lot of emotional moments and a lot of effective moments.  In terms of reaching for emotional heights, Beyond Two Souls succeeds where few games really have before.  On the other hand, from a gameplay perspective Beyond Two Souls is no where near as exciting.  The player's actions making little difference in the outcome of events or the refusal to make players own up to their mistakes in gameplay is a little jarring at times.  It doesn't keep you from playing the game, but it does give off this idea that the player is merely a passive participant rather than an active one.It is definitely a game worth playing.  Even multiple times.  However, if you are a gamer that values the illusion of choice (or at least the feeling that the choices and mistakes you make in gameplay matter) then you have to get used to the fact that Beyond Two Souls will provide you with a lot of choices, but few that will make a difference or result in consequences for the player.  Beyond Two Souls is a good game, but had it had a couple of tweaks to its gameplay it would've been a great one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G4O959OM7JHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050SX7BQ#wasThisHelpful","R3G4O959OM7JHN","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kingdom Hearts isn't a new game, and thus when the HD Remix came out it probably didn't seem like it was all that important to provide a guide.  In the first place, the ""Final Mix,"" doesn't really include a lot of stuff that wasn't already in the American version of the game to begin with.  That's not to say there are no differences, only to say there is enough of the old stuff here that using a previously released guide will not hinder you at all.  Thus, if you are the proud owner of the Bradygames Kingdom Hearts guide from 2002... that will actually help you out just fine.  And I mean it, that guide was AWESOME and had all the info you could ever want to master the first Kingdom Hearts.  That shouldn't suggest that this guide is bad by any means.  In fact, it covers just about the whole collection.  The original game and Chain of Memories.  If you're one to be a collector then this guide is also in a slick hardback edition.The guide doesn't waste a lot of time.  Since it has to over two games it is understandably thick. It begins by jumping into all the basics of the first Kingdom Hearts game.  And yes, it goes over just about everything.  And has some info that you'll very much appreciate in other ways as well.  In particular, you'll appreciate the charts concerning the abilities.  The choices you make that determine how you level and the abilities you'll learn along the way are listed here in this guide.  Likewise, the guide has charts that show how Sora and his allies will level.  This includes the different rates at which Sora levels.  It also shows what stats will increase at what level for every character.  You'll be more than well prepared for anything that comes your way.The walkthrough itself is also very well organized and put together.  Each section begins with a list of objectives and maps.  Maps that are very detailed.  Those who managed to get a hold of the guide made by Piggyback Interactive will probably note that they are, in fact, the same maps.  They even have the same charts.  This is a GOOD thing because this means you'll find EVERY item you need in any given area.  They're fairly easy to navigate as well.  There is always an objective list you can follow as well.  But if you want a bit more depth, there is a step by step guide that'll take you through everything you need.  It's overall just a really satisfying and simple to use walkthrough.  The screenshots are crystal clear.  There's so much data it's amazing sometimes.  All the heartless are also detailed in every area with handy charts that tell you all their stats.  Bosses are always called out as well.  Most of the strategies and instructions will take you through the game pretty fast.It's also organized very well.  After the walkthrough there is plenty to tell you of all of the games secrets.  Most of them put aside perfectly.  All the trinities are listed.  It'll tell you what area and what map to look at in the guide to find it.  All the Dalmations are listed.  All the mini-games and hidden bosses.  It's all comprised right here.  Following that is an enemies list that talks about every enemy in the game etc.  There are a couple of things beyond the walkthrough that it could stand to be more handy with.  For instance, the synthesis guide could've been a lot more detailed.  It lists ingredients, but a guide on actually getting the Ultima Keyblade would've been nice.  It talks about it, but doesn't really guide you through it.  Also, a much more comprehensive look at the the Gummi Ship might've been nice as well.  In particular, a guide to building a really good one.  I don't think it was necessary to actually detail the missions themselves, but a guide on making the perfect gummi ship would've been very helpful.  Aside from that, most of the stuff in the guide is pretty good on its own.  Very helpful.  Lastly there is a trophy list. The good news is that getting a lot of the trophies doesn't require it's own separate trophy guide.  Since most of the trophies are by completing a lot of extra events, the walkthrough will already help you anyway.  Although it would've been nice had they had tips for players who wanted to do speed runs and the like.There isn't much new in Kingdom Hearts Final Mix.  As I said, the American Version of Kingdom Hearts already had a lot of the things that were introduced to Final Mix in Japan.  There is one hidden boss here that players will like.  And yes, the guide will detail him too.  There are a lot of spoilers, however.  If you haven't played Kingdom Hearts before the guide talks at length about the plot at times.  Though I'm not someone who minds spoilers, I'm sure someone out there does.  Nevertheless, there's still a lot of useful info here.  Perhaps what might've been nice would've been if some of it were better organized and cut down on some of the page flipping.Chain of Memories has a walkthrough that's pretty similar.  It (for some reason) recaps the events of Kingdom Hearts before going into the basics of Chain of Memories.  It'll help you learn about the combat system and the cards.  It's not quite as in depth as what you saw in the Kingdom Hearts section, but then again, Chain of Memories doesn't have quite as much ground to cover.  It'll still help you progress and tell you about all of Sora's stats and how they grow.  The only key difference is that because there's less to cover in the basics it'll get to the walkthrough faster.The walkthrough here is slightly different in style.  Where as the first Kingdom Hearts had an objective list and then a step by step guide, this one is more talkative.  It's slightly less organized this way, but will still get the job done.  There aren't as many detailed maps (something the guide will explain... and if you're familiar with how Chain of Memories worked you won't mind this at all anyway) but the walkthrough is well suited for it all.  You'll also be happy to know that the guide does include a full walkthrough of Riku's story as well as Sora's.  Previous Chain of Memories guides made mention of Riku's story but didn't really walk players through it or give a lot of tips.  Here you get them.Chain of Memories doesn't have nearly as many secrets as the first game.  Everything you'll want to know about Chain of Memories is located primarily in its walkthrough.  There is still a trophies list and it still includes tons of appendices.  There's nothing really missing from this guide.As the guide is covering two games, it can be quite large.  In fact, it's easy to lose your place.  This collector's edition guide has a ribbon bookmark that you can use.  There can be a lot of page flipping (particularly in the first Kingdom Hearts section) but the ribbon bookmark will at least make it hard to lose your place.If you have a previous Kingdom Hearts guide this one isn't going to tell you anything you didn't already know.  There is ONE bonus boss here that this guide covers that previous guides from 2002 won't cover.  If you need a refresher, or you're diving into the heart for the very first time then this particular guide is going to be very helpful to you in a lot of ways.  It's enormous and has tons of information.  And with a bookmark it's easy to keep yourself organized.  Whether your playing for the first time or returning, this guide is going to help you through Kingdom Hearts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NZIQRD7W06NT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804162654#wasThisHelpful","R3NZIQRD7W06NT","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pokemon is one of the rare kinds of games where having a strategy guide actually benefits the player.  In this day and age many a guide is mostly seen as a collectors item to compliment the game itself.  But Pokemon has had times when a strategy guide is still really useful.  The games may be simple to play, but their complexity goes far beyond most games on the market today.  With X and Y in particular, it's nice to be able to have all that information compressed into one book as opposed to having to go through several links on several websites or have to go searching through tons of forums just to get the info you need.  Simply put, you might actually get a Pokemon guide because of the need to have one.Now, the X and Y guide is actually quite nice in and of itself.  It's a hardback guide with a nice cover.  It's beautiful.  The jacket cover also serves as the map.  Again, beautiful.  It also comes with a screen cleaner.  It's definitely got a good design going for it in this regard.  And when you crack it open it all seems good so far.  Particularly as it gets into the basics.  Giving you tons of info on all the new things.  The guide talks at length about the various systems.  It'll tell you about Super Training, raising a Pokemon's affections toward you.  It'll tell you about breeding and give you lots of information on much of these things.  It's not quite as in depth on everything as you'd like, but you won't go into it not knowing what's in store, at least.  How far and how long it goes into the new systems and all the basics of the game is quite impressive, though.  As many a guide won't spend that much time doing so.It's when we get into the walkthrough itself that things begin to falter.  The information is good.  You'll always know where to go, who to talk to for items and what shops and the like will have in store.  The guide also has detailed maps of every area in the Kalos region.  When trainers are on routes the guide will tell you how many Pokemon they have.  Although they don't tell you WHAT the Pokemon are (I have been spoiled by the Versus Books Pokemon Crystal guide where they told you what Pokemon every trainer in the game had to help you prepare).  It's still nice to know some of these things.  They also tell you what Pokemon are in the area.  They'll also tell you what's located in what type of grass, as well as what Pokemon might jump out.  They call out new Pokemon just fine.  Also, when you get to moments where other trainers challenge you to a battle (such as your rival or gym leaders) you get a list of their Pokemon.  What is nice, however, is that the guide is more concerned with explaining to you what type its weak to as opposed to just telling you the type.  It makes it much easier and takes away the need to flip to the back of the guide for the chart-type index.  For gym trainers in particular this is very useful.  It's all not so bad.That doesn't mean the walkthrough doesn't have its fair share of problems.  Because of the lack of a Pokedex (more on that in a minute) the guide is good at calling out new Pokemon... but will tell you absolutely nothing about them.  There are no profiles or anything to give you on any help on whether or not the Pokemon is worthwhile. And while the guide tells you what Pokemon are in an area, it doesn't always tell you the rarity of them.  It'll only tell you that they're in the area, but you have little indication as to how often they appear.  In terms of what to do the guide is great.  But in terms of info on the Pokemon themselves it's pretty abysmal.  Likewise, it'll tell you what items are in an area but not exactly where they are.  You will know that there is an item on the map, it just won't tell you what it is.The guide also doesn't tell you a lot about the post game.  Once you've beaten the Elite Four and Pokemon Champion it's pretty dry on all the post game fun.  But the biggest let down is, like so many have pointed out, the lack of a Pokedex of any kind.  To a degree this is standard stuff.  Pokemon guides, since Gold and Silver have generally made us wait a bit for a second volume that is usually the Pokedex.  The DS games in particular had you wait.  The Diamond and Pearl Guide by The Pokemon Company originally did not include a Pokedex either (though it had a list of Pokemon, there was never anything like moves etc. listed).  Here there is quite a bit to be desired.  Sometimes they've thrown in a regional Pokedex but here we don't get that either.  If it's like in the past, you should look to see a Volume 2 in a few months (and apparently it IS coming, so don't believe the statements that there won't be one).If anything, the only thing that's disappointing about it is that the guide is VERY clearly incomplete as a result.  It's one thing that there is no Pokedex but it goes deeper than that.  There's no info on any Post Game stuff, which is just as big of a deal.  And when I say they don't put any detail into the post game I'm not kidding.  If there's a TM to be discovered after the Elite Four... the guide won't even tell you WHAT it is.  It's not that the guide feels incomplete.  I expect them to do what they've done since the days of Gold and Silver.  Which is release a second volume later that details that stuff.  What I DO expect, however, is for the guide to at least FEEL like it covers all the basics.  Beyond the Elite Four it's not that useful, but what's also sad is that it's not quite as useful even leading up to it.  There are A LOT of things that are worth talking about to great lengths in Pokemon X and Y.  There is a lot of basic stuff here, but not a lot of depth.  The guide doesn't talk much at all about breeding, for instance, or how to get a Pokemon with a nature you want.  There's a bit about Super Training, but mostly just explaining what it is and not necessarily a good way to go about it.That's not to say the guide is useless.  If you're only goal is to get to the Elite Four and become the Pokemon Champion, the guide will more than help you out.  Chances are the next volume is going to be the one that gives the info that hardcore fans are going to want.  This includes a much needed Pokedex.  The walkthrough itself is not actually bad.  It'll take you through the Kalos region and it'll help you find a lot of key items, O-Powers etc.  There's a lot of stuff you WILL get as a result of this guide.  It's getting beneath the surface that you won't get.  There's a lot of depth the guide lacks and simply isn't going to go into.  As a walkthrough it's perfectly fine.  As a reference book for mastering Pokemon X and Y there's a lot to be desired outside of just a Pokedex.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3004F92KCNSK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804161992#wasThisHelpful","R3004F92KCNSK7","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those who have followed Nintendo Handhelds, the very idea that they'd release so many different versions of one handheld is nothing new.  The original Gameboy eventually had the Gameboy Pocket and then Gameboy Color.  The Gameboy Advance had the SP and the Micro.  The DS had the original release, the lite, the DSi and the DSi XL.  The 3DS already has the original and the XL.  It seemed strange that so soon after the launch of the 3DS XL we'd find ourselves with another DS release.  This is the 2DS.  On the outside it doesn't seem like much, but once you get it in your hand it's actually pretty solid.As a note before beginning: The following review assumes you are quite familiar with the 3DS already.  In reading this I am assuming you are familiar with the 3DS interface and features.  They will not be detailed here.  Just know that they all work exactly the same here.There are only two major differences between a 2DS and 3DS.  The first is that there is no stereoscopic 3D.  This means those hoping to play their games in stereoscopic 3D won't be able to do it.  For someone like me who insists on playing his original 3DS with the 3D slider turned off anyway, this is no problem.  It doesn't bother me in the slightest.  The second major difference is that the screen doesn't close like other DS models.  Other DS models had a clamshell design that allowed you to fold the screen down.  Both screen are visible at all times.  If you plan on getting this for a child I would strongly suggest buying screen protectors.Aside from those two things, the 2DS pretty much does everything your 3DS does.  All the channels are still there.  You can still access the Nintendo eShop.  There's nothing really ""stripped"" away here.  There is still a place for your SD card on the side.  All games are inserted into a slot that's on the top of the 3DS.  The camera still works just fine.  The interface is still fine.  The stylus is located in a slot on the back about halfway down the right hand side.  Anything you could do on your other 3DS systems you can do here.  It also retains being able to play your original DS games, although it doesn't look like there's a chance of it playing GBA games for those who are wondering.For those curious about the size of the 2DS, it's relatively small.  The screen sizes are that of the original 3DS and not of the XL.  So you won't have to worry that it's ""too big"" for the little ones.  Although the DS itself might be a tad small if you've got big hands.  Other differences include the fact that the L and R buttons are a lot bigger and easier to press.  The button placement itself actually works.  The face buttons (A, B, X, and Y) and circle pad are located next to the top screen while the directional pad is located closer to the bottom screen.  The start and select button are also located near the bottom screen off to the side just below the face buttons.  They're all very easy to get to and because it's not too big it's perfect placement.  Also, and I must say this is especially nice, there is a switch that allows you to put the 2DS into sleep mode.  Since you can't fold the top screen down they built in this little switch to compensate for that.  Just a flick and your 2DS goes to sleep.  A flick back and it wakes up.  Perfect if you need to put it away for any reason.There are only a couple of gripes with the 2DS.  None of them large.  The first is that I think I'd have preferred a clam shell design.  The 2DS is quite a remarkable device.  Yet a fold down top screen would've still been nice to have.  That way you could easily stick it in your pocket and not have to worry too much about scratches on the screen.  Both screens could've been protected this way.  This is pretty minor, but something that would've been nice, nonetheless. The other thing is that if you are getting this to replace a 3DS or 3DSXL some accessories don't work.  Those who got a Circle Pad Pro, for instance, won't be able to use it here, for instance.  I'm sure there will be brand new accessories to go with it, but at this point it feels odd that Nintendo isn't simply making a model with a second circle pad always there.  Likewise, if you're actually getting this to replace your 3DS, Nintendo has made it very tedious to transfer your data.  As you must perform a system transfer.  So if, for any reason you plan on trading in your old 3DS for a 2DS for any reason, keep in mind that you need to do a system transfer before handing it off.  You can't simply pull out your SD Card and put it in another system.This, of course, brings about the question always asked when a new model of a system comes out.  Is it worth it?  The answer varies from console to console.  But here I'll say simply that the 2DS is definitely a cheap alternative to the 3DS if you don't have one.  The price isn't bad.  This is especially nice if you have a young child.  If you've already got a 3DS there's no particular reason to get a 2DS.  It does all the same things.  The only reason to really replace a 3DS with this one is if you really like the design (or if you're looking for a cheap alternative should your need to be replaced).  Nevertheless it's not bad by any means.  As a cheap alternative it's perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P29DY7RKBYP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F0R7YJS#wasThisHelpful","R3P29DY7RKBYP1","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pokemon has been a regular staple in gaming for quite a long time now.  And while this is not news to anyone, the way in the which the games have been slowly evolving actually has been.  Pokemon X and Y is quite possibly the strongest game in the series in quite some time.  This time around the developers have really gone all out.  It's incredible no matter how you slice it.  If you are a Pokemon fan, X and Y is worth trying.Pokemon has had quite a consistent formula for a long time.  Nothing really changes here.  Though there is actually a bit more of a story than what has been in earlier variations of the game, the basic frame work is still pretty much the same.  You'll pick a Pokemon at the start (always between Grass, Fire and Water) and set out on your journey to catch as many Pokemon as you can, as well as to set out to find all the gyms.  The pacing of the game is rather slow at times, but this isn't really that big of a deal.  Because of how big X and Y is there's not a lot of downtime.  You'll find that in many places there is always something to do.  You'll choose either a boy or a girl, but you'll find even your player character can be customized.  You can give him or her a nickname, change their clothes and even do things that are leisurely to them as opposed to just your Pokemon.  As such, despite sticking to a lot of tried and true conventions, the world of Pokemon X and Y is most definitely bursting with life and energy.  The characters you meet might be a little annoying, and the writing and dialog are pretty bad... but Pokemon has never exactly been known for its writing to begin with.  The only part about it that may erk returning players, is how long it really takes to get going.  Everything about the introduction you've seen before.  You've been through choosing a starter before.  You know how to catch Pokemon.  There are a lot of things you won't need to be reminded of, but for the sake of new players you'll have to sit through a lot of these tutorials anyway.  The good news is it doesn't last too long.  The game will cut you from the tutorials earlier than expected, but it still takes some time before you really jump into the heart of the quest.Though there is a lot of awesome additions here, the core structure of the experience is pretty much the same.  You'll catch Pokemon out in the wild and add them to your roster.  You'll battle trainers who wish to challenge you.  You'll still go around collecting those gym badges.  Pokemon are in the tall grass as you'd expect.  There aren't too many additions to the core experience.  You can do things such as ride a Pokemon around in the wild and that's not so bad at all.  You can also build your compatibility with your Pokemon by giving them some much needed attention by petting them or just giving them attention.  You area also able to do some specific training to raise specific stats by playing certain mini games with your Pokemon.  It's pretty simple stuff.  It doesn't make too much of a difference in the long run, but they're still additions.Battling is exactly as it always has been.  Pokemon has always had a rock/paper/scissors element to the battle system.  It's what makes it so strategic and what makes it so that you can't simply power through everything with just one Pokemon.  For instance, grass type attacks are strong against water type Pokemon, but grass is also weak toward fire.  You can carry up to six Pokemon in your roster at a time and you'll always be allowed to switch between them in battle if need be.  You'll want to train all of your Pokemon and keep a good variety.  Because there are so many to collect and battle, however, it's pretty important to realize that there is no ""best"" team.  Anyone can build a team to their liking.  You'll appreciate a lot of the new creatures and grow attached to particular favorites.  It's a simple battle system, but it's surprisingly addictive.  The random encounter rate when walking through tall grass is a little high, but it's not really a bother for seasoned veterans.  And like in previous versions it can be easy to be drained from fighting too many trainers that you simply can't avoid.  Again, not much of a problem for a seasoned veteran, but sometimes when you don't feel like battling trainers and there's no way around them... it can feel like they're just a speed bump in the way of getting through a dungeon or a route.The Mega evolution concept sounded great on paper, but it's not quite as amazing as it sounds in practice.  Yes, it's pretty cool to see some of the Mega Evolutions, but it doesn't last that long.  Certain Pokemon can get one evolution higher, but it's only really a temporary boost.  It's nothing permanent and you can only use it once per battle.  There's nothing wrong with the concept, but it's only really a temporary boost.  And after a while you'll find you don't really need it in battle.  Pokemon X and Y is not exactly a difficult game.  You'll level up a lot faster here than you do in other installments.  Though I'd never describe Pokemon as a difficult game, this particular incarnation seems to have really dipped in the difficulty.  Most battles (even with gym leaders) are not too taxing, even if you go in unprepared.  The game requires less grinding to get yourself prepared for any challenge and even should the worst befall you, the punishment isn't very severe at all.Graphically, Pokemon X and Y has had quite the overhaul.  Before Pokemon has never really struck me on a technical level.  The gameplay has always been what kept it so fun and kept me coming back.  The graphics were usually not quite as good as what the platform was capable of producing.  This is not the case with X and Y.  The game is absolutely gorgeous with some good looking character models and some very detailed locales.  Pokemon X and Y isn't the best looking 3DS game out there, but it is most definitely a looker.  It's got fully detailed models and characters.  It has a nice distinct cartoony like look that is just perfect for Pokemon.  It's a charming aesthetic look at.  The fact that the game is so huge makes just how GOOD it looks that much more impressive.  It doesn't feel like anything was sacrificed to make the huge world in which you're playing in.  But nothing looks quite as amazing as the battle.  Though the environments and backgrounds themselves are not quite as detailed, they're still nice.  But what really shines here, is looking at your Pokemon in battle.  No longer are they merely flinching to attack.  Rather they have full movement in battle.  It's nice to see a flying Pokemon actually flapping its wings.  And though no attack really ""connects"" (you won't see Fennekin actually scratch a Pokemon, for instance) you will see some pretty nice looking animations.  In the past Pokemon hasn't really been a looker (and it didn't exactly need to be) but here it's quite nice to see a lot of care and devotion taken to the games presentation.  Particularly with the Pokemon and even with your character model.  You can change their clothes and accessories and really personalize it.  From a presentation standpoint, Pokemon X and Y looks absolutely amazing.The music is also just as good.  It's very energetic and catchy.  Just as most Pokemon tunes have always been.  There are times when the sound effects still sound a little dated, but again, as with most things here... it's not that big of a deal.  The battle themes, in particular, are really catchy.The multiplayer has been given a lot of treatment, however.  It's a lot easier to keep track of friends as the game will tell you when they're online.  Likewise, the game will track other players nearby.  This interface is intuitive and very easy to use.  It's also easy to set up trades and battles this way.In the long run, Pokemon X and Y really isn't all that different from its counterparts.  It still has the same basic formula at play.  However, some of the gameplay tweaks help it stand out.  The additions and improvements are noticeable and enough to warrant a look for any fan.  More than that, a lot of the gameplay is still really good.  Some of it has been refined.  The game may be easier than its counter parts, and the characters you come across quite bland and generic, but these are minor flaws when compared to the addictive gameplay.  Pokemon X and Y is a gem.  A game that deserves a look.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R580IM0NN0JOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053B66KE#wasThisHelpful","R580IM0NN0JOZ","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kingdom Hearts was originally released in 2002, and at the time of its release I don't think anyone thought the series was going to be as huge as it was.  Originally a lot of people weren't excited for Kingdom Hearts.  With so many various Disney characters thrown into the mix there was many a cry of how ""kiddy"" the game was going to be.  Yet in the end it not only turned out to be a success, but also one of Square-Enix's biggest properties.  With so many HD Collections coming out recently it's a wonder why it took so long to get a Kingdom Hearts one out there in the first place.  It's not entirely what I had expected, but it's still a solid remaster.There's not much need to go into the story of Kingdom Hearts.  Let's just say that of all the games in the series, the first one is by far the simplest as the plot hasn't had too many revelations yet.  You'll play as Sora who ends up coming into possession of the keyblade to fight the heartless and uncover the secrets behind them.  You'll do this by traveling to various worlds populated by Disney characters.  All of these things are remastered in HD and it looks really gorgeous to see some of your favorite characters and worlds.  It's also a pretty noticeable and the presentation is really good.Of all the HD reissues there are few that have the kind of care taken as Kingdom Hearts.  The entire presentation has been reworked for a 16:9 aspect ratio and is displayed in wonderful 1080p.  Other HD remakes tend to not touch things such as pre-rendered backgrounds, but in Kingdom Hearts even the pre-rendered stuff is displayed in gorgeous HD.  You'll hardly spot any blemishes or muddy textures.  It all looks brilliant.  The fonts are easier to read as well.It's also nice to know that there have been a couple of changes made to the gameplay to suit some of the features.  Originally the camera was a nightmare to deal with in the original game, but now it's relegated to the analog stick and easier to deal with.  You may still have a couple of camera issues, but with the camera no longer being set to the shoulder buttons, it's easier to deal with.  Likewise, much like Kingdom Hearts II, there are some moments where instead of selecting it in the menu you can just press the Triangle button during a context sensitive moment and perform certain actions.  These little tweaks help Kingdom Hearts out a lot.  Especially being able to press triangle to do simple things like open doors as opposed to having to select it in the action menu.  Likewise, the ability to pause and skip cutscenes is especially nice as this wasn't an option in the original release at all.  On subsequent playthroughs you'd have no choice but to watch every cutscene again.  Here you can just as easily bypass all that stuff.  It's overall not just a good HD upgrade, but also controls better.Other than that, combat is pretty much the same as you remember.  You'll roam around areas, enemies will pop up and you'll have to dispatch them quickly to earn experience points and level up skills.  This take on combat is still pretty cool stuff today.  Though it lacks some of the refinements of Kingdom Hearts II, it's still fun and simple to play.  But most important, the combat doesn't bog things down by constantly having you transition into a battle and then out of a battle so that the story can progress.There are some things that have not aged quite as well in Kingdom Hearts, however.  Chief among them are the gummi ship segments.  For the most part many of them are simply long, repetitive and slow paced.  Flying to a new world just doesn't really provide a whole lot of fun.  It feels counter to the fast paced action of the rest of the game.  Some of the platforming segments are also a little off at times.  Jumping from one platform to another can sometimes feel like a hassle, especially before you get the abilities that help simplify it.  These things aren't really ""bad,"" mind you.  At the time of the games original release, it probably didn't matter much but now it stands out a little more.  Thankfully, though, Kingdom Hearts is still a blast to play.  All the characters, the story and the gameplay is just as fun as it ever was.Unfortunately, the original Kingdom Hearts is all that's really worthwhile in the collection.  While Chain of Memories has a good story (actually a rather great one) the fact that it still has a pretty toned down card based battle system is urksome.  The combat simply isn't that much fun.  The fact that it also must transition into a battle as opposed to being right there in the action like it is in the first game is also a drag.  Granted this is a game that was remade from a GBA title, which certainly plays a part in that, but just the same it's a shame that while some enhancements were made to the original game to make the experience better, this particular game doesn't really have any that do.  Chain of Memories is also well known for just not letting you explore a ton or anything of the sort.  The story, however, is essential to understanding the overall plot of the Kingdom Hearts series.  It links to the second game and actually enhances the experience of that game.  It's worth playing through Chain of Memories just for the story alone, but the gameplay isn't all that exciting.The last bit is Kingdom Hearts 358/2.  The game was originally released on the DS.  You are NOT actually getting that game, though.  All you really get is the cutscenes from that game--enhanced and reworked.  They look gorgeous but it's not really all that exciting.  Granted, it probably would've been a bit much to remake the entire game in the same manner as Chain of Memories, but what you realize is that much of the cutscenes in 358/2 are quite dull.  It's worth watching for the sake of the story at least once.  And they're fully voiced and acted, but it's nothing too exciting.  For the most part much of it is rather dull.Even though the Kingdom Hearts HD Remix isn't as good as other collections out there, the price for just the original Kingdom Hearts alone is pretty worthwhile, as the game itself is amazing.  Even though there are some aspects that haven't aged that well, the game still looks and plays incredibly well even by todays standards.  If you haven't experienced the original Kingdom Hearts or you want to experience it again, this collection is for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13TPTQ2OO390K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008SBZD5U#wasThisHelpful","R13TPTQ2OO390K","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:+A lot of gameplay tweaks and additions make it the most fun to play+A large variety of characters, weapons and abilities+Varied missions each complete with unique objectives+Lots of different story modes to play through+At the end of the day, the game is just a ton of fun, particularly with friendsThe Bad:-The voice acting is laughably bad-There's no narration at all with the events inbetween battles-A few slight performance issues get in the way---Koei has pretty much made their mark in gaming with series such as Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors and Warriors Orochi.  For the most part all of these games play very similar to one another with usually little differences in their sequels.  Some gamers have come to love this while many critics have come to loathe this.  Dynasty Warriors has had a roller coaster of highs and lows.  The Playstation 2 era was quite kind to Dynasty Warriors as the third and fourth games in particular had devoted fans.  The PS3/360 era has seen more of a mixed bag with Koei experimenting a little bit.  It has caused for some mixed reactions among fans.  But fear not... they got it right with Dynasty Warriors 8.  Gameplay wise it is by far the best Dynasty Warriors has to offer.The story in Dynasty Warriors never changes.  You'll play through the events of the three kingdoms.  Wei, Wu and Shu.  There's another faction here called Jin as well.  There is a story mode for each force to play through.  As you play the story gives you some insight as to what's happening.  From a production standpoint, Dynasty Warriors has never been a standout title.  While the story can be fascinating to take in (because it takes place in the Three Kingdoms era of China), it is certainly not presented well.  There are moments in between each mission where you'll read a lot of text in a slide show like fashion, but there's no narrator to speak of.  And beyond that, when you see the games cutscenes they are very poorly voiced and written.  The voice acting, in particular, is sometimes laughably bad, while the writing tries far too hard to be complex.  Someone at Koei seems to think they're being prolific as there are a lot of big speeches about honor and the like... but most of it just comes off as really cheesy and hokey.  What really comes off as cheesy is whenever a particular character dies throughout the story.  You'll have fun with Dynasty Warriors 8, but you may find it hard not to laugh at some of its poorly conceived cutscenes.  On one hand it's kind of charming as it's clear that the team has embraced this hammy approach, but on another it takes away from what is actually supposed to be quite a series story and recount of history.The force you choose to play as each has their own separate story.  And as it progresses you'll come across new missions and select very specific characters for each story based moment.  It isn't like a couple of other games in the series where you select a character.  The game is about making sure that the key people in the battles are the people you play as.Hacking and slashing is the bread and butter of Dynasty Warriors 8 and those who are familiar with any past Koei game (in particular, Warriors Orochi) will know what to expect.  You can make your basic strikes while adding in certain charge attacks from time to time.  You also have your Musou gauge, except this time its split into three chunks.  If you manage to fill up your rage then you can use all three at once to perform a rage musou which is an incredibly powerful attack.  All the basics of Dynasty Warriors are there.A few things have changed or been improved.  The entire arsenal of weapons is opened up to every character.  This means that any character can pretty much use any weapon they want.  And the game encourages experimenting.  Likewise, you can always equip two weapons at once and change between them on the fly.  Every character can do this.  Every character also has a favorite weapon.  And using this weapon grants them the ability to make extra attacks.  Each weapon also has an affinity.  Either Heaven, Earth or Man.  This actually adds a rock-paper-scissors element to playing Dynasty Warriors.  Each affinity is strong against one affinity, while being weak to another.  For example, the Man affinity is strong versus Heaven affinity but weak to earth.  Officers using an affinity you're weak against have an advantage against you and vice versa.  If you do manage to use a weapon with a stronger affinity you can score some extra hits with some very cool attacks in the process.  Since you can equip two different types of weapons on every character, it's always a good idea to equip a weapon with a totally different affinity from your other one.There is, as always, a catch.  Each character has a compatibility rating for each weapon.  So while they can equip anything, there are definitely weapons that characters are not as good with as others.  Each character has a compatibility rating with every weapon.  The higher the compatibility, the better they are with said weapon.  Weapons also have abilities on them that allow them to do things like turn some attacks into lightning based attacks, increase attack when your life is low or boost defense.  There's quite a bit.  In addition to this, performing certain feats in battle can also allow you to learn abilities that you can equip on characters.  You might end up defeating an officer using a weapon with the same affinity and learn ""Victory Cry,"" an ability that increases damage dealt to officers.  Or you may learn defense boost or attack boost.  There are quite a few abilities to learn, and you can equip up to four.All this makes Dynasty Warriors 8 feel like there's actually a somewhat strategic element at play.  Yes, it's definitely hack and slash, but now players may have to sometimes change up their tune when playing.  It's a lot of fun in the long run, despite being as simplistic as it is.While hack and slash is at the forefront of Dynasty Warriors 8, the missions can sometimes be about much more than that.  Each mission has a certain set of objectives that must be taken care of at any given time.  Instead of just rushing an enemy leader, you may have to go to various locations and perform certain duties or take out a small group of officers in order to open gates, stop an enemy advance or put a wrench in the opposing teams plans.  Sometimes the goal isn't about defeating an officer but helping one escape (or preventing said escape).  Each mission seems to have a good set of objectives to take care of.  In the story mode this is especially important because in some missions you can branch off to other side story missions.  You may even ""change history,"" by getting to a hypothetical ending as opposed to the more historically accurate one.All this means that if you decide to, there's A LOT to do in Dynasty Warriors 8.  This isn't even taking into account that you'll need to find every characters best weapon, or all the things that can be done in Free Mode.  Dynasty Warriors 8 is a pretty large game.  There are tons of characters to play as and tons of stages to play through and experience from two points of view.  As you progress through the story you'll be able to play the same levels in Free Mode as well where you can select any character you want and just grind and have fun.Dynasty Warriors has never been a graphical powerhouse and Dynasty Warriors 8 is no problem.  It isn't the most powerful game out there.  It's fun, but you're not going to be writing home about how detailed everything is.  It's nice to see a lot of enemy troops on screen at one time, but the game sometimes buckles under all of this, as the frame rate tends to drop.  Other times there can be odd glitches or hitches in performance.  While playing two player for instance... I discovered that the officer my friend was playing as was also roaming around on the field as an AI (thus there were two of them).  Sometimes when performing certain tasks in levels the events simply failed to initiate when they were supposed to.  The last bit rarely happens (it has only happened to me once thus far) but the others typically tend to happen all the time.  For those wondering about installation, I'd highly recommend doing it as the game has some pretty lengthy load times otherwise.Musically the game is alright.  There are some tunes and battle themes that really stand out.  As already noted, the voice acting is laughably bad, but what really stings is that the story has no narration in the sequences between the battles, where instead you'll have to read it all.  The font is pretty small as well and you can't read it at your own leisure.  It's done in a slideshow like manner.  Dynasty Warriors, of course, has never been known for having excellent voice acting.  It's often been pretty dry.What stands out most in Dynasty Warriors 8 is the gameplay.  Particularly the refinement.  And teaming up with players is a treat.  Doing local or online co-op really adds a lot to the experience.  Playing co-op in Dynasty Warriors is just a lot of fun.  Likewise, the refinements to the gameplay are welcome as it never really feels like the pace of battle is slowing down.  Dynasty Warriors may not be a technical marvel, but it certainly is a lot of fun to play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AAA5B4AWNGLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBNVAE4#wasThisHelpful","R1AAA5B4AWNGLQ","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:+A good cast of characters+A very in-depth battle system+A good balance of character customization+The music is absolutely fantasticThe Bad:-Some areas could've had more details-Exploration sometimes feels limitedThe Tales series has not been huge in America.  Case in point, we're just now getting Tales of Xillia when Japan received the game a couple of years ago (and already has a sequel out).  Tales of Xillia made a big splash in Japan.  It's said to be one of the best Tales games ever released.  When playing it's easy to see why.  It's a very fun JRPG that helps remind us why the genre still has life while other times reminding us why it's not quite as popular as it once was.  Nevertheless the pros win out as Tales of Xillia is an amazing game.Tales of Xillia centers on two characters.  The first is a medical student named Jude Mathis.  The other is a mysterious woman named Milla Maxwell.  You're allowed to pick one character or the other to start the game.  Picking one changes how you see certain events and the perspective of the story.  The end goal is, for the most part, the same, but if you really love Tales of Xillia, you already have an incentive to play through it a second time.  Their story takes place in the world of Reize Maxia where mana seems to be slowly draining away.  Milla, along with her four spirits decides to investigate, while Jude gets wrapped up in the conflict.As you might have guessed, the story in Tales of Xillia doesn't get off to a very quick start.  It takes time to really get you to understand the world it takes place in as well as getting you used to the characters and their banter.  So while it might take a moment of Tales of Xillia to really get going, you'll appreciate this once you really get to know the characters.  One of the best things about the Tales series is the characters.  Certainly they each play one typical role or another, but Tales has always gone to great lengths to develop them.  The story itself really comes to life because of the characters and their chemistry with each other.  They each have a distinct personality.  Likewise, Tales of Xillia contains skits (a Tales staple) where characters will joke with one another, talk about certain events going on within the story and sometimes just talk about themselves.  By the time the journey is done you'll learn a lot about them, and they'll change and develop quite drastically.  Because of these characters, the story is that much more enticing as a result.In the past, Tales games often got bogged down in exposition.  With you running between towns with no real battles in between.  Tales of Xillia mostly avoids this.  There are times when it gets exposition heavy, but being able to warp between towns keeps the story moving at a brisk pace once it gets going.  As a result the exposition dumps that Tales is sometimes known for aren't as troublesome here because you needn't traverse huge chunks of the world map to return to towns and leave, or pass through the same area again and again.  There will still be moments where you'll feel like the game is explaining too much of a certain plot point again and again (and where you'll figure things out as your characters are trying to piece them together) but the pacing doesn't suffer as a result thanks to being able to warp between areas so easily.  It makes Tales of Xillia keep running once it really hits its stride.  This change for Tales is a pretty big one if you played previous games in the series.The battle system is going to feel both familiar and new to any Tales fan.  Battles are contact based.  When in battle you can move around freely and attack.  There's no turn based system here.  You and your allies can run all over the field and attack at your leisure.  Tales of Graces F certainly added a new spin onto the series but here things go back to be on par with Vesperia more so than any other game.  As usual you have tech points (TP) which can be used to perform Artes, which are like magic to deal extra damage.  Some things have changed, however.  There's more to Tales of Xillia than button mashing.  It can feel this way at first, but as the game progresses you'll really need to put some of the new mechanics to work.  When in the heat of battle you can backstep to evade attacks and surprise your enemy from behind.  Most unique of all the new elements, though, is the ability to link with other party members and perform linked attacks.  You'll be able to flank enemies, for instance.  Whoever you are ""linked"" to will also cover your back.  More impressive is that you'll be able to perform linked artes as well.  All this seems like it would make Tales of Xillia a pretty easy game, but the truth is that at some point there's a lot of strategy involved.  You need to be smart about who you link with, for example, and you need to be smart about how you evade and utilize your TP.  It's not exactly a hard game (unless you up the difficulty) but it is a game that really wants you to understand the system at play.You are only able to control one character at a time in battle.  The other three are controlled by the AI.  In most games the idea of the AI doing anything on your behalf is a nightmare, but in Tales of Xillia they hold their own.  You won't have to spend a lot of time babysitting them, and you can customize strategies for them to use.  The game also provides you with the ability to sign certain artes from other characters to a shortcut.  If you need a character to cast a specific spell you can assign it to a shortcut to have them do so.  You are also able to switch between characters any time you want in battle.There is more to the battle system.  Each character has a Lillium Orb.  As you level your stats don't increase.  Instead you get GP and move along a characters Lillium Orb.  Using the Lillium Orb allows you to develop characters at your own pace by letting you increase their individual stats and learn new artes and skills.  If you find you don't want to have to constantly make decisions about what stats to increase or artes to get, the game allows you to auto level and it'll develop the characters accordingly.Graphically speaking, Tales has never been a big leader in this department.  There aren't a lot of detail to the environments.  In particular, running around the fields can sometimes feel like you're running down the same path over and over.  There just aren't a lot of details in any of the dungeons or towns.  At times environments feel strangely empty.  This isn't likely to bother many players.  By now most Tales fans pretty much expect this graphically.  At the very least the cel-shading itself isn't bad.  Character models are fairly detailed and have a unique design to them.  They really stand out.  Plus, with how much fun you'll be having with the battle system and how good the story is... it's safe to say that the graphics being below the standard is a very minor flaw in what is an otherwise very good game overall.Musically, however, Tales of Xillia may have the best soundtrack in a Tales game yet.  It's very good all around.  Often evoking the right mood and tone.  For those who picked up the Limited Edition you'll get a music CD to help you sample.  The voice acting can be a mixed bag, however.  As is usual, the voices themselves fit with the characters, but the voice talent themselves isn't always up to par.  At the very least, Tales of Xillia has some well crafted dialog to really help things along.  Again, the voice acting is probably a more minor thing.  It's never cringe worthy.  There are just times you wish it packed more of a punch--especially in the game's more emotional moments (and there are a lot of those).Tales of Xillia is far from being flawless, of course.  As noted, the graphics aren't the best and the voice acting isn't quite as good.  These are the minor things.  What may be a little more major is how the world in and of itself feels slightly smaller.  One of the best things about other tales outings (particularly, Abyss, Symphonia and Vesperia) is that there was a huge overworld to explore.  Here, things are a lot more linear.  Often the game doesn't really let you branch off the beaten path.  If you try many times the game simply won't let you--usually reminding you to get back to the quest at hand.  There are plenty of sub events and sidequests that can be done, but Tales of Xillia doesn't always feel like it's a world that can be explored and traversed.  When you've reached a certain point in the game it's all at your disposal but the game works its best to make sure that you're keeping to the story for a long time.Nevertheless, Tales of Xillia is a very fun game in and of itself.  It's a rewarding JRPG which is a lot of fun to play and has a good cast of characters to carry the story along.  If you're a fan of the Tales series then you should definitely play.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTFRRF3VHKX6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B67ZTUW#wasThisHelpful","RTFRRF3VHKX6K","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Metal Gear saga has had quite the legacy over the past two decades.  The games have gone on to further a genre and they helped change the way video games tell stories.  Konami seems to hoping to get as many people as they can to experience these games.  If you've never jumped into Metal Gear before, this collection comes at a very affordable price for the number of games you get with it.There isn't much need to discuss the story of Metal Gear here. In the first place, we'd be here all day just trying to discuss what it all means. And in the second place, the majority of you getting your hands on this have probably already experienced these games once before. I will only say that the story of the saga is absorbing, confusing and a lot of fun. Gamers have been absorbed by the themes of these games for quite some time, but experiencing them again isn't always so bad. The cutscenes are usually good. Some of them are a little long, but they're very well done. Complete with great voice acting, humor, drama and action. The cinematic experience of Metal Gear Solid is a jack of all trades.  This review assumes that you are at least somewhat familiar with the Metal Gear franchise.This particular collection comes with pretty much the entire saga all in one place.  You'll get the original Metal Gear Solid.  Metal Gear Solid 2: HD Edition, Metal Gear Solid 3: HD Edition, Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker HD Edition, two digital graphic novels, Metal Gear Solid 4: Trophy Edition, an artbook and download vouchers to get Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid VR Missions.  While I'd have much rather been given an actual disk for the original game and VR Missions, I'll make due with a code.  Because you are getting the HD Editions of Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3, it should be known that you will be getting the Substance and Subsistence versions respectively.  Meaning, dear fans, that yes, you can experience Metal Gear 1 and Metal Gear 2.  In short, you truly are getting the core of the saga.As such, it's also fun to see just how the games have really changed over time.  If you begin with the very first game and play all the way through to the fourth you'll notice that all of the games play strikingly different from one another.  The first Metal Gear Solid is a gem no matter what, but it's nice to take into account just how much the second game adds to it.  Likewise, the third game also has its own gameplay variety, some of which carries to the fourth game.  It's incredible to see just how Metal Gear has evolved over the past two decades and how their stories are told.  Obviously if you're getting this, you'll need to prepare yourself for some moments where you'll be watching a lot.  Metal Gear has a pretty dense story, even as far back as the first game.  This is especially true because future games have no shame in referencing older ones.There's a lot in this collection and for the price that's a pretty big value.  There's always the question of whether or not it's worth getting a new collection when the games within it have had previous releases.  It's hard to answer this question.  If you've yet to pick up the Metal Gear Solid Saga before then this is definitely the buy you should get.  You'll get the entire core story if you decide to go with this collection and you really can't beat that price in this regard.  On the other hand if you've already got the HD Collection and you've already downloaded the Metal Gear Solid on the PSN there isn't much else beyond the digital graphic novels and artbook that you're really going to get.  Certainly you get MGS4, but that's a pretty common find in almost any used game shop for a pretty cheap price.  It's not so much that these games have all gotten pretty recent releases, it's more so that their last release (the HD Collection) wasn't all that long ago and is still readily available in stores.  Personally, I find that for all you're getting it's a solid collection.  Not only is all the stuff in the HD collection here, but you get an artbook and two graphic novels as well as a voucher for the original Metal Gear Solid as well as VR missions.That voucher does bring about a minor issue for some, however.  The first and simplest is that if you bought the game used that voucher might not do you any good.  The other (and probably bigger) issue at hand is that if you bought Metal Gear Solid already the voucher won't do you any good.  For the sake of collector's value a physical disc of Metal Gear Solid and VR Missions might've actually been better.Nevertheless, on its own, the collection is probably one of the best collections you could get for Metal Gear Solid.  It's a pretty decent price for all that you're getting with it.  You might have to think for a moment if you've already got the HD Collection in your hands, but for the inclusion of the graphic novels, the downloads for the original Metal Gear Solid and VR Missions as well as the artbook, it might just be worth trading in your HD Collection and simply replacing it with this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25COJ31VBAS9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CTKHXFO#wasThisHelpful","R25COJ31VBAS9S","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Last of Us is a game worth experiencing.  And it's got a lot of collectibles and a lot of hidden goodies to explore within every area.  It's a rather nice change of pace in gaming.  So naturally, when you think of collectibles you probably also think that it would be nice to have a strategy guide to help you out in those situations.  The Last of Us Official Strategy guide is here to help.  It's a good guide overall and actually provides a lot of information about the game.  I do suggest, however, that the strategy guide be used on a second playthrough, and we'll talk about why shortly.The guide begins, as so many do, with a lot of the game basics.  There's actually reason for any newcomer to The Last of Us to spend time here.  While the game is more than willing to explain everything about it in easy tutorials, the guide is willing to explain the basics of everything and go a little further.  The Last of Us is a huge game and one that, at some point, really banks on you knowing what you're doing to get through.  The fact that all the basic survival and combat stuff is willing to be more than just a ""how to,"" guide all the time is rather nice.  Bradygames has always had a problem about talking about the difficulty settings, but with this guide you won't mind as much.  The authors note that the guide is written with the assumption that you are playing on Hard Mode (usually Bradygames writes their walkthroughs with the assumption you're playing on Normal).  The guide does talk about the basics of weapons here, but it doesn't quite give any suggestions of how to upgrade them in anyway.  It probably doesn't have to, but at least you know that all the basics of The Last of Us is covered in surprising detail.The enemies chapter is also pretty useful as it talks about the enemies in good detail as well.  There isn't much to say, but it does note certain things about them, such as how they attack and what you can expect from an attack.  Which is probably much more useful than specifically telling you how to go about it (though the guide is quick to point out this as well).  You will learn about your foes.  The walkthrough also calls out the new enemies as they appear.  But having this section is still going to be useful.Once we get to the walkthrough this is where the guide becomes truly useful in so many different ways.  Each section begins by showing you the chapter itself.  Beyond that there is always a chart that tells you what collectibles can be found in the chapter and what supplies you can find as well.  It also mentions the enemies you'll encounter within that chapter.  The maps showcased in each chapter as you arrive at new areas are invaluable.  They are incredibly detailed, pointing out every item in the area and being more than just wireframe maps.  A lot of guides fail to put a lot of detail into their maps, but here the maps are so well done that you won't find yourself disoriented if you walk away because they always make sure you know what scenery is around you and the like.  Players who hope to explore and pick up every last item in an area will probably find that the maps alone will suffice in helping you navigate through much of the game without actually reading much of the walkthrough.The walkthrough also points out any time you meet new characters.  It's got some good organization and a great layout in many respects.  They always point out collectibles as you meander through the world at hand.  Often times not just putting it in the main text of the walkthrough but actually having callouts.  They also highlight any new tutorials, enemies and items that pop up at any given time.  It's a really in depth walkthrough that helps get you through the game.  It's also complete with tons of screenshots to illustrate a lot of things.  It's unusual to see a Bradygames guide this well organized.  There is a lot of text, though, so you may spend a lot of time reading some parts rather than being engrossed in the game.The guide isn't without it's faults.  For instance, while I like that Bradygames played through hard mode, I still feel that for those who want to tackle higher difficulty settings the guide simply won't help them.  Survivor is a totally different beast from the other difficulty settings and Bradygames does nothing to really help the player prepare.  As is standard: They mention how you do less damage and how enemies do more... but there are some really important things they're missing out on by not having some kind of addendum for Survivor.  There are fewer items.  Meaning that items shown on the map might not necessarily be there on Survivor.  Since the maps correspond to Hard Mode this means that when playing survivor it's pointing out items that may not be there.  Likewise, this also means that there are MORE items in an area on Normal and Easy that the maps aren't pointing out either.  It's a good walkthrough and has some good strategies and maps, but Bradygames still isn't willing to go that extra mile that could help a player master the game as opposed to just learning as much of it as they can.All this amounts to a great strategy guide in the long run.  Anyone playing on Hard difficulty or lower will find a lot of use in its maps.  For those playing on Survivor (and if you are you probably know the game anyway) there isn't much the guide will do to help you prepare for that.There is one other problem with the walkthrough.  The information is sound.  The strategies are awesome, the guidance is good and those maps are probably the most valuable resource the guide has.  However, the walkthrough is very forward and direct that it WILL spoil major plot points.  It doesn't just detail what to do in an area, but also what will happen to you after you've done it.  This means for those hoping to avoid spoilers the guide has plenty of them and they won't be highlighted as spoilers.  The Last of Us is quite an engrossing game.  The story is really good and many a gamer probably shouldn't have it spoiled for them.  The walkthrough leaves no stone unturned, this includes any twists in the story and plot.  Don't take this to mean the guide isn't good.  It's a very good guide.  One that will help you uncover everything The Last of Us has to offer, it's just not shy about telling you what's going to happen.  As such I recommend it for a second playthrough.  It will help you find everything and for those who want to find everything it's going to do just that.  But the guide is also going to make sure you KNOW everything about the story as well.  If you're the type who doesn't like spoilers, save the guide for a second playthrough.However, even if you only wanted the guide to find all the collectibles, the guide did make sure to include a separate chapter in case you didn't want to go searching through the walkthrough.  It's very well organized and shows you everything without giving away anything to the plot.  For those who also want to know, there is also a Tags and Trophy guide in the event that you just want to know those things as well, complete with strategies and commentary.  Meaning that even with spoilers, those who want to find everything can still do so without fear of the experience being ruined.  The guide is good for a quick reference as well as those looking for more in depth descriptions.The guide also has a huge section dedicated to talking about the various factions you'll see as well.  It provides much of the same info as the walkthrough itself.  It treats Factions as though it is a separate game, going over the basics all over again.  But everything that's great about the walkthrough is still really good here.For those wondering, there's not much difference in picking up the Limited Edition Guide or the Standard Edition.  The Content in both guides is exactly the same.  Both guides are the same length.  There are only two distinct differences.  The Limited Edition guide comes with a Firefly Keychain and is in hardcover.  That's the only difference.  Three's no ""extra content,"" in the Limited Edition Guide.  And you won't find anything in the Limited Edition guide that you won't find in the standard.  It just has a hardcover and keychain.The Last of Us is a pretty amazing game on its own, so it's nice to see that it also has a relatively amazing strategy guide to go with it.  It leaves no stone unturned and often provides all the information you need to go through any one area.  For those hoping to find everything The Last of Us has to offer, this is a good strategy guide to help you out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SJIA78JUV5ME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0744014581#wasThisHelpful","R1SJIA78JUV5ME","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nintendo Power doesn't make strategy guides anymore.  This has been true for a long time.  And when Prima first began making guides for Nintendo I wasn't quite sure what to think.  They've improved a great deal over time  The original Donkey Kong Country Returns guide was one of those guides.  In particular, when Nintendo has a side scrolling platformer released, Prima has consistently done a good job making good strategy guides for them.  Here it's just as good.For those who are curious, this guide is pretty much the same as the one released for the Wii version of the game.  The exception, of course, being that it covers the new levels that are here.  But aside from that the content is more or less the same.  If you still have the Wii version of the guide it'll suffice, save for covering the new levels.  With that in mind, let's talk about this guide a little bit.There isn't much to actually say about Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D.  The guide begins as so many do with the breakdown of the controls and the game basics.  Things you'll probably come to understand on your own with or without the guides help.  On one hand, beginners probably should start here as it will help them better get acquainted.  I suppose it's not necessary but if for some reason you do need it, there it is.  Donkey Kong Country Returns is pretty inviting on its own, pretty much teaching the player how to play within the first couple of levels.The walkthrough is where the guide is at its most helpful.  Each area begins by showing you maps.  The maps will point out everything.  All the DK barrels, the secrets and the lives.  Everything you need.  It's done using the familiar waypoint system that Prima has adapted from Nintendo Power.  That is to say that if you look on the maps and see a ""1"" on the map, you then need to find ""1"" in the text and read about what to do there.  Usually it's accompanied by a screenshot or two.  In particular, the guide will always make sure to call out things like the puzzle pieces or the KONG letters.  It's a pretty simple guide to use.  It's primarily a visual guide, however.  You'll probably be looking back to the maps constantly.  And while the maps are detailed they can feel a bit confusing at times.  Particularly in moments where you can blast off into the background of a level.  The maps are detailed in and of themselves and should help any player.As it does use a way point system, however, this means that players needn't expect the guide to be too handholding.  Meaning, it's not going to tell you how to get from Point 1 on the map to Point 2.  It just assumes you'll be able to do this on your own.  Likewise the boss strategies are usually pretty straightforward.There isn't much that actually keeps the guide down.  In fact, it's near perfect in every way.  It teaches the player the game and guides them without feeling like it's holding your hand too much in the process and still letting you enjoy the experience of the game for yourself.  If you're the type that has to collect everything and need to know where hidden passages and such are, then yes, by all means pick up this strategy guide.  It's sure to help any player that hopes to uncover everything Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D has to offer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S6220BVJ5AZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804161496#wasThisHelpful","R3S6220BVJ5AZQ","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:+A really compelling story with some really compelling characters+Gorgeous environments really bring the world to life+A great soundtrack+Fantastic voice acting+Often engaging gameplay that limits the player enough to make them consider their options, but provides enough that there are a variety of different ways to go about a situationThe Bad:-The Story will feel sluggish at timesNaughty Dog hit it out of the park with the Uncharted games.  They were good quality games that were not just great in cinematic quality, but also in interactive quality.  Beautifully bending the interactive touch of a video game with the cinematic trappings of a good adventure film.  Sure there were moments when it was over-the-top and surreal, but they were good fun and delivered interesting characters and stories.  The Last of Us strives to aim a lot higher than Uncharted, however. Instead of being an outright adventure, The Last of Us reaches a lot higher, is bolder and may be the best thing Naughty Dog has ever put out as a developer thus far.You play as Joel, a man who survived the end of the world.  Twenty years after a parasitic fungus turned the world into a wasteland, Joel and few other humans are out for survival.  And The Last of Us never lets you forget your goal is to survive.  Joel and his ally Tess spend a lot of time trading goods with survivors outside of the city to make a living and to survive.  Soon Joel is tasked with smuggling a teenage girl named Ellie to a band only known as The Fireflies.  Joel agrees and thus the adventure of The Last of Us truly begins.  The story is great, but only because the characters within it are great.  The Last of Us makes no bones about what it is.  It's a game that takes place in a dreary future where there is only one rule: To survive.  You don't know if you can trust the people you meet.  As the game is quick to point out that everyone is out to serve their own ends.  Small factions have formed among humans, but more than that, Joel and his allies (and enemies) must beware the infected who are also lurking around.The story may be a bit slow, but it wastes no time trying to really develop characters.  Like Uncharted many of the best moments are when the characters are simply having casual conversation amongst one another.  Unlike Uncharted, though, the tone is a lot more bleak.  It's a world that's been ravaged and ransacked and it shows.  There is still humor from time to time, but the game never lets you forget just how the world is.  The interactions between Joel and Ellie in particular are quite moving and telling of who they are.  It's very hard not to care about them and their struggles.  And The Last of Us has no issue pulling on your heart strings.  It sets the tone and press forward unapologetically.The Last of Us is a pretty big game in and of itself.  By comparison, the Uncharted games are a pretty linear affair.  You'll never get lost or never know where to go in those games.  The Last of Us isn't exactly non-linear, but there's a greater emphasis on exploring your environment for supplies, ammo and health.  You'll rarely be confused on where to go or what to do, but if you're not taking the time to properly explore your locale you may that The Last of Us can be a challenging experience nonetheless.  This is primarily because combat can (and often does) demand a lot of the player.  Survival is the name of the game and The Last of Us keeps this in mind.  Ammo is scarce a lot of the time.  Just because it seems like you're finding a lot, doesn't mean it can't all be depleted in the next encounter.  It's not unusual to use up entire ammo supplies in one encounter and be left to nothing but your supplies and fists in another.  If you aren't willing to balance some of it out, The Last of Us can be challenging.The good news is that checkpoints are quite frequent throughout the experience.  Should the worst befall you in any given situation you usually don't start too far from where it all happened.  This often times means that you can try other strategies without too much worry.Exploring the environments is much more important than the game itself is willing to let on.  While not every nook and cranny is actually crawling with infected or bad guys, you still need to search.  This is especially true because The Last of Us is very serious about it's survival instincts.  You'll find parts that can be used to create support weapons or items to heal you, but never both.  You also can't load up on stocks and constantly save them as the game only allows you to carry around a very limited quantity.  And everything the game wants you to do is done in real time.  You CAN pause the game, but none of your crafting or looking at artifacts you may find in this world or using health packs can be done from a pause menu.  Instead it's all done in real time, which puts a greater emphasis on finding safety when you can.  You'll have to craft while enemies could be bearing down on your or still be within the area.  You'll have to apply a health pack under the same circumstances.  This means in the midst of a firefight this is probably going to be difficult to do.  But when you have down time you'll relish the chance to prepare yourself for what may be lurking around the next corner.  This also means that when you can, you'll be more than tempted to explore each and every environment around you.The combat is often smooth and keeps you on your toes.  Many instances can feel overwhemling.  This is especially true if you are very reckless with your supplies and find yourself lacking them for the next encounter.  Enemies often rush you with reckless abandon.  There is time to think and react, but no doubt you'll bite the bullet more than enough times on your first play through.  Luckily the game gives you means by which to change or deepen the experience.  When crouching, Joel can increase his sense of hearing and plan accordingly.  You can often get an idea of where enemies this way.  Likewise, if enemies haven't noticed you, you can go for stealth kills or (if you're really bold) try to sneak by entirely.  The game encourages you to experiment, letting you know there isn't always a right way to go about anything.  Don't expect your downed enemies to be riddled with extra supplies, however.  They rarely (if ever) drop anything.  Again, there's a neat little dynamic about The Last of Us as a result of all of this.  Very few players will experience the game in the same way twice.  The way you utilize your supplies often results in different play styles and experiences.  Some players will find themselves forced into melee combat, while others will choose to do so in fear that they might not actually find supplies later.  And sure enough, no matter how much you comb over some environments, it's actually quite easy to miss items.If there's one thing that can almost always be said about Naughty Dog, it's that they certainly know how to make a good looking game.  The environments in The Last of Us look absolutely amazing.  The world has a pulse and comes to life like so few video game worlds do.  You'll find graffiti on walls that you can read, wanted poster, remnants of an old civilization are everywhere.  Ransacked homes, broken televisions, destroyed buildings.  The Last of Us is unapologetic about it's style and what it strives to convey.  Nothing showcases this better than the environments in which the game takes place in.  The world doesn't just look like a typical post apocalyptic world.  It actually looks like someone's living in it too.  In particular watching the prologue and then watching as it shifts showcases how much care and attention was actually put into each environments.  But perhaps the best part about The Last of Us, is that the atmosphere rarely drops.  The feeling of dread is surrounding the player much of the time.  Not just because of how it all looks, but because of how it also plays.  This idea that you might not have enough ammo for the next encounter.  There will be moments in which the player may be feeling anxious or even unprepared for certain situations as a result.  The end result is that you get a game where survival really is the root of it all as opposed to a game that often asks the player to run in guns blazing.  You CAN do this in The Last of Us if you so choose to, but it's quite clear there is something discouraging about doing so.The production values are good on another level as well.  The voice acting and sound are all phenomenal.  The sound effects are startlingly real.  The most rewarding part, however, is easily the soundtrack, which sounds nothing short of fantastic.  Often times it sets the mood perfectly, as well as provides a certain amount of comfort, dread and loneliness that some of the characters most certainly feel.  It's a well crafted and beautiful soundtrack overall.The Last of Us was a game that had high expectations upon it's announcement.  Not just coming out after Naughty Dog's success with Uncharted, but also at the onset of a new generation of consoles.  It delivers on multiple fronts.  If anything The Last of Us can feel a little sluggish at times.  This is especially true in the beginning when the game is teaching you how to play it and show you the ropes.  The Last of Us will take its sweet little time setting the stage for what is to unfold, and for some gamers it will undoubtedly test their patience.  Stick with it, however and the game comes to a point where it simply keeps getting bigger and better.Simply put, The Last of Us is a pretty bold game.  It's more than just another run of the mill shooter.  It's attention to detail and character make it a gaming experience worth having.  If you have a PS3 it is definitely worth a look.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KLK92C5B1O5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007CM0K86#wasThisHelpful","R2KLK92C5B1O5A","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1994, Rare developed a little game called Donkey Kong Country that became a huge smash on the Super Nintendo. It went on to sell millions of copies and was even followed up by two sequels. After the Donkey Kong Country trilogy came we were subjected to Donkey Kong 64 and then numerous strange games that seemed to feature Donkey Kong, but not exactly play like Donkey Kong. Thus, when Donkey Kong Country Returns first came out, it was easy to be excited. Because it was the first time in a over a decade that we got the chance to play a traditional Donkey Kong Country game and the results are fantastic.  When it was released on the Wii in 2010 it was hailed as an instant classic.  Now the game is getting a 3DS port and it's still pretty good.The original game followed the tale of Donkey Kong. His bananas were taken by King K. Rool and Donkey Kong had to go out, along with Diddy Kong, to get them back. Donkey Kong Country Returns goes back to that. But instead of King K. Rool and Kremlings it's a bunch of Tiki's that have done this. It's actually very hard NOT to miss the Kremlings. Especially in a Donkey Kong game that's supposed to be a return to things. But you won't mind too much because the level designs and the challenge this game evokes is absolutely fantastic.You'll go by on a world map from one level to the next completing them in an effort to get back your bananas from those Tiki's. They all start off rather easy at first, teaching you basic things and hoping you can keep up with all you've been taught. The first two worlds in particular are cake walks but once you get to world 3 things really pick up and start to become challenging. The gameplay is extremely familiar to anyone who played the original Donkey Kong Country games from a long time ago. You'll run and jump on your enemies, and you'll find hidden barrels and passages that'll take you to bonus rooms where you can reap the rewards. Every level also has puzzle pieces that you'll want to collect.There are a few things that have changed, however. The first is how your partner works. In the original games you could switch between Donkey and Diddy. And when one took a hit, he immediately ran away and the partner picked up the slack. After that one more hit meant the loss of a life. Here, both Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong have hearts. And Diddy will always be on Donkey Kong's back. Always. You won't be able to switch to him at all. But he will allow you to hover for a short period of time. Once you lose your first two hearts you lose Diddy and your ability to hover briefly. Until you find a DK barrel and get him back. Donkey Kong also has two hearts, and once lost the level ends. The level design here has made Donkey Kong Country Returns quite difficult, but fun and manageable. You'll find some moments of trial and error. But they're some well crafted levels that never throw the same thing at you twice. Even familiar levels will always have new tweaks. The first mine car level is basic. But there's one down the line that has you having to stay inside a giant while until it crumbles away. It is AMAZING stuff. The boss battles are also amazing and require a lot of pattern recognition. There's a lot of variety to each level. Couple that with the fact that some levels have you going into the background and foreground and there's a lot to do and explore in just about every level (not to mention this aspect looks pretty good in 3D). The game provides a challenge, but like so many of Nintendo's games that do in this day and age, it makes sure that extra lives are scattered everywhere. Just in case. Even if you ARE having problems, you're still not likely to see a game over screen any time soon based on the abundance lives.There are other moments that breathe of Donkey Kong Country. A lot of the music you here is simply remixed from the original Donkey Kong Country and it sounds brilliant and sometimes even sets the atmosphere. It's likely to fill long time fans with nostalgia.That's not to say it's all nostalgic though. There are some things that were either left on the cutting room floor. For instance, there are no real animal buddies here and that's a shame. You won't find some of your favorites like Rambi the Rhino or anything like that. For the most part Donkey Kong Country Returns doesn't really feature them. The other thing is that a lot of the Kong family isn't really there either. Part of the fun and charm of some of the other games was running into some of the ohter Kong's such as Wrinkly or Funky or Cranky. And while Cranky Kong returns, it's not with some of his clever fourth wall breaking ""we know we're in a video game,"" banter that he used to always have that made him such a comical character in the Super Nintendo classics.The Wii version of Donkey Kong Country Returns didn't have the best control scheme.  Thanks to making you waggle the Wii Remote to perform certain actions (like rolling) it was a little too sensitive and sometimes caused the player to perform actions they didn't want to.  Here, everything is mapped to a button.  And in a game this challenging you'll definitely appreciate it.Donkey Kong Country Returns also has a multiplayer function similar to New Super Mario Bros. Wii. One player controls Donkey Kong and the other controls Diddy Kong. It's the only time you really can control Diddy manually. You'll have to work together, but unlike New Super Mario Bros. Wii, there isn't much fun in messing around with your friends. The focus here is strictly teamwork and it holds to that. The game is a challenge and the last thing you'd want to do is mess up your partner who could potentially be carrying you through a level anyway.Apparently many a gamer must've thought the Wii version was too much of a challenge.  Indeed, there is an option here to make the game easier for players just jumping in.  True enough, Donkey Kong Country Returns actually is quite the challenge.  It takes a lot to really master a certain level.  You can make the game easier, and it'll give you some additional hearts as well as some new items available to you.  Make no mistake, Donkey Kong Country Returns lives up to its reputation of being a challenging game, but it's a good challenge.  If you do mess up too many times, however, the game will play through the level for you (although it will not grab any bonuses throughout).The other big question is always whether or not there's something new when a port comes around.  Donkey Kong Country Returns has a whole new world you can through on the the 3D release.  It's just barely enough of a curiosity to Wii Owners to make it worth trying, but it might not be enough to make it worth picking up just yet.  Aside from that the game is primarily the same.  The only real problem with 3DS port is that the game doesn't seem like it was made to be experienced on the small screen.  Sometimes it's hard to see just what hit you in some instance.  Eventually you'll get the gist, but you might suffer unnecessarily as a result.Visually Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D is a very pretty game.  Mostly the environments and the backgrounds.  The ability to go into the background or (sometimes) foreground is certainly not bad either.  The 3D is actually good for moments like these.  On the other hand, there's nothing the 3D will add to the gameplay.  You could just as easily do well with it off.  Despite that the game looks good in 3D there's nothing about it that will wholly immerse you in the experience.  Like many 3DS games you'll probably turn the 3D off after a while.There's always a wonder about whether or not to get the older version or the new.  The new world is certainly a curious thing and Wii Owners may like the idea of a more classic control scheme, but I'm finding it hard to say you'd need this version if you've already played the Wii version.  There are new levels but there aren't exactly a lot of new levels.  There isn't much you'll experience here that you didn't experience before.  On the other hand, if you've never played Donkey Kong Country Returns and you're curious, it's probably better to go with the 3DS variant.  The choice is yours.If you were a fan of the original Donkey Kong Country games then by all means play Donkey Kong Country Returns. If you never played them before and you just want to jump in, there's nothing to stop you this time around. It's a fun game, just one that can be pretty difficult. But that's not such a bad thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R949BGHZOVIH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQI3UQG#wasThisHelpful","R949BGHZOVIH0","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Who'd have thought that the best of the Resident Evil titles released in 2012 was the 3DS game: Resident Evil Revelations?  The experience was so good, evoking so much of what made Resident Evil so good in the first place that at the time I felt it was a shame that so few fans were going to be able to experience it.  At the time of the original release, the 3DS didn't have a huge install base.  Now that it has gotten a release on consoles, fans can finally experience one of the best Resident Evil games around.  Resident Evil Revelations is a fantastic experience.Set before the events of Resident Evil 5, Revelations focuses on the BSAA. A counter Bio-Terrorism group started by Chris and Jill. Our game begins when Jill and her partner Parker, sail out to the Mediterranean. They've lost contact with Chris and his partner Jessica and their last known coordinates were there. When they arrive they find a cruise ship, the Queen Zenobia, strangely abandoned. And soon it becomes apparent why. There are Bio Organic Weapons (B.O.W.s) running around all over the ship. One of the things that made some of the earliest Resident Evil games amusing was that there was a mystery at play. A sort of, ""What's going on?"" feeling to the game. Resident Evil Revelations has this in strides as the plot is actually extremely engrossing. There's a lot of mystery and suspense. And the stories are intertwined as we're introduced to new characters and situations that can, at times, take surprising turns. The story is just all around amazing.  At first it feels a little jumpy by introducing so many different plot points, but it actually all weaves together fairly well and makes for a good story.As you go exploring the various environments you find yourself in, you'll come face to face with several enemies that are usually dispensed with your trusty weapon. Aiming and shooting is similar to Resident Evil 4. You can take aim at various parts of the body, and when your enemies stagger you can go in for a quick melee attack. If you've kept up with the series since the fourth installment then this will be familiar to you. You can also strife while aiming, but chances are you'll find it much better to pop an enemy a couple of times, retreat and then pop them again. There are, however a few things added to the game itself that keep it interesting. You'll do a lot of running and gunning, but one of the most unique items your given is an item only known as Genesis, which you can use to scan several areas for hidden items or data on your enemies. It's hard not to go into a room and use it. The rewards are usually finding more ammo or precious herbs to heal your wounds.  On the 3DS the controls were pretty precise and tight, but the use of a second analog stick makes the controls a lot better in the console version.  You can play in the ""classic"" sense, which maps out the controls to be fairly similar to Resident Evil 4.  I don't particularly recommend this.  The ""classic"" controls feel more restrictive.  You can't rotate the camera and in some moments in Revelations you're definitely going to want to.There aren't many puzzles in Resident Evil Revelations at all. There are moments where you'll have to move a few circuits around, but they're hardly mind-bending moments. It's much more about the gunplay here and there's an emphasis put on that. You'll not only find weapons but also custom parts for those weapons that will make them more powerful, or fire faster or perhaps might help them do a better job of stunning your enemies. You can mix and match all you like and apply them to any type of weapon you want.After running through so many Resident Evil games, it's a wonder if Resident Evil can actually be scary anymore. Well, not really. But Revelations has various ways of trying to be scary. The first and most obvious is the atmosphere. Especially on the Queen Zenobia. Hallways are suspiciously empty, music hits some really eerie notes, and sometimes you'll find dead bodies or see some enemies pop out as you run by. Resident Evil has been doing these things since the very first installment and it's hard to be creeped out by the billionth enemy popping out at you when you've been exposed to that for seventeen years now. In spite of the atmosphere and the mystery given by various documents you'll find through the game, Resident Evil Revelations isn't going to scare anyone. You have to give credit to the game for trying at least. It does this in other ways as well. You'll find various keys to unlock locked doors, find yourself backtracking through previous rooms only to find them repopulated with new horror, and sometimes you'll find yourself wondering if you'll survive. All this is compounded by some very well done set pieces. Early on, for instance, you'll find yourself unable to stand as a pack of mutated dogs set their sights on you. It's a very tense moment where you, the player, may actually begin to feel just a little frightened you won't survive. Moments like this make you feel as though Resident Evil is returning to its roots. So at the very least Revelations tries to be scary and give you a sense of fear. It basically tries to take the best of the two styles of Resident Evil and mesh them together. The atmosphere and mystery is inspired by the early installments while the gunplay is drawn from the latter ones. It's a well put together hybrid. Just don't expect it to scare the pants off you.No matter who the game has you play as, you'll always have a partner, and this is perhaps the most glaring shortcoming that Revelations has. The rest of the game is great and it's other flaws forgivable, but when it comes to your partner, CAPCOM still hasn't made a competent one. They won't spend time wasting your resources like Sheva in Resident Evil 5, but a lot of the time they just stand there doing nothing. They rarely even shoot at your enemies, and most times they just follow you around like a confused puppy. If they did a little more such as point out objectives or even tried to battle a little more it wouldn't be so bad. The only use your AI partner really has is soaking up damage on your behalf.  The good news is that they can't die.  They can take as much damage as they need to.  They may be useless, but you are not in a position where you must babysit them.There are a few things about the 3DS version that I do miss to some degree.  While it's always easy to switch between your weapons and subweapons using the D-Pad, I do miss that all my inventory management is no longer on a bottom screen.  It doesn't clutter the heads up display, but on the 3DS it was easy to be immersed because the top screen where all the action took place was completely clean.  It made for a more immersive experience.There are other differences between the consoles and 3DS versions of the game aside from the hardware.  For one, load times are more noticeable.  While even the 3DS version had to load new areas causing severe dips in framerate (which isn't a big deal, you're in no real danger during these times) it's kind of strange that powerful consoles have to take a moment to load up some of the pre-rendered cutscenes where as the 3DS has little problem transitioning into them almost seamlessly.  Likewise, while the console version has a lovely HD remaster you can definitely tell that it was made for the smaller screen.  When blown up quite a bit of the game looks really good and detailed, but you can definitely see some blemishes that were not really noticeable on the 3DS version of the game.  The game looks good, but sometimes it looks better on the 3DS (where those blemishes don't stand out as much) and runs better on the 3DS (where you aren't interrupted nearly as much by ""Now Loading"" screens).The most noticeable difference between the versions, however, is that the console versions offer a new difficulty setting: Infernal Mode.  This is a lot more than just increasing how powerful enemies are.  This puts entirely new sets of enemies in some parts of the game.  You'll encounter the strongest of enemies a lot sooner.  For those really wanting to test their skills, this new difficulty setting is certainly worth a try.The original 3DS version had another mode called Raid Mode.  This mode returns.  It's a co-op mode that sends you through about twenty different missions killing your way through enemies, trying to earn the highest score and upgrading your equipment along the way.  Raid Mode is highly addictive if you're one who really loves the gunplay.  You may even find yourself spending more time here than you do in the main campaign.  Mostly because it also has difficulty settings and it changes up the enemies and how many you'll find on each difficulty setting.  It's almost like getting an entirely separate game along with the main campaign.  It's very fun and being able to really customize your weapons and level up makes Raid Mode worth playing.  You can play solo or you can go online with a friend (or stranger).  The only downside to Raid Mode, really, is that the co-op can only be done online.  It's a shame that there is no split screen multiplayer.  There isn't a lot added to Raid Mode, however.  There are a couple more costumes and a new character to play as, but not a lot of additions.  Don't think you can just jump in, however.  In order to access everything Raid Mode has to offer you'll have to complete the main campaign.All this makes Resident Evil Revelations a near perfect package of content.  The campaign is a good length and Raid Mode has such an enormous fun factor that you'll find yourself playing through the missions several times on end.  As with every reissue of a game, however, the big question is whether or not you should buy it if you already have the original game.  If you already have it on the 3DS the idea of a whole new difficulty setting and a couple of extra costumes in Raid Mode might not be enough to justify a fifty dollar price tag to those who already have the 3DS version.  On the other hand, if you've never played it before (or lack a 3DS) then it's not such a bad idea to grab it.If you've never taken the time to play Resident Evil: Revelations then now is probably a good time to do so.  It's a good game that provides some of the aspects about Resident Evil we used to love so much, while keeping some of the new gameplay enhancements there to keep it from being dated.  Resident Evil: Revelations is a good game that no Resident Evil fan should miss.  If you've already got the 3DS version, however, there isn't much reason to rush out and buy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WDGR4D8703EL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B59L9VO#wasThisHelpful","R2WDGR4D8703EL","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Resident Evil Revelations has been in the gaming spectrum for over a year now.  The 3DS version never actually got a strategy guide.  It might've helped for things like hand prints or maps, but for the most part the game itself was actually quite straightforward.  The console versions do have a guide.  It can be used for the 3DS as well.  It's a good guide too.  One that will be most useful to players.The guide begins with an introduction that is there to get you acquainted with the characters and the story so far.  Also providing a small table for a timeline.  If you are a Resident Evil fan this isn't going to be of any use to you at all.  If you're new there's nothing wrong with this, but it still won't mean anything to you.  There are then character profiles to help you get to know the characters.  Once we get beyond this the game is willing to teach you all the basics.  This stuff can be quite useful, actually.  Much of it is also about using the guide itself.The bestiary, however, is going to be very valuable.  It points out every enemies weakspot, tells you which weapons are best for taking them on and also gives you some tactics on how to do it.  There is a run down of the weapons as well, including how to acquire them and what they do.  Not quite as useful as the enemies list, but still pretty good.The walkthrough is where the guide is at its best.  Each section begins by showing you a map and all the items in the area.  It's a little annoying to constantly flip back to the basics to find out what the symbols mean, but you'll learn them on your own eventually.  The walkthrough is well organized and straightforward, often pointing out some pretty decent strategies.  What you'll want it for more than anything, however, is finding everything.  It shows you where all the hidden items are with Genesis.  But what you'll really want is the info on where all the handprints are.  And the guide is more than willing to call them out.  First on the maps, then in the text in the walkthrough... and finally in an appendix in the back.  Lastly, the guide is pretty good about the boss strategies and recommending upgrades for your weapons.  It's all highlighted with great screenshots as well.  It's a pretty decent guide overall.After all this, there is a lot the guide provides for Raid Mode.  Including tables of all the upgrades and general strategies while also making sure you know everything about the costumes and what they do.  There's also a monster list here that shows the multipliers of the enemies when they come in their special varieties.  The Raid Mode also provides some much needed maps.  The only real downside is that they don't really provide any strategies.  They provide maps for each difficulty setting (Chasm, Trench and Abyss) but no real strategy.  This is probably not a big deal.One thing to note, however, is that while the walkthrough will certainly suffice for the 3DS version of the game, it will be of no use at all when it comes to Raid Mode for 3DS players.  As enemy groups are different from what they were on the 3DS version.  For instance, while many of chasms levels are the same, once you get beyond that initial difficulty, much of what the guide shows you in the walkthrough and tells you about enemy groups is based on the PS3 and XBOX360 version of the game.  This is compounded by the fact that the console versions have a great deal more custom parts and different ""perks"" on the weapons that come automatically (""Speed Shot"" ""Light Weight,"" etc.).  It's to be expected as the guide was made to cover the console and not actually the 3DS version to begin with.While it may not be a big deal not to cover the levels on their own beyond maps, you do somewhat wish that they did, however.  Mainly because once you get beyond the chasm difficulty setting, it helps to be a bit more prepared to know what's around the next corner.  What is very useful however, is the bestiary for Raid Mode.  In particular because it can be used to really help get you through certain levels by knowing which enemies are weak to what.  But again, more coverage might've been needed.  For instance, the guide could've told players that instead of just expecting say... a Scagdead, it might've done well to mention that a ""Boss Scagdead,"" was going to show up.  It doesn't.  Raid Mode is as basic as it gets on coverage, and it's not exactly bad that it is.  You know the enemies and the layout and sometimes that's all that's needed, but once you start really getting into Raid Mode and moving up, you start to wish they'd done just a little bit more.In the past I've been quite harsh on Bradygames for more or less never wanting to go the extra mile.  They talk about how they have a complete walkthrough while simultaneously ignoring changes in difficulty settings.  They brag about covering trophies and achievements while basically copying and pasting the trophy list.  Here it's actually different.  If you're reading the walkthrough Bradygames made sure you KNOW when something significantly different is coming on the Infernal Difficulty setting, for instance.  It's also even in red font to let you know.  They do this quite a bit.  Even noting when some items may be in a different place.  They don't just do this for Infernal Mode.  If something is different on the 3DS it'll tell you that too.  Even their trophy/achievement guide actually has strategies for getting some of the trophy/achievements in the game.It's rare when a Bradygames guide goes this far in helping one unearth every crevice of the game.  Yet here, there's nothing left to just the devices of the gamer.  If you want to find everything and really get to know the game, you'll do it with this guide.  It's just about perfect for Resident Evil: Revelations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LTSPYKVKBZGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0744014921#wasThisHelpful","R1LTSPYKVKBZGV","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The atmosphere and mystery is inspired by the early installments while the gunplay is drawn from the latter ones. It's a well put together hybrid. Just don't expect it to scare the pants off you.No matter who the game has you play as, you'll always have a partner, and this is perhaps the most glaring shortcoming that Revelations has. The rest of the game is great and it's other flaws forgivable, but when it comes to your partner, CAPCOM still hasn't made a competent one. They won't spend time wasting your resources like Sheva in Resident Evil 5, but a lot of the time they just stand there doing nothing. They rarely even shoot at your enemies, and most times they just follow you around like a confused puppy. If they did a little more such as point out objectives or even tried to battle a little more it wouldn't be so bad. The only use your AI partner really has is soaking up damage on your behalf.  The good news is that they can't die.  They can take as much damage as they need to.  They may be useless, but you are not in a position where you must babysit them.There are a few things about the 3DS version that I do miss to some degree.  While it's always easy to switch between your weapons and subweapons using the D-Pad, I do miss that all my inventory management is no longer on a bottom screen.  It doesn't clutter the heads up display, but on the 3DS it was easy to be immersed because the top screen where all the action took place was completely clean.  It made for a more immersive experience.There are other differences between the consoles and 3DS versions of the game aside from the hardware.  For one, load times are more noticeable.  While even the 3DS version had to load new areas causing severe dips in framerate (which isn't a big deal, you're in no real danger during these times) it's kind of strange that powerful consoles have to take a moment to load up some of the pre-rendered cutscenes where as the 3DS has little problem transitioning into them almost seamlessly.  Likewise, while the console version has a lovely HD remaster you can definitely tell that it was made for the smaller screen.  When blown up quite a bit of the game looks really good and detailed, but you can definitely see some blemishes that were not really noticeable on the 3DS version of the game.  The game looks good, but sometimes it looks better on the 3DS (where those blemishes don't stand out as much) and runs better on the 3DS (where you aren't interrupted nearly as much by ""Now Loading"" screens).The most noticeable difference between the versions, however, is that the console versions offer a new difficulty setting: Infernal Mode.  This is a lot more than just increasing how powerful enemies are.  This puts entirely new sets of enemies in some parts of the game.  You'll encounter the strongest of enemies a lot sooner.  For those really wanting to test their skills, this new difficulty setting is certainly worth a try.The original 3DS version had another mode called Raid Mode.  This mode returns.  It's a co-op mode that sends you through about twenty different missions killing your way through enemies, trying to earn the highest score and upgrading your equipment along the way.  Raid Mode is highly addictive if you're one who really loves the gunplay.  You may even find yourself spending more time here than you do in the main campaign.  Mostly because it also has difficulty settings and it changes up the enemies and how many you'll find on each difficulty setting.  It's almost like getting an entirely separate game along with the main campaign.  It's very fun and being able to really customize your weapons and level up makes Raid Mode worth playing.  You can play solo or you can go online with a friend (or stranger).  The only downside to Raid Mode, really, is that the co-op can only be done online.  It's a shame that there is no split screen multiplayer.  There isn't a lot added to Raid Mode, however.  There are a couple more costumes and a new character to play as, but not a lot of additions.  Don't think you can just jump in, however.  In order to access everything Raid Mode has to offer you'll have to complete the main campaign.With the console version of Raid Mode, it's important to note that the experience is completely different from the 3DS counterpart in several ways.  The first is that there are far more upgrades that you can find and use throughout the Raid Mode experience.  New custom parts means that there are very different ways to play.  Yes the maps are the same, but all the new editions in this regard will make the experience wholly different for any player who experienced Raid Mode on the 3DS.  Likewise, there are now weapons that come with inherint custom parts.  You might find a weapon in a level that has a ""Light Weight"" characteristic.  This means your character will run faster, reload faster... but the gun might have a reduced firing power in light of having greater speed overall.  This makes Raid Mode a much different experience.  The same can also be said for enemy layouts.  If you had this game on the 3DS and you were a pro at Raid Mode the console version is going to be a different experience overall.  Especially as you go into higher difficulty settings.  Enemy layouts are also different in many levels.  The addition to being able to use a microphone is also a welcome.  But perhaps the biggest difference to the co-op play on multiplayer is that characters can now go into a ""dying"" state where you have a chance to revive them before an enemy does them in for good.  This doesn't mean you won't die at all on Raid Mode, but it does mean that playing on co-op has more benefits than it did in the 3DS version.  Lastly, there are no recommended levels to tackle a level on.  And playing through a mission at these levels (or lower) rewards better experience.  The experience of Raid Mode is going to feel fresh and new even to those who mastered the 3DS variation of it and that alone might make it worthwhile to pick up for those who already played through the game.All this makes Resident Evil Revelations a near perfect package of content.  The campaign is a good length and Raid Mode has such an enormous fun factor that you'll find yourself playing through the missions several times on end.  As with every reissue of a game, however, the big question is whether or not you should buy it if you already have the original game.  If you already have it on the 3DS the idea of a whole new difficulty setting and a couple of extra costumes in Raid Mode might not be enough to justify a fifty dollar price tag to those who already have the 3DS version.  On the other hand, if you've never played it before (or lack a 3DS) then it's not such a bad idea to grab it.  There is one reason to pick up the console version if you already have the 3DS version, however, and that's Raid Mode.  As I said, the experience is actually quite different here.  And if you found yourself addicted to Raid Mode on the 3DS then you should try the console version of Raid Mode because it's a completely different (sometimes better) experience.If you've never taken the time to play Resident Evil: Revelations then now is probably a good time to do so.  It's a good game that provides some of the aspects about Resident Evil we used to love so much, while keeping some of the new gameplay enhancements there to keep it from being dated.  Resident Evil: Revelations is a good game that no Resident Evil fan should miss.  If you've already got the 3DS version, however, there isn't much reason to rush out and buy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BQIVCS1VIL9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B59L9T6#wasThisHelpful","R2BQIVCS1VIL9H","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1999 when the original Soulcalibur debuted on the Dreamcast, it was quickly hailed as one of the greatest fighting games ever made (some would say the greatest).  Since then, Soulcalibur has been a staple in the fighting game genre, giving us interesting characters, who often have interesting stories and giving us an easy to grasp concept of fighting.  Soulcalibur is one of the few fighting games that is inviting to both newcomers and experts alike.  With the series reaching incredible heights right out of the gate, it was only a matter of time before an entry came up short of greatness.  Soulcalibur V is, indeed, a fun game, but you'd have to be a real hardcore fighter to really get your moneys worth out of it.To many people, the story in a fighting game isn't that important.  But fans of such games as the newer Mortal Kombat and BlazBlue would probably disagree.  Even fighting games have good storylines and can have good complex characters.  This was one of the hallmarks of Soulcalibur.  It had an interesting story and provided us with interesting characters.  Characters each had their own profiles and backstories that told you about them and why they were in pursuit of Soul Edge.  Either to destroy it (as Xianghua, Kilik and Sophitia were) or to obtain it for their own desires (Nightmare and Cervantes come to mind).  Small snippets in their profile made the characters somewhat interesting.  The personalized endings only added to this as well as learning about the relationship they had with other characters.  Soulcalibur III in particular, gave characters a well done story mode that really could add depth to some characters.  Soulcalibur IV more or less threw its story under the bus.  A painfully short story mode.  Although the fourth installment still had the character profiles (and even a flow chart to show the relationships) it didn't seem to have as much character.Soulcalibur V isn't much different.  The story mode here isn't about ALL the characters as a whole, and you won't even learn about all of them.  Here we're focused primarily on Patroklos, son of Sophitia.  He is battling the malfested (those cursed by Soul Edge).  He believes in justice and isn't afraid to say so.  Boy is he ever not afraid to say so.  The other half of the story focuses on Pyrhha, Sophitia's daughter who was kidnapped.  She herself is also cursed thanks to her mothers dealings with Soul Edge in the past.  Soulcalibur V's story is set seventeen years after the events of the fourth game.  This time, however, the story is a lot more linear.  There's an actual story mode that basically follows the exploits of Patroklos and his sister.  You'll also from time to time play as newcomer Z.W.E.I.  There are two major problems with Soulcalibur V's story mode.  The first and most obvious is that it's just not any good.  It's a pretty tame story that is hardly delivered that well.  There are battles, but inbetween are mostly story boards as opposed to cutscenes.  It's mostly a lazy effort.Some would say this is no big deal.  That the story in any fighting game isn't particularly important.  But in Soulcalibur the developers have often had narrative and character dripping from every facet.  Every stage, every character and every weapon had a backstory behind it that helped shape the world and characters within it.  Which brings about Soulcalibur V's biggest problem: the characters.  New and old alike, none of them really carry individual stories.  This is mostly about Patroklos and you'll know it.  The story mode doesn't allow you to play as other characters and explore THEIR stories and motivations.  You'll only be allowed to play as Patroklos, his sister and Z.W.E.I. at certain moments.  As such, if you're say... no good with any of these characters (and Z.W.E.I. has a real steep learning curve) then the story mode will be needlessly difficult or pretty boring.  You'll need to get through it once, however, because you'll use the story mode to unlock some characters.The new characters aren't that exciting and the old ones aren't either.  As I said, Soulcalibur V isn't that interested in giving characters personality outside of perhaps what they say in battle when you see them.  Yet for what it's worth you'll hardly learn anything about them unless you go to outside sources such as the official strategy guide or (if you picked up the collector's edition) the artbook.  Many characters are introduced but with no real story of their own.  Old characters are also brought back with no real story. There's not much reason given to us why Cervantes is still here.  Or why Aeon (Lizardman) is still running around.  Likewise, other characters that were dropped there's little reason to know why.  Why are Talim and Yunsung absent?  Other characters are replaced either by descendents (Leixia is Xianghua's daughter, Patroklos is Sophitia's son etc.) or by a student (Natsu is Taki's student).  They share their fighting styles, but there's not much in the way of knowing where the other characters went.  It's kind of disappointing how much less Soulcalibur V focuses on its character and story in a fighting game that series that was, at one point, quite renowned for its meticulous focus on such things.All this means the gameplay has to be good, right?  Well, yes.  For the most part Soulcalibur V is fun.  You've got a decent size roster of characters.  Although three of them are mimic characters (including series favorite, Kilik) and sadly enough, a very toned down moves list.  This isn't all bad.  Soulcalibur V is easy to pick up and learn.  Especially because it has a very good training mode to help those unfamiliar with the series get to know it.  You've got your basic horizontal and vertical attacks as well as your kicks and grabs.  At first it seems like button mashing can grant anyone a victory, but Soulcalibur manages to appeal to advanced players as well.  There has always been a rock-paper-scissors aspect to playing Soulcalibur.  If you play against a player that really knows your character, button mashing is a quick road to defeat.There are some changes to the battling, however.  For one, characters now have a gauge which allows them to perform super attacks.  This is the critical gauge.  Every character can extend some of their basic moves into more powerful types of attacks, referred to as Brave Edges.  In some regards this makes some characters slightly easier to use.  For instance, Ivy who is known primarily as a difficult character to master now has her Summon's Suffering a simple Brave Edge as opposed to a complex button combination.  Other characters benefit from Brave Edges to give them a means of coming back and turning the tide of battle.  Likewise, every character also has a critical edge, which is more or less a super attack.  Critical Edges have great animations but some of them are horribly unbalanced or unfavored attacks.  For instance, some Critical Edges are strangely not that powerful at all (Z.W.E.I.) while others are ridiculously overpowered (Nightmare).  This makes for a strangely unbalanced game.Lastly, it's also a shame that Soulcalibur changed its defensive play system.  I always enjoyed that Soulcalibur allowed for guard impacts, but this is now relegated to your critical gauge.  It now cost a level of your critical gauge to guard impact.  Instead you now have a ""Just Guard"" which is where you defend just as an attack strikes.  It's not an impact, but it acts as one.  The timing is a bit hard to master at first.  Other than that, one has to hope to master the guard impacts and deflections built into each characters attacks.  Lastly, as opposed to just being able to guard all the time, those who block too much will eventually be subjected to a guard burst, giving their opponent a free hit.  This is MUCH better than Soulcalibur IV's critical finishes.All this makes a competent fighting system, although it's a shame just how stripped away it all feels.  Not just a lot of moves being taken away from the game, but also that Soulcalibur V has taken away a lot of the options to really customize a fight.  There are no handicaps to set, for instance.  There is no ""infinite time"" that you can set for a match anymore.  Battles are also incredibly fast and won't last too long.  A staple, sure, but the inability to really set handicaps doesn't suit Soulcalibur V.  The engine itself is also fast.  While this certainly makes it a lot better than Soulcalibur IV's seemingly slow engine, it's no where near as smooth as Soulcalibur II or III.  By that I mean, sometimes attacks can be lashed out so fast you'll find yourself unable to do anything in combat.  This is especially true when fighting against some AI controlled opponents.  The engine is fast, but it isn't always smooth.  Especially when some fighters (Nightmare, in particular) can string their attacks together in such rapid succession that even blocking becomes unusually difficult.  I didn't feel like previous Soulcalibur titles suffered in this regard.The fighting isn't bad, however.  And playing against friends is definitely a treat.  It also helps that you can take the experience online.  And Soulcalibur V has a great online interface.  Being able to set up tournaments and go into battle rooms.  Or just search for random opponents.  You can also spectate battles, save replays and even set it up so that when watching a replay you can see your opponents button inputs.  This creates a game that actually gives players a chance to truly improve their game.  And that's saying a lot because the previous Soulcalibur titles weren't exactly catering toward this.The problem with all this is that Soulcalibur V certainly lacks a lot of content beyond this.  Either that or it's watered down considerably.  The Arcade Mode, for instance, has you fighting down one of four tiers (Standard, Europe, Asia or Special) and there are only six battles.  None of which are ever really mixed up.  It's the same Arcade Mode with no real variety.  With only six stages there's not much reason to play it other than to build your player level (which is used to unlock things in character creation).  Aside from that there is also a ""Quick Battle"" which only serves to get you online titles.  Lastly there is ""Legendary Souls,"" which is basically just a ridiculously tough Arcade Mode where you battle particular characters from the series who have really made a reputation for themselves over time.  It's nothing too exciting and after a while you realize that playing online is the only real reason to have the game in the first place.  There's not much of a single player experience to speak of.Again, for most this is no big deal but... this is Soulcalibur.  One of the things that Soulcalibur established (VERY well, might I add) is that there could be something BEYOND just the Arcade Mode.  The original included a Missions Mode along with Survival and a Team Battle.  There was also a battle theater, exhibitions to look at and artwork.  None of that is here.  The second game had a very expansive Weapons Master Mode on top of many things already brought back from the first game.  But it also included a variety of weapons and ""Extras"" modes where you could use them.  Soulcalibur III had a pretty expansive story mode, missions and various ways to go about them.  Even Soulcalibur IV had the Tower of Souls.  But Soulcalibur V includes nothing for the solitary gamer to do if they decide they won't want to play online.  There's no artwork to unlock, for instance.  There are no missions or any sort of challenge mode.  No survival mode.  No exhibition modes.  No character profiles.  No different types of weapons with their own effects to collect.  All of that stuff is pretty much gone.There's character creation, but aside from aesthetics there's not much point to doing it.  Certainly it's fun, but what's the point of all the various weapons if they don't make me consider how I'm fighting or what to put on?  In Soulcalibur IV there was sometimes a point to assigning certain abilities or even using certain weapons.  Take away the weapon effects (or don't put an emphasis on the weapons at all) and is Soulcalibur REALLY Soulcalibur in that regard?  Character creation is still fun because there's so much to do, but with very few motivations for doing it, it's particularly hard to see why a player really ought to aside from showing off their creations.  There's nothing wrong with this, really.  It just feels kind of strange that the fourth game put so much of an emphasis on altering your stats and finding the best combination of equipment to get through the Tower of Souls while Soulcalibur V is so stripped down.Visually, Soulcalibur V is a gorgeous game.  Although there are times of clipping, it's hardly a bad looking or running game.  It also doesn't sound bad by any stretch.  The music is absolutely fantastic.  It's still not as memorable as the first couple of games in the series, but still really good nonetheless.Overall, Soulcalibur V isn't a bad game, but it feels very stripped when compared to the games which preceded it.  The collector's edition comes with an artbook and soundtrack selections from all the previous games in the series, but it's probably not really worth the extra money to get those alone.  It's not a bad game, but it is a game where you expect just a little bit more because it's Soulcalibur.  There ought to be more to the single player experience than what's presented here.  This was one of the things that separated Soulcalibur from the pack and made fighting games more worthwhile outside the arcade.  The fact that they used to provide such a good single player experience.  With so much of that stripped down here, there's not much reason to pick up Soulcalibur V if you don't intend to go online.  If you're looking for down time when you're not online (or when you can't find someone online, which WILL happen) there's not much you can do.It's a fun game to be sure, but at some point I hope beyond hope that Project Soul will remember that Soulcalibur is allowed to include the things that made the series stand out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8XJPTOIF3820/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00604I8ZY#wasThisHelpful","R8XJPTOIF3820","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When it comes to the television show Family Guy, some of the best episodes out there are the ones in which Brian and Stewie travel together and actually don't feature the rest of the cast.  One of the better episodes was an episode in which Brian and Stewie traveled through the Multiverse.  Apparently the creators know how popular the episode is because they made a video game that was a sequel to it.  Back to Multiverse can be considered fan service in just about every respect.  If you really love the show and its humor you'll really love this game to a certain extent.  And while it's packed full of references it's hard to say this is a game worth forking over sixty dollars for.  If anything it would've easily sufficed as a downloadable game on PSN or XBOX Live Arcade.  There isn't really enough content to justify the price tag (though it's sure to go down eventually).Back to the Multiverse begins in typical Family Guy fashion.  It's as though you're playing through an actual episode of the show.  It plays the opening of the show--credits and all--as though this really is going to be a typical episode.  It then shows Brian and Stewie.  Their banter is quickly interrupted when Bertrum shows up from a different universe.  He wants revenge on Stewie and is about the travel the multiverse to amass an army.  It's up to Stewie and Brian to stop him by following him through the multiverse.  As far as Family Guy goes, the actual synopsis for this episode is definitely pretty cool.  And it's got some great humor in many respects.  The cutscenes themselves are full of some nice witty banter between Brian and Stewie but once you get into the actual game only your fan devotion is likely to hold you.  And you'll need to be a die hard fan of the show for it more so than just someone who watches it every now and then.There are ten levels in Back to the Multiverse.  Each complete with objectives.  You'll never get lost as there is a marker that will always show you where to go and where you should be.  Each level seems to have its own theme.  There's one level where it's all filled with Amish.  Another where everyone is crippled and you must battle through their fortress and a few more surprises I won't spoil.  Although there isn't much to spoil.  Any die-hard fan of the show will have seen this all before.  You don't get the sense there was much created from scratch for the game.You'll play as Brian and Stewie and be able to switch between them on the fly.  Each of them have their own set of weapons at their disposal.  Stewie has his trademark ray guns and inventions while Brian has the standard stuff like pistols, shotguns and rifles.  Characters also have secondary weapons and items they can use.  You can throw diaper bombs with Stewie or molotov cocktails with Brian.  It seems like there is a lot of variety but Back to Multiverse puts an emphasis on shooting your way through.  And hordes of enemies will come at you from everywhere.  The difficulty spikes seem a little unbalanced.  One minute everything seems manageable, the next you're overrun and barely able to survive.  It's okay though, because a lot of health packs and ammo are plentiful throughout each level.  There isn't really too much variety in the objectives, though.  Many times it's usually finding something to open passage so you can move forward, or it's something along the lines of killing a certain enemy to move on.As you kill enemies you'll also collect cash.  You'll be able to use this to buy more weapons and costumes, as well as increase your health or the amount of ammo you can carry.Every level is filled with references to the show.  But this is actually part of the problem.  You'll find characters in levels and hear your enemies and people close by spouting off their lines.  The thing is... you've heard nearly all of it before.  Many of the lines are lifted directly from the show.  Every now and then there is something original but for the most part, if you're that familiar with the show you've heard all these lines before.  This brings about another small issue with the game in and of itself... you will hear them constantly.  These lines pop up again and again.  In the very first level you'll constantly hear a frat boy saying, ""I'm angry, but not because I'm gay.""  It gets old really fast.  Whenever Stewie picks up ammo he'll say the ""This is my rifle/this is my gun..."" line from the episode where he and Brian went into the army.  It's constant, though and after a while it's just annoying.  At first you'll probably enjoy this.  Then again, with so many lines throughout the entire history of the show you're apt to wonder why they didn't lift a bigger variety of them.The biggest drawback is that the game is relatively short with little replay value.  The game can easily be completed in 3 to 5 hours.  It's brief, just like an episode of the show.  And while some of it is funny and witty, it's really only the cutscenes that are really that fun or engaging to watch.At the very least fans of the show will be happy to know that the writers and voice actors did step up to the plate to help out with the story and characters.  The cast is here to deliver their lines and it's done rather well.  The graphical presentation is a little jarring at first.  It's cartoon like, which is a good thing.  On the other hand, some animations seem a little stilted.  Mostly the cutscenes and the lip movements from time to time.  Likewise, the game being in 3D makes certain aspects look just a tad... strange.  Such as looking at Stewie's hair or Brian up close.  Nevertheless those are small nitpicks.  There are also moments in which you might feel the game could use a couple more details.  A lot of environments strangely feel scarce or empty.  I like that it looks like the cartoon, but you sometimes get the sense that they could've done a little more.Back to the Multiverse isn't a bad game at all.  It is a little steep to pay the full sixty dollar price tag for a game that's this short and doesn't offer nearly as much replay value.  There are a few extra things to do outside of the main story, but it's really nothing special.  It's a great amount of fan service at least and if you're a die hard fan you may like it.  Otherwise you may want to wait for just a little bit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JXIU4WOAJV6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Z3UUDW#wasThisHelpful","R3JXIU4WOAJV6P","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 2011, Uncharted 3 hit the ground running and quickly became one of the most well received games in the Playstation 3's library.  This is an impressive feat considering the game was the sequel to.  Uncharted 3 manage to live up to much of the hype which surrounded it and continues to be a popular treat.  As with most games that do well in the market as well as with the fans, Uncharted 3 was given a game of the year edition.  For those who've yet to experience Uncharted 3 this is most definitely the edition you'll want to buy.  The original game can still be find for a cheap price, but you'll wind up having to pay a lot of extra money for all the DLC.  If you don't really care much for the DLC then there's no real reason not to buy the original game.  This review is for those who have not played Uncharted 3 as well as for those who have so it's a rather long one.Uncharted 3 is a much more character driven story than the previous two.  The game focuses pretty strongly on Nate's relationship with Sully and just how far back it goes.  This time Nathan is looking for the Atlantis of the Sands.  Apparently Francis Drake found something, and Nathan Drake wants in on the action.  Of course he's not the only one after it.  A secret agency headed by a woman named Marlowe is also searching for Francis Drake's secret and they'll stop it nothing to get it.  In order for Nate to survive this one he's going to have to use all his cunning and wit, as well as face some of his biggest fears to date.  The story is actually pretty simple.  And while there are some nice twists and turns, what really makes it good are the characters withing it.  It's a character driven story through and through.The Uncharted series is pretty well known for it's good characters, sharp writing and easy to follow narrative.  This is perhaps the most true in the third game.  The characters here have an established narrative that the game is willing to fill you in on, but one does not need to play Uncharted: Drake's Fortune or Uncharted 2: Among Thieves to really understand the game in and of itself.  The characters introduced have such natural exchanges with one another that even if this is your first outing with Nate and his allies you'll grow to like them and know them without having played the previous games.  Uncharted simply doesn't slouch on the character development.  Even when simply walking around the characters carry on with jokes, conversation and banter.  It really makes for an enjoyable experience.The movie like quality is what helps the game along.  Uncharted isn't known for being a non-linear experience.  Players will always know where to go next and there isn't much off the beaten path.  There are treasures to find, but they're usually not too far out of the way.  On the other hand, Uncharted never makes you backtrack, always carefully guiding the player through its scripted sequences.  Normally this might be a deterrent for a game, but with so much focus on story and narrative, it helps keep the story pacing at a decent speed without getting too distracted from it.  Most of the gameplay segments are easily divided into three types of moments.  First there are the platforming elements which usually involve Drake scaling walls and jumping from hanging ledge to another to reach a destination.  The second are the puzzles he'll have to solve to progress further in the areas he's exploring and the last is the gunplay.  Because the game alternates so well between all these elements you'll rarely feel like you're being bogged down for too long.  After a long gunfight, for instance, the game slows down a little from the action by giving you some platforming to do or a puzzle to solve so that you can have a respite from the gunplay.  Likewise the story is pretty good at keeping things in focus.  The puzzles don't feel like they're just there to keep you busy, but because they actually add something to the story, while the platforming is worked in elegantly that it feels natural.The gunfights, however, can be some of the most challenging Uncharted has thrown out yet.  There are moments where enemies are all over the place and it's your job to take them out.  Much like the previous two games, Uncharted 3 isn't always easy.  You may find yourself dying in some gunfights either because you feel overwhelmed or simply can't find cover in time.  It's also not unusual for someone to come sneaking up behind you and blasting you away because you were focused on other enemies.  The good news is that checkpoints in Uncharted 3 are plentiful.  If you screw up a platforming section or bite the dust in a fire fight you're usually not too far away from where you died.Arguably, there isn't much Uncharted 3 needs to build upon from Uncharted 2.  The second one was such a huge step above the first that it didn't leave much of anything for the third to improve upon.  There also aren't enormous changes to gameplay.  A few things have been added in.  The melee combat has been improved a great deal and is now more fun than ever.  You can also pick up and toss back grenades that are thrown at you.  But by far the biggest reward to Uncharted 3's gameplay are its set piece moments.  They are easily some of the best the series as ever had.  In the second game players were treated to moments such as running away from a helicopter across roof tops, fighting a tank and doing battle on a moving train just to name a few of the games better moments.  Uncharted 3 strives for more.  Here you'll find yourself playing set piece moments that have you fighting bad guys as the building around you burns.  There's also a moment in which you'll be fighting on a capsizing cruise ship and it's easily one of the greatest things I've ever experienced in a video game.  These moments are big and epic.  I'd rather not give too much away for people who have yet to play, but Uncharted 3 packs in a lot of adventure in between its narrative, platforming and puzzle solving.  It's a game that adventure enthusiasts simply must experience for themselves.  It's amazing.All that being said, Uncharted 3 is a rather huge game.  The main campaign itself is rather short, but the multiplayer will more than make up for that.  It's enormous, with tons of modes to play and lots of customization options.  The reason I highly recommend the Game of the Year Edition for those who enjoy multiplayer is because it's simply that big.  You've got your typical deathmatch modes where you can be on teams or free for all.  There's also the standard king of the hill type stuff.  But there are also tons of maps that really make it special to play.  In part because the maps themselves are just a playing field but can also be their own experiences.  In one level, for instance, you're on trains jumping from one to the other until they arrive at the train station where the battle will continue.  Another has one team defending a plane while another constantly jumps there until they take off and land on another map.  It's also nice that some of the previous maps from previous games have been brought back.  Some of them look different because Naughty Dog changed the weather... and yes they do feel different as a result.  Some of Uncharted 2's better maps are back and they're just as gorgeous as they ever were.  Likewise, a lot of classic character skins are here as well.  You'll be able to play as your favorite characters from Drake's Fortune or Among Thieves, if you wish.Other aspects about the multiplayer that really add to the experience is that each game isn't afraid to mix things up.  For instance if you're doing team deathmatches the losing team might get random perks to help out such as revealing the winning teams location, or making their shots do more damage.  To also add to the variety you can select perks to take into specific maps that might help you reload faster, or collect more cash upon defeating adversaries.  But it doesn't end there.  In every game you can earn medals that will grant you more cash that you can spend on character skins or accessories to customize your own creation.  The medals aren't just used for that, however.  In every match each individual has kickbacks that act as temporary perks.  For instance getting enough medals might allow you to be granted a sniper rifle for a while, or roam around faster than usual.  You're also given the chance to customize weapons as you see fit and make them more powerful or helpful in other ways.  All this combined with rankings and clans can make multiplayer feel extremely overwhelming at first.  It certainly isn't as simple as Uncharted 2's, but once you get sucked in it can be very difficult to stop playing because it's done so well.  I've yet to experience a lot of connection issues.  Your mileage will vary.  So will your gameplay experiences.  The multiplayer is huge and we haven't even begun to talk about co-op yet.The game excels in the co-op arena as well.  There is a campaign complete with cutscenes.  Although it isn't much for story, it's lengthy enough that it can keep you satisfied with some exciting gunplay.  It's also pretty cool because you'll see some old favorites.  You'll get your brand of perks here as well.  But there is also the arena in which they mix up the rules when playing with friends.  For instance just the arena itself has you fighting ten waves of enemies with things in place.  You might be told to survive one round by killing everyone, and then be subjected to gold rush in the next in which you must escort an idol back to the chest with your team before your killed.  There is also one that insists you kill enemies from within a specific area on a map.  You can play all these modes by mixing and matching in the arena, but you can also opt to play them separately.  Simply put, there's quite a bit to keep you busy with the multiplayer.  And if you decide to take the dive into it then getting the Game of the Year Edition is a must.One of the things the Uncharted series is known for is having some of the most impressive visuals ever in a video game.  Uncharted 3 doesn't disappoint.  Every environment is brimming with detail and life.  The attention to detail is simply amazing.  It's all done so well it's hard not to notice some of the details.  For instance, when Nathan banks off a wall you'll notice he actually pushes himself off.  The animations are absolutely fantastic in part because of how the motion capture is done by the actors who actually provide the voices.  This gives a very human like quality to how the characters move.  Other little bits of detail include how well the environment interacts with the characters.  When Nathan is in the desert for instance it's hard not to be impressed by how naturally the sand flows.  Or looking at the water effects as they hit a ship.  The lighting is also done incredibly well.  Simply put, Uncharted 3 is a technological beast and there aren't that many words that can be used to describe just how much detail was put into the presentation.The voice acting and writing is also as sharp as ever.  The writing is very clever as the exchanges between characters feel very natural.  The voice actors also did the motion control and you can tell that they were disciplined in their work.  The acting is great and the emotions are spot on, not to mention the animations.  It's also hard to ignore the fantastic sound effects and music score.  It all compliments many of the games moments.  The music in each environment compliments the environment.  But the sound effects are also pretty stellar.It's hard to really knock the presentation of a Naughty Dog game because there's so much attention put into it.  However, it is NOT always perfect.  Because of so much put into it, there will be moments in which you may experience a bug or two.  It's usually never anything huge.  Rather it's things like... when you die Nate might clip through a piece of the environment or something like that.  It's usually never going to get you killed but when it happens it's much more noticeable than in other games because of that attention to detail.  As I said, I never died because of this... I always noticed this WHEN I died.  One time Nate's rag doll corpse went through a wall and into obscurity.For those wondering, yes, there are making of featurette that shows you how they did some of things they did.  It's complete with interviews and trivia, as well as showing you some of the things they did to improve the game.  However, there is no New Game+ here.  The previous two games managed to squeeze in some nice perks on subsequent playthroughs such as being able to change your character skin or being able to get infinite ammo in your weapons... or even just flat out select a gun to use--even if it wasn't available.  This was missing from the original Uncharted 3 and hasn't been restored to the game of the year edition.With an unquestionable amount of hype surrounding it, Uncharted 3 managed to somehow live up to just about all of it.  It's a great adventure and the Game of the Year Edition is even better for multiplayer enthusiasts.  There's so much loaded here that it can easily be enjoyed by anyone willing to take some time to play.  If you like adventure games and really enjoy multiplayer then Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is the game for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35FB59KVZTNVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CP6RUW#wasThisHelpful","R35FB59KVZTNVB","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to 2D side scrolling gamaes a strategy guide almost can't fail in this day and age.  And as you might expect, the New Super Mario Bros. U guide does not disappoint.  New Super Mario Bros. U is a pretty straightforward game as it is, but all the secrets and goodies might be elusive to some players.  This guide will help you find them all.Let's just jump to the walkthrough.  By this point in time all the preliminary basics should be known to just about anyone.  You know how to make Mario run and jump.  you know about the enemies and you know about the power ups.  The only thing that's of any importance, really is the walkthrough.  If you're still struggling with the basics, this guide will help but New Super Mario Bros. U is such a straightforward game you'll get by without ever having to read about the controls.The walkthrough is done just like every other New Super Mario Bros. Guide.  Each section begins with a map, usually showing you everything.  You'll find out where pipes lead, where Star Coins are and where alternate exits are with no problems whatsoever.  The guide uses the same waypoint system that every side scrolling Mario guide has used in the past few years.  When you look on the maps you'll usually see a number.  When you do, just look at the text below and find your number and it'll tell you what to do.  Generally speaking the guide doesn't hold your hand, only giving tips in areas they've found particularly difficult or where secrets lurk.  They do call out all the Star Coins in a special manner, however.The maps are perhaps the most important part.  In most cases this is all you need to get by and the guide has walkthroughs for just about every level.  Everything you need is here.In reality, there isn't much I can say here.  It's constructed just like the previous New Super Mario Bros. guide.  It's straightforward, has detailed maps and gives the tips you'd expect.  By this point in time it'd be really hard for any guide company to make a bad guide to New Super Mario Bros. U.  It's probably not going to be needed in anyway, but at least for those who are stuck it will help them find everything.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32QV65J59CCZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009T67WMA#wasThisHelpful","R32QV65J59CCZ5","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:+Fun and exciting gameplay+Voices and music ripped directly from the film+Good looking game+A great sense of humor about it+Lots of replay valueThe Bad:-A glitch or two can lessen the fun-There is virtually no challenge; although this is not necessarily a bad thingBack in 2005, LEGO Star Wars came out and became a surprising success by adding it's brand of innocent humor along with letting players play through the prequel trilogy in LEGO form.  It was an enticing idea.  One that worked splendidly.  Since then the LEGO games have taken a hold of gaming, allowing us to experience some of our favorite films in LEGO form.  The original Star Wars trilogy, Indiana Jones and Harry Potter are but a few film sagas to be turned into LEGO form.  LEGO Lord of the Rings was to be expected.  It's finally here and it's pretty enjoyable stuff.  The LEGO formula is starting to wear off a bit and overstay its welcome, but the game is still fun.Like the other LEGO games before it, LEGO Lord of the Rings will have you playing through the whole saga as the fellowship.  It follows the trilogy quite well, recreating some of the most memorable moments of the film in LEGO form.  In the past the LEGO games haven't been known to do a lot of voice acting, but here you'll find moments in which certain lines are ripped directly from the film and spoken by the characters as opposed to the gibberish they talk in in the other games.  That being said, it's really nice to hear some of the more iconic lines.  There are some liberties taken with some of the moments, of course.  Like the previous LEGO games there's a good sense of humor here and so some scenes are changed for the sake of comedy.  It's all in good fun and is sure to remind you of some of the best moments of the trilogy, while giving you something to laugh about from time to time.There are a grand total of eighteen levels in LEGO Lord of the Rings.  You'll begin in The Fellowship of the Ring and keep proceeding until you eventually play through The Two Towers and The Return of the King.  Along your journey you'll play through set piece moments and be able to switch between whatever characters are there on the fly.  When first playing through the game it's all story based and thus you'll only be able to play as any character that's actually staged to be there.  Each character has their own abilities that make them handy in situations.  Legolas can jump really high or use arrows as platforms.  Gandalf can use his wizardry.  You can throw Gimli at certain stones to break them.  But perhaps the most amusing is Frodo who's only ability is to scream and that (somehow) makes enemies simply stop attacking him.  It's a good setup and the game will constantly make you switch between characters to solve puzzles or to make use of them.  Simply put, you'll never be playing as the same character throughout.The first time through each level, however, you'll always come across puzzles and items off the beaten path that you simply can't get to at the moment because you may not have the character for it.  Luckily you can play through levels again with other characters who will have the ability to get you to these secrets off the beaten path.  As you complete the levels you'll unlock other characters who have abilities you can use when you choose to go back in Free Play mode.There is a lot familiar about the LEGO series by now and if you've played any of the previous entries you won't really be surprised by much of this.  As you go through levels you're encouraged to get studs which can eventually be used to buy more characters and the like.  There are a lot of characters that are fun to play as, but of course, some are just clones of another (as in, same abilities).  Nevertheless, getting them all and seeing your favorite characters in LEGO form is still a treat.  And because of going back for all those goodies and more studs there's a lot of replay value for what amounts to a relatively short campaign.A buddy can always jump into the fray and drop out any time they wish to do so.  Much like how it's been done before, co-op isn't much of a problem.  If someone wanders off too far the screen will automatically split until you're both reunited in the same vicinity again.  It's not likely to happen too often, however.  LEGO Lord of the Rings is a pretty linear affair.  You won't find yourself getting lost along the way very much and most times when you can go off the beaten path, you'll only have to return onto the right path.As you might also imagine, LEGO Lord of the Rings has a non-existent challenge.  For the most part, you'll have your rough spots but the only penalty for death is really just the loss of studs.  You'll always continue right where you died and you have an infinite number of lives.  There has never been such a thing as a game over in the LEGO series and it's not going to start now.  The games are a lot of wholesome fun.  They've never embraced challenging the player.Production wise most times the LEGO games usually look good.  The same is true here.  The animations of the LEGOs are great, but what really bears mentioning is the attention to detail.  All the LEGO games tend to do really well here.  From seeing your characters as LEGOs to the expression on their faces during cutscenes and the like.  The environments are also really good looking.  The game runs at a consistent frame rate, though I have noticed a glitch or two from time to time.  The games usually look nice, but it's not uncommon to see the games suffer from strange glitches.  In particular, my copy seems to randomly freeze after I've been playing for a couple of hours and I have to reset it.The voice acting is great because it's all ripped from the movies.  Sometimes it doesn't overlap perfectly with the movements but that's fine by me.  The score for the game is also ripped directly from the movies themselves and plays rather nicely.  the sound effects (particularly of LEGO pieces breaking) is also a nice touch.  It's a great blend of LEGOs and Lord of the Rings.The LEGO games have always been fun ways to enjoy some of our favorite movies in LEGO form.  Despite how the formula is starting to wear thin it's still a lot of fun to play these games.  LEGO Lord of the Rings is definitely among the better outings.  If you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings trilogy then you might want to give this game a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDIY3N8M1E3FG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088MVOUC#wasThisHelpful","RDIY3N8M1E3FG","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in the day, VERSUS BOOKS was known for making some incredibly detailed guides that went beyond what gamers typically expected from their strategy guides.  They often blew the competition away.  One of their best guides was for Pokemon Red/Yellow/Blue.  It's not particularly hard to make an awesome Pokemon Guide.  And granted, there aren't really a lot of ""bad"" guides out there.  Meaning you couldn't really go wrong with any guide for the original three games.  However, grabbing the VERSUS BOOKS guide is perhaps the best out of the lot.It begins with the ""getting started,"" section.  In most guides by VERSUS BOOKS this was the ""basic training"" section.  But here it's just called getting started, and it helps talk about all the basics of the game.  Not a terribly detailed section of the guide, but it doesn't have to be.  It will detail everything you must know about the game.  It'll tell you about catching Pokemon, the status effects and the flow of battle.  If for some reason you just can't grasp Pokemon, this guide is going to help you do so.  It'll help you step into the game itself rather easy.  As a bonus, the guide will tell you about the differences between the Yellow version as compared to the Red and Blue.It wastes no time getting into the walkthrough.  With each section beginning by showing you what new Pokemon can be found in the area, as well as giving profiles for new Pokemon as they appear.  There are also charts in every area that detail exact percentages for when a Pokemon will appear for each version.  All of this is fine and dandy.  For instance, the profiles often tell you their opinion on what can be done with each Pokemon without feeling like you need to take their suggestions.  There are also maps with item call outs as well.  What really helps the VERSUS BOOKS guide stand out above the pack, however, is that it details the roster of every trainer in the game.  If you ever find yourself roaming the overworld and you see a trainer, you can find out what they've got in store.  A handy list of all the trainers is in each section.  It's invaluable to the player.About the only thing the guide doesn't really detail is just how Gary decides to evolve his Eevee for Pokemon Yellow players.  You'll know what roster you're up against, but considering how Prima and Nintendo Power both told you how Gary was going to evolve is Eevee, it seems odd that of all the things VERSUS BOOKS misses out on, this is the strangest.  It's not that big a deal by any stretch of the imagination.  By far it's a minor detail, but one that seems strangely overlooked nonetheless.As an aside, however, I must say that at times the guide seems overdone in some areas.  And while that's a good thing, there are times when I felt it didn't matter as much.  Particularly when telling you about the Pokemon in an area.  I'm not sure if this means much to anyone else, but telling me I'll run into a Pokemon 60% of the time while telling me I'll run into another Pokemon 20% and another 10% etc. just doesn't really help much.  Really, this only gives me an idea of what Pokemon are in the area.  But simply telling me the chances of running into them were high, low or moderate would've been just fine by me.  I appreciate the extra mile, VERSUS BOOKS, but it seems just genuinely unnecessary to go that far.  It makes for a good looking guide, but even just doing what Nintendo Power does with their ""Many/Few/None"" approach would've sufficed just the same (maybe the ones that show up less than 10% of the time would've been well to put down ""Rare"").Another thing that's nice is the secrets section.  Pokemon has a lot of secrets.  Versus Books goes into quite a few.  Including the secrets of Missing No. and M. Block.  Of course, it seems impossible to uncover every glitch and put it into this guide.  It's actually very amusing that there was actually a strategy guide published that mentioned the item duplication trick and the like... but really, it only does so because they were discovered back in the days of Red and Blue and this guide was published when the Yellow version came out.  It seems strange that they pretend this is info one can't find anywhere... it was floating around the internet at least a year before the guide was published (and even covered in various magazines).  Granted, Missing No. and M. Block weren't covered in other guides but I'm not particularly sure it was necessary to do so in the first place.  The fact that VERSUS BOOKS would sit there and claim credit for this as though it's a secret that wasn't around until they told you about it just doesn't sit well with me.  Glad it's there, don't like that the guide makes too big a deal that they discovered it.The Pokedex is the last area that bears mentioning.  It's a great Pokedex.  One of the better ones.  It shows what all the Pokemon Stats look like at Max and all the HMs and TMs you can teach.  Throughout the Pokedex it also has little tidbits of information where they rank the Pokemon by stats.  It's a rather nice thing, but much like the other aspects of the guide, a little too much at times.  By this I mean, when it talks about the max stats of a Pokemon, they're approximate.  A graph or ranking system to show which stats a Pokemon excelled in would've been fine.  Yes, knowing a certain Pokemon has a Special stat of 300 is nice, but at Max level MY Pokemon of that same nature will not read 300.  It could be 299 or something to that effect.  It's dependent on the stat boosting items I use, etc.  Again, I appreciate this little tidbit, but another moment where, in the long run, it actually doesn't make the guide MORE useful.  It doesn't make it less useful either, mind you, it just doesn't really make it more useful than say... the Nintendo Power guide in that respect.  Nintendo Power mostly just showed which stats each Pokemon excelled at primarily because they couldn't exactly quote you a number.  In reality, it's actually no different than what VERSUS BOOKS does... they just don't tell you, ""You're Pokemon's stat will be this once they reach maximum level.""  VERSUS BOOKS is good at playing the numbers game here, but they don't particularly give credit to the player on just how they themselves will choose to raise a particular Pokemon.The VERSUS BOOKS guide really is the best of the Pokemon guides you can get.  But not because it has an awesome Pokedex or anything.  It's strengths actually come from out straightforward the walkthrough is, the fact that it's willing to show you every trainer's roster, and how detailed and useful the maps are.  The other things are just icing on the cake, but nothing that makes the guide more ""useful,"" but are nice things to be able to look at.  It shows they're willing to go the extra mile, but the more I flip through the guide and use it, I'm wondering if they realized that sometimes it didn't add much to the guide at all except for something neat for the eyes to look upon.  Nevertheless, I'd still recommend this guide over all the others by a long shot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OXFEF0VH4P6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ICYHQW#wasThisHelpful","R1OXFEF0VH4P6Q","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ratchet and Clank started things off with a bang on the Playstation 2.  Becoming a huge seller on the Playstation 2 by offering some dynamic platforming, weapons combat and puzzles.  When the Playstation 3 dropped down Insomniac games shifted focus from Ratchet and Clank and first gave us Resistance: Fall of Man.  A year into the PS3's life, however, and Insomniac Game brought back Ratchet and Clank with a whole new story and adventure.  Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction may be the best one in the series.Things are looking normal for our heroes who have saved the galaxy countless times.  Ratchet and Clank are just fixing a vehicle when they get a call from the Planetary Defense Center.  The city of Metropolis is under attack by an army that is being led by the evil Emperor Tachyon.  He's come to Metropolis for only one reason: To find and eradicate Ratchet--the last of the Lombax species.  And he's willing to level entire cities to do it.  Once Ratchet and Clank barely escape their quest takes them across the galaxy looking for the secrets of the past.  Why does Tachyon want to eliminate the Lombaxes?  And what was the Lombax secret?  The story, by all accounts, is much more heavily character focused than the other games which came before it.  In particular, you'll learn a lot more about Ratchet than you have in other games.  It makes for a more personal story and it's an exciting one.  It's filled with familiar characters and a few new ones.  It's also humorous in every way but also much more mature than most people really give it credit for.  There's a lot more heart in this story and makes a much more distinct connection with its characters.That being said, the only real issue with the story is that Tachyon just isn't an interesting character.  This is especially sad considering how present Dr. Nefarious was in Up Your Arsenal.  You'll rarely see what's going on for Tachyon or what he's doing.  He doesn't quite feel as absent as Drek does in the first one, but you rarely get the sense that Tachyon is really doing anything.  In some ways that's perfectly fine as the story going on with Ratchet and Clank is ultimately more satisfying and interesting than any game in the series thus far.  It more than makes up for the lack of focus on Tachyon because it keeps the focus on the main characters and really developing them.  It makes the story by far the most rewarding in the series.Ratchet and Clank has had a familiar formula for years and that doesn't change with Tools of Destruction.  Those familiar with any of the other games in the series will know what to expect.  There's a lot of running, jumping and blowing things up.  You'll find yourself collecting bolts aplenty to buy new weapons and armor.  There's not much here you haven't seen.  The weapons are certainly very fascinating, however.  There are some nice things here such as the new Tornado Launcher or being able to place down a swarm that will kill off the bad guys.  Like Up Your Arsenal each weapon is constantly leveling up.  What's new, however, is that you will not just gain bolts but Raritanium.  While Raritanium is nothing new to Ratchet and Clank, here it's actually used to purchase perks for your weapons such as more ammo, longer range or more power.  Each weapon also has a master perk that adds a new element.  For instance, the Fusion Bomb will have a master upgrade that allows each bomb to explode into a smaller set of bombs that may damage other enemies in the area.  Each weapon goes through five levels and once they hit level five they change into a totally different weapon.There are other editions, however.  You not only have weapons, but also devices that aren't always weapons but rather just things to help distract enemies.  The devices are usually independent of Ratchet.  For instance, you can use the Groovitron to make enemies dance in place, or use a Leech Bomb to drain their health.  You might not always need devices, but they add variety to the game.There is also a lot of space combat where you'll fly on rails and aim at various targets.  Usually these segments end with a boss fight as well.  None of these moments are challenging, however.  Which may be something about the game overall.  The first three Ratchet and Clank games were quite the challenge from time to time but Future: Tools if Destruction is a relatively simple game by comparison.  Your nanotech increases a lot easier than it did in the previous games.  But the most strange thing is that you'll rarely (if ever) find yourself short on bolts.  In previous games, grinding for bolts was a must, but in Future: Tools of Destruction you'll find you almost always have the right number of bolts.  And if you don't, it's never detrimental to buy a new weapon as your old ones will level up quite quickly and never be useless.  Your default weapons will still be enough to hold you over at the end.  But even then, you'll end up getting enough bolts almost purely by accident.  Bolts are everywhere, in large quantities and never stop coming.  You'll also find jackpot crates that double bolts.  Even if you manage to be having some trouble in Future: Tools of Destruction your nanotech will increase enough times that you'll eventually be able to dominate your foes purely based off the fact that you have too much health to be taken down.That's not to say it doesn't have its challenging moments.  It's only to say that eventually you'll succeed because the game has fewer limitations than previous games.  Your health is always restored when you go to a weapon shop, for instance, and sometimes there's one sitting right next to you in major battles.At the very least Future: Tools of Destruction does have some well designed areas, although it's a lot more linear than the other games.  For instance, in previous games you had various paths you could take the moment you touched down, but Future: Tools of Destruction is much more about making sure you progress through the games story.  Meaning that instead of being able to start off by going down three different paths only to find easy shortcuts back to your ship, you often only have one path to take to your next goal, which is never a mystery to you.  That's okay by me, as many of the game's locales are absolutely huge and populated with plenty of things to do such as puzzles, enemies aplenty and gold bolts to collect off the beaten path.  The feeling of exploration is still there, it's just that the various ""missions"" can't be done in nearly any order like previous games.Production wise, Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction may be the best the PS3 has to offer.  Despite originally releasing in 2007, the game still looks a lot better than you'd expect it to.  The cartoon like quality really helps a lot of the characters pop with detail.  It also helps that so much of the environments are colorful.  There's a lot of life in Ratchet and Clank and that really helps the game seem much bigger and more epic than it actually is.  In particular, the game's opening moments in Metropolis are some of the most amazing you'll see in the series.  But perhaps the most amazing thing is how well animated everything is in the game's various pre-rendered cutscenes or even in game.  There's a lot of detail and a lot of chaos that can go on.  And it rarely slows down when things happen such as enemies populating the screen or bolts flying around everywhere.The only real hiccup is that while the in game engine never buckles, the pre-rendered cutscenes sometimes do.  Sometimes the audio gets a little wonky and the actual speech doesn't match up with the lip movements.  This is actually rather sad as the voice acting and writing you see here is some of the best in the series.  So when a pre-rendered scene starts to buckle it's a little sad.  The animations and voice acting aren't just some of the best in the series, but some of the best I've ever seen of any game.Musically, Future: Tools of Destruction may have the best music in the series.  It's not quite as ""mechanical"" as some of the other tunes, but there are moments that much more emotionally investing and moments where the music really compliments the environments a lot.  It's a pretty amazing soundtrack overall, topped off by some fantastic sound effects.  Everything about the production values comes forth to make a really solid package.  One of the best uses of technology on the system you're likely to see.  If anything, the game is always running A LOT of things, making me wish that it could be installed instead of everything always constantly being read from the disk.  It's quite clear Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction is running A LOT of stuff and you'll hear it reading from the disc constantly.Overall, Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction is one of the best in the series.  It's got such an engrossing story and gameplay that's it's hard not to like it.  It's an ambitious game technologically that really showcases--even now--just what video games can be with the right art design and graphical prowess in place.  If you're a fan of Ratchet and Clank then Future: Tools of Destruction should not be missed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VUL4LWOMYIU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UC5ML0#wasThisHelpful","R1VUL4LWOMYIU1","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ratchet and Clank is a series that has always been progressing and getting better with each installment.  Up Your Arsenal is the third in the series and long considered the best of the PS2 games out there.  With good reason, it's absolutely amazing to play.  The adventure and all the content is well worth any asking price.  The game is huge in just about every way.  It's hard to say if it really outdoes Going Commando, but it would only miss the mark by mere milometers.Up Your Arsenal sees Ratchet and Clank relaxing when they see on the news that Ratchet's home planet of Veldin is under attack by a mysterious race called the Tyranoids.  It's up to Ratchet to save the planet.  But he soon discovers that a robot by the name of Dr. Nefarious is behind all of this turmoil and he's out to turn the entire galaxy into robots.  There is only one person who has tangled with Dr. Nefarious before.  Captain Qwark, and you'll have to work with him to rescue the galaxy... if you can find him.From a story standpoint Up Your Arsenal is a lot more straightforward than Going Commando, which opted for a few more susprises in its story than this one does.  However, Dr. Nefarious is by far the most expressive villain Ratchet and Clank have ever faced.  One issue with the first game in particular is that the villain, Drek, doesn't feel like he's really there or doing anything.  This was rectified somewhat in the second one, although the main antagonists keeps himself hidden until the end.  But with Up Your Arsenal, Dr. Nefarious is there throughout.  Often stringing you along, taunting you and just being present.  You get the sense that Nefarious is actually doing something.  This has fewer surprises than uncovering the mystery of Going Commando's Protopet, but at least Nefarious is entertaining throughout.  Up Your Arsenal is by far the funniest of the Ratchet and Clank games.  Introducing you to some interesting characters and clever satire along the way.Gameplay wise it's about what you'd expect from Ratchet and Clank.  You'll have tons of weapons, but unlike before they now increase up to five levels instead of just two.  You'll buy weapons and each time they level they gain new abilities.  When they finally reach level five they upgrade and change into a different weapon.  If you've got save data from Going Commando then you'll be able to get a hold of some of the previous weapons from Megacorp for free (provided you acquired them in Going Commando).  And some of new weapons are actually quite nice.  There are some familiar weapons such as the Hurricane which is really just a variation of Going Commando's Lancer (which was, in turn, a variation of the first game's blaster).  There are some new weapons, the most amusing of which is the Rift Launcher which launches a black hole and sucks enemies in.  Or the Infector which causes enemies to turn on one another.  It's good stuff and they all upgrade and turn into different weapons later.Aside from that it's pretty much the familiar Ratchet and Clank.  There's a good share of running and gunning, platforming and puzzles to solve on your way to Dr. Nefarious.  It is not as hard as Going Commando but will still serve as a decent challenge.  It's not an easy game by any means.  Just like before your Nanotech will increase as you progress through the game giving you more chances to be hit.  Likewise, you can also upgrade your armor.  A few things also return such as the battle arena where you can compete for prizes.There are actually some new things to behold in Up Your Arsenal as well.  The first major thing you'll note is that there is actually a hub in this game.  Between stretches on various planets, Ratchet and Clank can always return to the Starship Phoenix and restock their weapons, buy new armor, test out weapons in the VR Training (and earn more bolts in the process) as well as go through an obstacle course in training as well.  Likewise, throughout the game you'll collect Vid-Comics where you can play as Captain Qwark in his previous missions.  It's a mini-game that plays like an old school shooter/platformer and it's quite nice, however shortlived it is.Some things have also changed.  Space combat has been axed in favor of various missions.  From time to time you'll arrive on planets where you'll have a series of missions to complete.  Some that require you to get something offline, or drive across the terrain on a planet to take out certain enemies.  Others are as simple as having you defend troops.  No matter your style of play, Ratchet and Clank Up Your Arsenal offers something for players of all breeds.  There's even an option go play the game entirely in first person should you choose to do so.All that aside, there's no shortage of content in Ratchet and Clank Up Your Arsenal.  And it helps that the campaign clocks in at a decent 15 to 20 hours as well.  It's a good, long lasting experience and also has a couple of side areas and a lot of good in-universe references for those who played the previous two games.  It's without a doubt a love letter to fans of the series.  There isn't much that keeps it down.  If there were it would be that some of the challenge can be unbalanced.  You'll go through an area that is pretty simple to get through only to find the next area to be too densely populated with enemies that'll kill you easily only because you were unable to get the next armor upgrade.  This doesn't happen too often, and you'll never feel like it's impossible.  But you'll more than likely just start memorizing where enemies will appear more so than anything to help you get by.  There's nothing really ""unfair"" about any death you may suffer, and the weapons are much more balanced than in Going Commando that you won't find yourself constantly running low once you get near the end game.Production values have always been very high in Ratchet and Clank.  The games themselves are gorgeous.  That being said, they were also a little ahead of their time graphically.  Up Your Arsenal doesn't really look that much better than the previous two games.  That's not a bad thing by any stretch as it still looks amazing.  There are more details in some of the environments.  The only thing that might happen from time to time is a slight dip in frame rate whenever there's too much chaos on screen.  The voice acting, however, has been getting progressively better as the series goes along.  There aren't quite as many awkward pauses or shifts as there used to be.  The writing and jokes are also among the best.  The best part of the voice acting ensemble by far is Dr. Nefarious.  He not only has the best lines, but provides the most comedy in the game.  By far he is the best villain that has ever been present in Ratchet and Clank.  The soundtrack itself is also pretty amazing, hosting some catchy tunes and a few epic moments.It's hard to say whether Up Your Arsenal is the best Ratchet and Clank game or not.  It has gone so far to throw everything it can into this game.  Dr. Nefarious is by far the best villain, but it's hard to say if the adventure is as enticing as that of Going Commando.  And this is mostly because Going Commando seemed to have a more interesting story despite Up Your Arsenal having better characters.  Either way, Up Your Arsenal is a great game that shouldn't be missed by any Ratchet and Clank fan, and shouldn't be missed by anyone who likes action platformers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVIMGSXG0SGGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00020LZBG#wasThisHelpful","RVIMGSXG0SGGL","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To put things simple, Ratchet and Clank Going Commando is the sequel I didn't know I wanted until I actually played it.  In my mind there wasn't much the second game needed to do to improve upon the first.  Simple steps were taken to make the experience more enjoyable and more refined.  Small additions made big changes and the package ends up being just about as good (if not better) than the original game.After the events of the first game, Ratchet and Clank became heroes across the galaxy.  A man named Mr. Fizzwidgit manages to get a hold of them in a far off galaxy, however, because he wants the heroes to get back his protopet that has been stolen.  Ratchet will have to undergo training in order to prepare for this mission.  The story is most certainly far better than the first one and presented a lot better as well.  You get the sense that there's actually something going on more so this time around.  Likewise, there are even a few twists and turns.  The story is more complete here with characters interacting a lot more.Much like the first game, Going Commando is set up in a rather linear fashion.  You'll go to other planets where you'll have two or three different paths you can go down, each leading to the objective of various ""missions,"" and all ending with easy ways to get back to your ship.  Because of the much tighter focus on story, however, there are quite a few more places that are more straightforward.  This doesn't mean there isn't much to explore, it simply means that you'll rarely find yourself lost at any given time.  There is plenty of stuff off the beaten path to explore.  You'll be able to collect and find Platinum Bolts or even other hidden gadgets and goodies.  Much like the first you can't really get too far ahead of yourself in any fashion.  You must always find coordinates to go to another galaxy.You'll spend a great deal of time traveling through various locales on foot.  Like before, Ratchet has a ton of weapons and gadgets at his disposal.  You'll begin with a standard Lancer gun and bombs but before you know it you'll also find weapons like the mini turrets that he can set out to blasts his opponents, seeker missiles, chopper stars and more.  If you've got data from the previous Ratchet and Clank then you can also buy those weapons for free.  However, the old additions are no where near as good as the newer ones.  Why bother the bomb glove, for instance, if the Gravity Bomb does the same thing and in a bigger radius?  Likewise, the new gadgets and weapons actually level up and morph into more powerful weapons with use.  The Lancer will eventually turn into the Heavy Lancer while the Gravity Bomb eventually morphs into the Mini-Nuke where it has more power and a bigger blast radius.  The goodies from the original game do not level up at all.There are also a few new gameplay additions and mechanics that make the game overall better.  The weapons leveling up was a nice touch, but other things add to the game as well.  Gun combat, for instance, is a lot simpler because the player now has the ability to strafe left and right and dodge by doing jumps and backflips while in this mode.  This alone makes a lot of the combat moments a lot easier than before.Another thing to mention is that most games when the sequel comes out the characters tend to lose all the abilities from the first game.  Megaman, for instance, never carried over his upgrades from one Mega Man X game to the next.  Ratchet and Clank changes that to a degree.  Many of Ratchets upgrades he got in the first game he either begins with or there's a simple explanation for why he does not have them.  His swing shot and grind boots, for instance, are in Clank's apartment and thus Clank has them.  When Ratchet meets up with Clank he gets his boots and swingshot back.  Likewise, Clank already has his Thruster Pack and Hydropack from the outset.  And yes, Ratchet kept his oxygen mask as well.  It seems like a strange thing to compliment, but I rather liked this as there was no need to find all these things again.  Thus what really happens is that Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando is more about building on the first one more so than anything.  In place are new gadgets for them to use such as the Dynamo which generally makes platforms appear (or move).  The magnetic boots are gone, however and replaced with the Gravity Boots so that he can now jump when stuck to a different surface.  The variety has been increased a lot.The variety has also been changed in other ways.  From time to time there are also now space missions that Ratchet and Clank embark on where they'll pilot their fighter and shoot down waves of fighters.  These levels can also be replayed and the player can attempt challenges as well.  There are overall more side missions than you'd expect as well and the rewards are sometimes worth it.  The biggest addition is the battle arena where you can fight gauntlets of enemies.  Sometimes there will be challenges such as going through a gauntlet only using one weapon.  Another has you trying not to take a single hit of damage.  The rewards is usually bolts, but you'll want that reward more than you know.  In addition to buying weapons, Ratchet can also upgrade his armor and these upgrades are not cheap by any means.  Luckily, you get more bolts than you did in the original game.Not every new addition or change is welcome, however.  In the original game you sometimes came across doors that made you solve a puzzle to get into various rooms.  Those are back here, but they aren't puzzles.  They're mostly mini games built upon the foundation of trial and error.  The Electrolyzer Puzzles, for instance don't really require more than just simply memorizing when you have to change the circuits and the Infiltrator puzzles are ALL about memorization.  They're more of a nuisance than anything that actually resembles fun.Going Commando is also a very challenging game.  Much more so than the first.  Your Nanotech level increases as you kill enemies leaving to have much more than four or five hit points like the first game, but enemies also do various amounts of damage.  What really strikes as odd, however, is that you rarely feel like you have enough ammo to take on the enormous waves of enemies that come your way.  In the final area of the game, for instance, I nearly ran out of ammo in EVERY weapon I had (and they were upgraded).  It seemed overly difficult but for the only reason being that the weapons you have just don't have enough ammo to deal with the hordes of enemies coming your way.  After getting over all those hurdles, however, Going Commando is actually a lot better than the first game because it offers so much more.For the most part Ratchet and Clank Going Commando looks pretty much like the first game.  That's fine by me as the first game is a graphical masterpiece.  There are a few more details in the environments and a lot of creative things, but on a visual level it doesn't look that much better than the first.  But this is fine because it's still a marvelous game and easy on the eyes.  The cartoony like visuals of most games tend to age better than the photorealistic ones.  There's a nice artsy design to this that makes it stand out.  The music, on the other hand, is better than ever.  Going Commando has a much better soundtrack than the first (which was already excellent to begin with) but the real show stopper is the voice acting.  It is better than the first game in every way.  It just sounds more fluid.  Again, the first game didn't actually have bad voice acting, but there's a lot more of it that feels natural here.  The jokes and gags are also quite hilarious making Going Commando just feel like a better package overall.Ratchet and Clank was a hard game to best but Going Commando manages to do so.  Even though it may seem a bit more unfairly difficult at times, it's still a lot of fun.  You never get the sense that it's an impossible game.  At the end of the day, it's just all around fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW4PHKGEHY158/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000099T2E#wasThisHelpful","RW4PHKGEHY158","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Insomniac games is mostly known for creating Spyro the Dragon back on the original Playstation.  And when the PS2 came out, there were probably millions of fans waiting for a follow up to that series on the PS2.  Instead Insomniac Games developed a different kind of tale.  One that would serve as a nice little compliment to Naughty Dog's Jak and Daxter (similar to how Spyro served as a nice compliment to Crash Bandicoot).  It was a game all about weapons, explosions and destruction.  The game was Ratchet and Clank.  It came out in 2002, sold millions of copies and went on to start one of the core franchises on the PS2.  Ratchet and Clank was, and still is, a triumph.Ratchet and Clank begins on Planet Veldin.  Ratchet belongs to a race known as the Lombax.  As he's fixing a ship to one day get off the planet, another ship crashes down.  Checking it out, Ratchet finds nothing more than a small robot.  This is Clank and as it turns out he's carrying an urgent message.  A man by the name of Drek is taking pieces of land from other worlds to rebuild his own.  Leaving the planets he takes from in shambles with no other alternative than to be destroyed or abandoned.  Clank wants to go find the legendary hero Qwark, and fixes the ship Ratchet in exchange for help to find him.  Ratchet, however, doesn't seem to care too much about Drek at the start, but slowly gets involved in the quest anyway.There isn't exactly much story to Ratchet and Clank.  It's not weak storytelling by any means, but the games to follow would do a lot of things so much better.  All the plot twists are pretty obvious twists, for instance.  At the very least the voice acting is great in most areas and there's a good sense of humor about things.  That's not to say there are no hiccups with the storytelling.  The villain is no where near as fun as what the game would produce later on in the series.  Likewise, the story doesn't draw you in nearly as much.  For the Playstation 2, however, it's certainly an achievement with all the right bits falling into place.  For a game made in 2002 there are a lot of beautifully crafted cutscenes that still hold up well, even to this day.  It's like watching a Saturday morning cartoon at times.Ratchet and Clank is well aware that it's greatest strength is not in the storytelling.  It's not Ratchet and Clank's weakness either, but it is to say that Insomniac Games knows that the strength is in the gameplay because it's nearly flawless.  Throughout much of the game you will play as Ratchet.  Though Clank gets small segments.  Ratchet primarily roams with Clank on his back.  You have a nice arsenal of weapons at your disposal.  You'll start off with pretty basic weapons such as the Bomb Glove and Blaster but you'll soon be firing off missiles and planting decoys and using flamethrowers.  The weapons are usually well balanced, enough that none of them will ever become useless as the game goes on, but there is definitely a ""best"" weapon for many situations.  It's interesting to see what all of them do, but you'll no doubt find yourself with a favorite at some point.The game has a pretty simplistic flow to it as well.  You'll often go to various planets and complete specific missions by taking one path or another that leads to the completion of different objectives.  Not EVERY objective must be completed on a planet.  The main goal is usually to find the infobot or use various items to learn the coordinates to another planet where you can continue the journey.  For the most part Ratchet and Clank is quite a linear game as you can never really get too far ahead of yourself.  And as you explore each planet there are plenty of shortcuts that will take you right back to the very beginning where you can get back in your ship and fly to another planet.Ratchet and Clank is not an easy game but it's not too taxing either.  Even if you fail a couple of times you'll start to learn the ins and outs of whereever it is you're not doing so well.  The game is easy to learn but difficult to master.  That being said, you'll rarely feel as though the game is being unfair.  Most danger presents itself early enough that there's no trial and error about it.  There will be some moments that will likely give you trouble but nothing that will keep you down so long you'll quit in frustration.There are small moments where you'll play as Clank and he controls quite differently.  While you'll still be running and jumping, Clank doesn't have weapons.  Rather he controls several tiny bots that can be ordered to attack, wait, follow you or enter into various stations that require it.  It adds a slight puzzle element to the game, but Clank's moments aren't quite as action packed.Ratchet and Clank has a lot to keep you going and it's a well structured game.  The story isn't much, but it's rather enjoyable just the same.  The story isn't really the focus here, the gameplay is.  That's not to say that production values of Ratchet and Clank are bad, though.  By far, Ratchet and Clank is one of the best looking games on the PS2.  And because of its colorful aesthetics still looks good even to this day.  This includes in HD.  There's a lot of life in the universe of Ratchet and Clank.  It's all around easy on the eyes.  The music, however, may be the best part.  There was no slumping on this.  Each planet sounds strangely in tune with the action.  All the moments are lovely and playful when they need to be and a bit darker and more perilous when they need to be as well.  If there's one thing Insomniac games really knows how to do: It's make a good sounding and looking game.For those that love adventure, Ratchet and Clank is nearly a perfect package.  It offers just about everything you want from a solid platformer.  If you enjoy platformers, it's not to be missed.  And it just so happens the HD collection is out there if you happen to have a PS3 and don't want to dust off your PS2.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27RMAF71TF20M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006GSNX#wasThisHelpful","R27RMAF71TF20M","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been known to get my hands on a lot of games and play them.  During the PS2 era I managed to get my hands on a ton of games.  Strangely, however, I never actually picked up Ratchet and Clank.  Despite the games being one of the biggest selling franchises on the PS2, I never got around to playing them.  My first foray into the Lombax's universe and the little robot backpack was playing Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction.  Upon playing that game, I was in pure awe of everything it had to offer.  As I planned to dust off my PS2 and find the previous three games used, I was told by the clerk that perhaps I should wait, as an HD collection was right around the corner.  Sure enough, that collection hit and I got to experience the first three games for the very first time in splendid HD.It has been ten years since Ratchet and Clank debuted, and as I sat there playing the collection I found myself in awe.  They were amazing games.  Games that, with each installment, actually got better and better.  And what was remarkable about this progression was that at no point in time did I ever feel one game had to ""fix"" the flaws of another.  No, rather each new game just adds the right amount of new stuff to keep it interesting and make the experience more rewarding.HD Collections are slowly being debated about in the gaming industry.  But Ratchet and Clank is most certainly one of the better ones.  When it comes to gaming and graphics one little known aspect that is hardly talked about is the aesthetics themselves and how sometimes that is what makes a game hold up.  During the Playstation 2 era a lot of games tried to do character models that were closer to looking photo-realistic or something along those lines.  This makes HD Collections like Metal Gear Solid look great, but their age shows a little bit more.  A game like Ratchet and Clank, however, uses incredibly vibrant colors and cartoon like qualities.  And one thing seems to be certain: These kinds of aesthetics most definitely age better than the ones going for a more ""realistic"" look.  Case in point, if you didn't know the Ratchet and Clank games were originally Playstation 2 titles you might not assume they were right off the bat.  There's A LOT of detail put into these games and they've actually aged rather well.  No, they've got nothing on say... Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, but it's still admirable the amount of detail put into these games.  In crisp HD they're amazing on the eyes.  It is by far one of the best looking HD Collections you can find.  It made that transition smoothly.There are moments where the aspect ratio is still 4:3 and, of course, that can't be helped.  They're pre-rendered cutscenes.  But at the very least these scenes were updated as well.  This is really only noticeable in the first Ratchet and Clank, however.  The sides of your television will be black for these scenes.  However, it's a step up from some HD collections that left their pre-rendered stuff untouched.  There are moments in game, however, where it's still kept at the 4:3 ratio when it could've been stretched.  Again, this mostly noticeable in the first one, as it has a lot of those moments.Gameplay wise, Ratchet and Clank is familiar.  You usually play as Ratchet, running around with Clank on your back.  You'll be able to buy and find an assortment of weapons throughout the entire experience of all three games.  In the first game it's merely finding and equipping them.  But in the second there is more variety and they level up.  By the time you get to the third you'll have a whole host of weapons to play with.  As you move from one game to the next you can also carry over some weapons from one game to the next.  Although with some weapons there isn't much point to carrying them over.  For instance, in Going Commando, you start off with a Gravity Bomb that has a huge blast radius as it is.  There's not much reason to carry over the original Bomb Glove from Ratchet and Clank in this instance.  Often you'll find the new arsenal in each new game better than the last.As with most HD Collections, however, you begin to see how some games have really aged.  Despite just being ten years old, it may take some gamers a bit of time to adjust to some of the controls.  In the instances of swimming it took a moment to adjust.  It also took a moment to adjust to the camera controls and to the idea of pressing the O button to fire when most modern day games rely on using R1.  These are, of course, minor complaints.  Namely because the Ratchet and Clank games were state of the art.  It's just how games were made in 2002.  The controls, for the most part, don't really improve much as you go from one game to another.  This is actually not so bad as once you settle in you'll pretty much be okay for the whole set.  The games aren't long either so you'll easily pass through all of them.  There is trophy support added for those who want it, though, and some of them are quite fun to try for while others just seem silly to go for (collecting 1 million bolts in the first game is just tedious without exploiting a well known glitch).That's not to say everything about the collection is perfect.  There were times when there was some noticeable frame rate issues.  And normally this happens when a game is overcrowded with a lot of data on screen, but this wasn't the case here.  Sometimes the frame rate seemed to dip for essentially no reason.  Likewise, sometimes when the audio would loop it would hiccup for just a second or two.It's actually quite amazing how well the games have aged.  I am sitting here playing these games for the first time after having played Future: Tools of Destruction and it's hard not to be impressed.  Certainly the controls aren't up to speed, but they're still solid and tight that learning them is all that is necessary.  It never really trips you up.  The progression through each planet is also simply amazing.  It's also nice to see how the games evolved in every standpoint.  The production values in the first one are stellar as it is, for instance, and jumping into Going Commando once I was finished with my first adventure showed a major step.  Simply put, each game just kept getting better in every sense of the word.  More weapons.  More variety of levels and exploration.  Other aspects just simply got better.  The cutscenes in each game looked and sounded better.  The voice acting got better with each game.  The writing got better with each game.  The humor got better with each game.  And most important, each new adventure was better.It's hard not to recommend the collection.  All small hiccups aside, these are phenomenal games.  There are hardly any platformers out there that can best Ratchet and Clank.  Many come close but few truly eclipse it in terms of quality and substance.  Not to mention it has moments of just pure action and amazement.  To revisit them in HD or (as is my case) to discover these gems for the first time is well worth the investment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17VNB4BJM4A8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050SXI6K#wasThisHelpful","R17VNB4BJM4A8S","A29BQ6B90Y1R5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29BQ6B90Y1R5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a decent and light cover for your Surface 3, then consider Case Logic Kick Back case. While Surface 3 is made of very sturdy materials (magnesium-alloy and gorilla glass 3), you can certainly add extra protection for the investment you've made.PROS:1. THIN & LIGHT. If you do not want to add bulk, then this case is a great fit. It is thin (1/16"" thin) and light. The case will not make your Surface bulky at all.2. FIT. It fits like a glove. You snap it on, and it holds well. All ports are accessible. MS Type Cover is not hindered.3. PROTECTION. Remember, this case is not designed for a fall (or drop) on the floor. It only protects from ""scratches and bumps"" and it will certainly do well in that area.CONS:1. There is a no Surface Pen holder.2. As said earlier, this case is not drop-proof. If you want to have a case that is a drop-proof, consider Urban Armor Gear. It is more expensive and bulkier, but protects well from the drop - even face down, and also has a Pen holder.3. It is difficult to take the case off. Be careful, when you take the cover off from the kick stand, you might bend the kickstand.Overall, this is a decent case for your Surface 3 - if you do not need comprehensive protection. Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G9EGBISB9S4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013LDVFCY#wasThisHelpful","R2G9EGBISB9S4W","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My kids (10 and 12 yrs old)  love this drone! This is their first drone and they love to play with it.1. SMALL. The drone itself is small (4"" by 4""). The controller is bigger than the drone. So it can fly easily and effortlessly both inside and outside.2. FUN. My kids love to flip the drone while it flies, and love the auto-takeoff and land function. You can fly the drone slowly or fast, giving you more control. Just watch out for pets - they might get scared. Our dog (Maltese) was scared of it - when the drone was chasing him!3. CONTROL. The controller is something that you have to get used to. My kids read and followed the instruction before they were actually good at controlling the drone. It will take a couple of days to get used to it. So tell your kids not to get frustrated. For adults, same applies. At the beginning, I was constantly crashing the drone. But after several tries and attempt, you can fly the drone with no problems.4. DURABILITY. This is something you need to be aware of. Because it flies fast, and it will crash into things, and it will break your propeller protectors AND propellers (they are removable and replaceable - follow the instruction manual). Spare parts come with the box, so it is not all good. But to get extra spare parts, you need to order more.5. PRICE. Compare to other basic drones, the price is little expensive (due to more functions). If the price is not an issue for you, then definitely consider this drone. It is amazing and your kids will love it!This is excellent drone! I gave 4 stars due to price. BUT the fun factor is definitely 5 stars! Highly recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M5UW3YUT3CGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9CEVII#wasThisHelpful","R3M5UW3YUT3CGW","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow. Another excellent Study Bible for believers. I already own ESV Study Bible, Reformation Study Bible (2015 edition), MacArthur Study Bible, and KJV Reformation Heritage Study Bible. And they are all excellent study Bibles. So to decide which one is better, it really comes down to ones own preference. If your primary version is NIV, then this Study Bible will fit the bill. Even if your primary version is not NIV, you will still find the study notes enriching.1. THICK & HEAVY. It weighs 5 lbs and measures 9  x 6  x 2  inches. It will be difficult to carry it around. It is best used at home as a reference for your devotion and personal Bible study. However, if you own a smartphone then you will have digital access to its content for free, instead of carrying the Bible.2. SMYTH-SEWN. Yes, this Study Bible is stitched and not glued to the spine like many Bibles today. So this is very durable. It will lay open flat.3. HELPFUL CHARTS & ILLUTRATIONS. There are numerous helpful charts, color photos, maps, and diagrams scattered throughout the Bible. They are helpful, interesting, and insightful. The maps and photos are easy on the eyes.4. PRINT & FONT. The print quality is superb  while the font is small (both the text and the notes), but because it is dark, it is easily legible. And they are consistently even throughout the Bible.5. CONTENT. The quality of the study notes varies from a scholar to scholar  but this is to be expected from all Study Bibles. All in all, the notes and the articles are solid and helpful to understand the Bible. As the cover states, Built on the Truth of Scripture and Centered on the Gospel Message  it strives to be gospel-centered in its notes. DA Carson (general editor) is a well-known and respected Bible scholar who is involved in Gospel Coalition. And there are other reputable scholars who contributed to the study notes (Douglas Moo, Craig L. Blomberg, Bruce K. Waltke, etc). The articles are short but helpful, written by several well-known authors (Tim Keller, Kevin DeYoung, Sam Storms, Moises Silva, etc).6. DIGITAL ACCESS. As noted earlier, since many will find it difficult to carry the study Bible around, using smartphones will bridge the gap. It comes with FREE Digital Access Code at the back of the Bible (inside the back cover). HOWEVER, be careful when you scratch off for the access code, you might erase the code itself! The film on it is too strong, so it can be wiped out with the code. It happened to me. I cannot use the digital access since I do not have the full code.All in all, this is an excellent study Bible for anyone who wants to know the Bible more. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NWDX1QUZQDHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310438330#wasThisHelpful","R2NWDX1QUZQDHF","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is NON-Technical review for those who are considering top-end cable modem/router. Since there are many excellent reviews already, I'll just add a couple of my 2 cents.1. SETUP. This can be either frustrating or easy depends on your Internet provider. I have Xfinity, and it was not as bad as I thought, I followed the Quick Installation guide carefully and it worked, after a second try (do not know why it didn't work the first time).2. STURDINESS. This modem/router is very sturdy. It is bigger than I expected, although it doesn't take much space (due to high tower design). It seems durable and quality made. TP-Link products have been excellent in my experience - ALL TP-Link products I own have performed as advertised or better than I expected, so I trust the name.3. FAST. The speed was as advertised. Both upload/download speed was far faster than my previous modem and router. Movies stream faster and downloading was much faster than my previous one. So if you are looking for fast cable modem/router combo product, this is probably one of the most decent ones out there.4. PRICE. OK, this is where you might have to decide whether this is worth it. You could purchase BOTH basic cable modem and router separately for $100.00. This was what I have done. I did not want to pay monthly charge for my cable modem, so I purchased one for $49.99 and also bought decent router for $50.00. And it met all my family needs (4 smartphones, 3 tablets, 4 laptops). We were good overall. So if you do NOT NEED high end speed, then purchasing them separately might be better option.5. NO DSL. One of the drawbacks for this kind of cable modem/router combo products is that it will NOT work with DSL modems. If you decide to switch to DSL, then you cannot use this product at all. But if you purchase cable modem and router (both cable and dsl ready) separately, you have the option to use the router.All in all, this is a great product for cable modem/router users. But for some, this is cost prohibitive (that's why 4 stars). But of the cost is not an issue, then this will be a great product for you. Highly Recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ8SCD0GZGXGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012I96J3W#wasThisHelpful","RQ8SCD0GZGXGW","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The benefit of vitamin supplements is still being debated. My friend, who is a nurse, told me that 75% of the vitamins are not absorbed in the stomach and passes through. In other words, it has minimum benefit. Then there are those who by experience, the vitamin supplements are helping them.The BEST way to get vitamins is through foods. Generally, if you eat healthy, then the food you eat will provide sufficient vitamins you need. But if your lifestyle is such that healthy diet is not feasible, then certainly taking vitamins will help (even though only a little). Doctors also warned that taking too much vitamins is not good for you. Vitamin-supplements cannot REPLACE your food.IF you must take vitamins, then consider food based vitamins, and not synthetic ones. Food based vitamins get their vitamins from food, but synthetic vitamins are produced in the laboratories.This Green Source Multivitamin is food based, therefore it is easily absorbed in your body and processed. Because it is food based, once you open up the bottle, you must store it in the refrigerator. One serving is 3 caplets, so even though it has 240 pills, it is worth of 80 days.I did note the spike in energy level the first time I used it (3 caplets), I had not expectation, but it made me less tired throughout the day. But after few days, you cannot tell the difference, because your body is now used to it.Overall, Green Source Multi-vitamin works better than synthetic ones. But I give 4 stars, because of the price. It is a bit expensive. If you have to take vitamins, and the price is not the important thing, then this one might work for you.

"Many of us already own some kind of electronic brush over manual ones. But Braun Oral-B and Philips Sonicare are two well-known electronic tooth brushes on the market. But which is one is better? Well, that is up to you - up to your preference. Both are much better than manual ones. Some prefer Oral-B, others Sonicare. The difference lies in their mode of cleaning. Oral-B uses oscillation and Sonicare uses vibration. As for Sonicare Healthy White+:1. THOROUGH Cleaning. If you follow the instruction, you will feel the cleanness of your teeth. NOTE: The instruction recommends to place the bristles against the teeth at a slight angle (45 degrees), pressing firmly to make the bristles reach the gumline or slightly beneath the gumline for thorough cleaning.2. TWO Brushing Modes. Clean Mode (default mode)  cleanses the whole mouth (2 mins, divided into 4  30 second timer), focuses on plaque removal. White Mode is longer than 2 mins and focuses on polishing and brightening your front teeth. Indeed, I have tried it for 3 weeks (though, you can see it 1 week) and my teeth does seem to be whiter (ie, not bleached white, but polished)  and I am an avid coffee drinker!3. LONG Battery Life. Compared to my Oral-B electronic tooth brush, Sonicare holds the charge longer by few days. In one month use, I have only recharged once.4. TRAVEL Case & Hygienic Travel Cap. This is great for your travel. The case is handsome looking and holds everything you need.I am an Oral-B user for years. It has done well. And I have tried Sonicare for one full month and I can see why people like it (my wife uses it). I see strengths for both products. Sonicare feels gentler than Oral-B. But they BOTH clean well. If you prefer gentler feeling of cleaning and simple electronic tooth brush then, consider this wonderful product.

"I like grilling, but sometimes both gas and charcoal grilling can be too much hassle. Also, for obvious reasons you cannot grill inside your home. This George Foreman grill does not replace your tried-and-true gas/charcoal grills. But it is a great alternative or addition to what you already own.POSITIVES:1. Easy to Cook and Grill. Its built-in Temperature Setting (1-5) helps you to cook in proper setting. For meats (steak, salmon, and hamburgers, etc) are set to ""5"" according to the cooking chart (in their website), and hot dogs, boneless pork chops, thin fish fillets, and various vegetables are set for ""4."" And because it is electric grill, the heat is evenly distributed and fast, ensuring thorough cook of the meat. I grilled frozen hamburger patties and they were cooked fast and evenly.2. Easy to Clean. Because the grill top is ceramic coated, it is much easier to clean than metal ones. Just wet paper towel or a wet sponge easily removes grill residues from the plate.3. Easy to Use Indoor or Outdoor. During winter, or any other occasion where outdoor grill is not feasible, this grill can be easily removed from the stand, and be placed on the island for easy grilling.4. Easy to Assemble. Although the assembly instruction does not have a diagram, if you follow the instruction, you will be OK. Assembly took only 5 minutes. BUT I do wish that the manual had a diagram for assembly.NEGATIVES.1. Although it is not a big deal for me, clamshell design of the lid/cover would have been better. When you have to use two hands, you need to place the cover somewhere else. A bit inconvenient.2. It feels flimsy. This does not mean cheap. The materials seem to be good, not great, but good. But due to single stand with four pedestal feet, it does move (or wobble a little). But it will not tip or tilt over.3. Lack of cooking instruction/manual. The provided manual did not have temperature setting instruction or a cooking chart. So initially, I did not know the setting 1-5 meant. But visiting their website, I was able to print out the cooking chart for this model. Visit: georgeforemancooking.com . Then: click ""Grills"" --> ""Indoor/Outdoor Grills"" --> ""12+ Serving Indoor/Outdoor Electric Grill"" --> scroll down a little and Click on ""GFO201RX Use and Care Manual"" --> from pages 6 - 9, you will find a cooking chart and recipes. You can download its .pdf file and print it out.All in all, this is a decent sized (a family of 4) electric grill that can be used inside and outside. It cooks well, fast, easy to clean, and convenient.

"Eton is known for producing quality emergency radios. First to produce shortwave radio (1986) and first to produce hand-crank emergency radio (2002). It also partners with Red Cross to produce these radios. As for this model FR1, it comes with many features that will be handy during emergency situations. Great for any family or even a college student who is away.1. COMPACT. It measures 2 1/2"" (w) x 5 1/4"" (h) x 1 5/8"" (d). It could be stored anywhere. In your family emergency kit or in a tool box.2. STURDY. Being compact does not mean cheap. It is made of strong plastic. It will withstand casual bumps and bruises. BUT it is not shatterproof or waterproof. Best used in indoors or outside away from exposure to rain or snow.3. GREAT FEATURES. This little thing has: [1] LED Flash Light, [2] Digital FM/AM/WB (Weather Band) channels, [3] DC Rechargeable micro USB port, [4] Hand-crank power, [5] USB connector for your smartphones, [6] Headphone jack and [7] Antenna.4. NOAA (National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration) Weather Band adjusts to your local weather station. The information is clear and up to the minute data. Great to have during power outages due to severe weather or natural disaster.5. DIGITAL BANDS. FM/AM/WB are adjusted with digital bands. It is easier and accurate. You will receive clear sounds. All channels come through clearly.6. HAND-CRANK. Initially I wasn't sure whether it will hold. The handle is thin (1/8"") with a knob at the end. BUT I soon discovered that the plastic while thin, was very strong and well grooved into the radio for support. It was easy to turn, but it will make a high pitched noise. I was able to turn for 4 mins without breaking anything and it did charge the radio.All in all, this is a great item for your emergency kit. Whether in your house, garage, glove box, or tool chest, this Eton FR1 is a must!

"DISCLAIMER: The effectiveness of any supplement depends on various factors, such as, one's physiological make up, age, diet, and health. Therefore my review is based on one who is 48 years old, non-smoker, non-drinker, and who works out 3 times a week. Your result may vary.I always liked Cellucor products because they were effective and did not cause any side effect on my body. Perhaps you have used several products too and found something that worked for you. For me, Cellucor products are safe bet. For this product, SuperHD Thermogenic Fat Burner has been very good. Let me briefly explain:PROS:1. After 2 days of use, my body quickly adjusted. You should expect that first two days, you may feel slight jitters. So take one pill a day. So that your body will become use to it. After that, taking 1 pill in the morning (before breakfast), and 2nd pill in the afternoon will help you burn calories throughout the day.2. You will be alert, due to caffeine in the product. I did not have any headaches or stomach discomfort when I took the pills. So it was easy.3. It energized my workouts: both in cardio and strength exercises. I didn't feel sluggish (as I often feel when I work out), and I was able to focus and push through the workouts.4. I didn't crash after the workout. I felt energized throughout the day.NOTES:1. I felt that it could have been stronger in dosage. But I could see that Cellucor was on the side of caution.2. This supplement WILL NOT automatically make you lose weight. You must have healthy diet and regular workout regimen in order to see some results.All in all, happy with the product.

"This is overall comfortable and decent task chair. But if you prefer tighter chair, then this is not it. If you are shorter than 5' 8"" tall, then this task chair might be little big for you.  NOTE: The assembly required.1. COMFORTABLE. The mesh and the cushion are very comfortable. I did not feel fatigued or felt numbness on my buttocks or legs. And my back was cool  mesh being breathable.2. LUMBAR SUPPORT. I hurt lower back a couple of months ago [lumbar strain], and I needed a good support on my lower back. And this chair provides that needed lumbar support. Also, it is adjustable, so you can choose the best position for your lower back. Unlike other lumbar support, this does not dig into your back.3. REMOVABLE/ADJUSTABLE ARMS. This is removable and the height is adjustable. This is a great option for those who needs arm support. The plastic is strong and well-made.4. TILTED BACK. Unlike some other chairs, this has a tilted back design to relieve your back pain or just to relax your back.5. SMOOTH. The base (5 star designed) is sturdy and does not creak, it moves smoothly as you turn and move around the floor.The only concern is that this task chair might be too big for some. The depth of the chair might be little too deep for some users. If you put your back and hips all the way to the mesh, then the edge of the chair might lift your knees. And this can cause some fit issue.Best thing is that you visit one of the office supply stores and sit on some similar chairs for most comfortable sized chair and then order one online.However, the product itself is sturdy, comfortable, and well made.

"If you own a Surface 3, then you want to protect your investment. While Surface 3 is pretty sturdy (chassis is made of magnesium alloy and the screen is protected with Gorilla Glass), still if you want to protect further, then this Urban Armor Gear case is best bet. Compared to other cases out there, this case will definitely protect your Surface 3 from drops and abuses.1. FIT. The fit is perfect. All your buttons, cameras and ports are accessible. Buttons are covered, while ports and cameras are not. This is good design. It fits like a glove.2. FEEL. When you fit your Surface 3 in it, it feels real good and solid to hold. Not slippery at all. The ""Frog Skin Grip"" really helps to maintain the control of Surface 3 with ease.3. PROTECTION. It claims to have ""military standard"" in drop testing (810G-516.6), and it means it protects well from the shock (516.6) when dropped from 30"" to 48"" high to the concrete ground (tested 26 drops of corners, front and back, and side). You can clearly see that the corners are reinforced with thicker ratio. In short, as of now, there is no sturdier case than this one for your Surface 3. You will feel at ease.4. 3-POSITION STAND. It works well, but you still feel that if used a lot, it may break. Don't get me wrong, both the aluminum stand and plastic hinge are strong and not cheap, but you just feel that compared to the rest of the case, it might be vulnerable. So do not apply too much pressure when you adjust your stand.5. STYLUS (PEN) HOLDER. This is clearly well thought out design. Since Surface 3 (or Surface 3 Type Cover) do not have pen holder, this is a great option for those who carry the pen.6. KEYBOARD BUNGEE. You will notice an elastic band on the top right corner of the case, that is for your Type Cover when closed to hold the tablet and keyboard together without getting loose. BUT after 2 days later, it broke. The end of band is not solidly connected to the plastic tab. The elastic band itself is strong, but the end that is connected to the tab (that you can pull) is weak.7. WEIGHT & THICKNESS. The case does add some weight to the Surface 3. You can definitely feel the heaviness and the thickness. If this matters to you a lot, then you might want to consider lighter case or just be very careful with your S3 without the case. Surface 3 without the case is still very durable compare to other netbooks or ultrabooks.All in all this is a great case for your Surface 3. Well designed with maximum protection for your Surface 3.

"This is a premium case for your Lumia 635. I have cheaper cases (made of TPU), and they are decent. But this case definitely adds more protection and premium feeling.1. Very Sturdy. D3O compound is a shock absorbing material that is unparalleled. Much stronger than TPUs alone. This case will protect your phone very, very well.2. All buttons and ports are accessible. Buttons are covered, so they might be hard to press for some, but I prefer the hard press - because I do not want my phone to accidentally turned on in my pocket - which happened occasionally with TPU cases.3. If you drop the phone, the back-cover (shell) will pop out with the case. This happened with other cases. HINT. Use double sided Scotch tape inside the shell to hold the phone (make sure you do not place the tape on the battery, speaker, or a sensor). Since the tape, the back shell does not pop out when dropped.4. The case is slightly raised above the screen (but not too much), so you can put the phone - face down. But it protects minimally. If you want to protect the screen more, then you might want to consider the other cases (ie, wallet type of case).All in all, I am very pleased with this case. Sure it is more expensive than those TPU cases, but it is better case.

"My eeePC 1000HA has been a great little netbook for my work. I have invested: Windows 7 Home Premium (retail), SSD (128GB), and 2GB RAM on it. And it has been an excellent portable netbook. Then I dropped it on a concrete, and the screen though not shatter3ed, the display showed vertical lines - so I knew it was broken.And I found this replacement screen for less than $45.00 (including S&H). The screen was perfect, it fits perfectly and had no dead pixels! It was matte screen like the original. BUT note that this company may send you a glossy screen if the matte screen is not available. So make sure you contact your seller for your preference.You can easily replace the screen. Just google ""How to replace asus eeepc 1000HA screen"" - you will find various youtube video instructions. Choose the one that you like. It took about 15 minutes to replace the screen.Happy with the result and highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31QDI65IG1429/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TP2MI6#wasThisHelpful","R31QDI65IG1429","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this Study Bible almost in every way, but the print quality is less than average. If you are considering this Study Bible, most likely because you are familiar with R.C. Sproul and/or Reformed Theology. I have several Study Bibles (ESV Study Bible, The Reformation Heritage KJV Study Bible, and MacArthur Study Bible), so I can compare them side by side.PROS:1. ATTRACTIVE BINDING & SLIP CASE. [a] It is Smyth-sewn binding (pages are stitched and not glued to the spine). This is rare these days. For the record, both ESVSB and RHKJVSB are also Smyth-sewn. [b] The slip case is strong and appealing. [c] The ""Welcome to the Reformation Study Bible"" booklet is a great bonus that explains how the Study Bible came about with nice quotes from Reformers of the past. Do not lose this - you  will need it to register to use its web resources - you will be able to download FREE ebooks (epub or mobi), such as: Everyone's A Theologian (by RC Sproul), In Christ Alone (by Sinclair Ferguson), and The Daring Mission of William Tyndale (by Steven Lawson). And other resources include: 6 month DIGITAL Table Talk access. NOTE: registration number is CASE Sensitive.2. CONTENT. [a] it is thoroughly revised and updated from previous Reformation Study Bible (aka New Geneva Study Bible). It has ""1.1 million words of verse-by-verse and topical explanations."" Much more (40% more) study notes than the previous edition. [b] Thoroughly Reformed study notes. This study Bible consistently interprets the Bible in historically Reformed perspective, being faithful to Reformers' views. ESVSB & MSB are Reformed in Soteriology (doctrine of salvation), but not necessarily in Eschatology or baptism. [c] It also includes Reformed Confessions: Heidelberg, Belgic, Dort, Westminster, and London Baptist, etc. This is helpful collection of historical Reformed confessions and catechisms. [d] The extensiveness of the notes (total 2534 pages) fall into somewhere between ESVSB (total 2750 pages) and RHKJVSB (total 2217 pages). Indeed, I do find ESVSB notes more comprehensive than RSB notes but not by much.3. MAPS. It comes with colored maps at the back, and B&W maps in the study notes. The colored maps are welcomed addition (since it was absent from previous edition). But the smaller B&W maps in the notes are challenging to read. Some may find them too small.4. THREE-COLUMN STUDY NOTES. This is actually an amazing design. I find 3-column study notes easier to read than 2-column study notes.CONS:1. There is ONLY ONE major issue with this Study Bible. The print quality is not in par with ESVSB or RHKJVSB. The fonts are really light and faint compared to other Study Bibles. Both ESVSB & RHKJVSB are still legible because the prints are relatively clear and dark.2. So due to its faint print quality, I cannot read it too long, sadly. So if you wear glasses (or reading glasses), you might struggle to read at some point. I am actually looking forward to read it in computer, if it makes available in Kindle edition or online edition.All in all, this is a great study Bible despite the poor print quality. However, it will not nullify its excellent content!

"My wife and I are Windows Phone users (Lumia 635, Lumia 925, and HTC 8X). And when I got BLU (Bold Like Us) Vivo Air, my wife wanted to try it out because it was light and thin. After trying it out for a month, she decided to keep on using it much to my dismay. BUT to be fair (even from a Windows Phone user), this Vivo Air is an excellent mid-entry Android phone.PROS:1. THIN & LIGHT. This is one of the best features for this product. It only weighs .21 lbs (97 grams) and 1/8 inches (5.1 mm). This is very unusual for this price range. This is a welcome feature for those who do not want to pay premium price for it.2. EXCELLENT BUILD QUALITY. Usually, when it is this thin and light, the toughness of it is often compromised. But not with Vivo Air. It is built from magnesium alloy frame and has Gorilla glass 3 on the front and back. So this is a one tough hardware. It will withstand daily abuses.3. DISPLAY. It features 4.8-inch 720p Super AMOLED, and it looks better than Lumia 925 screen. My wife prefers it over L925 screen. While not a high end display, it is clearly better than the most at this price range. It displays clear, rich, and sharp images and texts.4. CAMERA. Camera while not the high end, it certainly is not bad at all. It takes decent pictures both inside and outside. Since it comes with front facing (5mp  great for selfies) and back camera with flash (8mp  average for this price range), you will not miss any important shots with friends and family.5. POWER. It comes with Octa-core (8 Core) CPU by MediaTek (up and coming Taiwanese company that is popular in Asia) is plenty strong for daily use. The MediaTek is the first company to innovate True Octacore CPU that processes 8 cores concurrently unlike other octa core (that uses 4 cores at a time). So even though it only comes with 1 GB RAM, your multitasking will be smooth overall. It is faster than Lumia 925.6. ACCESSORIES. The box comes with all that you need. It includes TPU case  that fits Vivo Air perfectly, 1 screen protector (since it comes with only 1, make sure you do not make mistake when you put it on), a headset (a decent quality) and a charger. I love the case, because it also covers the ports when not in use.CONS:1. No micro SD CARD slot. So you are stuck with 16GB internal storage. So if you need more than 16GB storage, then you need to look elsewhere.2. 1GB RAM. While for most users 1GB with Octacore will be enough, it will not be for power users. Especially if you use a lot of apps.3. Android quirkiness. Android OS, even with the higher end, you often see stuttering or lag, but this is not a hardware fault  so you cannot blame BLU. But Android is getting better and better with each release. Vivo Air comes with Kit Kat, but the company promised that there will be an update (Lollipop) for Vivo Air soon.My wife loves it over Lumia 925  despite some minor problems. Indeed, it is a handsome smartphone. If you are already using Android, but looking for something that is thin and light yet powerful but inexpensive, then BLU Vivo Air might be what you are looking for.

"I like this product in every way, except for one area (that's why I gave 4 stars). Let me be brief:PROS:1. The quality of the product is excellent. I cannot find any particular fault in it. From the board to the ball, they are made from superior materials. The backboard is shatter proof, the steel rim is strong and thick for the size, and the ball is tight and heavy (when inflated). In short, it is not cheap.2. It easily hangs on the door as well on the wall (presumably on the wall studs or on the wooden panel, needs to be screwed in).3. My son (11 years old) loves it! If your kids are into basketball, this will definitely bring joy to your kids.CONS.1. Now, if you live in an apartment (2nd floor and above), be warned that tenant below you, will complain. The ball is very heavy (made from dense rubber - just like the regular basketball, except it is only 10"" in diameter), therefore when your kid bounce the ball on the floor, you will hear loud pounding. I own a house, and I don't even like the sound. So I replaced the ball with same sized Nerf basketball. But this will diminish the fun factor for kids.2. Because of above issue, it is best suited for basement or outside. Since every home/apartment is different, you must adjust accordingly.All in all, this is a great product, but if you like to be quiet in the house, you may want to replace the ball with Nerf basketball. Kids will still enjoy it immensely.

"This is indeed genuine OEM Nokia back cover for Lumia 635. Only thing that is missing was the black strip pad inside the cover [you can see it in the picture]. Other than that, the cover is genuine and it fits perfectly with my AT&T Lumia 635.1. White shell gives you the premium look. Additionally, if you have a clear (transparent) TPU case, then logo ""nokia"" is seen in the back.2. Shipping will take few weeks (it is shipped from China). But it is worth the wait.3. It is great to have the option to change the back cover depending on the mood of the day.Overall, very satisfied.

"Personally I use NASB & ESV the most for my studies, but I love NLT for just reading it for pleasure. Because it is easy to understand I have purchased two of them to give my children (9 and 11 years old) to do their QT (Quiet Time). They love the Bible!1. The Bible is attractive (mine is ""Black/Onyx Leather Like"" edition). The Imitation leather is supple and soft, and it is not hard at all. Easy to hold and nicely designed overall. Pages are silver gilded and not gold. More modern it seems.2. The Font is Great! Because this is a compact edition, the Bible is portable (measures 5"" x 7 1/4"" x 1 1/4""), but the font is plenty large (8.75) for a compact edition - where you can read the Bible comfortably without squinting.3. Printed in Italy. Quality printing from the first page to the last. The print density is even throughout the Bible (some Bibles have darker prints in one page, and lighter print the next, but I did not notice that in this Bible).4. Not a Reference Bible. If you are looking for a reference Bible, then this edition is not it. It does not have cross reference, or any other study materials. But it does have textual notes at the bottom of the pages, and comes with concordance/dictionary and maps.5. Not Smyth-sewn (stitched) binding. This is the ONLY flaw I find in this Bible. Like many Bibles today, pages are glued to the spine and not stitched. Stitched binding lasts longer and the pages do not fall out. However, it seems that pages are solidly glued to the spine, therefore it should last a long time.Overall, I love the Bible! Great for pleasure reading of the word of God and excellent for kids! Because of the binding, it is almost perfect.

"I have been using Sakura Micron pens for last 28 years for marking my Bibles and taking notes in the margins of the Bible. It does not bleed through the Bible pages (and Bible pages are real thin), and even after 28 years, I can still read clearly what I wrote on the margins of the Bible. The tip of the pen is so thin, it takes some conscious effort to write it without pressuring the tip too hard. For my note taking in the Bible, Micron 005 (.20mm) is the best. Because it is thin, you can write more on the margin, and because it doesn't smudge or bleed through, your notes remain clean without fading. So if you take notes or underline in your Bibles, then this is the best pen out there.

"Like many I love my Stream 7.But I do not enjoy typing long emails or docs in onscreen keyboard. It limits the screen area in half, and is difficult to type fast. So I needed something that I can type fast and feels like a real keyboard. After researching little bit, I came to choose Infiland product. This comes with both the case and the Bluetooth keyboard. I was somewhat skeptical in the beginning about the keyboard, but after I received it, I was totally amazed by the quality. Let me be brief:1. THE CASE. the case feels like a leather, but it is not. It feels good in your hands. Protects Stream 7 really well. All the ports, cameras, and buttons are accessible. Power button is slightly covered but does not limit your access. The Velcro that holds the tablet is strong and sturdy. The case is not thin, therefore it provides good protection. The case is single stitched throughout, I was hoping that it was double stitched, but still it is strong. There was no instruction for the case, so you have to play with it a little or look at the product pictures at Amazon. All in all, the case is well made.2. THE KEYBOARD. Wow. I cannot believe they can actually make a keyboard this thin. It is in Chiclet styled keyboard, and you can actually type with two hands easily (I am actually writing this review on it!). The User's Guide provides excellent instruction to charge the keyboard and how to connect the keyboard with your tablet or your smartphone. It fits into the CASE nicely and sturdy. The ""ON"" and ""OFF"" button works flawlessly and can easily save your battery when not in use. It connected to my Stream 7 quickly and worked immediately. I was able to work on my Word document with ease. However because it is small, certain key placements you might have to get used to. For example: The ""delete"" key is next to ""P"" and apostrophe is ""fn""+""<"" and the quote ("" "") is function + ""L"" etc. Except for this minor issue, the keyboard is excellent. I can actually do my work!All in all, this is a great product for your Stream 7, especially if you are going to do some work.

"One of the best entry Windows Phones. Period. I own HTC 8X, Lumia 520, 1020, and my wife has 925. Lumia 520 is a great phone, no doubt. But Lumia 635 (I bought it because it was on sale for $39.99) is an incredible value for those who do not want premium phone and do not take selfies. Since there are already many excellent reviews, I just want to add my two cents:1. FAST. While it comes with 512MB RAM, because it is a QUAD core, it is much much faster than Lumia 520. I compared with my HTC 8X and most of the apps open at the same time, and the web experience was actually slightly faster than 8X to my surprise! So you will not be disappointed. L635 comes with LTE speed so it is pretty fast where there is no WiFi available. See [Hint 2] below for enabling LTE.2. BATTERY LIFE. I used it for almost 2 days. email, texts, few calls, and some web browsing lasted me 2 days. But I set the brightness to ""LOW"" and turned off the apps that work in the background.3. DISPLAY. Certainly at this price range, I do not expect to compete with HTC 8X, but it is decent. Gorilla glass 3 is a huge bonus! I dropped the phone from waste high to the concrete floor in gas station, the back cover popped out, but the screen was not cracked, but the screen protector was scratched. So the Gorilla glass 3 is definitely strong! Also, at least personally, setting the background ""light"" instead of ""dark"" helped to improve its display. Perhaps you should try it [settings -> start+theme -> background -> select ""light""]4. BRIGHTNESS. Now it does not have ""automatic brightness sensor"" like Lumia 520, but you can control the brightness of each of ""low,"" ""medium,"" and ""high"" setting. Now if you see that your ""low"" setting is too low for you but ""medium"" is a little too bright, then you can control the brightness of ""low"" setting to make it brighter. Adjust it accordingly [Settings -> display -> Brightness profile -> click ""adjust"" -> move the bar at ""low level (currently selected).""]5. SOUND. Both calls and music sound are average. They are  clear, but not as clear or rich as 8X or 925. But for a budget phone, this is normal.[HINT: If dropped, the back cover of the phone will pop out even if you have the case put on. To prevent this, use DOUBLE-SIDED scotch tape inside the cover. It will prevent the cover from popping out when dropped. But make sure that you do not cover the sensors or speakers. I put the tape right below the battery and above the speaker].[HINT 2: Enabling LTE. Initially, you will only see 4G speed, but make a call to your friend or a family member from your L635 and speak on the phone for 10 minutes, then within few hours, you will see LTE signal. Additionally, your visual voicemail (vvm) will be enabled - if you have the plan for it].All in all, this is a great entry phone (or backup phone) for those who just want basic smartphone. But if you know Windows Phone, the OS does so much more. It is dependable OS, and at the end of the day, that's what we all want. And I have been using L635 as my daily driver.

"Most of us have all-in-one printers that can copy, fax, and scan. These are indeed useful because they are multifunction printers that can do what most of us need. But these are ""jack of all trades, master of none"" type of machines. If you need a high quality scanner that is inexpensive then seriously consider Canon LiDE 220 Scanner.1. EASY to SETUP. Just plug and play. Connect the USB cable (provided) to your PC or laptop , Windows 8, & 8.1 will automatically install the driver for you and after the restart, you can start scanning your photos, docs, etc. using Windows scanning tool [go to LiDE220 icon and right click and choose ""start scan""]. But If you have Windows 7, you need to install the driver via provided CD or Windows Update. But if you want to use the scanner buttons ""PDF,"" ""AUTO SCAN,"" ""COPY,"" and ""SEND"" then you need to install the software CD that came with it. Just install the program and run it, then you will be able to use ALL the functions of the scanner.2. NO POWER ADAPTER. The scanner is powered up when you connect it to your PC via USB cable. It does not need AC adapter! This is so simple and frees your desk from cables and clutter. I found this feature extremely useful in moving it from room to room. So unlike mutilfunction printers, you can unplug the scanner and store it away until you need it again. Its lightness and portability makes this product ideal.3. FAST. The scanning speed is fast. I tested it on i5 Core PC (Asus Zenbook, Win 8.1) and on netbook (Asus 1000HA, Win 7), and they were both fast! I was impressed how fast the scanning was.4. QUIET. The scanning was also quieter than the multifunction copiers.5. INCREDIBLE COLORS & DETAIL. My multifunction copiers (I have 2) produce average color reproduction - it is not vivid or even close to original. But this Canon LiDE 220 scans the color almost perfectly. Yes, this is not a high-end scanner, but considering the price, this is a great value for those who want more than all-in-one printer scanner. So if you want to treasure your old pictures with original detail, this scanner will do a great job.6. SEND TO CLOUD. This feature you will need to install the software CD that came with the product. Follow the instruction on how to send to the cloud, such as OneDrive or DropBox. Sending the scanned items to the cloud is a great idea to backup and share with others.All in all, if you are looking to save old pictures, documents, writings, or any other items in their original colors and details, then LiDE 220 is an excellent value and choice for you.

"Fits perfectly with Stream 7. Slightly on the expensive side, but worth it.1. QUALITY PROTECTOR. It is made in the U.S.A and uses superior material. It is Anti-fingerprint (it does not mean it will have no finger prints, it means it is greatly reduced), Anti-bubble (if you follow the instruction, you should not have any bubble on the screen), Anti-bacterial, scratch-resistant, and oil-resistant. You will be pleased with the quality.2. BLUE LIGHT TECHNOLOGY. This is NOT 100% clear screen protector. It has very light colored hue on the screen protector. Personally, I like it, because it seems to diminish glossy effect of the screen. It claims that ""the protector features the newest Blue Light technology, which reduces eye strain and fatigue by blocking up to 32% of harmful blue light emitted from device."" It looks matte without being a matte screen. Not everyone will prefer it, so choose accordingly.3. INSTRUCTION. It comes with clearly explained instruction to install the protector. HINT: Clean your screen with a cotton pad with rubbing alcohol, it will remove all the oil residues from the screen and the protector will stick so much better.All in all this is a great screen protector for your Stream 7.

"There are many Bluetooth Sports headsets out there and they are not bad. But this Sony product is worthy of serious consideration for those who wear during workouts and even in wet conditions. Now this product is NOT perfect, but it is pretty close.PROS:1. HIGH QUALITY MATERIALS. When you open the box, you immediately notice the quality of its materials. From replaceable ear buds, plastic headsets, to USB cord are durable, solid and have that premium feeling. This is not made of cheap materials.2. MP3 PLAYER + BLUETOOTH PLAYER. This is what makes this product excellent. You do not need your smartphone to listen to your music while you work out all the time. You can either choose to listen to your music via Bluetooth connected devices (smartphones, tablets, etc), or straight from the headset - because MP3 player is built in. It has 4GB storage where you can store decent amount of songs of your choice. [NOTE: to store your songs, EITHER you can use the software that came with it (you need to connect the headset to your PC and open the folder ""FOR WINDOWS"" and double click ""Help Guide Installer"" and follow the instruction)] OR just DRAG & DROP your songs into ""MUSIC"" folder and that's it [NOTE: If you drag & drop a folder of albums that contain your songs, it will only play one song from the album. You need to drag & drop songs (not the folder) to the MUSIC folder].3. MUSIC QUALITY. If you are playing MP3 player, then songs are great! You can really hear the wide range of notes clearly and fully. But if you connect to Bluetooth devices, it is not as rich or fuller compared to MP3. So make sure you store your favorite songs or music into MP3 player as much as possible.4. WATER PROOF. Yes, when you put on swimming earbuds, then you it is water resistant. I took a shower with it, and I did not see any issues. Also I ran in the rain, and it had no issues. But I did not swim with it.5. FIT. The headset fits securely and tightly. I was pleased by its secure placement. BUT the length of wrap around cord (between ""L"" and ""R"" earbuds) might be too short for some who have larger heads thus it will be a real tight fit.6. REMOTE. There is a remote control where you can place it on your finger, it works well, but it can hinder other activities. I have short and thick fingers and when I put the remote on and tried to type a keyboard, it hindered my movement. But others I am sure will find it useful. A great option to have.CONS:1. You can only charge the headset via USB port. The headset does not have Micro USB port so you cannot use your typical AC adapter that has micro USB connector to charge your device directly. But you can use with a wall charger that has USB ports.2. Automated information voices and beeps can be loud. The beeps pierced my ears. So be warned.All in all, this is a great choice for who exercise a lot. Having an option of MP3 and Bluetooth is a great choice for those who want flexibility. I love this device despite few flaws.

"Lumia 635 is a great entry/budget phone that performs like a mid-range phone! And to protect this little investment, I wanted to buy a case that is inexpensive and does the job, and this Blue Premium TPU case fits the bill.1. It fits perfectly like a glove. All ports are accessible, and is easy to put on.2. It protects the phone. The buttons are covered, so they are protected from dust or accidental pressure. The screen is protected because the case wraps around the edges where the case is raised about 1/32 inches from the screen. So you can lay the phone flat without screen touching the surface.3. It is attractive case. Blue color is indeed pleasing to the eyes, but the color is not glossy as the picture suggests. It feels solid and durable - not cheap. ALSO Other colored cases are available.[HINT: Even with the case, if dropped, the back cover of the phone will pop out. To prevent this, use DOUBLE-SIDED scotch tape inside the cover. It will prevent the cover from popping out when dropped. But make sure that you do not cover the sensors or speakers. I put the tape right below the battery and above the speaker].All in all, very sturdy and attractive case for your Lumia 635. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DLBP00WA4Q95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZWV26E#wasThisHelpful","R1DLBP00WA4Q95","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jesus was described as the One who will not break off ""a bruised reed"" (Matt. 12:20). It speaks of the tenderness of Christ towards the hurt, the broken, and the weak. His love becomes a healing balm to the afflicted soul.Richard Sibbes (1577-1635), an English Puritan captures so well of Jesus as compassionate healer of the broken soul and the weak. I was profoundly influenced by the book personally and pastorally. Richard Sibbes had a knack of explaining the love of Christ, it moved me to tears - tears of joy and gratitude to know that such Savior cares for me. For example:""Shall our sins discourage us, when he [Christ] appears there for sinners? Are you bruised? Be of good comfort, he calls you. Conceal not your wounds, open all before him and take not Satan's counsel. Go to Christ, although trembling, as the poor woman who said, `If I may but touch his garment' (Matt. 9:21). We shall be healed and have a gracious answer... Never fear to go to God, since we have such Mediator with him, who is not only our friend but our brother and husband"" (p. 9). Another example is:""God knows we have nothing of ourselves, therefore in the covenant of grace he requires no more than he gives, but gives what he requires, and accepts what he gives: `If she be not be able to bring a lamb, then shall bring two turtle doves' (Lev. 12:8). What is the gospel itself but a merciful moderation, in which Christ's obedience is esteemed ours, and our sins laid upon him, wherein God, from being a judge, becomes our Father, pardoning our sins and accepting our obedience, though feeble and blemished? We are now brought to heaven under the covenant of grace by a way of love and mercy"" (p. 36).And throughout the book, Richard Sibbes digs into deep theological truths of the gospel and plainly applies to the afflicted. Therefore his encouragement to the poor soul is not a fluff or filler, but theological truths stem from the gospel of grace. That is why it is so effective.It may be a slow reading (it is), but it is immensely rewarding to your soul. Read it slowly, digest it, and you will see Christ in a different light - you will see Him as sweet and precious Savior for your lonely and troubled soul. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HYI2EOPE4SIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0851517404#wasThisHelpful","R2HYI2EOPE4SIC","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Considering the price, this is basic external CD/DVD drive that works. For some who use external drive extensively, might want to consider higher end product that will endure wear & tear of the drive. Others who use infrequently (once in a while), this LG might fit the bill.1. It is decently built. Made of plastic, while somewhat sturdy, still it will break if dropped. So handle with care.2. It works with Windows 7, 8, & 8.1 out of the box. You do not need to install separate driver. Windows (7&8) will recognize the drive. So you can read & write CDs and DVDs. Read & Write speed is average among this price range.3. You can play DVD as well, but EITHER you can install the software (CD) that came with it OR download & use VLC media player. Windows Media Player will not play DVD.4. You do not need 2nd USB cord to power the drive. A provided single USB cable will connect and power up LG drive through your notebooks. It also works well with netbooks. I connected the LG drive to ASUS eee PC 1000HA (2gb RAM, Win 7, 128gb SSD), and it worked great!5. Works with Linux as well. I dual-boot eee PC 1000HA with Win 7 and Xubuntu 14.10, and Xubuntu 14.10 recognized the drive and played the DVD in VLC media player.6. You can also connect the drive to your TV - provided that your TV has USB port. So you can play your DVD and watch it on your TV.7. You can read/write M-Discs. This is a great advantage of this drive. M-Discs can store your files (docs, pictures, & movies) for 1000 years. Yes. 1000 years.8. The box comes with DVD drive, manual, 1 USB cable, and Software CD (to play DVDs, install drivers, etc). But I did not need the software CD for my purpose. But it is good to have it handy, just in case.All in all, this is a simple CD/DVD drive that will work well with your notebooks and netbooks, including Linux OS. Again, if you are going to use the drive extensively (every day), then you might want to purchase something more sturdy, but if you are going to use it occasionally, then this LG model is a great product for you.

"My journey of finding that perfect coffee taste: It all began, from instant coffee to drip coffee to percolator, and finally French Coffee Press. I've heard it before, and I was curious about it - since many rave about its coffee taste. So when I tried French Coffee Press with this product, I was blown away! Wow... the coffee tastes so pure, so delightful! I am not an expert on coffee, but I can taste the difference between percolated coffee vs. French Coffee Press. So if you already know the pure delight of French press coffee, then you might want to consider Francois et Mimi Stainless Steel Double Wall French Coffee Press (34oz).1. BEAUTIFUL. This stainless steel is simple, elegant, and beautiful. It is a timeless beauty of stainless with classical design. Very attractive.2. SIMPLE to USE. Like many other French Coffee Press, this is very simple to use. I love the kettle like design with generous handle for anyone to use.3. DOUBLE WALL. This is to retain the heat of the coffee longer. Certainly this is better than the ones made of glass. My coffee was hot and satisfying even after 20 minutes.4. STUDY. The whole product is strong and sturdy, including the press.Since it is made of stainless steel, it wouldn't easily break as the glass ones. But since it is a metal, it may dent.5. PRICE. At this price (as of today $49.95), this is a great opportunity to experience French Press Coffee without risking much.All in all, if you are looking for an excellent French Coffee Press with cheap price and not glass made, then this is a great buy!

"This is a great set of blasters where 2 kids can play! Usually, it is not fun to play by oneself with this kind of blasters, but when you have 2 blasters - that's a different story. My kids (9 and 11 years old) run around and try to shoot each other with the blaster!1. FUN for two. The set comes with 2 blasters so 2 persons can play with each other or with the provided target (and yes, the darts do stick). The darts travel up to approx. 70 feet, but usually less, but still far enough to challenge your shooting or ""blasting"" skills. Another way to enhance the fun is to set up targets (small toys, matchbox or hotwheels cars) on the table and try to hit them from a distance.2. STURDY. The plastic is strong and not flimsy. It could withstand accidental drops. The shield, however, can be broken due to simple connection to the blaster. But my kids seldom uses the shield, so it is not a big deal.All in all, this is a great set for those who have 2 kids (or friends).

"This is a great toy blaster! My kids love it!1. FUN. This blaster is fun because the kids love when it shoots far (about 70 feet). Because it does not need to be reloaded each time (you could load all 8 darts at once). You could use it to knock off targets of your choice from the table or you could use the provided target board. Kids are creative, so they can make many kinds of fun games with this blaster.2. STURDY. The plastic is very strong and not flimsy.

"Nowadays Solid States Drives (SSD) are becoming more affordable and that means performance boost for your old laptops or PCs. If you are not ready to purchase new computers, but want to have increased performance, then SSD is the best way to go. I have Lenovo G560 laptop (4 year old basic notebook without power CPU or bells & whistles), but I am not ready to buy a new one. Well by upgrading my HD to OCZ Vector 150 Series SSD tremendously improved my G560.For detailed benchmark for this SSD, you can easily find more professional reviews online, but my purpose is to show that OCZ SSD with Windows 8.1 (b/c it is better with SSDs) have given new lease on the notebook.1. BOOT UP and SHUT DOWN time are almost instant. For G560, it was less than 5 seconds boot up, and less than 4 seconds shut down.2. APPLICATIONS open up much more quickly than previous HD. MS Word, Excel opens up less than a second. Other applications that I use for my work varies depending on the program, but still faster than HD.3. PICTURES & VIDEOS open up faster and transfer to another media (USB stick or SD card) is much faster than HD.4. WEB SURFING has also improved. Basically everything has been faster with this OCZ Vector 150 SSD.5. PRICE. OCZ Vector 150 series is cheaper than other brands. I was surprised by its price and quality. Having been using this about two months, and not a single glitch.All in all, OCZ Vector 150 series SSD is inexpensive, high quality, and high performance SSD that will give new life to your old notebooks and PCs.

"First Aid kit is essential preparation for any family. Especially if you have children with activities (soccer, basketball, baseball, etc), then you want to have decent First Aid kit with you (either at home or in the car). Since we do not know when the emergencies would happen, being prepared is KEY to unfortunate situations. As a certified CPR, AED, & First Aid, school district employee, I can recommend Physicians CARE First Aid kit wholeheartedly.1. THE CONTAINER. the plastic box is strong and sturdy and can withstand minor abuses. It could be tossed around yet will not break apart. The clips that hold the container are strong and will not easily pop open. It could be hung on the wall if you choose to.2. INSIDE THE CONTAINER. It has enough to help in most situations. It comes with titanium scissor, sterile pads, boxes of Nitrile gloves, 1""x3"" Bandage, First Aid tape, Burn Cream, Antibiotic Ointment, Antiseptic Wipes, Triangular Bandages, and CPR, AED, & Basic First Aid Pocket Reference Guide. The Pocket Guide will definitely help even if you do not know what to do. Following the instruction calmly will help you to help others in need.3. PRICE. The price is reasonable. But the first aid kit cannot be measured by dollar amount, but its usefulness. And I think that it will give you the peace of mind.4. FOR HOME and CAR. Our family has two first aid kits. One for home and one for our car. Since our kids play soccer, baseball, and basketball regularly, it is essential that we one for the car. If anything happens, we know we are prepared to alleviate the situation.All in all, this is a great First Aid kit. You will certainly be at ease knowing that you are prepared.

"My wife and I were looking for notebooks for our kids (9 and 11 yrs old). DELL had a sale for $200.00 for this model, and we could not pass up the opportunity. All in all, this is an excellent laptop for kids or very basic laptop for a family.PROS:1. CHIP: Intel Celeron (dual core). This is a latest Celeron chip (N2830, Bay Trail - M) you will have. Being a dual core can handle most of the demands easily. Because it is a Bay Trail chip, it is quiet and not heavy on your resources. It is so quiet, you hardly hear the fan at all. So for your Web browsing, emails, YouTube viewing, MS Office, some gaming, and every day chores, this is a great basic laptop.2. BUILD. The black matte finish is not fancy but functional. Simple but sturdy. The keyboard has no flex, and comes with chiclet keyboard that is well designed and generously spaced. The screen is bright and resolution is normal for this price range.3. PRICE. Price differs from store to store, but if you get it in right time, you might get it for around $200.00. Even $250 is a good price. To give you a comparison: various Chromebooks are priced in this range but with less functions and memories. Additionally, you CANNOT install any Windows programs (such as, MS Office, etc), so while Chromebooks have their proper place, for those who need basic laptop for general use, this laptop might be a better fit in this price range.4. OS. Windows 8.1 is far, far better than Windows 8.0. If you already have 8.0, then you should update/upgrade it to 8.1. I love using it, and my kids love the tiles. PLUS, I love 8.1's Family Safety feature. I can control how much my kids can be on the computer and what days. Additionally you can also filter what kind of web they are browsing. MS also sends you (the parent) weekly report on the kids use of the computer. Love this feature! Easy to set up and monitor.CONS:1. No optical Drive (DVD/CD). But nowadays, this is not really needed anymore. But for those who need it, you might have to consider other models.2. No Bluetooth. The box says, ""Bluetooth"" but this is misprint. This model does NOT have Bluetooth.3. Only 2 USB (2.0) ports. I was hoping that it had another USB port.Despite the cons, considering its price, this is an excellent entry laptop for kids and those who just want sturdy, dependable laptop for every day general use.

"This BlueAnt Pump Wireless HD Sportbuds is pure, simple, and solid. No bells and whistles, just an excellent headset that is waterproof while you workout or for leisure use.1. SOLID. The build and quality are solid. It is sturdy and strong. It is not made of cheap plastic, but durable one. You could see and feel the difference as you hold it in your hand.2. HEADSET. The design is simple. The purpose is to hold the headset while you workout, so the design (over the ear) is perfect for that purpose. It also comes with stabilizers so it can add to more customized stability. Buttons are few: power and volumes (+ & -). Those three button are used for Bluetooth connection, playing & listening to music; receiving & answering calls.3. WATERPROOF. Yes, it is sweat proof,and water proof. I ran while raining (rains a lot in Seattle), and it did not affect the sound at all. I worked out sweating, and it did not short out or damage the sound system. But you are not advised to swim with it. This is of course, overkill.4. SOUND. Sound quality is clear, rich and full. Bass sound stands out. You will definitely enjoy listening to your music while working out.5. CONNECTION. The headset connects with any Bluetooth device: smartphones (I have Windows Phone 8, HTC 8X), iPod touch, tablets, etc...

"If your home, church, or business needs a great quality LCD Projector yet that will not break your bank, this Epson VS330 is it. Since there are some excellent technical reviews on Amazon, I will just dwell on actual use of it at home.1. BUILD. The plastic casing while light, is not weak. It is sturdy. It will withstand normal bumps on the tables and things. Casing is tight. That is, you will not see loose parts or areas. Nicely put together.2. EASY TO USE. This is my FIRST LCD Projector. I was able to use it within 5 minutes as I hooked it up to my netbook (ASUS 1000HA). All the button are easy to see and clearly labelled. Ports (USB A&B, S-Video, Audio, HDMI) are also clearly labelled. The remote control is also easy to understand. NOTE: Read Quick Start guide, you will be able to use the projector very quickly.3. BRIGHTNESS. Note that this model has ""2700 COLOR lumens"" and ""2700 WHITE lumens."" It is the COLOR lumens that will dictate the brightness and the richness of the color images (pictures, movies, presentation). So make sure you compare the ""COLOR lumens."" Some other LCD projectors do not mention color lumens but only WHITE Lumens to attract consumers. I've seen a comparable priced LCD projector which has 2700 white lumens, but lower color lumens (the model doesn't even mention it), and the colors look faded and dull. My family saw how bright and rich the colors were! We felt like we were in a mini-movie theater! We saw various movie clips (youtube) and family movies (phone, digital camera, etc).4. NOTEBOOKS, NETBOOKS, and SMARTPHONES. Yes. You can connect your laptops AND even netbooks that has computer port (monitor port). Also, you can project your smartphone images as well. But this depends on your smartphone. Some smartphones can directly project via USB-A connection, but others need to connect the phone to the laptop first.5. PORTABILITY. This is a small and light projector compared to others. It weighs about 5 lbs and measures 11"" x 5"" x 8 3/4"". But if you are going to carry it, I recommend that you purchase a decent carrying case for it. Or you can use the box that came with it.Overall, I am very impressed with it.

"Let me brief. The Chummie Alarm does work. The alarm is loud and vibration is strong enough to wake you.1. The gadget is small enough to place it on boy's pajamas. It has a removable clip. The clip is strong enough to stay on the cloth.2. The sensor is placed outside of the underwear. And when the underwear is wet (a very small wetness) will trigger the alarm.3. Alarm, vibration, and flashing blue lights go ON to wake up the boy so that he may learn to go to the bathroom. [1] Yes, the alarm is loud. [2] The vibration has enough movement to wake the child, and [3] flashing blue light creates the urgency.4. So, yes, the gadget works well. HOWEVER...Consider:1. The alarm, vibration, and flashing lights can surprise the boy - if he is not used to it. It is kind of mild shock treatment of sort. Because it will suddenly wake the boy.2. Not all boys like to wear it - because to them, it is uncomfortable. Do not force them wear it. Rather try to convince them to try it for few days.3. Perhaps, being scared of using it, the boy might actually stop wet the bed at night.Yes, it works well. But some convincing might be necessary.

"Wow, what a beautiful craftsmanship! This Bluetooth stereo speaker is pleasing to the ears AND eyes. I LOVE this wooden (custom milled bamboo) enclosure for the speakers! Let me be brief:1. SOUND. I was really surprised by its sound quality: strong bass is booming and at the same time, captures high note well. The sound is clear and carries in the room. I must admit that it does sound like Bose Wave Audio System.2. AESTHETIC. It simply is beautiful. The speaker is pleasing to the eyes. Because it is made of milled bamboo, you can see and feel it as well. The black speakers are unassuming and highlights the wooden enclosure well. It is also wrapped with gray fabric (composed of reclaimed hemp, organic cotton, and recycled plastic bottles) that is strong and functional.3. SIMPLE. It is easy to connect with your Bluetooth electronics (iPod, smartphones, etc). You can also connect with non-Bluetooth items that audio jack. You can connect with your laptop and use the speaker the same way. 3.5 mm Stereo Mini cable comes with the speaker so you can use it right away. There are 4 buttons on the top, where clearly marked for easy access.4. PORTABILITY. Although I would not use this as a portable speaker, it is just that. The speaker is rechargeable so you can use it anywhere without the AC power cable. I choose to use it as a stationary speaker on my desk.5. POSSIBLE MINOR ISSUE. If the sound gets dropped, or cuts away during the play, try this: Lower the volume from the speaker and increase the volume from the source (smartphone, laptop), you will note that it will no longer drop the sound. Try few times to get right balance where no drops occur.All in all, I am very, very satisfied. If the price is not an issue, then this is an excellent speaker for all occasions!

This is the best entry smartphone - including all entry level Android phones. Now make no mistake, this is not a high end phone. But this is very capable entry phone for all your needs. You can read excellent online reviews for Lumia 520, so let me just mention few excellent qualities of Lumia 520:1. PRICE. As of now, Amazon sellls it for $54.99. That is incredibly cheap. Just to give you a comparison, Sansa Clip+ MP3 Player (8GB) is $49.00 in Amazon. But Lumia 520 does so much more than playing your music. It has Nokia maps, drive+, etc, you can browse the web, email, set calendar for your appointments. You can take pictures, you can call & text. You can read ebooks, you can do MS Office (preloaded), and so much more. So for $54.99, you are getting a mini-computer at your disposal. At this price, it is bargain.2. WINDOWS PHONE OS. If you are used to WP OS, then you already know how smooth, simple, and useful it is. But if you are thinking about WP, then Lumia 520 is an excellent choice (if you don't mind its low spec) for you to try it out since it is so cheap, you will still experience buttery smooth OS that makes your life organized and entertained. Lumia 520 is preloaded with WP 8, but you can easily upgrade it to WP 8.1 and Lumia Black. Sure it is not as fast as high end WP (ie, Lumia 925, HTC 8X, etc), but it is decent. It is smooth. NOTE: If you want to sync with Windows Phone with your contact list, email, calendar, etc.., it is BEST to use Windows Live Mail (FREE email client from Microsoft). It will always sync with your desktop/laptop with your phone.3. FUNCTIONALITY: call is clear, speaker is loud enough, screen (IPS LCD) is bright & clear, but it is finger print magnet (but this is greatly reduced by putting on screen protector - Illumishield product). Memory can be expanded by Micro SD card - where you can store: maps, music, pictures, apps, and documents. Bluetooth (version 4.0) works flawlessly. The screen is responsive even with the gloves on. No front facing camera, but I don't do selfie - so it doesn't matter.In sum, this is the best entry smartphone you can buy. You cannot beat this price with this much quality. I love this phone. you might too. Give it a chance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QJOEFIBZZMV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E45043A#wasThisHelpful","R3QJOEFIBZZMV3","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you have kids and all their after school activities, you need something to remind you of your daily tasks and chores. Sure, smartphone helps. But sometimes, you need good old marker/cork board to remind you the old fashioned way! Even my daughter (9 yrs old) loves this! She puts the board in her room, and writes down what she needs to do. It is a great reminder for her.1. MATERIAL. While not the best or premium kind, it is made of decent quality. Edges are not made of metal or aluminum, but made of a plastic - which is nice. The cork and marker board is average quality.2. USEFULNESS. Definitely useful. You can out on the cork board whatever you want to pin: pictures, letters, to do lists, etc... On the marker board, you can write your list of chores or reminders for your family etc.3. PLACEMENT. Although it comes with self-adhesive tape for the wall, you might want to hang the board.All in all, it is inexpensive and decent quality board for whole family.

"DISCLAIMER: Products like this depends on your health, condition, and physical make up. So your results may vary. For general context for this review: I am 47 years old male, non-smoker, non-drinker, and in decent shape (not an athlete kind).1. IT WORKS. Wow. I took 1 scoop [a scoop is really small amount compared to other pre-workout drinks], and during my workout (cardio & some strengthening), it caused me to sweat like no other! It was intense workout. I did more with this pre-workout drink than not. It seems to give you a boost, intensity, and burst of strength during the workout.2. IT MAKES You JITTERY. I realize that many products like this will make you jittery due to caffeine or high dose of stimulants in the product. Although I do not prefer jitters, I am used to it. If you are set against feeling jittery, then consider others products.3. IT MIXES EASY with water. I just put one scoop in a plastic bottle with 6 oz of water and shake it for 10 seconds and drink it. No chemical residue at the end. Among many pre-workout drinks I tried, this one mixes the best and easiest.4. IT TASTES DECENT. Fruit punch taste was better and cleaner than I expected. It decent because there was no chemical residue at the end.5. IT CAN be USED as ENERGY DRINK. If you need a quick energy for the task at hand, you could also use this as an energy drink (more powerful than Red Bull). I work as a custodian, and sometimes when I need extra energy, I take this drink and it gives me some pep to plow through my work. Love this!All in all, if you are in a decent shape, and needs something extra for your workout (or for some added energy), consider this product. You may be surprised by its effectiveness.

"Just like other SKLZ equipment, this baseball tee is great! My kids (11 and 9 years old) love to use it for batting practices. They use regular baseball, tennis ball, and wiffle ball not just to practice but also to have fun! My son (11) just joined his first baseball team and he has been using it to practice his swing. And he likes it using it.1. STURDY. The material used here are sturdy and durable. The plastics are not cheap, but strong and thick. The base is heavy so that it can withstand the swing, but not heavy enough to be not portable. This is a quality tee.2. EASY to Assemble & Disassemble. It is adjustable for any height. My kids were able to adjust by themselves. It is also very quick and easy to assemble & disassemble. The tee itself can be attached to the base flat - making easy to carry and store.3. FUN factor. My kids love it and I too enjoy using it with my kids to have fun with them!All in all, I highly recommend this tee if you are thinking about getting one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U6E6TE5QLOXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HA1FT44#wasThisHelpful","R3U6E6TE5QLOXY","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is basically an OK health tracker. For the money, I thought it could do more and simpler. Don't get me wrong, this is made with quality. The strap, the digital display, and the materials used are pretty good. But the functionality is somewhat limited in itself but need a computer (and smartphone) to use all the functionality. If you are simply looking to track: number of steps you took, heart rate, calories burned, then it is better to purchase inexpensive one.1. Without the computer, this is simply a bulky watch with basic heart monitor. The Basis Tracker will display calories burned, heart rate, and steps you took.2. BUT if you use your computer/smartphone (app needs to be downloaded), then it can actually give you in-depth analysis of your heart rate and calories burned throughout the day and also through the weeks. So you can have big picture of how your heart is expended. So it can generally detect your stress level. How accurate this reading is, I am not sure.3. You need to recharge this watch with computer on. The fully charged watch can be used for a full day.4.

"This particular Large Print Compact Bible (TruTone, Mahogany) is one of the better compact Bibles I have seen. Sure you could pay more to purchase Pitt Minion series, but fonts are smaller. But this edition is affordable and has font size of 8. Let me be brief.1. TRANSLATION. ESV has been very popular for several years, and you can find some excellent reviews online. But this review is not about the translation. I use both ESV & NASB, and I love them both.2. COVER. This TruTone is supple. Previous editions (ie. coffee) was not supple or as flexible. This Mahogany is really soft and supple. I love the feel of it. Design is simple and classical. Love its color - conservative and unassuming.3. FORMAT. The pages do not have cross-references, just textual notes on the bottom. This is NOT a reference Bible. It is a compact Bible that meant portability with readability. The text is clear and is red letter edition.The font size is 8 and is plenty big for compact Bible. It is in paragraph format like so many other editions of the Bible. It includes the concordance in the back, but NO MAP - this is only drawback, if I were to mention.4. BINDING. This is Smyth-sewn binding (stitched, and not glued to the spine). I LOVE THIS! Almost all of the Bibles are glued to the spine in this price range. But Crossway seems to be committed to produce affordable yet quality binding Bibles. Because it is stitched, it is stronger and lay flat on the table.All in all, I love this edition. If you are looking for something that is inexpensive, compact yet readable, and attractive, then get this Bible. Highly, highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZD37XGFI04BY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433541564#wasThisHelpful","RZD37XGFI04BY","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DISCLAIMER: Each person's reaction to this kind of drinks is different. Your result may not be same as mine. For the context of this review, I am an Asian male, 47 years old, non-smoker & non-drinker, and is in decent shape.I've tried many ""pre-workout"" drink mixes such as: Jack 3D, BSN Hyper etc... These are pretty much similar products, but everyone reacts little differently because our bodies are not the same. Hyper gave me a lot of jitters. Jack 3D was better with a minor jitters. As for Labrada Super Charge!, I've found it to be a good pre-workout mix.1. NO SIDE EFFECTS. At least for me, I did not have any jitters (but this does not mean you wouldn't). My body felt fine after drinking it (1 scoop) . I did not have any headaches, nausea, or any other mild side effects with Labrada. So this was good for me.2. CAFFEINE & TAURINE. Yes, this does have caffeine (labeled as ""methylxanthines""), and each scoop is equal to almost 3 cups of coffee, so that is a lot of caffeine so if you are trying to cut down on a caffeine, this may not be a best product. TAURINE is same ingredient you'll find in a can of RED BULL, it supposedly gives you alertness (1 scoop has 1000 mg, same amount as a can of Red Bull). But if you are wary of Taurine, then you might want to skip this.3. PERFORMANCE. I did notice in my stamina when I work out. I do some basic free weights and cardio (Insanity, Focus 25), and preworkout drink helped me to get through the workout with minimum exhaustion and less frequent pauses. So yes, it does seem to work.4. FAST Recovery. Nice bonus of including BCAA 2:1:1 helps you to recover faster after workout. But of course, if you drink protein mix after your workout, it would already have BCAA.5. TASTE. Not the best, but not the worst. Hint: mix really, really well. Expect bitter after taste if you consume little undissolved white powders at the end.All in all, if you really NEED to get ""pre-workout"" drink mix, then consider Labrada Super Charge, for me, it was pretty good without any strange side effects, so I would recommend the product. BUT if you are cautious about the amount of caffeine and taurine, then skip pre-workout drink mix of any kind, and eat a banana before your workout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLW4L95XPUCBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GPTZXC#wasThisHelpful","RLW4L95XPUCBZ","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many exercise balls out there, and it is difficult to determines which one is better. Like always, a consumer must research and even visit sporting good stores to see and feel these equipments. If you are considering purchase an exercise ball, keep SKLZ in the list.1. SKLZ generally makes a quality sporting/athletic equipments: baseball net, soccer net, baseball tee, etc. In my experience SKLZ products have been excellent in durability and quality. So the brand name here means trust.2. This Golf Trainer Ball is not only for those who play golf. This is basically an exercise ball. I have seen this same kind of balls in athletic clubs in NYC and everyone was using it and not just golfers.3. The rubber material is soft, and not as thin as other exercise balls. It feels gentle on your hand and your body. It has non-slippery feel to it - thus promoting stability in your movement on the ball.4. The diagram on the ball helps, but not the best. I would recommend that you use youtube to see how to use exercise balls. The diagram is merely a pointer, not an extensive ""how-to""s.5. The pump is something getting use to. It is small (portable kind). It will take some length to inflate the ball to the point where you can use it. Some say you can inflate the ball between 10-25 minutes depending on your stamina. If you are an older person (55+ years old), you may want some others to inflate the ball for you. If you have automatic air pump, then it is easier of course.6. HINT: After inflating the ball (make sure you follow the instruction), make sure to plug the hole well. Press all the way in, so that no air will escape.7. After using it for a while, I see the benefit of it. It does help your body to stretch better and work on your core and other parts of your body.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10RPX5CHXHK0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0097CEJAY#wasThisHelpful","R10RPX5CHXHK0A","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SKLZ always produced quality sports equipment. I had their soccer net for my kids in the past and We loved it! It was easy to set up and durable. Likewise, this baseball combo net system is also quality product. Let me be brief:1. PORTABLE. the nets can be disassembled into parts so that you can put it in a durable bag that came with it. It can be easily placed in your car or SUV trunk, and it does not take much space. And you can always leave it in the car for next practice.2. DURABLE. The frames and the nets are light but very durable. Meshed nets are laced with quality material, you could feel it once you touch it. As mentioned, earlier, SKLZ makes quality products, and this is no exception.3. EASY TO SETUP. Both assemble & disassemble take less than 5-7 minutes depending on your familiarity with it.4. FUN FACTOR. My son (11 years old), just started his first baseball season. And he loves this! He enjoys practicing it with SKLZ because he does not need to chase after the ball after hitting it. He can practice by himself. He can practice pitching and hitting without running after the ball. This greatly increases fun factor.5. GET A BASEBALL TEE. To complete the set, you might want to consider getting the baseball tee.All in all, I am very satisfied with the product. SKLZ has yet to let me down. Their product is quality and affordable.

"I have a couple of inexpensive Bluetooth speakers for my smartphone and tablets, but their sound qualities are lacking. They were only little bit better than the smartphone speaker. But if you want something that is better than cheap Bluetooth speakers, you might want to seriously consider Belkin's FUSIVE Bluetooth speaker.1. SLIM & LIGHT. Yes, it is slim. It is like a small paperback book. You could put it in your bag, briefcase, and pockets in notebook cases but not in your pocket. It is lighter than it looks. So the weight should not be a problem.2. WELL MADE. The speaker is made of durable plastic, it doesn't feel cheap. The buttons are placed where you can have easy access: TOP of the speaker (power, FF, REW, and volume buttons are located), and the SIDE (Bluetooth button, and charging connection are located). It also has audio jack, so you can connect the speaker to your notebook that does not have Bluetooth. The silver colored front looks elegant and expensive. Nice touch.3. SOUND QUALITY. The sound quality while not TOP notch compared non-Bluetooth speakers, it is excellent for Bluetooth speaker. Remember that your sound quality also depends on your smartphone, and the quality of MP3 or MP4. The sound comes out loud and clear - but not distorted, but balanced. Overall, it is clear, strong, and balanced.All in all, if you like to have great sound outside or inside, without the tangling cable, then consider this gem. You will be pleasantly surprised.

"SSD (Solid State Drive) is much faster and quieter than traditional HD (Hard Drive), though the price is higher. But nowadays, SSD is becoming more affordable than before. And Toshiba 256 GB Q series Pro is one of those SSDs. Since many use SSD for their recent notebooks and reviews many. But I chose to use SSD for my 6 years old netbook - such as ASUS eee PC 1000HA. Haven't used it for 4 years because of its degrading performance. But I wanted to see whether I could use netbook again for my work every day. Here is the review:1. QUIET. All SSDs are quiet since there are no moving parts. eee PC 1000HA has been amazingly quiet.2. LIGHT. Toshiba 256 GB Q Series is made of aluminum casing - much lighter than competition. Already light eee PC 1000HA has become lighter.3. PERFORMANCE. [a] Speed - is much, much faster. My eee pc 1000HA (2 GB RAM, Win 7 Home Premium) boots up less than 20 seconds. MS Office Word 2010 opens up in 2 seconds. Other applications vary, but many of my programs consistently open up faster than before (difference is NOTICEABLE). In short, the netbook is very much useable. I've been taking my 6 year netbook to work and it has been great! Thanks to Toshiba Q series, it gave new lease on life! [b] Bench mark - according to Crystal Disk Mark, Toshiba 256 GB Q series scored: Seq. Read 125.7, Write 121.1; 512k Read 116.7, Write 112.6; 4k Read 11.70, Write 28.08; 4k qd32  Read 17.17, Write 39.94. This score was much better than Kingston V300 series in the same netbook. And Windows Experience Index jumped from 1.2 to 2.3! [c] Multitasking - MS Word 2010, Firefox, Windows Live Mail, and Kindle were all opened, and I had no problem using them.4. OVERALL Usability. I must say that I enjoy using this netbook again, thanks to Toshiba 256 GB Q Series SSD! Music, pictures, videos, MS Office, web browsing, and other programs are all work well. Even Linux works well in this SSD as well!I am very, very happy to use my old netbook again because of Toshiba SSD! If you do not need 256GB, then you could consider 128 GB for your netbook.

"This is a small Nerf-type of football for the kids. But even adults can enjoy it with their children. If you have a child that likes football, then this is a great gift for him/her.PROS:1. It is soft (like a Nerf football), but sturdy (not cheap). So it will not hurt your hand playing. My kids (8 and 10 years old) love to throw it around, because it is small and soft.2. When the light is ""ON"" (there is a switch to turn the light ""ON"" or ""OFF"") at nights, it is real cool! Especially, when you throw a tight spiral. Kids are all smiles!3.

"CONTEXT: I am 46 years old male, not overweight and in decent shape. And I was looking for a quick overall workout for my body. I cannot afford the whole Insanity set, so I just got this Insanity Fast & Furious (IFF).PROS:1. Wow! Amazing workout! After the workout, I was sweating like I've never sweated before. My heart rate was high and I was huffing and puffing. I KNOW I burned a lot of calories. Some say, you will burn 300 - 500 calories depending on your intensity of the workout.2. It is short. 20 minutes. BUT I had to stop several times to catch my breath. So during my workout, I just ""PAUSE"" the DVD and continue on after catching my breath. So the whole workout in reality is about 25 minutes for me.3. Overall workout: It works your abs, cardio, toning your body.4. After 3 months of using it (3-4 times per week), I've noticed more definition, tighter abs, and overall toned body.CONS:1. If you have any joint issues (knees, ankles, wrists, hips), you might want to avoid this. It has a lot of jumping and burpees.2. For me, the music is more distracting, so I turn off the music option, so you can hear Shaun T's instruction more clearly.TIPS:1. If you want to add more to your workout. Immediately after IFF, do weights (1 set of 10 reps) of biceps, shoulders, etc... You will burn more calories that way.2. If you want to change the pace of the workout, get Shaun T's Focus T25: Core Speed DVD workout. This single DVD workout is another excellent workout, and I use it with IFF.All in all, it is a great workout and you will see results!

"Excellent electric tooth brush with oral health kit! The Kit comes with:*Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Tooth Brush with SmartGuide*Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Toothpaste*Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse*Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Clinical Protection Dental FlossPROS:1. Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 is an excellent electric tooth brush. Certainly it is much, much better than the manual ones. Personally speaking, I prefer rounded head than the elongated head. With the rounded head, you can focus on each tooth more since it covers one tooth at a time (but for those who prefer elongated head, the kit comes with additional elongated head as well with 3 other types of head). It also has automatic timer built in: It is programmed for 2 mins total, and 2 mins are divided into 4 (30sec) durations. Each duration covering 1/4 (quadrant) of your teeth. This is quite helpful as you get used to it, so that you will not clean one section more than others. The brush is waterproof and rechargeable. And it is easy to hold being slim. It is also MADE IN GERMANY. The rechargeable battery is replaceable - this is huge plus.2. The brush has 5 modes: Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Massage and Whitening. Each mode works differently in speed of the oscillation with different types of head that is designed for specific purpose. You will feel the difference in each mode.3. It cleans well. As stated, it is superior than manual brushing. I always feel the smoothness of my teeth all around, even the wisdom teeth that is hard to reach.4. It comes with travel case to protect the electric brush and SmartGuide to show the progress of each brushing. It displays each quadrant of your mouth, and the timer that indicates how long you have left. It can be also used as digital clock. There is no extra work involved. Just put the batteries in and start brushing, then it automatically indicates the mode of your brushing. I find this very useful as I brush.5. The kit comes with toothpaste, floss, and a mouthwash. So you are ready to start a healthy oral hygiene. I realize that you may prefer other oral hygiene products over these, but these are not bad at all. If you do not like any alcohol based mouthwash, then Crest Pro Health Rinse is an excellent alternative. They are clearly good products that can help your oral health.CONS:1. Price might be little prohibitive for someone who does not need all the stuff. If you use your own preferred paste, floss, and mouthwash, then just purchase this electric tooth brush separately - it will be cheaper.2. It takes a long time to charge the brush. To charge fully, you need to put it on the charger for more than 15 hours. But this is minor issue.Over all, I love Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric brush!

It is also MADE IN GERMANY. The rechargeable battery is replaceable - this is huge plus.2. It cleans well. As stated, it is superior than manual brushing. I always feel the smoothness of my teeth all around, even the wisdom teeth that is hard to reach.3. The kit comes with toothpaste, floss, and a mouthwash. So you are ready to start a healthy oral hygiene. I realize that you may prefer other oral hygiene products over these, but these are not bad at all. They are clearly a good products that can help your oral health.CONS:1. Price might be little prohibitive for someone who does not need all the stuff. If you use your own preferred paste, floss, and mouthwash, then just purchase this electric tooth brush separately.2. It takes a long time to charge the brush. To charge fully, you need to put it on the charger for more than 15 hours. But this is minor issue.Over all, I love Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Electric brush!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHZTOG0XG5JHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZH3LQG#wasThisHelpful","RHZTOG0XG5JHJ","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every man has different preference when it comes to shaving, therefore every review will be different as well. For the sake of this review, it will be helpful if I provide my context: I am mid 40s Asian man, who shaves 3 times a week. Throughout my shaving journey, I tried BOTH blade and the electric. So I can tell the pros and cons of both.It is important to note that no electric shaver will shave as close as the blade: Blade actually touches the skin while the electric does not. For this review then, I will focus not on the closeness of the shave but overall usability of it.POSITIVES:1. It does what it claims. It does cool your skin while you shave. The ""active cooling technology"" does work. I did not feel any burn sensation at all. Other electric shavers you have irritation on your skin, you would feel the heat traveling to the blade foil. But Cool Tec was comfortable.2. It gives you a closer shave than other electric shavers. I always liked the Braun electric shavers, because they gave me closer shaves due to straight foil and this Cool Tec also has adaptable 3-stage cutting system (basically, it has 2 independently moving cutting elements that cut BOTH the short hair and the long hairs. The two foils move UP&DOWN and SIDE-to-SIDE to ensure capture all your hairs, while contouring to your skin).3. It can be used in shower WITHOUT the shaving cream. Yes, you can use it in the water. I personally do not like to use the shaver in shower, but I can see that others might find it very helpful.4. Easy to clean. Just pop out the top, and you can simply rinse it with running water.NEGATIVES:1. It is heavier and bulkier than the most electric shavers. I have small hands, therefore it was hard for me to control and maneuver the shaver. To be fair, you can get used to it within 2 weeks of use.2. Price. I think it is somewhat pricey, but it is subjective.All in all, I do like the product a lot. If you only use electric shaver, and are looking for something that is excellent and can be used in the shower, then I highly recommend this Cool Tec!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQVYMBCFH4KC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DU6ZV28#wasThisHelpful","RQVYMBCFH4KC5","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DISCLAIMER: Products like this depend on various factors - location of your home, location of power line, number of electrical devices in your home, and strengths of signals of your neighbors' routers, etc. So my experience may not be yours with the product.Background: I live in approx. 2200 square feet home (two stories with garage). My family (of 4), we have 4 computers (2 PC, 2 notebooks) and 2 tablets (Surface RT and iPad 2) and 2 smartphones. And sometimes, our tablets'  WiFi gets disconnected due to weak signal from the router (esp. in one particular room, where my kids play). So I thought I needed a Wi-Fi Range Extender, so I got TP-Link TL-WA850RE. Here is my experience:POSITIVES:1. Setup is real easy. Instruction (in mini CD and quick installation guide) is simple, clear and easy to follow. You will be running the Range Extender in less than 5-10 minutes depend on where you plug the unit. [a] Plug the unit, [b] Press WPS or QSS button on your router (usually, it is a little blue button on the back of your router), [c] wait for 2minutes and you are done.2. The Range Extender itself looks nice and easy to follow - very intuitive.NEGATIVES:1. It works, but not all the time, strangely. Perhaps it is just my home, but it works sometimes, increasing the signal strength by about 15%. But other times, there is no real difference.2. When it does work, somehow the internet browsing speed is slower. So it works, but not as fast.Again, user experience may vary depend on circumstances and factors around the Range Extender. Your experience may not be same as mine, but this review gives an additional information for you to consider.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSLL3KGXEG53W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E98O7GC#wasThisHelpful","RSLL3KGXEG53W","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this drill! For every day ""light to moderate"" job (ie, drilling holes, tightening screws) this is a great product. Before this product, I used B&D VersaPak drill/driver (3.6 V), while it was OK, it wasn't powerful enough for certain jobs (making a hole in a wood, etc), torque was lacking. However, this Bosch PS11-102 is clearly more powerful (12V) so you can do many ""light to moderate"" jobs with ease.[NOTE: this drill/driver is NOT INTENDED for heavy duty jobs. For those you might need to consider commercial ones]1. ENOUGH POWER: the rechargeable battery (Lithium-Ion) has 12 volt power, sufficient enough for every day chores for home or garage. I was able to fix wooden fence, cabinet, and drill a garage dry wall with ease. The torque (115 lb, max) really helps when you are drilling or tightening a thicker or harder material.2. EFFICIENT MANEUVERABILITY: 5 Position pivoting head gives you a control and comfort for harder to reach areas (I was able to drive a screw under the sink kitchen cabinet with ease, esp the corners).3. EXCELLENT DESIGN: overall design of the drill is excellent. [1] There is a led light that beams when you drill, this is a clever design that helps you when you need to work in a dark area (under the cabinet), [2] Power indicator = the drill shows you how much power you have left, so that you will know when to recharge the battery. [3] The trigger is big enough (pressed with four fingers, when you grab) so that you can easily dictate the level of power you want.4. VERY STURDY: The materials used are not flimsy. Very strong/hard plastic (tested with hammer, and dropped on the garage floor, and no damage). Really nicely built.5. NICE CARRYING CASE: Some prefer plastic case, others prefer softer canvas. This comes with softer canvas case, that can hold the drill and the charger, it also has a pocket to put the manual, and ares to store some drill bits.6. ADDITIONAL INFO: If this might be a FIRST drill you will purchase, please note that it does NOT come with any drill bit set. You need to purchase the drill bit set separately.All in all, I am very satisfied. So if you need a drill for every day job, consider this gem. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30JJ4L8MXPE1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BD5G3UC#wasThisHelpful","R30JJ4L8MXPE1E","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My wife loves this! It is smooth, sensitive and it does not cut her skin when she shaves. My wife recommends this because:1. It shaves close to your skin. Although you may not see it with a naked eye, but you could certainly feel it.2. It is comfortable. Overall, the shave is comfortable. Although the razor is somewhat bulky for a small hand, after getting used to it, the razor becomes just right in your hand.3. It smells great. With Olay Sugarberry scent, you will smell nice after the shave. Only draw back is that the strip doesn't last long enough. But this is the case for all razor cartridges.So all in all, my wife likes the razor despite some minor glitches (little bulky, thus little difficult to maneuver).

"This is NOT a Bluetooth music speaker. It is a receiver that connects to your music or stereo system so that your music from smartphone/tablet/iPod/iPad can be played wirelessly. I love this product!1. It is a small device, unobtrusive, and stylish. It will not take much space on the table.2. Easy instruction on how to connect the device to your stereo system. I connected Belkin Bluetooth HD receiver to my BOSE Wave Music System in a minute and necessary cables are included in the box.3. I connected my Windows Phone 8 (HTC 8X) through Bluetooth without any problems. Any Bluetooth device will be suffice.4. The sound quality was amazing! BOSE was able to play all my music from my smartphone with clarity and detail. There was no skipping, dropping, or lagging during the music.If you have a home stereo system, and want to play your music from your smartphones then you want to seriously consider this product from Belkin.

"There are many whey protein powders on the market. Like many, I have tried several kinds. And in my experience of using whey protein, Jarrow Formula has been the best. If you are looking for effective and clean taste of protein then consider this product:1. THE TASTE. For many protein powders, the taste has been the problem. They solve by adding sweeteners or sugar. But some do not want added calories or a chemical that might not be good for them. But Jarrow's protein powder has that clean taste without the ""yucky-ness."" This French Vanilla is natural, mildly sweet (without adding artificial sweetners) and easy to drink with water or milk.2. THE SOLVENCY. The powder easily dissolves in water or milk. If you do not want to use a mixer or even a spoon, try this. In an empty water bottle with cap, add 6 - 8 oz water with protein powder (you might need to use a funnel to pour the powder in), then close the cap and SHAKE well until it is well mixed. And enjoy!3. THE EFFECT. The protein seems to work well. When I drink it after a workout or even regular work (manual labor), I noticed that the soreness is somewhat diminished and I feel at ease. I also did not see any side effect of the the product. My stomach was fine.All in all, love the product and recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X0BRTNBGKMF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OSK8Q#wasThisHelpful","R2X0BRTNBGKMF0","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All of us want pearly white teeth, but it is elusive as we age over the years. Especially if we drink or smoke. But if you want quick and effective way to whiten your teeth, consider Crest 3D White High Performance White Strips.[NOTE: Whitening effectiveness vary depending on your drinking/smoking/age. I am an avid coffee drinker, at least 3 cups a day, but I am not a smoker, so this is one person's experience]1. IT IS EASY TO USE. Compare to other whitening strips, Crest 3D is really easy to use. 2 strips (for upper and lower teeth) are clearly identified. And because it is a flexible strip (not a hard plastic), it stays on your teeth easily and without any discomfort. Make sure, you put lower strip first, then the upper.2. IT IS QUICK. Once you apply the strip on your teeth, it must be on for 30 minutes. But you only apply once a day so this is quick. Once it is applied, it sticks to your teeth so it is comfortable and you could do other things (reading, watching TV, exercise, etc). Make sure you have a timer on for 30 minutes. I used my smartphone timer.3. IT IS EFFECTIVE. The best way to describe the result is that - It is NOTICEABLE. After using it for 20 straight days, I could NOTICE my teeth being clearly whiter than ever before and therefore pleasant to look at when I smile. It is not as white as bleaching, but noticeably whiter.4. WARNING: If you have sensitive teeth, you may feel slight discomfort and ache. BUT this goes away after few days of use.This is a great whitening strips for your teeth. After 20 days, your teeth will be pearly white! If you need to attend a social event (wedding, reunion, etc), then you could use ""2 Hour Express"" strip for that quick but noticeable white.I love the product! The only wish or suggestion I have for Crest is that lower strip should be wider (horizontally), so that it could cover 2 more lower tooth. Other than that, I thought it was excellent product!YES! For occasional deep whitening of your teeth, highly, highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QOKV7K89GE83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHAWWO0#wasThisHelpful","R3QOKV7K89GE83","A3KF79AODCE7YE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KF79AODCE7YE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Your HTC 8X is a beautiful phone in every way. I love using my phone, and I am sure that you want to protect the screen. No doubt, you have considered more expensive Skinomi, Zagg, and other similar military grade protectors. If you are wary of applying Skinomi and the likes, consider Halo screen protector.1. Easy to put on. If you follow the instruction, you will be done in a minute. If you are not sure, then watch the installation video in Youtube or their website. Some experience bubble - but this has nothing to do with the screen protector itself, but dust or lint on your screen causes the bubble. [HINT: Use rubbing alcohol to remove finger oil or dirt from the screen, this will greatly help the screen protector to stick well]. Again, I emphasize - use rubbing alcohol to remove any residue on the screen, THEN look at the screen at an angle, you might notice a lint on the screen you didn't see it before, blow it away gently.2. This screen protector is glossy finish. Glossy finish fully captures fine details of 8X display. But if you prefer Matte finish (non-glossy and non-reflective screen), it is also available in Halo. A rule of thumb is: matte finish is easier on the eyes, but loses some fine details of the screen and is not finger print magnet, but glossy screen captures color, pixels, and richness of the display well - but is reflective, also catches finger prints well. Ultimately it depends on what you prefer.3. Excellent fit. It doesn't cover your camera or the speaker. If you have a case (I use Diztronic & Incipio Dual Pro), screen protector edges do not touch the case, thus there will be no accidental peeling or wrinkles. But this depends on your case.4. It comes with 3 screen protectors and a lint free cloth. Excellent value. I know I am going to use this screen protector for a long time.5. Quality screen. It protects from scratch, residue (smudges), and UV resistant. The material is from Japan and it shows.All in all, I am very satisfied. Especially with the price & quality!

"I have 4 year old Asus Eee 1000HA netbook. It was good when it came out and I used it well. But being a netbook, it is still slow (even after upgrading to 2GB Ram and Windows 7), and I haven't used it much since last year. Then I thought that replacing HD with SSD might improve its performance. But I did not want to spend too much money on a netbook: Enter Kingston SSDNow V+200 60GB. Affordable and I thought it was worth a try. I was literally wowed after installing SSD.1. Everything is FASTER. Faster boot, sleep, resume, and shutdown. Faster open up of MS Office, browser, and other programs. SPEED is noticeable! I am actually using this netbook again!!2. Everything is QUIET. No moving parts, so you hear nothing. Sometimes, fan is on - but very quiet. The bottom of netbook doesn't get hot at all!3. Battery life is IMPROVED. SSD improves your battery life by about 30 minutes. I have noticed it in my netbook. (HINT: After installing the SSD, fully charge your battery, then completely drain the battery TWICE. This will help the battery to adjust to SSD).4. It supports S.M.A.R.T and TRIM, so your SSD will be optimized for Windows 7/8 or any other OS that supports them.Although the prices of SSD have been dropped, still they are expensive compared to HD.

"I am sure you love your HTC 8X! Now you must be wondering which case is best for it. There are several good options: Otterbox, Incipio, and Diztrnoic cases. I have Incipio already (HT-316 Dual Pro) and I love it a lot. I also know that Otterbox makes great cases as well. But these are somewhat pricey. So what is a happy medium? Diztronic case for your HTC 8X.1. The case is made out of TPU - stronger than silicon while flexible, and more shock absorbent than Polycarbonate plastics. This is very strong and sturdy case. TPU is also known for oil resistant. All in all, TPU is a great material for your phone.2. The case is slim, thin, and light. My Incipio case is great, but because it has two layers of protection(silicon lining inside and polycarbonate shell outside), it is somewhat bulkier and heavier than Diztronic case. You could feel the difference when you hold your phone.3. The case is tight fit. Other reviewers have said it is difficult to put on (this is so, because of the material and for great fit with the phone). Because it is a tight fit, the phone and the case feel like one object!4. The case is easy to handle. My Incipio case is somewhat slippery, but Diztronic case is not, yet easy to take it out from your pocket.5. All the buttons are well covered - except for the power button. All ports are easily accessible as well.So if you are looking for a great case with a great price, then Diztronic case is your best bet! I love mine!

"I love my HTC 8X! I am sure those who own 8X feel the same way and want to protect their phone. And Incipio Dual Pro case is an excellent choice! When I had HTC Radar 4G, I purchased some cheap cases and they were not really protecting the phone. Then I bought Incipio case, and wow it really protected my HTC Radar from all aspects: drops (including face down), hits, and abuses. So I came to trust in Incipio. And HTC 8X case is no exception. It is superbly & attractively designed.1. It is called, ""Dual Pro"" because the case comes in 2 parts: shock absorbing silicon core and outer plextonium shell. Plextonium is polycarbonate resin sheet material that is very strong. Your 8X will be protected well.2. Raised front silicon frame will protect your phone even if it falls face down. Very well designed.3. All the buttons (power, volume, and camera) are covered with silicon cover. Since some have complained about the hard time pressing the power button (it is flushed with the frame), raised silicon power button is a welcome design - you will not struggle with it.4. All openings and ports are fully accessible.5. It is very attractive and screams premium cover.6. It comes with clear screen protector, microfiber cleaning cloth, and applicator card.I am confident that this case will protect my 8X for years to come as it did with my Radar.

"I always loved Steve Allen, and because I am 70, I grew up with his TV presence in many forms. I wrote him a letter back in the 1980's praising one of his shows, and to my delight, eventually I received a two-page typed answer from him. This CD has 35 minutes of light jazz, and the only flaw for me is that it depends on the organ quite a bit, never my favorite sound in music. But his group is more than competent, he wrote all 12 songs (instrumentals here...I don't know if any have lyrics) and the bossa nova style suits his choices well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SF2MYOM13NJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001V4F#wasThisHelpful","R2SF2MYOM13NJN","A5A2QE6NECFR5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A2QE6NECFR5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gosh, I was on page 120 or so, after a long, dense, somewhat dull struggle, before I could make a promise to stay through the remaining two-thirds. I found the stage-setting aspect confusing, with way too much description and too little dialogue. However, after those 100-pages, I finally got enough info about the characters, their crises, their histories, and their possible fates to interest me. And the rest of the story was much better, although no characters were all that likeable for me, and most of the time when I choose novels, I want someone to for whom to root. This is a tale of two wives, two husbands, and two sons, crossing from England to Spain and back, flashing back 20 years to a traumatic event and coming back to the present for the unfolding of the final consequences. You will find some sex, some suspense, some danger, and much sadness and anger in their lives. If that description intrigues you, fine. I do believe that Ms. Knight can be expected to produce better novels in the future. I don't want to discourage her, because this book reveals she has a clever mind. What this first effort lacks is a dose of wit, a dollop of joy, and a main character who deserves fully the reader's devotion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DCBZR3VUQXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062362259#wasThisHelpful","R1DCBZR3VUQXM","A5A2QE6NECFR5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A2QE6NECFR5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, the most vile bad guys, the ones with the least excuses for being evil, meet their fates without direct confrontations with our favorite Boston private eye.

"The Parker Estate used Michael Brandman to keep the Police Chief Jesse Stone character alive, and now the series is in the hands of Reed Farrel Coleman. I read most of the Parker-authored entries, two of the Brandmans, and now this one by Coleman. I always enjoy these crime thrillers, because I like Jesse Stone and his back story and his ""current situation"" and his officers, friends, and underworld acquaintances. Tom Selleck plays Stone in occasional TV movie versions, and so when I read these, I see Tom as Jesse. This one has a beautiful lover with a secret, an old baseball team-mate with a secret, the father of an abducted boy with a secret, a mobster's wife with a secret. There are two hired killers, one with a too-late developed conscience, one without.

"If you pick up a book and judge it by the cover and the ""blurbs"" and decide ""It's local history"" you just might put it back down if you don't think ""I'm part of that locality."" In some cases, including this one, that would be a mistake. The Anglo-American West and Southwest were populated in the 19th and 20th centuries by travelers, and those who came to places like the Concho Valley in Texas as adults already had histories elsewhere. In the cases of the three women profiled in this book, their ""back stories"" are as fascinating as their lives near San Angelo. Mary Jane Metcalfe, for instance, born on a Georgia plantation in 1826, only spent about a decade in Texas before her death in a flood in 1882. Author Dana Glossbrenner's account of that tragedy, which took more than 65 lives, including Mrs. Metcalfe, her brother, and her teen daughter, is the stuff of nightmares for readers living in areas still susceptible to flooding. Before her death, this pioneer woman survived the suicide of her father when she was 16, the births of nine children, huge losses of money, livestock, food and property as Civil War battles raged back and forth in her husband's county in Tennessee, and his battles with inherited mental illness which confined him to an asylum, forcing her and her minor children to move to Texas. There she found herself in a community that was in the grip of a lengthy, violent battle between rival political gangs.The second major figure profiled, Annie Tankersley, was born in 1829 and died in 1902. For unknown reasons, she let her children believe that she was an only child born to the owners of a plantation, but the truth seems to be that she had several siblings and grew up a child of a small farmer who was also a preacher in a part of Mississippi not known for extensive wealth. Annie and her spouse migrated to Texas before the Civil War, to raise cattle. They got to the Concho River country by 1864, generally considered to be the first Caucasian family to permanently settle here. This was a time when raiding Indians from several tribes were still a huge danger to ranchers and farmers. By 1871 Fort Concho had been established in what is now San Angelo, and when her husband went on a lengthy cattle drive to California, Annie and her children moved into the fort for safety. When her husband returned, they built what is considered the second private home in the growing settlement just across the river from the soldiers. In 1878 there was a bitter divorce, but Annie got a fair settlement, stayed in the cattle business, and operated a hotel. She played a key part in a riot when the black ""Buffalo soldiers"" of the Fort demanded that a white man who shot an off-duty trooper be turned over. Ms. Tankersley created a delay that allowed him to escape the immediate danger. Eventually he was tried elsewhere and acquitted. Upon her death in 1902, Annie was lauded as a person who had a special generosity toward orphans and the homeless.And finally, the profile of Ellen Farr, born in 1862 in upstate New York, a hotbed of anti-slavery sentiment. Her father had tuberculosis, as did several in his family line, and the disease also was common in her mother's family. He moved with wife and kids to sparsely populated Northeast New Mexico, likely to improve his condition in dry air, and became a clerk for a wealthy man at his compound between Fort Union and the last leg of the Santa Fe Trail. her dad died when she was 11, and the survivors returned to New York, where Ellen earned a teaching certificate, after her mother's suicide when Ellen was just 15. Because she had an uncle who stayed in San Angelo after army service at Fort Concho, Ellen ended up coming West for a teaching job. She married, but divorced four years later, claiming spousal abuse and alcoholism. She served as postmaster, deputy county clerk, wife to a successful businessman, bore five children, and died in her mid-'40's, of unknown cause, while her husband was serving as mayor of San Angelo.This is a lengthy review, but I've left out almost all of the interesting details of these lives full of trouble, tragedy, hardship, heartache and headaches. Accounts like these are not ""local history"" but rather ""human history."" And Dana Glossbrenner did a fine job in revealing the sagas. The question I was left with when I finished was ""Could I have ever done nearly so well as these folks if I had lived in their circumstances?"" And that's exactly the right reaction we should have if the history book is any good. This one is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16WYZ7Z0YR6HK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NY8TUV0#wasThisHelpful","R16WYZ7Z0YR6HK","A5A2QE6NECFR5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A2QE6NECFR5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is only my second Jodie novel, but I liked this one a lot better than the one about the killer wishing to donate his heart. I agree with a couple of the negative reviews: The character of Jacob seems to exhibit every possible symptom of Asperger's every day yet in his own journal entries is brilliantly aware of them. Also, there is a court case at the heart of this novel, a complex one, and the final result of that case in terms of punishment(s) is left to our imagination. Crimes were committed, even admitted, yet no resolution clearly stated. I have had brief acquaintance with two Asperger's men, one in his 20's whose symptoms were so mild he became a small town policeman, but when called to his parents' home on a domestic disturbance, he shot and killed his father to save his mother. (Yes, there could be a good novel in that tragedy.) The other was a man who was not diagnosed until his '40's, who was a successful printer, married father of two, and an excellent if obsessed amateur astronomer. His childhood was much like the character Jacob's in ""House Rules."" So I came to this book with quite bit of interest, and it was rewarded. Jacob's brother, Theo, has troubles of his own. His mom is nearly saintly, his lawyer a rookie who likely would have never been allowed, in real life, to handle a murder case without a veteran co-counsel court-appointed to take the lead, and the main detective a lonely man forced by the seeming facts of a crime to be on opposite sides to where his sympathies lie. There is a victim in this story who I wanted to live, and whose death seems too easy, and at the moment of that development I had to decide whether to keep reading. I'm glad I did, but based on my first two of her novels, Ms. Picoult's specialty seems to be challenging readers to hang with her and try to figure out why she is taking us on journeys with difficult people toward ambiguous ends. She does that well, if ""that"" is an intentional goal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M1M28T68IUN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743296443#wasThisHelpful","R2M1M28T68IUN5","A5A2QE6NECFR5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A2QE6NECFR5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was born at the end of 1944, just before Audie Murphy's bravery in battle led to his becoming the most decorated soldier of World War II, while looking like the high school senior he should have been back in Texas. I didn't know anything about him until I got old enough to see his cowboy/outlaw movies beginning at age ten. I liked him and was too young to care than he wasn't a highly talented actor. I didn't see the film version of his autobiography, ""To Hell and Back"" until it was re-released around 1962, when I was a senior in high school, although it originally came out in '55. When I was about ten, I began to become a fan of certain actors and singers. My first three ""crushes"" were for Doris Day, Fess Parker (Davy Crockett on the Disney version from television) and Murphy. I still like all of them, and now live in Parker's Texas home town. My niece lives in Murphy's Texas home county. Several years ago I read ""Audie Murphy: American Soldier"" a lengthy and excellent treatment of his life. This new book is about one-third as large, and covers most of the same ground concisely. Smith, however, explores Audie's personal demons and attributes them to post-traumatic stress disorder, what in WW II was termed ""combat fatigue"" as if a good month's rest back home would fix it. Audie's symptoms dominated his post-war life (until his death in a plane crash in 1971 just short of his 46th birthday.) He had nightmares, needed to carry a loaded, concealed pistol every day, and sleep with it under his pillow, became a gambling addict in a really big, destructive way, failed in a couple of marriages, had trouble coping with his fame, praise, and acting assignments. He was relegated to low-budget westerns with few exceptions in a 15-year major career which featured about 40 films. This book is worth reading to learn about Murphy's heroism, the frustrations he found in Hollywood, and his misunderstood PTSD. And if you want to see some his movies, here are nine I recommend, in no particular order: Kansas Raiders, 1950, for an early example; The Red Badge of Courage, 1951; Destry, 1954; To Hell and Back, '55; Night Passage, '57; The Quiet American, '58; No Name on the Bullet, 1959; The Unforgiven, 1960, and Seven Ways From Sundown, 1960. None are masterpieces, two are civil war plots, one is comic, in two he plays non-heroes, and in two he is a supporting actor, and only two are non-westerns. However, these, in my view, show him in quickies made in three weeks on low money, a couple of high-budget fairly big successes, and his self-portrayal in the story of his WWII exploits, in which he wanted to highlight the sacrifices of his fellow soldiers, not the glorification of his own actions (as the book did, but the movie had to compromise about in order to get made.) Audie Murphy may have been a difficult man to love intimately, and to live with, but incredibly stressful combat circumstances made him that way. And that part of his life saved the lives of countless U.S. military personnel. Fourth of July seems a good day to acknowledge him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39K940VEJZDO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1621573176#wasThisHelpful","R39K940VEJZDO2","A5A2QE6NECFR5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A2QE6NECFR5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like getting my Robert Parkers (or the novels produced since his death with the same characters, authorized by his estate) from the library for two reasons: 1. They are free. 2. Since they only take me a few hours to read (being all dialogue for 300 or fewer pages) free is a better deal than a purchase for twenty bucks. This ""Jesse Stone"" entry was quite good. Someone is murdered late in the book, and that came as a surprise to me. I expected Police Chief Stone and his bodyguard friend to be able to stop it from happening, so that twist made the novel even more successful. These are all written to a formula...enjoy that formula and all of them are worth trying, although some series entries do work better than some others. Many recurring characters appear, some friends, some foes of the still-drinking but not to excess rough-edged law officer. A beautiful woman shows up now and then, an interesting pet appears occasionally, troubled townsfolk are often helped by Stone's intervention, which begins in antagonism and ends in gratitude. No deep thoughts in these, just escape into someone else's troubled world for a few hours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VBHKN1D7L1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042526128X#wasThisHelpful","R2VBHKN1D7L1L","A5A2QE6NECFR5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A2QE6NECFR5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I liked the early entries in Coulter's FBI series quite a bit, but her more recent efforts more often bring the following words to mind: Lazy, affected, stilted, formulaic, stale. This one has more than one villain, plot complications which are not credible, and bad guys who are kind of dull. The names of her characters are getting strange and annoying, as some other reviewers have noted. She also has this weird need to remind us about six times per book that one of her heroes drives an expensive German sports car, even on FBI duty. While the formula, having an established FBI couple encourage romance between two other characters while all four are involved in investigating lethal enemies of society, was charming in the first few novels of the series, by now it's all too predictable. I did stick with this because I wanted to know exactly who killed whom and why, and who ran a drug deal and who was innocent, there were no real surprises at the ""reveal."" These are light entertainment efforts, and as such, have their place in a compulsive reader's life, but I think Ms. Coulter has ridden this particular franchise to the finish line.

"This is a great reference book on the ""western"" part of the country and western music industry, concentrating on performers who included lots of songs about cowboys, Indians, cattle, criminals and their clashes with contemporary life. Great photos and short bios of more than 200 singers, pickers and writers. From The Carter Family through Gene Autry and Roy Rogers and up to Michael Martin Murphy and George Strait, there is fascinating food for thought here. A CD is included with a sampling of traditional cowboy songs by non-professional singers and some who were/are polished pros, like the great Cisco Houston. Frankly, though, the book is the real achievement, not the disc. And if you like cowboy culture and find this item at an affordable price, don't hesitate.

"This was my first Picoult novel, and it perhaps is not the best choice for a reader initiation. I had read some glowing reviews of her output, and found this on the library shelf last week. It promised an innovative look at the ""religion v. spirituality"" debate and an argument against the death penalty and a  challenging look at retribution v. forgiveness. I found that it attempted all three premises, but was only partly successful in each. It took 100 pages for me to commit to finishing, since the opening 25 percent focuses heavily on the lives of death row inmates, a subject I was not fascinated by. It did get better. Unfortunately, I guessed the major plot secret long before the halfway point of the novel, as did several other reviewers. The best characters in here were Maggie Bloom, the ACLU attorney who fights to give the alleged murderer an execution that would allow his organs to be donated, and her dad, a Rabbi.  I pretty much liked Michael the priest as well, although his back story was not convincing. The inmate, Shay, who somehow works a few miracles for his fellow convicts, never intrigued me. I will say that the final 100 pages are powerful and made me emotional, and for that reason, maybe 3.5 stars is a proper rating. And I will try another Picoult, when the half-dozen books that just arrived in the mail are consumed.

One was wealthy and powerful and smart, one was back-woodsy but ""gifted"" with super-fast hypnotic talent, and the third was mixed-up in values and acting on bad information that didn't justify the character's rage. Agents Savitch and Sherlock were as usual, very likeable, and the formula of having one of their friends fall in love with one of the victims in their case is getting too predictable and pedestrian.

"Yes, four stars for a great novel idea realized just a bit imperfectly. Mr. Howard has talent. He took a real incident (an attempt to hurt singer Nat Cole at an Alabama concert in 1956), moved it back ten years, changed some of the details, invented a soldier hero who saves the ""King"" but pays a harsh punishment price, and shows us the ex-soldier/convict as the crooner's driver ten years later. He and Nat go back to the scene of the crime to do a makeup show in the midst of the Montgomery bus boycott. Nat only has a supporting role. The driver and his friends and family are the major characters we come to know, like and understand. I am 70, so I am old enough to recall seeing Cole's famous brief TV series of 15-minute unsponsored NBC shows. My mother liked Nat's singing, so I got to hear several of his LP's in the '50's, and have owned a great many since. We were a white family in NJ, as casually racist in our use of language as all the other Caucasian families we knew, but we did no physical or economic harm to the African-Americans we did know, and we owned records not only by Nat but by Billy Eckstine and other black artists. Mr.Howard's novel demonstrates that even in Hollywood back then racial anxieties from whites hampered the careers of highly talented men and women. Although this book is fiction, I found it reminded me effectively of the Civil Rights struggles I lived through (at a distance) throughout the 60's and made me want to listen to my Cole CD's immediately after I finished.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H2K7HIHBCL2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006052961X#wasThisHelpful","R1H2K7HIHBCL2L","A5A2QE6NECFR5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A2QE6NECFR5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Spicing up the new bedroom with new toys is always an adventure. But a very fun adventure. To keep your relationship or marriage healthy, you should always try new things with your partner to keep the spice rolling. I love to try new things with my hubby. It makes it fun and we learn as we go. If we don't like something we try, we can at least say we have tried it. We have never tried a mouth gag before so i thought it would be fun to try for the first time. The mouth gag straps are very well made and i felt comfortable with it on my face. It is lengthy but you can adjust the size to fit your head. The ring of the mouth gag was like the perfect fit for my mouth to be open and i have a small mouth.

"The 8mm wide men's silicone are a great gift for your hubby that has an active life such as being an athlete or working in some heavy construction work. Sometimes wedding bands get in the way or become uncomfortable to wear. Sometimes even the hubby's job may not allow wedding rings due to safety precaution. This is a great alternative to buy if that is the case. In this set, you get 2 size 10 rings and 2 size 11 which is great so you know you will have a size that fits you if you're not sure if you're a 10 or 11. Also, if you're not sure which is which. The sizes are inside for you to see. In my case, my fianc is wearing the size 11 because we are into cycling and sometimes holding on to the handle bars for hours at a time becomes uncomfortable when wearing a regular wedding band.

"Child safety locks are always a must for parents because we all know that kids love to get into things they aren't suppose to. My house unfortunately has a ton of cabinets which means I needs tons of child safety locks! My son is now 2 and into everything but his own toys. I am always on my toes to make sure he doesn't get into anything he isn't suppose to. I child safety locked all the cabinets in the bathroom so that he could not get into any drawers that he didn't need to. I hide all my bathroom essentials like deodorant,toothpaste, razors... ect. It makes me feel so much better that I can relax knowing he cannot dig in any drawer in the bathroom now that they are all locked up. These locks have a powerful super sticky side that you peel and stick to any drawer in your house, you can even adjust the size of the lock to fit your desired need and waaaa laaaa! So easy to instal and now you can breathe. These locks would be very hard for a child to even open because you have to slide the piece out and up at the same time.

"Work just got easier! I work in the medical field and I have a work laptop that I have to chart on patients all day long and i an one person that needs a mouse to function correctly. This handheld mouse is perfect for left or right handers which is amazing because I am right handed and my husband is left handed! The portable finger mouse was ready to go as soon as I plugged it in to my lap top and instantly it was so much easier to navigate than the original laptop mouse. The rolly ball on the portable mouse is very smooth and the buttons click very nicely. I have big hands and it was still perfect fitting in my hand. This is probably the best invention I have ever tried before! The cord is a little longer than i would imagine. However, if I wanted to use it at my home desk, the cord would need to be long to fit around my whole desk AND I wouldn't have to sit so close to my desk either. It's amazing that you don't need a surface to use it! I love it, I love it, I love it!

" 0:14 MinsHere is the trap in action....  it develops a 1200 volt charge, then when it senses an animal stepping on more than one of the 3 metal plates on the floor... zap... dead as you can see.Pro:- it is very very rare for a rat to beat it...  I've been using mine 4 years, caught about 75 rats, and only one small female was able to freak out enough to get away...  she basically squirmed like crazy, got lucky and lurched backwards out of the trap.- batteries last forever...  I put one set of Cs in it and those went over 18 months before they died- you can just dump the undamaged, not bloody, non disgusting rat body on the floor then take your dogs pooper scooper or the likeCon-- if you are sloppy with whatever bait you use, it might arc across 2 of the floor plates and wear out the batteries or possibly kill the trap, so be carefulTips:-  leave it off for a couple of days so the rats get used to their new food stop, then turn it on and they will go to town.- a university study from New Zealand recently ranked baits for rats and it was surprising:1- english muffin (yup, shocking, I tried it and caught 3 rats in a day, one crawled over his dead mates body to get to the english muffin and got zapped)2- dark tuna meat... buy the cheapest nastiest can of tuna and stick a little of it back there3- slim jims style jerky....  a lot of rats cant resist this4- peanut butter...  no surpriseMost important tip:  I found that Rats got very inventive at licking or grabbing the peanut butter or bait from the airholes in back, so I just took an old metal box and blocked it so they had to go into the front to get the bait.... they still love the bait, they just aren't able to steal it anymore.Lastly, get a cheap infrared webcam and set it up so you don't have to go check the trap all the time... set it up to email you video of the rat getting caught, then you can pull out a fresh, non stinky rat and pitch him into the trash or local stand of trees as a food donation for needy racoons etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZMYGOWF4W0BD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHT2ICE#wasThisHelpful","RZMYGOWF4W0BD","ANC36RGFR9HU4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANC36RGFR9HU4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are super soft face towels!! I received a sample for review, but I won't post pictures since some of the colors I received are discontinued (white, blue, purple). This set now comes with pairs of pink, yellow and green towels. They are thin, just as the stock photos show, so I'll be careful when washing these to make them last longer (hand wash). I might try them on the delicate cycle in my washing machine, but I would imagine they might snag unless in a garment bag. They are creamy soft on my face, and I really like them a lot! I normally use terrycloth face towels which are thicker and more durable, but not as soft.

"This headset is awesome! I received a sample for review and definitely rate it 5 stars for its excellent quality. This headset delivers in sound quality, comfort, and fine details.COMFORT: These feel like a dream! The ear part is large enough to fit comfortably around my large lady ears, and the band is padded very well so I barely notice it on my head. Other over-ear headphones usually hurt my ears, as well as the headband part feeling hard and uncomfortable on top of my skull after prolonged use. These do not cause any discomfort from prolonged wear. The ear pieces swivel to conform nicely to my head.PHONE CALLS: I use it on my iPhone 6+ and my DH says I come in clear (although not the same as using stock Apple headsets which are pretty unbeatable for phone call sound quality). He sounds crystal clear on my end.MUSIC QUALITY: The music sounds crisp and bassy when playing through my phone, and sounds even better for some reason when plugged into my MacBook Air.AWESOME FACT: THIS ALSO WORKS AS A GAMING HEADSET FOR SONY PLAYSTATION 4. I'm super excited about this latter fact, can you tell? I'm an avid gamer and play daily with my husband. If you are on PSN, you know that the stock Sony headsets are very poorly made: they hurt your ears. And Sony makes an effort so that other headsets can't be used on their system, except for the few brands they have approved, like Turtlebeach. I found that old Apple headsets can work, if you can find a previous version of them (the current ones create a buzz in the chat party). These Sentey headsets can plug right into your controller and the chat party sounds crystal clear to everyone.I posted some pictures so you can see the fine details of how well this is made.Hope my review helps and happy shopping!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17JJRAMJLO7EZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMX5AY#wasThisHelpful","R17JJRAMJLO7EZ","A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice budget headset. I received a sample for review and give it a good 4 stars. It isn't the best quality headset, but you get what you pay for, and at less than $20, this works well for the price. The sound quality isn't as good as stock Apple headsets. I LOVE Apple products and believe they make AWESOME headsets for phone calls and music enjoyment. So if you have Apple products, just hold onto those amazing ear buds. But if you don't, this headset is a good budget alternative. You can use if for phone calls since it comes with a mic, and the braided cord is made of really great quality. The headset is as pretty as the pictures, super pretty in white & pink. This also works on my Sony Playstation 4, although the sound quality wasn't the best, the other players said they could hear a faint hiss when I talked, so I won't use this for gaming. I also wouldn't be able to wear this for a prolonged amount of time because of the earpiece and headband: the ear buds are too small for my large lady ears and press in on my ears, and the headband part contacts the top of my head (not enough padding for my comfort).Hope my review helps and happy shopping!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N78TS8GPFXKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0179DDIQI#wasThisHelpful","R1N78TS8GPFXKY","A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a discounted sample for review and definitely rate it 5 stars, because it is an excellent product for the price. If you are on a budget, you get a LOT for almost $10. I always wanted a nice Kabuki brush, but they are so darn expensive in the makeup stores. Now I have so many!! This kit is awesome!! It comes with 10 brushes and the bristles are very soft. I'm super happy with the set. It also comes with a vinyl case that is very handy for storage - each brush sits in place firmly, making this set easy to travel with and store away. The case isn't high quality, but it works well, and is good enough for the price. The bristles aren't even on one of my brushes, but I don't really care about that, and it was easy to trim. I posted pictures so you can see what the brush heads are like close up :)NOTE: If you have money to burn, you may not want to buy these. If you want high end real animal hair brushes, or a fancy leather case, this is not it. I think you get more than what you pay for with this product, but it is not for people looking for high end makeup brushes. High end makeup brushes are seriously overpriced and I can't afford them. It's ridiculous how expensive nice makeup brushes are, not to mention how high maintenance they are, I only have one LOL.Hope my review helps and happy shopping!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22GJLUHA2P8OG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SQ476I#wasThisHelpful","R22GJLUHA2P8OG","A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a sample for review and am happy with this product. I'm a very efficient packer (I used to be a flight attendant) and appreciate anything that makes traveling more organized and manageable. I'm not sure why these are labeled as ""extra deep"" since this was a lot smaller than I expected it to be. But I've never used a packing cube before, so I have no reference. The quality is excellent, but for $10, I think one cube is overpriced, so minus 1 star there. Maybe it would be worth it if it was made out of more thicker durable material, or was water proof, or had some extra pockets for small items. I know the description says waterproof, but there are huge holed vents in the top and bottom, so I really wouldn't call this waterproof at all. It measures to: 6.5"" x 16"" x 5"" (deep) but doesn't fit in my luggage across, like their stock photos (my luggage fits in the overhead compartment). I could easily fit a pair of heavy jeans in it, with room to spare for socks or a teeshirt, but I couldn't fit my large bulky knit turtleneck sweater. I intend to use this as a dirty laundry compartment while on the road, which I think it'll be perfect for.Hope my review helps and happy shopping!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ARWWCC90HBUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013S7YVB0#wasThisHelpful","R3ARWWCC90HBUI","A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a sample for review and am happy with this solar powered light. I live in Southern California, so I had no problems charging up this solar light during the day. The product looks just like the photos, and comes in a small box with the lamp part detached (although connected with wires). All you do to put it together is place the light's hinge on the base's hinge, and use the connecting turn-handle screw. EZPZ. I didn't need the included lug nut, because the screw didn't pop out on the other side of the hinge. You have the option to put the stake in the base, or you can use the 3 included screws & anchors to mount it on a wall. The light is not powerful, which is what I was hoping for. This is going in my parent's backyard to ward off trespassers at night and help my dog when he needs to go out. I love that this automatically turns on at night. It has a setting for off, low and high, but there isn't a significant difference, as the light is VERY DIM in general. FYI if you're on a budget, I saw similar products for a few dollars cheaper.Hope my review helps and happy shopping!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4RSCETF5N0B4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011O8OXXG#wasThisHelpful","R4RSCETF5N0B4","A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a sample for review and give it 5 stars. I hesitate to give out 5 stars in general unless I'm totally in love with a product, but this wallet is excellent quality for what it costs, doesn't look or feel cheap, and I can't really find anything wrong with it. I received the Black 5.5"" size wallet ($7.99 at time of review).It's 7"" x 4"" when closed, and 7"" x 8"" when open. The interior is lined with a soft material to protect your phone. The right side pocket has 3 slots for cards, and I could comfortably fit 4 cards in each slot. I probably could have maxed out at 5, but I didn't have enough cards to try it out with. I posted pictures of the wallet stuffed with 12 cards and an old iPhone 4. The leather is soft and flexible so that the wallet didn't try to fly open when stuffed (which would happen if it was stiff thick cheap leather). And it actually fits my iPhone 6+ without a case on (my phone is 6+"" as its monicker indicates). I usually have a case though, so I won't use this to carry my phone.The only negative thing I could say about this product is that it's not quite as shiny as the stock photos (it almost looks like real leather in the stock pix to me). But that's a real stretch, because it looks really great in person, the fine details are all there: the weave is classy and perfectly cut and put together, the seams are smooth and cleanly done, no rough edges, no cheap molding. At less than $10, I would not expect this to last forever, but it could last quite a while depending on how you use it.I would totally buy this if it came as a regular compact sized wallet for my credit cards, because it's well made and looks classy. Unfortunately I don't see any offered by this company.Hope my review helps and happy shopping!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EG19BMTSQAYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014H5H2VI#wasThisHelpful","R1EG19BMTSQAYI","A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a sample product for review and give it a solid 4 stars. I've been wearing it daily for a week now, and can't tell if it's doing anything for my arthritis yet, but if it does, then I'll bump up my review to 5 stars and buy some more. If it were just jewelry, I would give it 5 stars, it's now one of my favorite accessories. But since it claims to relieve arthritic pain, I can only give it 4 stars since I'm happy with it, but it does not necessarily do what it's intended to do.These are definitely stunning!! OMG it's so pretty! I will wear this regularly. It's shiny rose gold plated (I have no idea if it's true rose gold, or what percent of plating mix), but it's a really solid plating - I have to constantly bend this bracelet when I put it on or take it off since my wrists are so bony, and so far, the plating has held up very well. I will update my review when/if the plating wears off. The magnets are very strong - I used my Restoration Hardware fridge super magnets and they gripped the magnets really firmly. This bracelet really is stunning though, I can't stop repeating it - I don't think the other reviews are the usual ""free sample fluff.""  My husband keeps making comments about my bracelet because it's so eye-catching. I may end up buying some more for my other wrist or to bunch up a few, because I love the color. I would buy rings if they made them. Do they make them?? The box says it's 99% copper, but I have no way to test it out, because I'm not going to cut up my bracelet to see what's inside, but seriously, I can't believe that copper would be this cheap. /shrugDoes it work for arthritis? Who knows. I don't think there is enough scientific data yet to prove or disprove that this works. But I'll give anything a try to help my joint pain.Is this worth the money? In my opinion, yes, because as an accessory alone, this is a gorgeous bracelet that will not tarnish, like most other bracelets at this price. The plating is thicker than most jewelry at this price, and the color is gorgeous. It's a great thickness, not too flashy, not too thin or flimsy. I would have bought this at the jewelry store if I had seen it for sale :)Hope my review helps and happy shopping!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F88IXOLTDHMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149US67U#wasThisHelpful","R2F88IXOLTDHMP","A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a sample of this product review and definitely give it 5 stars. I also have one from Mudder, and this one is far superior. First, it comes with batteries (I was really irritated that the Mudder one didn't come with them). Then there's a lot of care in the details and it's made really well, which is something I care about. Both parts of the thermomter have a convenient stand, the battery hatch is very secure (Mudder fell off), the design is pretty, and it feels good in my hands. I cook daily for 2 and this comes in soooooo handy to make the perfect roast, turkey, steak, anything. This is a must have for BBQ grill n00bs like me.

"I received a sample of this product for review and rate it 4 stars. It's not the best BT out there, but it's solid and pretty. I got the red ones and use it with my iPhone 6+ and MacBook Air. I really like that I can clasp the magnetic buds together and just wear it down to the gym and not have to worry about wires dangling while I'm working out.The talking quality is good - it's not as crisp as stock Apple headsets, but I could hear my DH well and vice versa. I can talk anywhere in the same room with my device, but when I start moving far into the kitchen (no door to the kitchen) and my phone is in the living room, the connection gets unstable.The music quality is excellent. Clear sound, good bass. However I can't seem to get a good soft low volume with my iPhone6+, but I can with my MacBook Air (if I adjust the volume slider in iTunes).This pairs as ""DT55"" and was ezpz to pair. The audio confirmations are a nice touch - a female voice tells you whether you are powering on/off, in pairing mode, calling, etc.THINGS I LIKE ABOUT THIS HEADSET:- Reliable clear connection for talking on the phone without dangly wires (all the cheap BT headsets I've tried have horrible talking quality)- Pretty- Can wear around your neck with magnetic earbuds for easy transport- Sound confirmations- Great music sound qualityTHINGS I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT:- When my iPhone6+ is on the lowest volume setting, it's louder than I want it to be. This is fine for when I'm working out because it's noisy in the gym, but I won't wear this to listen to music on my phone while I'm at home (I'll use it connected to my MBA instead)- Talking sound quality is not the same as Apple stock headset (imo fair trade for lack of dangly wires)- Music sound quality is excellent but I prefer a more boomy bass sound (just my preference)- The smallest size ear buds fit me but are a little bigger than I want them to be (I'm a 5'9"", 150 lbs woman, if that helps any). I've seen smaller buds come with other headsets- No Siri button (that I could figure out, if you figure it out, please tell me :)I don't always keep my review samples, but this is a keeper for working out at the gym, and listening to music/talking on phone while cooking. I posted pictures of the instructions, in case you're like me, and just throw them away and want to be able to look them up later.Oh, and just in case you're a gamer, these do not work with PS4 (most BT are vetoed by Sony, boo).Hope my review helps and happy shopping!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1878EQFBAE7XR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01434SX8Y#wasThisHelpful","R1878EQFBAE7XR","A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a sample of this product for review and give it a solid 4 stars for being good quality cheap cutting board. I cook daily for 2 and am always in need of cutting boards! One day I will treat myself to a gorgeous wood block (maybe Christmas?), but for now, I use the modestly priced ones on Amazon. My arsenal includes: Foodie's Kitchen Premium Silicone CB ($22), Dexas Lemon CB ($10), Yolomommies CB ($20 for 2), a small bamboo board, as well as those large flat white CB's that are made with similar materials as these Equinox International boards ($19 for 3). Each board has pro's and con's, but I'm still not satisfied and continue on my quest for that perfect cutting board.WHY I LIKE THESE CUTTING BOARDS:- dishwasher safe- solid (feels great to chop on)- grooves to catch all those liquids!! Can't believe all boards do not have this :L- super cheap (compared to all the others I've bought)- small and easy to pick up and use for a quick chop and toss in the dishwasherTHINGS THAT BUG ME:- doesn't stay firm on my counter unless I flip it upside down to the side without the catch grooves (what the heck man, oh right, cheap)- narrow board shape, I would prefer it to be more square, or just a lot larger!

"I received a sample of this product for review and give it 4 stars because I definitely like it!Make sure to order your Chinese size! They make clothing a lot smaller in China. If you ever visit, you would know why. Everyone is super skinny and small. Except Yao Ming. For reference, my waist is 32"" and my hips are 40"" and I got this in XXL. If they had it, a XXXL would have been baggy and comfy. I'm 5'9"", and at this size, the knee band is tight and comes right at the base of my knees. Another inch of length would have been perfect for me. But if you're shorter than me, they should be the perfect length for you. The pants are slim on me, not baggy, but not tight either. The waistband is a little tight, but not uncomfortably. These are high waisted and I love that! (I hate how low waisted everything else is these days)These have nice sized pockets on both sides, but aren't super duper deep. They aren't as shallow as other Chinese clothing though. I can almost fit my entire large lady hands in them (see pic).There are two different laces, a black one in the top red band, and a white one in the lower grey band. As other reviewers mention, the laces are a little on the short side, so the black one pulls back into the waistband when you stretch it to put them on. I removed both laces, since the waistband is very tight and doesn't need them. If you want to keep them in, make sure to double knot the ends so they don't get sucked back in. The white pair of laces are longer though, and don't get sucked in for me. They are not as long as the stock photo though. I'm sorry I didn't take a picture to show how long the laces are.

I love cooking and baking, so these decorative labels are an elegant option for my jars and containers. I was using painter's tape and marker before which looks so ghetto. The ""chalk"" marker erases easily and writes nicely, so you can use these over and over. Make sure to give the marker time to dry so it doesn't smudge. The marker isn't firm like a sharpie; the tip is soft so it looks like chalk on blackboard. The pack comes with 6 pages of 8 labels, too many for my kitchen.. hmm I could use these for other household containers I guess?

"I really like these gloves a lot. I assumed these would be the same as a black pair I got from a Teikis BBQ set because they look the same, however these are much better! They are softer and more flexible than the other brand, and these fit me much better. I have size Large lady hands and I like the way these fit. They are not like regular gloves, and do not fit perfectly, but I imagine this has to be sized a certain way to fit all genders and hand sizes and shapes. I like the color too, it's just as pictured. I received this product for evaluation and review and use this regularly in my kitchen. I would pay extra for them to be available in different sizes and lengths, these are so much better than cloth mitts that I had been using in the past few decades.Hope my review helps and happy shopping!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22AMNW77JBDGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014504QNM#wasThisHelpful","R22AMNW77JBDGR","A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EXCELLENT APPLE HEADSET KNOCK OFFS! I am soooooooo excited about these headsets! If you are a gamer, you know that the stock headsets that come with PS4 (or Xone) are so awful! Apple headsets are designed so well, that they are comfortable and have wonderful sound quality. Unfortunately Sony has made it so that the new Apple headsets create buzz when used. It is such a pain in the butt that Sony does not let most headsets, especially bluetooth, work with their console. UGH. But I am so excited because these headsets WORK PERFECTLY WITH PS4 GAMING!!! Can you tell that I am a game nerd?? Yes. A happy game nerd. These are almost exactly like Apple headsets too. I can only see two tiny minor differences: the cable is made of a slightly different material - this feels a little softer/tackier, and I can see a very small seam on the side of the earbuds (barely visible) where Apple ones do not. I got these free as a sample, but will definitely repurchase these since I know for sure that they work with gaming consoles. If you are a gamer, these are the best wired headsets to play with! They are comfortable to wear for hours, and the sound quality is excellent both for you and your party, the sound cancellation is great, yet you can tell if someone is trying to talk to you in the same room (it does not completely block out all sound, which is dangerous in my opinion). Just don't click the volume buttons! It makes an annoying sound to your party and they will get mad at you. Happened. Heehee. Adjust the volume through the Audio Settings.Hope my review helps and happy shopping!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQOKZHOJKYKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0154ARF94#wasThisHelpful","RKQOKZHOJKYKU","A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love my new selfie stick! I would never have thought to buy one, but I was offered a sample product to evaluate and review and am really digging it. I have really long arms, so I never wanted one of these, but they make such nicer pictures with the added distance. I don't know how it works, but you plug it into your iPhone (I have a 6+) and the button on the handle takes the picture! So awesome! Ha ha I am super excited about this stick, particularly because it's a pretty turquoise (my favorite color), and folds up so compact. It even comes with a carrying case too, although it's kind of linty, so I won't be using it.

"I received this product for evaluation and review and am very happy with the product. I occasionally use vitamin C serums to help with wrinkles all over my face, neck and body (especially my neck, yuck!). I really like that this is a bit larger than the bottles I usually find in the stores, and it has no frills: Sometimes I've got serums that are diluted with fragrance and/or cream, but this seems like the real deal. My mom is old school and actually rubs lemons on her face. I admit she has amazing skin for a senior citizen, but I'm just not willing to deal with all the fuss of lemons, so Vitamin C serums are perfect for me!

Fortunately I was provided a sample of this product for evaluation and review and it works exactly the same. I have no need for a CD player in my car and use my iPhone for music, so I don't mind that this sits in the CD player.

"I bought these because they look just like the ones from Bed Bath & Beyond but a little cheaper. They are not the same :( They LOOK exactly the same, but the difference is in the quality and details:the curtain is very thin - mine picked up discoloration within a week (the BBB one took a month),and the holes are not reinforced with metal grommets - they are just cut holes into the vinyl (which is fine, did not ever tear on me while I used it)For the price, I will not purchase this again, knowing I can spend another dollar or two at BBB.

"I am unhappy that I wasted so much money and time on this humidifier. I did SO MUCH RESEARCH, read all the reviews, and this seemed like a great solution to humidify my small bedroom. This worked okay for the first month, but then it went downhill. I clean my humidifier regularly, I flip the filter DAILY, re-soak the filter regularly to revitalize, only use clean filtered water, and have done all the helpful tips I read in the reviews. I think the problem is with the replacement filters, if you read the reviews for the replacement filters, Honeywell has changed them and made them worse.. they are thinner and do not prevent mold, in fact they develop BLACK MOLD quickly. But the worst part is that it doesn't do much to humidify the air anymore. I have a tiny bedroom and keep the doors closed at night yet I wake up so dry. It worked well when it was brand new, I used it on the lowest setting and it seemed to humidify well. But after the filter replacement, I have to use the second setting which is very loud and annoying to fall asleep to, but it still does not humidify the air much. The highest setting is too loud for my small bedroom, so I may look into donating this and finding a new product.Rantings aside, I did like that the bottom tray is dishwasher safe, and how easy it is to fill, and how low maintenance this is compared to a vaporizer (no deposits to scrape off). However, having to flip the filter daily, and re-soak it after a month to revitalize it, are such a nuisance.Oh well. I hope my review was helpful and I would totally appreciate and welcome any suggestions or solutions :)","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37O37PQ6NWHM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJTVHKO#wasThisHelpful","R37O37PQ6NWHM5","A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this flosser!!! It is now my favorite. Yes, the floss is fragile and can break, but these slide between my tight teeth so easily!!! I have osteoarthritis and flossing is a pain (literally), so I was super excited to find that these require barely any effort. I've only been using them for a few weeks and have had 2 break on me; however, I wonder if they made it more durable, if it wouldn't slide so easily, just like all the others. I'm hoping I will get more of a knack for using these down the line and maybe not break them anymore. I am definitely way too excited over a dental tool!! I LOVE HOW EASY IT IS TO FLOSS NOW! Ha ha, sorry for the cheese. Every other flosser I've used have always got stuck between some of my teeth because they are so tightly aligned, and have been so hard to get in and out, especially back by my crown.

"I love these measuring cups, however, the quality control is poor. They are lovely, like the pictures, and are perfect for scooping up flour and confectioner's sugar. I debated heavily about exchanging these, but I'm so tired of doing that with my Amazon purchases, so I decided to ""fix"" these myself.I found several of the cups with dark black or red waxy type substance in various spots, which remained even after hand washing. I had to scrub quite a bit with Bar Keepers. MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR CUPS THOROUGHLY AND SCRUB WITH BAR KEEPERS!! Check: the inside of your cups for little black dots, the corners under the handle, the top of the handle, and even along the edges (I had a lot of black wax hiding on the edges themselves). Who knows what that is, I sure don't want to end up eating it!Also, the edges were sharp on two of my handles. I really did not want to bother with another exchange, so I fixed it myself. DO NOT USE SANDPAPER, otherwise use it very very carefully, as I managed to get a little scuff mark on top of the handle. I was so bummed, because these cups are so pretty, but I scuffed the handle of my 1 cup and the sandpaper wouldn't really work (unless you scrub for a very very very long time, I imagine). So I used our DREMEL SANDER (we normally use for our beagle's nails) and it worked perfectly! In case you wanted to look into it, I got the ""Dremel 7300-PT 4.8-Volt Pet Grooming Kit"" on Amazon, it works really well for weekly pet nail grooming.Still, I'm glad I got these. I scoured the internet and couldn't find any stainless steel measuring cups made in the USA anymore, so I settled for these. I think they are overpriced for the poor quality control; hopefully I'm just a fluke, but if not, they are totally overpriced. Still, I'm happy with these and am sure they will last me a very long time. Darn that scuff mark, I wish I could unseen it ha ha!Hope my review helps, and happy shopping!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P3E7TDFOQ68D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GSXFKYY#wasThisHelpful","R2P3E7TDFOQ68D","A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVGSOJ1MQYGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Its another dark and gritty story, full of mystery and intrigue.  It keeps you riveted and turning the pages to see what happens next.In this book we get a better look at the past and see exactly how Olivia, Gabriel, and Ricky are involved in what happens now and in the future.  Im curious to see how it will all play out and how Olivias future actions will affect the trio in the upcoming books.  I love both Ricky and Gabriel and it pains me to know that this series will most likely end with one of these guys heartbreak.Gabriel has been making quite a bit of progress himself, allowing Olivia into his life and personal space, and its fun to see him evolve.  Although I do adore Ricky!!Im also really enjoying learning more about Olivias birth father, Todd, and the motivations that led him to where he is now, in prison!  This storyline is bound to only get better.I really enjoyed this story and honestly cannot wait for the next entry into this series!*OBS would like to thank the publisher for supplying a free copy of this title in exchange for an honest review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YHJH25MHM76W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=052595306X#wasThisHelpful","R2YHJH25MHM76W","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer UnaJeannie Moon has done it again and given the reader a great story with good flow and interesting and complex characters. She weaves her other stories in but allows each story to stand alone in their own right.Leah an ambitious attorney is smart outspoken and leery of business romances and commitment. Burnt in the past with an office romance, she decides when she meets Tristan Wade, a CFO for her brothers firm that friendship will be what she will maintain with him in spite of the physical attraction and hot sex that is offered.Tristan knows from the beginning that trust is what is all important to Leah. He gradually builds up her trust in him and they begin to strengthen their relationship. Everything goes well until Tristans past comes back to haunt him and destroys the trust Leah has in him.Leah doesnt like anyone making her decisions for her and when her career and relationships are threatened she has to make difficult decisions on her own. Even her loving and concerned family cant help her.Having a past of blowing off steam and hurting the people she loves, Leah must think long and hard on what she truly wants out of life.Jeannie Moon has strong independent main female characters from all walks of life and handsome rich leading men who in spite of their wealth turn out to be decent caring people. She writes great stories with lovely supporting characters that I have loved from previous books; I know I am really looking forward to more Jeannie Moon stories. I hope to hear what Amy (Leahs sister) does with her life and who her leading man will be. Maybe a Christmas release!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W4OSN9H9UH4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VFDRLIK#wasThisHelpful","R2W4OSN9H9UH4P","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer DanieleI liked A Likely Story and found it to be an absorbing sixth installment in the well crafted Library Lovers Mystery series.Lindsey Norris is the library director in the fictional small coastal Connecticut town of Briar Creek.  Just out from the coast is a series of islands, called the Thumb Islands, and Lindsey regularly travels by water taxi, piloted by her ex-boyfriend Sully, to deliver books to the reclusive Rosen brothers.  When Stewart Rosen is not at his dock to meet her, Lindseys instinct tells her that things are not right.  The brothers are not only hermits but also hoarders and have booby trapped their property to deter visitors and thieves.  Lindsey and Sully literally risk life and limb to investigate.  To their horror, they find Peter Rosen, who is wheelchair bound, deceased in the kitchen, murdered by what looks to be a gunshot wound, and Stewart is nowhere to be found.  What on earth happened here, and is Stewart in danger or the culprit?All of the regular cast of characters appear in this installment, and there are several subplots to round out the book.  Beth, the childrens librarian, is worried about her dwindling story time audience and the competition a new childrens librarian in a neighboring town brings.  Robbie, one of Lindseys suitors, is up to something.  Sully and Lindsey are still tip toeing around each other, but you can tell they both want to rekindle their relationship (as long as Robbie does not thwart Sullys plans).  Even Ms. Cole, the cranky assistant librarian known as the lemon seems to be softening a bit.  If anything, the members of the Crafternoon group play a smaller role this time around, but they all still have definite opinions regarding Lindseys personal life.  There is also an appearance of some collectibles pickers and a plan by a wealthy resident who looks like she wants to buy as many of the Thumb Islands as she can.A Likely Story gets off to an exciting start with a flooding emergency at the library followed by a booby trapped house and an explosion that leaves Chief Emma injured.  It moves along at a brisk pace and is full of suspense, but there is a very limited number of suspects.  Because of this, I was able to pick out the perpetrator(s) pretty much from the moment they were introduced.  Usually, this would quite deter my enjoyment, but the story was entertaining enough to overlook the predictability.I enjoy the Library Lovers series because of the characters.  They are likable and realistic, diverse in personality and actions.  Beth is a favorite.  Every library should be lucky enough to have such a talented childrens librarian.  I also really like Sully.  He is a deep, complex character, and I love that he is such a steadfast personality and that he is opening up more to Lindsey.  I do wish that the love triangle would end.  It has gone on far too long and is becoming tiresome.I read for many reasons, but a main one is the prospect of being an armchair traveler.  Briar Creek is such a cozy, beautiful place.  It provides a stark contrast to my everyday land-locked Texas life, and it is a pleasure to visit a different place for a while.  Ms. McKinlay does a fine job immersing the reader in an enchanting environment while keeping the atmosphere and situations for the most part realistic.A Likely Story is an entertaining read.  I recommend it to fans of a library setting and inquisitive heroines.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12MJKW73M1JZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425260747#wasThisHelpful","R12MJKW73M1JZ2","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer KaytAn Old-Fashioned Christmas Sweet Traditions for Hearth and Home is so much more than a Christmas cookbook and memoir. It is a wonderful glimpse inside a dream Christmas that bursts with flavor, fun, family and love. You would be doing a disservice to yourself if you did not take the time to savor the heartwarming stories of author Ellen Stimsons family traditions, adventures and festivities. This book is Christmas from the classic cover, delightful photos and on to the recipes  I could smell Christmas reading it.After reading this fun-filled book, I am ready to pack up and move to Vermont myself. In flowing descriptive writing, the author paints a picture of an old fashioned Christmas with Vermont being the perfect setting. Their family Christmas traditions are entertaining and heart felt. I love the idea of their Christmas Adventure. The first week of December they take off on a trip and do fun things, together as a family. I think my favorite Christmas traditions was buying an ornament each year  one each. I so enjoyed the stories attached to the ones author Ellen Stimson shared.The recipes are great and the majority of them do not seem too complicated. The stories included with each of them enhances the urge to make them. Winter Suppers, Cabin Food, Homespun Tastes and even Treats for Four-legged Friends are just a few of the chapters. The nut roll recipe is amazing and the stories behind it make it even more enjoyable. The addition of Winter Adventures of Vermont and New England Flavors: online Retailers makes the Vermont Dream Christmas seem even more accessible.  Hey if I cannot get there, I just might be able to enjoy a taste of it at home.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. And I seriously want to move in with Ellen Stimson and her family before Christmas season hits. Their love for one another and their family traditions is easily evident in the pages, writing, recipes and photos of this fun book. This is the perfect gift book, the perfect holiday read and a wonderful escape for anyone (especially a Southerner that loves and misses snow). The author and her family fully embrace the season with love and do it with laughter and fun. As the author says, The point of this whole exercise we call Christmas is to figure out what feels fun and sweet to you and do more of that and less of anything that feels like a burden. Delight. You are going for delight. Reading this book was a true delight!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NEPIIE893F7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1Q0ECM#wasThisHelpful","R3NEPIIE893F7Z","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer jerjenElla has loved Gavin for as long as she can remember.  Seems like she loved him even when she was a child.  But she has been the little sister and Gavin did not seem to know of her feelings for him.  And the way that he has acted made Ella think that he did not feel the same way.  He has pushed her away and rebuffed her feelings for so long that Ella knows there is no future with him. But her head and her heart are not on the same page and she knows that she will never feel like this for any other man.  She will have to continue to love him from afar.Gavin is in a very dark place in his life.  He has never fully recovered from the death of his brother.  He cannot seem to let go of his feelings of anger and guilt.  And when his brothers dog, Homer, passes away, he sinks even deeper into the darkness.  He begins to drink heavily and fight with everyone and becomes a person he does not like nor recognize.  He has an epiphany of sorts when he sees Ella again; he realizes that his life does not seem so dark whenever he is with her.  He realizes he needs her in his life to pull him back into the land of the living.  He also knows that it is not fair to her but she is his lifeline.  He convinces her of this fact, and although she is afraid to trust him completely with her heart, she knows she cannot deny him anything.Ella and Gavin are both flawed and both bring baggage into the relationship.  But they are characters that you can cheer for and care about and hope that they can make a relationship work.  I felt like a little too much time was spent on letting the reader know how crazy they were for each other and their prior feelings, but that is just me. Other readers may enjoy reading about this page after page, but I felt it got a little too repetitive.  I would have liked more time spent on seeing them living in the present, going on dates and things that normal couples would do.Ella has a large family and whenever they get together there is a lot of bickering and bantering going on.  They tease each other mercilessly but they also love each other fiercely.  They have each others back and would do whatever is needed to help and protect those they love.  I love this family portrayal and hope that most families are like this in real life.  I enjoyed reading about all the family interactions.I really enjoyed the fact that Ellas father and grandfather were meddlesome and trying to control  the lives of their loved ones.  Usually it is the females in the family that do this, a mother, an aunt, or a sister.  The fact that it was two male characters is quite unusual and I loved it.  I could have read more about their shenanigans.Another thing that I enjoyed is the inspirational sayings that begin each chapter.  They are thought-provoking and apply to many areas in our life.  I thought this was a great addition to the book.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well written adult contemporary romance.  There is a lot of steaminess in this book so I do not feel it would be appropriate for a young adult.  This is the second book that I have read in this series and I enjoyed them both.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26WIMC30ZSXNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA5KF6G#wasThisHelpful","R26WIMC30ZSXNN","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer KaytThe Darkest Day, a thriller from author Tom Wood, is just that thrilling. Once again hit man extraordinaire Victor is on the job, doing what he does best  killing and leaving no trace. This time though everything is going wrong and someone even is trying to kill him. Victor reaches out to those he knows to find out who this female assassin is and who sent her. Raven is good, almost as good as he is. She works like he does too. Is she the enemy or is this some plot against them both?In the latest Tom Wood thriller, the reader is pulled into the intrigue and non-stop action of assassin Victor as he not only searches for Raven herself, but also answers as to what and who was behind her attempt to kill him. In the process, as Manhattan goes black, he uncovers treachery, evil and a homegrown terrorist plot. Someone is playing Victor for all hes worth and that just does not happen. People are not who they say they are and there is Raven. As the two lone wolf killers join forces, things go from bad to worse quickly.Victor is a character that should not be likable or heroic, but he is. Raven is an enjoyable bad ass* woman that actually compliments him and his tactics. They are almost a good team, if there is such a thing for Victor. There is as always tons of action, gunfights, shear brute strength and in this one, even more car chases. Bodies pile up quickly as the story unfolds. And after all is said and done, a wonderful twist was just a nice cherry on top of it all.The Darkest Day is a true thrill a minute, guns blazing, action packed novel. No rest for the wicked in this book. It is well written and suspenseful. A touch of politics is thrown in for good measure. Victor is precise and sleek and a loner in the Nth degree.  If you have never read one of Tom Woods Victor the Assassin books, you will want to soon. This can easily be read as a stand-alone book as all of them in this series can. Any reader that enjoys a darn (*no cursing is allowed in Victors presence) good read will enjoy The Darkest Day. Fans of tough and intelligent main characters will want to add this one to their To Be Read list immediately. Just be sure to hang on  it is one rough and exhilarating ride.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ADYCACX6B7R5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S75OKL0#wasThisHelpful","R1ADYCACX6B7R5","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Brought to you by OBS reviewer UnaI found this book was delightful. and truly historical fiction at its best. The setting and characters easily engaged the reader and I found myself hooked from page 1.  I found Delia especially interesting. Her mother had married beneath her for love, and thus had ruined the family name and their place in society. The scandal was so bad that even Delias grandmother would have nothing to do with Delia or her sisters. This resulted in Delia being shunned when presented as a debutante. As a result she grew up hating the whole social scene of the societys privileged rich..Lily on the other hand is desperate to experience this part of society so against her better judgement Delia agrees to attend a friends ball. Delia realizes that Lily should have her opportunity to find a mate. At the ball she comes into contact with Alec who is determined to ruin her with his charms so that his brother will lose interest. After all the familys reputation is at stake considering the scandal that Delias mother caused in the past.  What neither Alec or Delia expects is the chemistry between them and as they play the cat and mouse game of seduction against seductress their pasts come in-between. Alec finds he has an equal opponent who is exciting and lights something inside of him and Delia finds that the man is an irresistible foe who proves loyal and dependable.The story is humorous, and easy to read as the two find love. Alec finds out that there are more important things than society and Delia realizes love might be able to overcome all. The reader gets to experience that good and bad of English aristocracy of the time.A great afternoon read for a fall day and I hope that Anna Bradley will continue to write historical fiction. I know I will certainly look for more books from this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA991ESLXFJ0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI0B8D2#wasThisHelpful","RA991ESLXFJ0F","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer KaytIn Put A Ring On It, Beth Kendrick takes us back to Black Dog Bay, Delaware. Black Dog Bay is more than just a picturesque Delaware beach town. It is where recently divorced, dumped or cheated on people go to recover. Brighton Smith, the main character, is unaware of its popularity and its magical legend  the appearance of the mystical Black Dog when things are finally right. No for Brighton, insurance actuary, type A personality with a capital A, 10 year planner, no she only knows a dear friend Kira, has recently moved there. Kiras call and casual invitation to come for a weekend could not have happened at a better time. Brightons fiancee Colin has just broken off their engagement over zipper merging among other things. So Brighton decides to be spontaneous for once and plays hooky from work to head to Black Dog Bay for the weekend.What started as a free weekend to relax and be carefree turns into a horse of a different color when Brighton receives a call from her recently exd Colin. He has gotten married to someone he doesnt even know and even used her ring. Brighton decides to let loose and ends up on a private jet with town heartthrob Jake Sorenson. They imbibe a bit too much, but manage to make it to Vegas to get married. And so begins every womans dream, marrying an extremely hot man who is not only nice, but very wealthy.

While in town she finds herself drawn to the Naked Finger jewelers and back to a time when she was truly carefree and happy  working with jewelry and design.Black Dog Bay has all the gossip you would expect in a small town. That leads to funny and at times awkward situations. Put A Ring On It is humorous and heart wrenching, entertaining and sentimental. Beth Kendrick has built an amazing and enjoyable town in Black Dog Bay and I was happy to return in this 3rd installment. Each of the books is truly a stand-alone read, but the continuity is delightful. A wonderful romance, filled with tension, however not one bit of tasteless frivolity. It is a truly enjoyable read that is more than just a basic romance novel.

"Brought to you by OBS reviewer UnaI started this book with reservations as to whether I would even like it however within the first few pages I was hooked. It truly is witty and charming as it tells the stories of two teenagers who wont follow their mothers pre-determined path for their future. Stanley wants to develop and publish cross word puzzles and not be a senator and go to Harvard. Vera thinks she does not want to be a mathematics professor and go to Brown. Having formed a bond by winning the National Spelling Bee contest the two devise a plan where they will get married in name only and thus be able to follow their own dreams. Their love of crosswords brings them together however what both dont realize is their need and love for each other will foil their plan. Stanley is more set in his ways and wont give up on his dream however Vera eventually will go to a modified course that her mother had set out for her.  Their subsequent journeys eventually drive them apart however coded crosswords allow them to find each other in the end. Will they be able to repair the relationship?  I loved how both Stanley and Vera come to terms with their mothers after a long deception and are able to see the love their mothers ultimately had for them. The story will make you laugh especially after Vera and Stanley are married and win a TV contest on how much you know about your partner.Both Vera and Stanley are different and no matter how they try to fit in and develop relationships of their own they are ultimately drawn back to each other.I really liked the flow of the story and Bartsch develops and matures the characters in a manner that is appropriate to their nature. A delightful summer read and I look forward to more stories from Jeffrey Bartsch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q5MAY0WZJDIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQQL8K8#wasThisHelpful","R2Q5MAY0WZJDIM","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer KaytAs always with Sally Goldenbaums A Seaside Knitters Mystery series, Trimmed with Murder is full of friends, family and community unity. Also one of the interesting things about her books is each one centers on different main characters while the others still play a big part. This installment has Izzys younger brother Charlie arriving after being incommunicado for years. Along his way to Sea Harbor a mysterious woman hitches a ride, she actually gets in without being asked. Unbeknownst to Charlie, Amber Hanson is coming home after being summoned to the reading of a will. It is the holiday season so lots of activities are going on in the wonderful town as well.I love that the author lists the characters in the front. This is really helpful to me and especially helpful when there is such a large cast of characters. You do not have to be a knitter to enjoy the way these characters, Nell, Izzy, Cass, and Birdie knit together the clues of these mysteries. Along with the men in their lives, they are able to keep things from getting too tangled up. The murder in this one comes later in the book. I am not sure I enjoyed getting to know Amber, getting to care for her and then having her murdered. It seemed harder and harsher than normal. Charlies relationship with Amber also made her murder that much sadder. It was the one thing I really did not care for. And for Cass and Danny to find the body while they were making strides in their relationship was also a bit rough.Sally Goldenbaum has a wonderful and warm writing style and that did soften the blow at times in this one. Her characters are always enjoyable. The care with which she crafts them, the way they interact and get involved with their community is superb. Trimmed with Murder is an intuitive and insightful mystery. The side stories are intricate and stitched together perfectly with the murder mystery. Descriptive writing really paints a wonderful picture of the Christmas season in Sea Harbor. Izzy wants to keep her brother from being arrested for the holidays. The first annual tree trimming contest is endearing. Definitely a great cozy for the season.All of the Seaside Knitters Mystery series can be read as stand-alone books, however reading them is like coming home to visit for the holidays. The characters have become friends and as their lives have bloomed and changed, long time readers are able to enjoy the growth. I really love the characters, with Nell and Birdie being my favorites. I would recommend Trimmed with Murder to any reader of cozies, any knitters and anyone that enjoys a good story with great characters. The caring and connected characters are truly the stars in this series. That said though, the mystery is first class.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HXCRAYBL1FS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02B2Y#wasThisHelpful","R1HXCRAYBL1FS1","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer AndraJumping into a series at this late date (book #12) can be difficult as the reader does not have the back story on the main characters.  However I must commend Nancy J. Cohen on creating a story and developing these characters in such a manner that I was not at all lost.  And as such, I look forward to being able to read the first 11 books of the series in due course.Marla Vail (hairstylist) and Dalton Vail (a homicide detective) are newlyweds heading off on their honeymoon from their home in Florida.  As a favor to Daltons family, this overdue honeymoon is taking place on Daltons families dude ranch in Arizona.  One main factor is because a forest ranger has died under suspicious circumstances, and there has been a rash of supposed accidents (or are they ???) at both the ranch and ghost town that Uncle Ray is in the process of constructing. There was depth to both main characters which definitely added to my enjoyment of the story.I really enjoyed the familial interactions, especially with Annie Campbell.  I really felt connected and kept hoping that Marla and Dalton would finally figure out what was going on (and of coursethey did ).  And Uncle Ray was an interesting character.  I really liked that at the beginning of the book there was a List of Characters outlining everyone within the context of the series.  Even though Marla and Dalton were helping to solve a family mystery, they never lost sight of the fact that it was their honeymoon.  I thought this story line was portrayed tastefully, cute and left some things to the imagination of the reader.There were MANY twists and turns to this tale adding to the enjoyment of this read. One little snafu is that I was able to figure out the whodunit before it was revealedand that left me a bit flummoxed.  Luckily, the writing and story was well told so that my interest was held throughout.  I have even put other titles by this author on my TBR pile If you would like to read an enjoyable, entertaining and engaging cozy mystery (though this one did have a bit more gun play than is usual), then Peril by Ponytail is your book!*OBS would like to thank the publisher for supplying a free copy of this title in exchange for an honest review*","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TY2EL8CP6FQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ESSHV6#wasThisHelpful","R1TY2EL8CP6FQ8","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer DanieleDeath once again comes to Beakley village, and Chef Maurice is on the case.  I love Chef Maurice.Spring is in full bloom in the quaint Cotswold village of Beakley, and everyone is excited about the Spring Fayre and baking competitionexcept Chef Maurice.  He has lost his spot at the judges table to celebrity chef Miranda Matthews.  When Miranda is found dead at the fayre, it quickly becomes apparent that what skill she lacked in the kitchen she more than made up for in making enemies.  Chef Maurice and his long-suffering best friend and food critic Arthur make it their mission to unmask the killer.  Throw in some blackmail, a spurned ex-co-host, a head mistress with a secret, and the demise of domestic bliss, and you have a laugh-out-loud sweet romp.There is nothing subtle or covert about Chef Maurice.  He and Arthur blatantly insinuate themselves in the investigation.  I cant help but feel sorry for Constable Lucy, but I do wonder how far she would get on her own, especially since she is distracted by the prospect of sous chef Patrick leaving town.  It is sometimes difficult to decide if Maurice is more help or hindrance.There are plenty of suspects to consider and enough red herrings to keep me guessing, and second guessing, throughout.  I will admit that the final reveal came as a bit of a surprise, a relatively rare occurrence in my reading.  The characters are all quirky in their own ways and loveable.  I could not help but root for Lucy and Patrick as they fumble through their romance.  My only complaint is there was not enough Hamilton, the micro pig.I thoroughly enjoyed Chef Maurice and the Bunny-Boiler Bake Off  and recommend it to fans of the series and those looking for a light hearted, humorous cozy mystery.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BVLZPG8UXHCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011UNSMK0#wasThisHelpful","R2BVLZPG8UXHCW","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer JeanieWhat a fun, engaging read!  Well, except for the murders.  Hamlet is a cat with a definite tude and a nose for clues.  He has an opinion about most people who are privileged to meet him, from children who have seen him on YouTube and want their pictures taken with him to those who visit the shop for the first time.  Even though he came with Pettistones Fine Books in Brooklyn, NY when Darla inherited it from her great aunt, I dont think Darla would give him up for all the books in Brooklyn.  Good thing, since Hammy really owns Darla!  Pettistones has caffeine, books, and a catit just doesnt get any better!Darla contributed many hours to get together the vendors on this block of historic brownstones to have an outdoor 4th of July block party.  As final preparations are made for decorating, replacing a last-minute band back-out, and placing display tables and cases, Darla had one more task to complete  get the balance of the shared entry fee from the owners of Perkys Coffee Shop.  George King, the self-proclaimed King of Coffee, had protested the addition of the coffee bar at Pettistones, and was less than excited about the block party, so Darla tread softly  and George referred her to his lovely wife, Livvy.  Darla also hoped to learn more about a special coffee blend she heard some young people discussing their preference for.  What a special blend it was!  Very expensivehow could teens afford it?The block party was a success; even the summer heat and humidity didnt stop the steady flow of folks who sampled free or reduced-price wares from the shops, listened to the unique band, watched Martial Arts demos and the dance schools flash mob, even coming to meet Hamlet, the Youtube star.  Nobody was prepared for the shocking end of day, though, when Hamlet sensed the way to Livvy King, dead near the front of Perkys while her husband had napped at their booth.  Then within a matter of hours, the owner of the dance studio  a respected ballerina  was also found dead in another shop.As the fifth novel in the Black Cat Bookshop Mystery series, Plot Boiler could be enjoyed as a stand-alone or within the series  but I encourage you to enjoy the whole series!  While the author thoroughly developed the primary characters early on, with each mystery we see new facets, strengths, and talents in them.  I like best friends Darla and Jake; their diverse ages and backgrounds contribute as much to their friendship as their common interests. Hamlet, of course, knows he is the star (well, isnt he?) and without his presence, the bookshop and the series would not be the same.  This cat with a tude brings entertainment, a sense of safety and well-being, and a whimsical whisker of imagination to all who come in contact with him!The characters specific to this novel or introduced for the first time are well-suited to their defined roles.  Even Detective Fiorello Fi Reeses fiance, Connie, while certainly out-of-character for his personality, was an interesting woman.  Hopefully we havent seen the last of her!  Pinky, leader of the band that Darlas barista Robert referred for a last-minute fill-in, had unexpected talent.  The newbies also continue to educate me, this time introducing me to some current slang.  Catching up with familiar friends and meeting new ones has been an absolute blast!Plot Boiler is very well-organized and thoroughly executed; I cant imagine any loose threads at the close of the day.  The means of death was certainly a surprise for me; it was one of the plot twists that kept me on my toes!  While like Darla I disagreed with the cops line of thinking, suspects and motives just would not match up for me.  This reader was stumped, as an excellent mystery can do, until it was too late, so its a good thing Darla wasnt waiting for me to figure it out! I do, however, see that this is a four-paws and a tail UP tale and highly recommend this cozy to cat, book, and mystery lovers who appreciate well-written mysteries.  Plot Boiler has given me hours of feline fun without additional feline chores; Ali Brandon has designed an amazing bookstore where I cant wait to spend more time!

"Brought to you by OBS reviewer UnaI loved this story and I loved the way Shannon Richards is able to intertwine her other stories about the residents of Mirabelle without the stories being dependent on each other. They each stand-alone but having read the others I know I found it was like a favorite TV show .You are away for a while and then spend time catching up on what the other characters had done.Harper has been hurt in the past and is definitely not looking for a relationship when she goes to Nashville to visit her aunt on what would have been her wedding weekend. Her aunt gets tied up at the hospital and Harper finds herself enamored by Liam James an upcoming musician. After a hot a sexy weekend she finds herself not only in love but pregnant in spite of precautions taken. She returns home realizing she only has the phone number and not even the last name of the man who has stolen her heart.For Liam it is love at first sight and when Harper runs he is devastated. How will he ever find her when he doesnt know anything about her other than she has stolen his heart and left him desiring her in all ways? She has inspired him to write songs that are sure to propel his career forward but will Harper be able to accept living in the spotlight and dealing with the tabloids? She has already had to deal with the towns gossip about her breakup and now with the sudden pregnancy and a brief romance.When the two meet coincidentally at a charity event the sparks begin to fly. They realize that they were meant for each other but dont know whether Harpers trust issues will allow them to follow their hearts plus, they have the baby and their parents to contend with. Although happy about the upcoming grandchild, the parents are not thrilled with the suddenness of the romance.Love does win in the end but Shannon Richardss story telling ability has the reader craving for more. I know I am hoping for more stories set in the town of Mirabelle. A great afternoon read for these cooler fall days!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38FGAGDOOGJNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQL4UTO#wasThisHelpful","R38FGAGDOOGJNG","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer JeanieWhat an exciting new take on a classic mystery!  Lee and her Aunt Nettie take seriously the value of chocolate in every situation, including the film noir celebration opening with The Maltese Falcon.  How cool is that, chocolate in the shape of the mysterious Falcon?  The Chocolate Falcon Fraud is the 15th in this Chocoholic Mystery series, yet I could pick it up and read it as a standalone as I have not read others from this series  yet  and really enjoyed it.  Particularly fun are the some of the chocolate trivia and recipes throughout.  The beautiful Michigan setting was a grand place to bring light to some of the darker noir films.When I was in high school I had to read The Maltese Falcon.  Not my favorite then, but that could be very different, especially after reading the authors insights on various aspects of the story.  I never considered then that it was more than a mystery.  Joanna Carl has broken new ground with this mystery by using the classic story to bring additional meaning to this one.Working at and managing a chocolatier sounds like such a sweet endeavor!  It was a wonderful place for Lee to land when leaving Texas several years prior.  Aunt Netties  TenHuis Chocolade is one of the best things that has happened to Lee, second only to her husband Joe.  Lees former stepson is now an adult, a very bright, personable young man.  Nobody other than his girlfriend grasped how important the film festival was to Jeff, and the unique mystery and danger that everybody around him found themselves in was beyond what they anticipated.Lee is a fun lady, and I really enjoyed her.  Lee, Nettie, their spouses, Jeff and his girlfriend Tess are the primary people, and I felt as if I really came to know them well through the excellent characterizations.  Those men and women who were unique to this novel are as well defined as needed for their roles.  The conversations and activities brought each to life as the story progressed.The plot was a great blend of this story and the classic falcon tale.  There were interesting twists with every turn, including the murder, the disappearing woman, the mysterious third Falcon, and Jeffs temporary amnesia surrounding his accident.  Chocolate remains central to the theme, and the chocolate shop with its tasty creations and kitchens were fun to read about.  Trying to guess or logically understand who the bad guy / gal might be was almost impossible, and this reader was deliciously surprised with the resolution and the fully satisfying ending.  I highly recommend The Chocolate Falcon Fraud to chocolate lovers of all ages, and those who appreciate well-crafted mysteries that include classic and contemporary elements.  And I recommend that one also have a few chocolates nearby to help settle that craving while one reads!  Life is too short to solve the mystery without chocolate!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XWTM8AU8GBX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI025Y8#wasThisHelpful","R1XWTM8AU8GBX3","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer KaytMovie Star by Lizzie Pepper seems to be the summer beach read from all the reviews and comments. I do not go to the beach, but enjoyed this romp into celebrity gossip magazines and memoirs. Cleverly written by talented ghostwriter Hilary Liftin and in a way that kept me confused as to who was actually writing it, Lizzie or Hilary. Yes I am a fan of those rag mags that stare at us in the checkout line. And yes I am fascinated by the weird life the stars seem to live. There is an obvious blurring of the lines between Lizzie and Rob Mars and the now defunct celebrity couple TomKat. As a reader, I wanted to believe that this was really the inside story of their quick jump from couple, to parents, to wed to secretly whisked away divorce. I am still unsure if the author had some inside information and scattered it among some fiction she wrote, but I think that is one of the things that is so interesting about this book.The whole of this novel is written in actress Lizzie Peppers voice as she tells the story of her life from right before meeting actor Rob Mars through her divorce. As Lizzie changes to Robs Elizabeth and then back again, the reader gets to see the inside of how she was given everything she could have wanted only to realize it was nothing she could ever truly be happy with. We get to see inside the rumored evil One Cell that sounds not surprisingly like another congregation that we all want to know about. At first Lizzie only sees the good in all the wonderful things coming her way, the man of her dreams, her prince charming says everything a woman could want to hear and is given everything a woman could want. Their life is a fairy tale. It is only later that she realizes it was a scripted one and she was only playing a part.Lizzie is a wonderful character, whether true or based on fact or fiction. The reader knows how it will end, but the story takes us through all her thoughts and actions. I love her coming upon the scripts that Rob used to woo her and how she reacts to them. With wonderful characters including the woman Rob has set up to be her caretaker and Lizzies friends. The reader is taken along as she travels, lives in the lap of luxury and then finds a way out of the prison she finally realizes she is in.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was fun, entertaining and never let me down. I still am not sure if this was written with inside knowledge that Ms. Liftin secretly had or if this is all truly fiction. Either way it was a fabulous and well written look into the rich and famous. Lizzie is a character that the reader can root for and wishes the best for. Even at the end of the book, the reader is still led to believe that this could possibly be another ghost writing work and that only the names have been changed to protect the innocent or in this case the writer.*OBS would like to thank the publisher for supplying a free copy of this title in exchange for an honest review as part of their ongoing blog tour*","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M9Q7Q6F5KTY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670016411#wasThisHelpful","R2M9Q7Q6F5KTY6","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer UnaI enjoyed this story until the end. The end disappointed me in that when the reader is on a high and enjoying the flow of the story, it just ends with no closure for the reader. Up until the end the story was exciting and the suspense was building. I wanted more but instead went to the last page expecting an answer and all I was left with was a sense of letdown. I realize there will be another book to answer the questions but I cant see how this one can stand alone with the reader frustrated by the ending.Alessandra and Hudson find out they will be working together and the chemistry and attraction to each other makes it impossible to keep their feelings under control. Hudson wants Allie back but their secrets and mistrust always come back to foil their happiness.  The sex is hot and steamy and the story is fast moving.When Allie fails to trust Hudson enough with a secret that could entail real danger to her life; Hudson may lose her forever.At this point the story ends. I do hope that the next story will have a better ending for the reader.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EHWGTKRXON2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPNRAEI#wasThisHelpful","R1EHWGTKRXON2V","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer jerjenThis is a story that involves many facets of life.  It deals with many real-life situations and issues.  It is a story about friendship, love, loss, pain, life, commitment and second chances.  It is about having the courage to let go of the past and grabbing the future with both hands.Leo and Garrett have been best friends for a very long time.  They have each others back and would do just about anything for each other.  Leo decides that he cannot think of anyone better to take care of his wife and family should anything ever happen to him.  He is not planning on dying anytime soon but being a firefighter, he knows that it is possible he will die in the line of duty.  He gets Garrett to agree that, in the event of his death, Garrett will be there for his wife Audrey and his children and will take of them forever.  When the unthinkable happens and Leo does die, Garrett must decide if he will honor the promise he made to Leo.  And he has to find out if Audrey is willing to accept his help.I like the fact that the book is written from different perspectives.  Each chapter spotlights a different character: there are sections for Garrett, Audrey, and Audreys children.  I found this to be a very effect way to follow their lives, their feelings, their struggles and their emotions.Reading about what happened to Audrey made me stop to think about how I would feel in the same situation.  How devastated I would feel, how alone I would feel and how overwhelmed I would feel.  I think I would feel as though I would never overcome my grief and I would just want to give up on life.  But then I would look at my children and know that I had to move on and be there for them.  This is a situation that many women and men are faced with and forced to deal with on a daily basis.  I think the author did a great job relaying the devastation and determination it would take to get through this.This book explored the different types of love that exists.  There is the obvious one, the love between spouses or a significant other.  Most people have experienced this type of love and have first hand experience in these feelings.  But there is also the love between best friends, the love that Leo and Garrett experienced.  They had best friends forever and would do anything for each other.  Some people may have not experienced this type of love but it does exist.  And the third type of love demonstrated in this book is the love between parent and adult.  In some ways, I think this is the strongest love there is.The writing style flows smoothly and the book is a quick read.  There are a lot of heartfelt emotions contained within the pages and the reader is taken on an emotional roller-coaster ride.  It also challenged me to think about what my feelings would be and how I would handle things if I found myself in Audreys shoes.  I really enjoyed the fact that this happened.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well written womens contemporary.  If you like to read books that make you stop and think about how you would react, this is a book that you should read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R104YB85N3MZCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NERQRPS#wasThisHelpful","R104YB85N3MZCW","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer KaytStones in the Road tells the story of an 11 year old Amish boy, Joshua that lives in fear of his church deacon father Abraham. One night in what has become more normal than not, Abraham takes Joshua out to the shed and begins to lose it. A fire is started and both are severely hurt. Joshua however is able to make a run for it and never looks back. Barefoot and scared, Joshua heads west. Meanwhile, his mother Miriam is left with not only the fear of what has become of her son, but also a broken and damaged husband. Author E. B. Moore does a wonderful job of telling this story from both mother and sons perspective. It is set in 1867 and the times are harsh for everyone, but even more so for this poor son and even his mother and the family he had to leave behind.Joshua is barefoot and burned but is able to make it away from the Amish farm and stumbles along as best he can. He is helped by slaves who try to treat some of his injuries and assist this unconscious boy even when they themselves are in peril. After resting for a bit, Joshua is also helped by a wonderful character in Mother Biddle. He has several different stops along the way to growing up until he ends up out west. The travels and adventures he has are perilous and interesting. The writer switches between boy and mother as their lives go on and at times have some of the same issues to face.Miriam never wants to give up hope that her boy is alive out there somewhere. She takes drastic measures hiding the fact that she still hunts for him. She befriends a lady that is not Amish. Her damaged husband struggles to live, as she has to nurse him constantly. She wants to know what happened that night, but he is unable to tell her about it. Miriam gives birth to another son, this time named Isaac (Abraham often called Joshua that). She has to finally let go of the hope she had for her oldest son. Both of them, mother and son face temptation, anger, and fear.So much more is going on in Stones in the Road than the tale of these well-developed characters. The reader gets a real view of the travails of Joshua as he works his way from Pennsylvania Amish country, through Colorado and beyond. I have to say there were a few parts of this book that I had a hard time reading and did not see the purpose of them. Otherwise, it is a very intricately detailed tale spanning many years. Joshuas return is impactful and the tale does come full circle. I think anyone that enjoys reading historical fiction would probably find this book informative and accurate. I would suggest those who do not like graphic writing dealing with animals and others may want to be careful with reading it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDR9W9WO2MIDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI028KO#wasThisHelpful","RDR9W9WO2MIDW","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer AndraA Dead Daughter is the third book of the Jessica Huntington series by Anna Celeste Burke.  Yet again, Anna Celeste Burke has written an engaging, jam packed cozy mystery.  I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire readjust the way I like it!The continuing evolution of the relationship between Jessica and Frank was exciting.  I could really feel the intensity begin to growit will be interesting to see where this relationship ends up.  I did not sense the progression as much with Jessicas relationship with Paul.  Frank is smitten, but as any single parent knows, he must tread carefully as it is not only his life he will affect with any new relationship:At least for a few more years I have kids at home, so its not just me I have to think about before getting involved with a woman.  Especially as one as stubborn, uppity, and exasperating as our friend here, no matter how lovely and beguiling she can be. Jessica felt herself go all mushy inside.  They did have a lot of things to sort out, but, damn, the man knew how to make it seem worthwhile.The members of the cat pack: Tommy, Jerry, Brien, Bernadette  continue to evolve and we see sides of their personalities which really show us their depth, compassion and all around love for Jessica.  Additionally, the chuckles that came about because of some of the dialogue out of Briens mouth is just priceless; he just cracks me up!!!One characteristic of a book I value highly is its incorporation of humour (if appropriate of course). Well.A Dead Daughter does indeed have humour (FYI.humor and humour are different spellings of the same word. Humor is preferred in American English, and humour is preferred in all the other main varieties of English. Given that I am CanadianI shall be sticking with humour).Now for an example of humour:I dont get it, you guys.  Miss Marple investigated dozens of heinous crimes, and about the worst thing that ever happened was that she dropped a few stitches in her knitting.  Hercule Poirot, the punctilious little detective, almost never had more to complain about than sore feet or getting his spats dirty.  Me, Ive been punched in the face, thrown to the ground in a parking lot, accosted by gangbangers on the side of the road, kidnapped, drugged and shot at!  Now, to top it all off, I get shoved off a mountain.  What am I doing wrong?And then there is the delicious mix of humour and sexual innuendo:Ooh, here we go again, Tommy said, shifting his weight on the foot of her bed..You realize a lot of this is just sexual tension, right?  Frank laughed, but Jessica and Jerry both shot Tommy a dirty look.  Tommy didnt care as he took full advantage of the special place he held in Jessicas heart.  He took delight in taunting her, like a mischievous younger brother, especially about Frank.  What? I cant help it if you heterosexual types require so much foreplay before you  Tommy, knock it off, Jerry interrupted, shaking his head.  That made Frank laugh louder.  His laughter made Jessica angrier.  Lack of foreplay has nothing to do with it, Jessica blurted.  Wait, thats not what I meantNow on to the mystery; well-conceived, intricate and with enough twists and turns that my interest was held until the final word was read.  Jessica does not disappoint as a self-acclaimed amateur sleuth (albeit an injured sleuth) and carries own with her brand of sleuthing with the help of the Cat Pack friends as she recovers from being thrown off the mountain. The mystery included a laundry list of characters in such a manner that at times I needed to re-read a section to make sure I was getting everyones relationship straight.I also really LOVED the character development and sub-plot of Alexis.  What mothers keep from their kids!!!  Glad Jessica now knows what her mother is going through and that the entire family unit (dysfunctional as it may be) can contribute.  This also helps explain some of Jessicas feelings towards her mother and will aid in her acceptance of Alexis for who she is and not Jessicas ideas of what a mother should be.As I have said before..very well done Ms. Burke!!  I will patiently await the next book in this delightful and engaging series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DEMYPFDNNVTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UUTH2LG#wasThisHelpful","R2DEMYPFDNNVTC","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer KaytOh my, what a great read. Florist Grump is the 17th in Kate Collins A Flower Shop Mystery series and is without a doubt the best yet. That is saying a lot as not only is Kate Collins a NY Times bestselling author, but the first in the series, Mums the Word, is being made into a movie. Now, what makes Florist Grump so wonderful, EVERYTHING. From the very first pages, this book grabs you and keeps pulling you in deeper and deeper. The fabulous nuances that this stellar author throws in this installment are just dazzling. Florist Grump is a bouquet of vibrancy with intellectual fillers stuck in all the right places and displayed with elegance.Main character, Abby Knight Salvare, is not only a great lead, but she is human too. Abby is a florist grump in this one. It was great to see her be so normal and have a hard time dealing with everything she had on her plate. Great because honestly some lead characters in cozies seem almost superhuman with all they do and get done (and make me feel horrible too). Abby is just plain grumpy. Who wouldnt be if they had to live with their parents, in her old bedroom (left exactly as it was) with her sexy new husband, Marco? And Abby fells like an insolent teen at her parents house. If that was not enough, Abbys business, Bloomers, is so busy she needs more help. Why does part-time helper Rosa have to make everything seem so easy? Abby hated the thought of asking her to work more  more time to make her feel inadequate.There is so much more going on in this cozy than just a murder mystery. I will not spoil things, but Abbys mother has taken up writing instead of her usual hideous artwork. This side story is absolutely one of my favorite parts of the book. But there is even more than that. Although the times when Seedy, their 3 legged rescue dog, is in danger was almost more than I could bear. Back to the murder, because yes there was one. A body is found and the police suspect is New Chapels beloved window washer Jingles. Jingles is much more than just a kindly old man though. Shop owners come together and put private investigators Team Salvare (Marco and Abby) on the case.Florist Grump is genius, pure genius. The characters are wonderful and diverse. The mystery is enthralling. The action is intense. Even if you have never read any of the other books in this series, you will not be lost. Author Kate Collins does a wonderful job of getting the reader caught up without ever boring you. So many side topics are touched on here, but in a manner that flows. Family, parents, estrangements, love, relationships of all kinds  friends, family, marriage, and oh so much more. I just cannot say enough about the writing of author Kate Collins. This has become one of my favorite reads ever. I hope others will enjoy it as much as well. I am sure they will.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUSEIO8Z7I9CU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S75OKBA#wasThisHelpful","RUSEIO8Z7I9CU","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer DanieleRest Ye Murdered Gentlemen is a delightful start to the new Year-Round Christmas Mystery series.  It is full of holiday cheer and atmosphere despite a couple of town folk Grinches, and I cannot wait to visit Christmas Town again.Rudolph, New York, aka Christmas Town, has created a tourist niche for itself by celebrating the holiday year round.  This is Merry Wilkinsons first holiday season as a shop owner and is thus eligible to participate in the semiannual parade.  However, things do not go as planned when her float does not take off.  She finds it a bit disturbing when she learns that the tractor designated to pull her float was sabotaged.  But, she has other things to think of during this busiest time of year, including a visiting journalist in town to write a magazine feature.  Merry is shocked when, while out for their nightly walk in the park, her puppy Matterhorn (Mattie) leads her to the journalist Nigel Pearces body.  Initially, the police are very interested in Merrys best friend and bakery owner Vicky since it looks like a drug laced gingerbread cookie led to Nigels demise.  When other strange acts of sabotage occur, Merry decides it cannot all be coincidence.  She does her best to find out who is trying to ruin the towns reputation and the spirit of Christmas before the damage done is permanent.I admit it.  I am a fan of holiday themed cozy mysteries, especially those set during the fall and holiday seasons.  With a setting that could have been a cloyingly sweet clich, Vicki Delany does a masterful job of creating an inviting fictional small town that is all about Christmas.  I appreciate that even though all is picturesque, Delany does not shy away from the real worries that come with the tourist trade.  Rudolph sounds like the perfect weekend destination, and I can just imagine all of the festive lights and decorations and beautiful music and sundries to tempt visitors.  I wish I could purchase one of Alans, the local toymaker/woodworker, toy trains for a special child in my life.  Even with murder and sabotage hanging over the town, it seems magical.Merry makes for an interesting protagonist.  She is likeable, with both hometown and big city smarts.  Her parents are a hoot.  With a name like Noel and a December 25th birthday, how could anyone but Merrys father be the official town Santa? Her mother Aline is a retired opera diva who keeps the music alive throughout town.  Vicky is unique (i.e. purple hair and tattoos) and adds some dimension to a character who could have been simply a caricature.  My mouth waters as I think about all of the delicious goodies that come out of her bakery.  Alan and Russ, Merrys potential suitors, pleasantly contrast one another, but I do hope that Delany does not turn it into a full blown love triangle with them (At present, I am on team Alan).  Finally, Mattie the Saint Bernard puppy may be my favorite character of all. He is too precious.  Even though this is the first introduction of the characters, I already feel like I know them pretty well.The mystery is paced well with plenty of twists to make me second guess the perpetrators identity until almost the very end.  To me, this is a sign of a well written tale.I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Christmas Town and look forward to many more trips to this enchanting town with all of its charming residents.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32JMX60SWBLRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI0B5R6#wasThisHelpful","R32JMX60SWBLRM","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer UnaHaving read the Anne of Green Gables books when I was younger I truly wondered how the story could be brought into a modern day setting but Andi Teran has done just that. The similarities are there if you had read the Anne books but the book stands alone if you havent read them.Ana is a troubled teen with a violent past. Having not adjusted to foster care the farm trainee program is her last chance. The program is run by the Garbers, a brother sister duo. Emmett Garber looks in disdain as he picks up Ana. What good is a girl for farm work?  He had wanted a boy for the program. Abbie his sister on the other hand is delighted Ana is a girl and forms a bond.With hard work and caring people Ana realizes that the farm is what she needs. She finds a friend in Rye, in neighboring Hadley and the two become inseparable. Like the story of Anne there is a modern version of the drinking cordial episode that threatens their friendship. Ana also begins a relationship with Cole another troubled teen. This relationship too is doomed. Ana is now frightened she will lose the only hope of happiness she has ever had.Andi Teran keeps the story close to the story of Anne of Green Gables but brings it into the present so that it is an exciting modern story with good flow. This is a great summer read and I look forward to more books by Andi Teran.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YEPJOYTX5006/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4D2S#wasThisHelpful","R1YEPJOYTX5006","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review brought to you by OBS staff member AndraWOW!!! Ms. Lavelle has continued on in fine fashion.  As a reader, I hope that each book of a series grabs me on its own.  And I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt.Dangerous Intentions certainly grabbed me and did not let go until the final word was read.  I suggest that if you have not read book 1 of the series, Veiled Obsession, that you do so before reading this second book in the series.  I know I went and re-read it, just to make sure I remembered the characters to their fullest.The story of Hayley and Jude continue with Hayley having finally escaped the marital home and Jude.  She is safe.or so says Dustin (Hayleys wealthy, ex  high school beau) who assisted in the escape and is now putting Hayley up in his ranch.  The hard work is now upon Hayleyhow to proceed with her life to fully extricate herself from her abusive marriage.  She has endured unimaginable atrocities (you will have to read book one and two yourself.I am not spoiling anything ).  Frankly, everything Hayley has had to put up with at the hands of Jude had me shiveringThe twists and turns were both unexpected and yet expected.  Unexpected in that I was taken aback by what was happening, but expected in that Jude is a truly evil guy!  The development of each character added depth, which surprised me, given the length of the book.  ActuallyI take that back.it did not surprise me because Ms. Lavelle is a truly gifted writer!!!!A few characters were introducedone being Nolan.  He had an integral part in this story. I am anticipating that his role is still to be developed further in book 3though that is just my conjecture given that I did not sense closure with respect to this character.  Is Nolan truly as depraved as Jude?  What is his relationship with Jude? Good questions and at least one is answered in the book.  Another character  Grace  was also introduced.  I found her relatable and would be fascinated to learn more about her as I felt her true depth was not 100% explored in this book.but I shall see :)The pace of the story kept me engaged throughout and in fact; I read it all in one sitting, without looking up or stopping for anything or anyone!  And when I finished, I just sat there thinking WOW.I cant help but wonder. how will the third book in this series play out?  Where will Ms. Lavelle take this story?  Who is featured?  I shall wait (and probably NOT patiently) for the next book in the His Agenda series  Broken Illusions.Dori Lavelle  thank you for penning a truly gripping, dark story.  Not generally a genre I would read  but very glad I am.  Your talent seems to know no bounds.  I cant wait to read the conclusion to this series.*OBS would like to thank the author for supplying a free copy of this title in exchange for an honest review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R1ZBC4X170MB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XGY8LGC#wasThisHelpful","R2R1ZBC4X170MB","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer jerjenUndercover DEA agent, Tucker Pankov, is not having a good week.  First his boss is killed and Tucker does not know who is responsible for the death.  Then an assassin shows up at his house and tries to kill him.  When he finds out that other members of his team were also targeted for death, Tucker knows there is a big problem and he is being targeted by someone very powerful.  But he has no idea why.  Things continue to go downhill when he and the members of his team find out that they have lost their top-secret security clearance.  And then they find themselves on television, appearing to be placing bombs and blowing up very public places.  Not knowing who is behind these actions and not knowing who they can trust, they have to proceed with caution working outside the box to find a solution.  When they kidnap Karen Stafford, an NSA analyst, they feel that she is their only hope of solving this mystery and discovering who is behind the attacks.  This is one of the times they had to work outside normal operating procedures.The characters are well rounded, well developed and three dimensional.  You cannot help but like Tucker and root for him.  Although he is a highly trained undercover agent and more than capable of disarming someone in a blink of an eye, he also has a tender side.  He lives by his own code of ethics and there are some lines he will not cross.  Kidnapping Karen almost crosses that line and he is not happy that he had to resort to that action.  He does everything in his power to make her feel safe and let her know they mean her no harm.  And after he gets to know her better, he knows he will do everything in his power to keep her alive.  Karen is one tough woman and she is not easily intimidated.  But when she is kidnapped and meets Tucker, she is scared to death but refuses to let Tucker and the others know.  As she gets to know him better, she sees that the only thing she has to fear from him is losing her heart to him.This is an action packed adventure thriller that pulls the reader along at breakneck speed and never lets the reader catch their breath.  Every page is full of action, tension and suspense.  Starting from the first page, there is enough going on to keep the reader wanting to turn the pages to see what will happen next.  I enjoyed the fact that the reader knew who the bad guys are, even though Tucker and his team had no idea.  To me this added more suspense and tension and I really like that.The writing style flows smoothly and the book is an easy read.  The author is very talented in her descriptive writing and I felt like I was right there watching all the action (bullets flying, explosions) happening around me.  The romance between Tucker and Elizabeth was also explosive and the action and suspense were woven together perfectly.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a romantic suspense with lots of action.  This book can be read as a stand alone but why would you not want to read all of the books in the series?","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36QVX06IE6V7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451475453#wasThisHelpful","R36QVX06IE6V7K","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer KaytThe Shell Seekers is a wonderful novel dealing with love, loss, family, pursuit of happiness and memories. Penelope is a wonderful character and the author, Rosamunde Pilcher, takesthe reader through her life of struggle and love. Backstories are given in gentle glimpses of the past. Penelope has faced a health scare that has her children pushing for change and herself looking to enjoy the rest of her life. After putting her mostly ungrateful adult children first, it is time she does something for herself, besides buying her perfect English cottage and develop her magnificent gardens.Penelopes children are annoying, absurd and beyond sniveling. Her oldest Nancy is selfish and smarmy to the point I really wanted to smack her silly. Youngest Noel is a lazy, greedy, no count bum. The only child I half way liked was her middle child Olivia. While she was a bit self-centered, she was not demanding and never tried to tell her mother how to live her life. She is also in part responsible for bringing Antonia into her mothers life. And that is a blessing. Penelopes oldest daughter and her son realize that their grandfathers paintings are now worth a lot of money and what it now. But Penelope is on to them even if they do not realize it.So much goes on in this expansive novel that you really cannot describe everything. So many different emotions and situations are included that it is like the reader is stepping into the lives of the characters and going on a long and entertaining ride. Touching on World War II, artisans, family turmoil, emotions and actions that have developed the characters into who they have become. The Shell Seekers encompasses such a long period of time, yet is never dull or lacking in sentiment. I take it that this has been a very popular novel since it was realized, but I had never heard of it. I can understand the fans it accumulated over the years.The Shell Seekers is filled with heartache and pain and it takes the reader on a roller coaster ride with the characters and their lives. Wonderful writing and characters makes this a delightful read. The switch from past to present and back again is done tastefully and in a very smooth style that doesnt leave the reader scratching their heads. It is strange in the fact that most of the characters are not very pleasant in the present. Only Penelope is always a great character that keeps you rooting for her in any situation. She is the grandmother, mother we all love. Although her over indulgence of her children can be a tad infuriating. This is a wonderful and entertaining read for sure. Sit back and enjoy your time with this great novel and imagine your time with Penelope.*OBS would like to thank the publisher for supplying a free copy of this title in exchange for an honest review as part of their ongoing blog tour*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IR64LLKQD8JO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BIV49FC#wasThisHelpful","R2IR64LLKQD8JO","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer HeidiTristan is still unsure of where he fits in life.  He doesnt know why he was made into a Dragon King, or why he looks just like the deceased Warrior, Duncan Kerr.  Hes feeling the pressure to get to know Duncans twin from all sides, but he doesnt know if he really wants to.  He doesnt remember anything after allSammi doesnt allow herself to love, not after her mother passed away and obliterated her heart in the process.  She cant afford to ever feel that horrible again.  She takes pride in running the pub her mother and she purchased.  That is until her ex made friend thats been helping with her business gets in over his head with the mob and they blow the pub to smithereens!Now Sammi is on the run for her life and goes to the only place that she can feel safe, for even a day, To Dreagan where her sister, Jane, and her husband live.  The place where Sammi meets Tristan and is forever changedIts been quite a while since Ive read a Donna Grant book and I was excited to delve into this one.  It had a decent enough storyline, although it was missing the majority of the steamy sex scenes I expect from Grant.  There was only one in this book, which was a bit of a disappointment.Tristan has been struggling with his own identity and how exactly he fits in with the Dragon Kings and Warriors.  But after touching Sammi he can no longer deny his connection with his twin, Ian.  The memories start coming back and he knows that he is Duncan.  Hes just not sure if he wants to face that reality or what to do with it.The storyline is building to a war with the Dark Fae and I did enjoy seeing some of the Warriors I met in Grants other tales.  Im curious to see what roles they will play in this future war, as its clear the Kings will need to call upon every resource they have if they are going to have a chance to survive it!Overall this was an okay read  I wanted to like it more, but it just didnt grip me like some of Grants other books have.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EEYE4DZYK3RP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250041376#wasThisHelpful","R2EEYE4DZYK3RP","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer DanieleNo Comfort for the Lost is a finely crafted historical mystery set in the unsettled years following the Civil War in San Francisco.  Full of period details and true events and locations, it will appeal to readers who enjoy a step back in the past and those interested in a smart mystery.San Francisco in 1867 could be a hard place, especially for the Chinese immigrants seeking a better life for themselves.  There is great unrest brewing, especially among the Irish, against the Chinese and those who associate with them.  Celia, an English war nurse, has made a life for herself following the presumed loss of her husband healing the downtrodden and forgotten of her adopted city.  When the body of a pregnant Chinese girl is found floating at the docks, Celia is afraid it is her friend Li Sha.  Unfortunately, she is correct.  Detective Nicholas Greaves has been assigned the case, however it is made clear by his superiors that he should not waste valuable time and effort on such a lowly victim.  Compelled to find justice for Li Sha, Celia and Nick place themselves in increasingly dangerous situations in hopes of identifying the killer.There are plenty of suspects, each with his or her viable motive.  Every time I thought I had it figured out, I would then read something that would change my mind.  I was surprised when the killer was revealed, and, to me, that is the sign of a well crafted whodunit.  Celia is no shrinking violet, and her strength, independence, and compassion come shining through.  Nick is also quite well developed, and I liked his genuineness and sense of right and wrong.  The supporting characters, including the other policemen, high society, and shady characters provided realism and depth to the unfolding story.  I particularly like urchin Owens willingness to sacrifice himself to gain Celias approval.  I did not care much for Barbara; maybe it was simply her immaturity and insecurity showing.  I hope she matures in further installments.  Housekeeper Addie provided more than one chuckle.Celia and Nick are attracted to each other, but this is far from a romance.  It adds pleasant tension to their relationship, and I look forward to seeing where things lead, although I am sure whatever progresses will be fraught with challenges since we do not know definitively that Celias husband is deceased.The plight of the Chinese immigrants and women in general was a fascinating backdrop to the story.  I could not help but find parallels to modern struggles.  If only society would learn from its mistakes.  Ms. Herrimans skillful depiction of San Francisco, from its glittering theaters and morning rooms to the fog covered docks and slums, made me feel like I was there in the midst of the action.I greatly enjoyed No Comfort for the Lost.  It might possibly go on the short list of my best books of the year.  I highly recommend it to those who enjoy strong heroines and lushly detailed history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E3VMV5MOOPUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4GTI#wasThisHelpful","R1E3VMV5MOOPUR","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Brought to you by OBS reviewer UnaI loved this story as it tells the journey of Henrietta a brutally abused wife of Charles who for the sake of their son Henry finds herself and her husband a place in the court of George and Caroline the Prince and Princess of Wales, to remove them from a life of abject poverty that Charles has subjected them to.  Henrietta becomes Carolines confidant as they share much in common. Their boys are about the same age and both women have very little say in their futures.When Caroline suggests that Henrietta become the mistress of George, as she feels she would rather know who he was courting with, Henrietta has no option but to obey. Henrietta, to please George must dye her hair blonde using horse urine to lighten it ,as George has a preference for blondes.  Henrietta knows the affair will bring the worst out in Charles and after a brutal beating, in vengeance he takes Henry away from her and eventually turns Henry against her. It breaks Henriettas heart when Henry ,when he is older, says to her that she has brought shame against the family name and likely warranted the abuse Charles subjected her to. Henry states, to Henriettas dismay, that he wants nothing more to do with her. Caroline can also relate to this as her oldest son was taken away from her at 7 as they left Germany to remain as the future ruler of Hannover and also becomes distant to her as he gets older.Caroline, as she sees her husband become more emotionally connected to Henrietta, turns against her also, bringing out a mean streak and forcing Henrietta to make a life changing decision. Henrietta knows that she will not be the Kings mistress forever as George is already searching for someone younger. When he repays her for her services, and luck has it that Charles eventually inherits a title, Henrietta has the ammunition to set up a life for herself. With the help of her brother whom Charles had forbidden her to see, she is able to, with great difficulty, break her bond with Charles and begin to build a life of her own.  Only when Charles dies is she able to live freely, and make her own decisions.I am always amazed at how little control these women had of their own futures. They were the property of their husbands and had no rights. Divorce was not an option and abuse was not a ground for leaving. They literally were breeders of future generations and even wealth and breeding had no say in their outcomes.This is a delightful fast moving story that will keep the reader turning pages.  I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, the flow of the story, and the setting and I definitely look forward to more books from Laura Purcell.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDK6SZB4CU7HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012AN0F54#wasThisHelpful","RDK6SZB4CU7HB","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer DanieleFans of the Pink Carnation series will not be disappointed in this final installment of the long running series. The Pink Carnation Janes story brings everything to a satisfying conclusion in true Lauren Willig style.In the early nineteenth century, Napoleons quest to conquer all is progressing when French troops take control of Lisbon, Portugal. The royal family has fled the city for safety in Brazil, all except the mad matriarch Queen Mary who is believed to have been taken North by those planning a resistance. The Pink Carnation is expedited to Portugal to recover the queen but, not knowing Portuguese or the land, reluctantly admits that she needs the assistance of fellow British spy Jack Reid, otherwise known as the Moonflower. Things are off to a rough start as the pair butt heads and have different opinions as how to proceed. They follow the leads to find the matriarch before she can be whisked off by competing parties. There are, of course, some setbacks, including near discovery by The Guardian, rough weather and terrain, and bad intel. Jane hides that she knows Jacks family even though they have implored her to ask him to come home. As their romantic tension builds, so does the danger.In modern England, Eloise, a (former) doctoral student who discovered the Pink Carnations true identity during her research, is finally seeing her plans to marry Colin come to fruition. All of the estate is abuzz with last minute wedding preparations, when Colins aunt is kidnapped, and the pair must make an exchange to ensure her safe return. Unfortunately, Eloise and Colin do not know what the box is that the kidnapper wants. The reference to Scooby Doo during the confrontation scene with the kidnapper had me laughing out loud. I was worried for a few pages that the wedding would not happen after all.The Lure of the Moonflower was an engaging read. Jane finally gets her turn at true love, and even though she is strong without a love interest, I believe that Jack is indeed a worthy match. They each carry their own hurts and baggage of life, and I can completely understand their initial resistance to trust each other. Jane is a woman after all and Jack does have a tendency to change sides when it suits him. Their back and forth banter provided pages of entertainment, and their building attraction was palpable. I love that the donkey was their chaperone. There were plenty of tense and dangerous moments, complete with disguises, to keep me on the edge of my seat until the end. Most all of the characters that have been part of the previous books make appearances here, though some are only mentioned in passing, and I thought this added to the familial sense of finality for the story. The Guardians appearance added a layer of intrigue, and I am pleased that he got what was coming to him.As always, the mingling of the past and present is seamless, and they are well tied together. All of the modern respective family members make their appearances, too, and I am so glad to see Eloise and Colin get their happy ending. I could see a spin-off series happeningwishful thinking on my part, perhaps?The Lure of the Moonflower is a gratifying finale to this wonderful series, and I will miss the characters. At least there is always the option to reread the books. I recommend this to fans of the Pink Carnation series and those who enjoy Regency espionage and romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGYDQQ2C653DW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4F58#wasThisHelpful","RGYDQQ2C653DW","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer JeanieJust Killing Time is a remarkable, suspenseful debut novel by Julianne Holmes, who has published short stories under the name J. A. Hennrikus. This reader found a mystery in the first chapter  how this author, who writes such a vivid description of a New England autumn day that I could almost see the thrill of changing leaves and smell the crisp air, had not had a novel published earlier! Maybe it is the clock shop that reminded me of a Black Forest clock shop back home, or the adorable shop cat, Bezus. Or the wonderful, down-to-earth men and women of Orchard, Massachusetts. This charming combination renders a well-written mystery that captivated me from the first moment of meeting Ruth Clagan, the caffeine-deprived young woman learning of her grandfathers demise just when she was on her way to see him after a long estrangement.Clockmaking was in the Clagan blood. The Cog and Sprocket was opened by the first Clagan who had immigrated to the US, Ruths great-great grandfather. He passed the shop to her grandfather, and now it would be Ruths. No matter that she hadnt seen her beloved G.T. for a few years, or that he had remarried less than a year of her grandmothers sudden death. She had learned the skill and art of clock making and repairing at a young age at G.T.s side, where she spent most of her summers and several school years while her parents pursued their careers in academia. She continued to pursue this career through a specialty college abroad, and now mostly designed and built specialty artistic clocks.It seemed that everyone in town loved G.T;; everyone had kind words for her and her step grandmother. Then the break-ins at the shop began, and it seemed that time was ticking down for the future of the shopperhaps her very lifeespecially when Pat, her grandfathers one employee was a person of interest in her grandfathers death.The relationships of most of the folks in this town were enmeshed together as the gears in a well-oiled clock. I enjoyed getting to know some of the unique characters, including Ruths step-grandmother Caroline, Moira, her best friend from childhood, and Ben, the interesting young man who ran the hair salon and seemed to know everyone in town. Ruth, Ben and Caroline are my favorites for their spunk, hard work, and kindness for others. Caroline and Ruth have become better friends than either of them imagined, and it is easy to see what a terrific help the chief of police, Jeff Paisley will be. The integrity and helping nature inherent in those in small towns is refreshing. Yet there are some people in this small town who wanted to keep her grandfathers ideas out of the mix, those who could care less about the small town atmosphere.Just Killing Time has a plot that is excellent both in depth and suspenseful action, and is flawlessly executed. It is driven by action, including plot twists to surprise even the most seasoned cozy mystery lover as Ruth diligently seeks clues that might be in the shop or the upstairs living quarters. Suspense only grows throughout the novel. This reader was as stumped as Ruth until the final clues were revealed. The author gives us a magnificent setting in a New England autumn and a historic shop that links past and present together with its collection of timepieces. I highly recommend Just Killing Time; it is a triumphant first-in-series for mystery lovers of all ages. Julianne Holmes is an author that we will see many more riveting reads from; there are endless possibilities for mystery and mayhem in a shop housing so many elegant and historic timepieces!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OV77RN00YB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425275523#wasThisHelpful","R1OV77RN00YB3","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer KaytI love this series  Amish Quilt Shop Mysteries. I love this author Isabella Alan/Amanda Flower. I love this book Murder, Plainly Read. Ok now that I have that out of the way, let me just say this is everything a cozy should be. It has a wonderful, cozy setting  Holmes County, Ohio in rural Amish country. It has a fabulous and amazing cast of characters ranging from the Englisch in Angie (main character), her boyfriend sheriff Mitchell and Angies parents, as well as the wonderful Amish characters in Anna (one of my favorites with her sassy Amish personality) and all the ladies in their quilting circle and townsfolk. It has an intriguing and suspenseful, yet cozy mystery. Then of course you add in French Bulldog Oliver, kitty Dodger (both Angies pets) and ever entertaining Petunia the goat and you have a patchwork quilt of amazing cozy in one book!!Angie has her hands full with running her quilt shop, her love life, her parents and now she is supposed to help organize the Rolling Brook librarys annual book sale. Luckily her mother has grabbed hold of the idea and wants to run with it herself. Before that happens though, Angie and friends see librarian Austina Shaker get a set down by Old Order Amish bishop Bartholomew Belier. He does not go quietly. And when Angie and her mom go to meet Austina to get things settled with moving the booksale to the pie factory (a way to help everyone concerned), they find grumpy old Bartholomew dead in the book mobile. Now it seems brash Austina is the prime suspect. Angie has her hands tied when she does not want to anger her new boyfriend Mitchell by getting involved, but cannot let an innocent woman be railroaded if she really did not murder this gruff and argumentative man.You do not have to be a quilter to enjoy this series. I can barely thread a needle. The characters are so well developed and I love them, even the not so nice ones. The way these two communities come together to help each other, to find answers and just be friends is so delightful and refreshing. You really do not have to read the others in this series to thoroughly enjoy Murder, Plainly Read, but do yourself a favor and read the others at some point. They too are great. If you enjoy cozy mysteries this is about as good as they get. If you enjoy reading about the Amish, you will adore this one and the series. I hope you get some of the same enjoyment I do when you read this book. In the way things are in the world these days, it is such a relief to grab a book this refreshing, delve deep into the setting, people and their lives and just forget the nastiness out there. Now the only bad thing is we have to wait for the next one to be released.*OBS would like to thank the publisher for supplying a free copy of this title in exchange for an honest review as part of their ongoing blog tour*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BHVH7CW9E4BI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S75RYYU#wasThisHelpful","R3BHVH7CW9E4BI","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer JerjenTwo men take an oath to uphold the law, to serve and protect and to do everything in their power to keep others safe. One would think that they both take their oath seriously and will do the best they can to uphold that oath. But you would be wrong in thinking that.One does his best to uphold the law and take criminals off the street. He tries to do what he can to solve murders and bring justice to the victims and their families. Sometimes his dedication is so consuming that everything else is his life takes second place (family, friends, relationships). Sometimes havoc is wreaked in his life because of this dedication. But he still upholds the laws and takes his oath quite serious.The other man uses his badge and his power for evil purposes. He uses the trust that his position holds to get close to women and perpetuate unthinkable acts of violence. He is on a mission to rid the world of vain pretentious women and will use whatever means necessary to carry out this mission. The two men are polar opposite of each other but they do have one thing in common: a badge.I really enjoyed the concept of this book. Two people whose lives could be very similar but both take different paths that shape their lives forever. They really could not be more dissimilar I also enjoyed how tense and suspenseful the book was. At times I could not turn the pages fast enough and at other times I did not want to turn it because I was afraid of what might happen. The book is such a good example of the good versus evil concept with a modern twist. The author is very talented using the written word to convey terror, suspense and fearfulness.The characters are well developed and well rounded. The good guy is flawed but he always tries to do whatever he thinks is right, even if it was a bit outside the law. He doubts his ability and worries that he will not be able to catch the criminal. The bad guy is as bad as they get, evil through and through. He has total confidence and is not worried about getting caught because no one is as smart as him. The contrast between the two is written very well and I thought it was carried on well throughout the entire book. The book is divided into different years and what happens during each of those time frames and I liked the fact that the book is divided like that.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well plotted mystery suspense. The book is well written with enough suspense and tension to satisfy the most avid mystery lover. Grab a copy of this book but you may want to read it with the lights on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBOKM29643FH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TG0KQ0O#wasThisHelpful","RBOKM29643FH9","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer DanieleJanet MacPhail is amply busy with her animal photography business and the agility work she does with her Australian Shepherd Jay. In addition to the every day activities, she is dealing with her boyfriend Toms looming cohabitation, her mothers upcoming nuptials, a cranky new neighbor hell bent on passing a city ordinance that would limit the number of pets allowed per home, and a radical group who thinks all pets should be freed from slavery. She attends a sheep herding competition where Jay will compete and she take photos, but she becomes distracted by claims of missing sheep. The next day the stock handler Ray, who worked with the sheep, is found hanging in one of the outbuildings and Summer, the sheeps owner disappears. A dubious pair of men is looking for Summer, and they begin following Janet, thinking that she knows where Summer is and that Janet must have taken pictures of the men. Even Summers husband claims to have no idea of her whereabouts or if it is connected to Rays death. Several plotlines converge here to make an interesting, twisty tale of manipulation, fake identities, and consequences. Janet does her best to talk herself out of looking into things, but her nosy nature, and her neighbor, just wont let her leave things aloneeven when she in the path of a bullet.Shepherds Crook is the fourth book in the Animals in Focus mysteries, and it is great fun. The mystery itself is compelling, but for me the animals are the real draw that keeps me reading. I enjoy learning about the world of dog (and cat) agility and that the pets are so prominently featured throughout the story. I also like that animals are involved with the mystery itself. Janet has a dog and a couple of cats, Tom has two dogs, her neighbor has a dog and a cat, and even the police detective has a kitten. I cannot wait to read about the new puppy Winnies exploits in future installments.Ms. Boneham obviously knows a great deal about the animal agility trial world and pets. What could come across as dry textbook information is instead woven seamlessly within the story with a deft hand. The characters are varied and well developed. Janet is realistically flawed, yet endearing, but I do hope she gets over her relationship insecurities soon.Shepherds Crook was thoroughly entertaining and a quick read. I recommend it to all pet lovers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34XRLV8HLLGC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CZD176#wasThisHelpful","R34XRLV8HLLGC4","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review brought to you by OBS reviewer AndraPane and Suffering is the first book in the Webbs Glass Shop Mystery series by author Cheryl Hollon. I found the pace good and the plot was engaging, if at times a tad slow. The mystery was definitely a well-kept secret (at least from me)my early prediction of who was the killerway off!Savannah Webb (a glass blowing artist who lives in Seattle) returns to St. Petersburg, Florida when her father dies of a heart attack. The original plan was to get through the funeral, set the shop in order and then sell it to Hugh Trevor. Unfortunately, during the course of opening the shop up after the funeral and resuming normal classes, a second deathHugh! Now this is definitely more than a coincidence. This is where Savannah puts on her amateur sleuthing hat and gets busy. Especially with the bumbling Officer Boulli as the attending officer at the site of Hughs death. And there is a pleathoria of potential murderers! Smythe (drinks Bud Light in a British pubreally?!) or freaky Frank. And surprisingly, Jacob.I found the geocaching aspect interestinga new twist on communications between a deceased father and his daughter. The use of many codes and cyphers added a bit a mystery and the opportunity for Savannah to communicate with her father, which when one loses a loved one with no notice, can be cathartic. Savannahs thoughts on thisI found them very touching:She thought back to how excited her dad had been when hed discovered the game of geocaching. It seemed a perfect way to introduce his motherless daughter to an outdoor activity that also exercised her brain.Diversity and acceptance in life and in books is good. I found the inclusion and portrayal of Jacob, a young man with Aspergers syndrome to be refreshing. I cheered for Detective Parker when he spoke slowly to Officer Boulli (way to tell him by the way!):Jacob Underwood has a specific condition called Aspergers syndrome. Hes developmentally different, not crazy. Sometimes these kids have an intelligence level that is off the scale.I also enjoyed reading about his service dog, Suzy. The respect and extra mile Savannah went to be able to include Suzy in the shop was refreshing. Jacobs contributions to solving the mystery were invaluable as he was able to decipher the clues from geocaching.Edwardwhat can I say? An attractive owner of the neighboring pub to the glass shop. And he frequently brings beverages and goodies to the glass shop! Additionally, he knows the secret to making the cash register at Webbs Glass Shop work. I loved how Edward and Savannah interacted. At times, Savannah seemed exasperated by Edwards actions and then she seemed smitten. I would certainly enjoy reading about a continuing relationship in future booksif there is one :)  Maybe he is the one to help Savannah forget about her ex in Seattle. But then againthe way that Savannah treated him when she found out about something that he certainly should have shared with her was very harsh:Burkart told me. Really, you couldnt find ten seconds to let me know about something that major? I might have made a terrible mistake in negotiating a sale. Im sorry, but I didnt mean to cause any problems. It was just business I cant talk about it now, please leave. Im sorry, Savannah. Let me Leave, now! He picked up the tray and headed back to the pub.As Savannah got her feet wet teaching the course, we were introduced to a myriad of colorful characters. They all brought something to the table and added some much needed humor to the shop at a time of sadness. Always a chuckle with the two sisters!I am pleased to have been able to read this first book in the new series and will patiently wait for the next installment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG9AEGAX7QDGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RRT32HK#wasThisHelpful","RG9AEGAX7QDGP","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer JeanieFaux Paw is a fun and imaginative read with Kathleen and Marcus, her beau. It wouldnt be as much fun without Hercules and Owen, Kathleens adorable little cats and of course, Fred the Funky Chicken. Seventh in the Magical Cat Mystery series, Faux Paw can be read as a stand alone or as part of the series. Sofie Kelly writes masterfully in so many ways and captures the personality of each person  and cat. I could almost see Kathleens home, the library, the unique display and additional security, and always, the joy of books.I knew the life of a librarian was extraordinarily busy, and learned more about how it takes many hands to keep a good one operating smoothly. It was fascinating to read about the special display, especially the valuable sketch with a whole new significance. It helps bring a new understanding about how much drama can be behind what seems like a simple historic drawing, and really helped draw this even more into the midst of the novel.The characters, developed over the course of the series, are fully endearing. The characters unique to this mystery only were brought to life to make the plot fully suspenseful. The action and conversations were exciting, so that those who are part of the series are made even more endearing. The drama that the cats had between themselves was so realistic, as those of us who have been owned by littermates can attest. One thing Im just not sure I could handle as well as Kathleen does, however, is the special magical talent that each of the cats have.For as much as I like Kathleen, I was uncomfortable that she seemed, at times, to disregard Marcus concerns that she not participate in the investigation. She thought she understood those concerns, but her actions at times belied her words. Marcus and his partner, Hope, were a great professional team; they both wanted Kathleen out of the eye of yet another criminal investigation. These concerns were realistic when considering that Kathleen and Marcus are growing a relationship, and how much danger she placed herself in during prior investigations.The plot was wonderfully complex, with layers of deceit wrapped around the theft and murder. This reader could not have discovered who the bad guy(s)/ gal(s) were; the plot twists took a couple of blind curves to bring about a fully satisfying ending to the mystery as well as to this chapter of the young couples relationship. I highly recommend Faux Paw to those who have loved this series, and any other series by Sofie Kelly. Those who enjoy mysteries with cats actively involved, or appreciate libraries, unique art exhibits, or simply very well-written mysteries might especially like this novel. I have read only one other book in this series so far, but am getting more! I can absolutely affirm that this series just gets magically better!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8BOR778JP6TU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S75OKW4#wasThisHelpful","R8BOR778JP6TU","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer AndraI was pleasantly surprised and pleased in reading this next title in the A Jake & Laura Mystery series. An easy flowing mystery in which the mystery carried through until the end of the story, and this is high on my priority list when reading mysteries :) As with All That Glitters (book 2 in the series), I am again enthralled with the writers styleit adds so much to the 1930s feel.This story carries on in the life of Jake and Laura. They are on their honeymoon in Hawaii (as they were married by the ships captain during their voyage to the islands) and receive an invitation from Amelia Earhart to tour Oahu by air. Jake is not overly fond of airplanes and neither is his new bride, Laura, but this might just be an experience which could later be used is his writing of a future Blackie Doyle book, so Jake agreed to the tour.I love how Jake is still a bit of a bumbling guy with respect to his new wife. He will act in a certain way or say something and almost immediately he knows he has messed up! The plight of a newly married guy :) :How many ways could a sap like me say he was sorry? Let me count the ways. I tried to remember my favorite apologies over the years. When Laura returned, she bounded up the deck steps and past me without so much as a glance. She went inside and slammed the front door, shaking the walls of the cabana.I loved a conversation that took place while a reporter was interviewing Lauraone question was directed to Jake during this interview:Whats been your biggest accomplishment? Youve had two careers, a detective and a mystery writer.  Jake answers My biggest accomplishmentmarrying Laura. Shes one special person. If you write that, dont make the words seems as sappy as they sound.I quite enjoyed the banter between Laura and Jake and was happy to see that while Laura frequently became annoyed with something Jake would do, she did not hold a grudge and her playful, loving side came through.Amelia discoveries the body of a local business man in the hanger next to her plane one day while taking care of final preparations for the upcoming flight from Hawaii to California. Amelias husband and business manager seeks out Jake for assistance in solving the murder because if this is not solved immediately, the flight may have to be cancelled!Certainly a chuckle when Laura, Jake and Billy entered the office of Kalua Enterprises (after hours):Laura felt along the top of the doorframe for a key. Sorry, darling, youll have to do your thing.  Billy clamped his eyes shut. What thing? Laura smiled proudly. Jake has many talents. I wasnt sure I still possessed the tools I needed. I searched through my wallet. The narrow file I kept from the old days was someplace back in Los Angeles. Pardon me. I plucked a hatpin from Lauras silver beret. Youre going to break in? Billy let out a deep breath. Thisthis isnt legal.I certainly enjoyed the navet of Billy. I must say though, he became more seasoned quickly while hanging around Laura and Jake! And they made a good team..While Jake was none to please to be working a murder investigation again during his honeymoon, you could sense that he was once again getting back into the groove of this type of work and began to enjoy himself and the challenges of investigating such a high-profile murder. A pure delight!The path to the killer was filled with twists and turns. It was a delight to live vicariously through the process that Mr. Murphy took the reader through to discover whodunit in this fast paced murder mystery. Thank you, Mr. Murphy for penning such a wonderful gumshoe murder mystery. I cannot wait for the next installment of Jake and Lauras adventures.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PVM0E5WHL5JH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONUVRUA#wasThisHelpful","R2PVM0E5WHL5JH","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer DanieleKnock on Wood is the second book in the Superstition Mystery series and picks up right where the first book, Lost Under a Ladder, leaves off.  I do not think it is necessary to have read Ladder but do think it would lend to a better reading experience since there are many references to the plot of the first book.  Rory has not decided to permanently stay in the superstitious tourist town of Destiny, California, but she is settling into a pretty comfortable routine as manager of the dog boutique with her new dog and budding romance with the chief of police Justin.  She is excited for her best friend Gemma to come for a visit but is surprised when she arrives ahead of schedule after breaking up with her boyfriend.  Things turn a bit dicey when Frank, the ex boyfriend, follows Gemma to town and possessively stalks her.  Gemma has quickly caught the eye of not one, but two, new suitors, Stuart the publishing editor and Lou the towns Public Affairs Director.  Lou proposes that Gemma, with her librarian skills, should take over as the manager of the local bookstore (its proprietor died in Ladder), and she decides to give it a go.  Things soon turn unlucky for Gemma when Lou is found murdered in the park, and she becomes the prime suspect.  Rory sets out to clear her friends name despite warnings from Justin.I really like the premise of the Superstition Mysteries, a town that is the world headquarters of all things superstitious and a mass of people who believe them.  However, this second visit to Destiny left me wanting more.  It is hard to determine if the residents really buy into the superstitions or if the superstitions are an easy excuse not to deal with some things or simply scapegoats.  I recall enjoying learning about various superstitions in Ladder but did not glean much this time around.  What superstitions are relevant here are mentioned repeatedly, and that repetition became boring.  There are actually few suspects, and when the perpetrator was revealed it came as a bit of a surprise, not because of clever plotting but because there were few clues leading to him/her.We still do not learn much about the residents of Destiny, and I think their stories would be interesting reading.  However, Rorys character does grow as she begins to move beyond her fiances death, and we learn more about Justin as his relationship with Rory develops.  Rory spends a lot of time with her dog (and I enjoy pets in my cozy mysteries), but I found all of the potty walks tedious.  Rorys future is still unsettled, and I do hope that she does not drag out her decisions.Overall, I enjoyed Knock on Wood but found it to be a weak sophomore entry in the series.  I will read the next book when it becomes available and cross my fingers that the shortcomings I have mentioned will be resolved.  I recommend this to fans of Ms. Johnston and those interested in superstitions.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z7O2NLVXXNRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738745529#wasThisHelpful","R1Z7O2NLVXXNRS","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer ScottOnce again, this volume of The Last Man saga relies on knowledge of the previous two volumes. But in terms of story content it is a fantastic jumping on point for new readers. Adrian and his mother, Marianne, expand on the world of anachronisms and flights of fancy, in a stunning graphic novel, The Chase. As new vistas open, this book so far, has been the strongest of the three volumes in the series. A lot more character depth and mystery abounds in the pages of The Chase and the story rings more truly because of this. If only the series had started out this way.The writing is much improved over the previous two installments, and this time around the centerpiece of Mariannes character in both her role as a mother and in the mysterious knowledge she seems to hold. The Chase after The Last Mans Richard Aldana, whom we find is a more mysterious man than in the previous two volumes (in which he really was a cypher). Its the simple addition of more background to their characters that make this book more enduring than the last. In fact, most of the tension arises as you dont seem to know these characters as well as you know them now, but there seems so much more to tell. The cookie cutter characters are now finally being fleshed out while still holding on to that serial feel.The art just keeps getting better and better with each volume. Abandoned petroleum reservoirs, outlaw police forces, and panoramic port and cityscapes pepper the volume with panache, and even the manga-styled characters are looking more realistic (mind you that could be because Im used to them by now). From driving across a wasteland, to a literal Kangaroo Courtrooms antics, the action is brisk and fast paced through this artistic barrage. It seems that the artists have been saving up for this installment to deliver their punch; and it lands. The art isnt rushed, but rather sweeps and flows to draw the reader into the page. Stylized in grey tones, you can almost imagine the colors leaping off the pages. Sound effects and word balloons are well placed and also serve well in guiding the viewers eye. You can hear the sounds of a port town, and it looks good.For a more sophisticated viewing of the world of The Last Man, fans of Dragonball or Dragonball Z, manga, fight comics and video game admirers, The Chase  is the graphic novel  in the series you dont want to miss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GQ69HNSUXTB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CKNY7S#wasThisHelpful","R2GQ69HNSUXTB5","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer DanieleWith its perfect Halloween setting for Sid the skeleton, The Skeleton Haunts the House is an ideal mystery to curl up with on a brisk autumn dayor any day.It is October in the small college town Pennycross, Massachusetts, and McQuaid University has been transformed into the perfect locale for the annual Haunted Howl, complete with a carnival, midway, and haunted hall.  The oldest building on campus, which sits empty the rest of the year, becomes McHades Hall every Halloween satisfying the conditions of the McQuaid familys bequeathment to the university.  It is opening night of the Howl, and Sid (the skeleton) is beside himself with excitement to attend.  Opportunities to leave the house without drawing unwanted attention to himself are understandably few and far between so his best friend Georgia, an adjunct professor at McQuaid University, is more than willing to escort him to the festivities.  The two dress as Velma and Scooby Doo (since Sid has exhausted all the standard skeleton costumes).  Georgias sister Deborah is in charge of McHades, and her daughter Madison is working in the haunted hall.  Everything is going well, even though Georgia does not want to go inside the hall, until real screams pierce the night and an actual dead body is discovered in the Zombie Party Room.  Sid finds himself caught in the sealed off crime scene and ditches the dog costume to become part of the haunted houses display.  This provides an excellent opportunity for Sid to eavesdrop on the police.  When the police zero in on the abandoned Scooby Doo costume, Deborah knows the police are on the wrong track and implores Georgia and Sid to find the real murderer so that McHades Hall can reopen.At first it seems that there is absolutely no reason for Kendall, a college student home to attend the Howl with friends from high school, to die, but the more Sid digs for dirt on the web and Georgia talks to people the more they uncover.  The university stands to lose McQuaid Hall and some adjacent land if the haunted hall does not reopen.  There is also a missing heir who, if found, could take everything despite the conditions laid out by the McQuaid family.  Could this be the real motivation for the murder?  Was Kendall simply at the wrong place at the wrong time?  Or did Kendall have some secrets someone would kill to keep quiet?  Or are Sid and Georgia on the wrong track altogether?I will come right out and say it  I love Sid!  The concept of a living skeleton as a main character should not work, but it does, delightfully so.  Sid is not a ghost or a monster, but an irresistibly charming, slightly goofy, witty, devoted best friend and partner to Georgia .  They have been together since Georgia was six years old, and it is easy for the reader to suspend reality and forget that he is dead.  They are definitely amateur detectives, bumbling their way through theories, clues, and information.  They make plenty of incorrect assumptions that lead them down wrong paths, but in the end, they get to the bottom of things, all while unintentionally putting themselves in harms way.Georgia is middle aged and still struggling to make it in the world of academia, but she is practical (if a bit impulsive), intelligent, inquisitive, and loyal.  Her love for her daughter Madison is palpable, and though her relationship with her sister rocky you know they would do anything for each other.  In this third installment, we finally meet Georgias parents, professors who have been absent on sabbatical.  They make a quirky family, and their dynamics are good.  They are all well developed characters but with room to grow.  One character whose appearances are peripheral  is Byron, the Akita.  He and Sid have a love/hate relationship because Byron steals Sids bones to chew on.  This makes me laugh probably more than it should.  The other subordinate characters, including other university faculty, law enforcement, and Georgias new romantic interest, all provide additional small town flavor.The Halloween backdrop is perfect for Sid.  I enjoy fall themed cozy mysteries, and the descriptions of the costumes, haunted hall, and carnival food seemed just right for this time of year.  I do think that The Skeleton Haunts the House can be read any time of year without any dimming of the fun and festiveness.  This series obviously boasts a paranormal theme, but Perrys handling of Sid and easy yet suspenseful and clever writing, should appeal to any reader.The mystery itself is well thought out and paced.  There are plenty of viable motivations and correlating offenders, but the actual reveal came as a bit of a surprise.  I love it when that happens since I usually guess whodunit way too soon.  This installment ends with Georgias future a bit up in the air, and I am impatient to see what the future holds for her.The Skeleton Haunts the House, and the entire Family Skeleton Mystery series for that matter, is a fun-filled, action-packed read that engrosses the reader from the first page to the last.  Highly recommended! I come away from reading this thinking that every family should have a skeleton, not in their closet,  in the attic.  Long live Sid!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVQQSIOJV0GF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02E4O#wasThisHelpful","RVQQSIOJV0GF2","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer DanieleOnce Upon a Grind, the fourteenth entry in the long-running Coffeehouse Mystery series, is a departure from the previous installments.  This tale is less cozy and much more of a suspenseful thriller.Ahh, October in Central Park.  Storybook Kingdom, a weekend festival in the park celebrating all things Brothers Grimm and fairy tales, is primed to be a big success.  Clare and her coffee shop employees have embraced the theme and transformed the coffee truck into Jack and the Beanstalk, and Matt has been called upon to be the Pink Princess Prince Charming.  All goes well until Anya, the Pink Princess, does not appear for one of her commitments.  To complicate matters, Clares boyfriend Quinns children have been unceremoniously dumped by their mother, and even though she does not need anything else on her plate, Clare keeps an eye on them.  However, the pair also goes missing with their dog Penny while Clare is distracted in the fortune teller tent.  Thankfully, the children are found without injury, but Anya is not so lucky.  Clare, with Pennys help, finds her unresponsive in an isolated wooded area of the park.  While the police think it is an overdose, Clare feels that something dark is in play with the Russian immigrant who nannies the children part-time.Things quickly spiral out of control when Matt is arrested in connection to Anyas state.  Clares inquiries lead her into a secret world of private clubs, a mysterious drug, a CIA cold case, espionage, blackmail, possible police corruption, and the Russian mob.  When another Princess dies and Matt is fingered in the crime, Clare puts herself in harms way to find the guilty Big Bad Wolf.I admit that I have not read all of the Coffeehouse Mystery books, but have I missed something?  When did Clare become superstitious and a believer in coffee ground readings with psychic abilities.  I am a fan of paranormal mysteries, but I definitely did not expect to find one here.  I was surprised by this turn in the characters, and I had a hard time with suspending reality enough to buy into the magic coffee beans, visions, and such.  Despite this, I found this to be a likable enough read.  The interweaving of fairy tale themes, such as Sleeping Beauty and Red Riding Hood, was fresh and interesting.  The plot was complex, a good thing, and the characters were connected in surprising ways.  The plethora of plot twists and turns kept me guessing until rather late in the book.  Also, the subplots involving all of the supporting characters kept me reading, but it did seem like too many big life changes involving too many Village Blend employees.  I am curious to see how Coyle handles all of these in the next installment.  Overall, it is my enjoyment of the characters that keeps me reading these books.Different from the other books in the series, Once Upon a Grind is still an entertaining read, and I will continue with the series.  There are always plenty of delicious sounding recipes included in the back of the book.  I recommend this to fans of the series and coffee fanatics.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JN5T19BKXXDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INIXU9Y#wasThisHelpful","R3JN5T19BKXXDQ","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer ScottWarning! This book leaves you hanging. The Secret Coders is a very Oriental-American stylized book in both its art and execution. However at the base of it, behind all of the conspiracies surrounding her new school, and her mothers separation (and being her Mandarin teacher), Hopper, the prime antagonist, and cohorts in education just cant hide the fact that this is a learning tutorial in binary numbers and the lost computer language LOGO (complete with turtle  a rather cute robot).Hopper is the young girl who drives the story forward. Her first school day at the eerie, Stately Academy, shows the growing pains that a change of environments allots. It is through this perspective of the world that the reader comes to meet her new friends and deepen the mysteries surrounding the school. As she becomes friends with others, the educational component of the book kick in.  Not that there is a lot of action depicted (aside from a few brushes with the school custodian). The Secret Coders uses Hopper as an elegant sounding board through which to teach and inform. With the help of her friends the young reader learns to count in binary (at a basic level, and understand bits of programming, drawing (literally and figuratively) from the computer language LOGO.The art is done in a hybrid of North American and Oriental styles. The characters are very stylized and cartoony, with over exaggerated gesture. The panels are grid like at the fundamental level, and very easy to read; especially for the 8-12 age category. Minimalist backgrounds dont conceal the budding programmers (or coders) and actively use repetition in the panels to reinforce the learning material.  Being simplistic in design, allows Gene Luan Han, to tell the story, and impart lessons with the minimal of fuss.The story is what would draw young programmers into it. Who hasnt had pre-school jitters, and with the 4 eyed birds, secret numbers lying about the premises, and a problem to be solved will have most kids hooked. The writing is not over simplistic or too wordy and imparts its information gracefully from one page to the next, building upon the lessons to be learned, and not doing so in a patronizing manner. Being the first book in the series, of course, Mr. Han would leave us with a cliffhanger; all the more reason for the child to come up with his own solution to the end of the chapter problem and compare it to what is found out next.Overall, the story and art complement each other well in the Secret Coders, and the fundamental teaching mechanism is not lost. I only wish it could have developed the characters a little more beyond the two dimensional, but that would have impacted the message.

From the opening chapter I loved the character of Emmaline, a young blind woman with the gift of healing and caring. Having lived in France where such gifts were considered witchcraft she makes her way back to England to a brother who had abandoned her as a child. In his care at the brothel he runs, she quietly lives out her life. Her blindness combined with her brothers restrictions makes life more of an existence that she must endure. Emmalines life changes when she is asked to care for two Scottish brothers who were involved in a fight at the Inn. The eldest brother, a rogue Highlander, appeals to something in Emmaline and as he heals Malcolm introduces Emmaline to a world she could only dream about. But danger is always lurking around the corner and enemies are always to be found. Can Malcolm live long enough to fulfill Emmalines dreams and will she be able to convince her brother that Malcolm is the man she wants?Malcolm finds himself wounded along with his brother and being cared for by a sweet young blind lass that makes him want for a life he never thought he would have. After all he had been burnt by love in the past and he never wanted to be burnt again. Emmaline as he finds out in spite of her blindness is strong, resourceful and can see better than most. Her gentle feeling hands make him quake with desire and want, and he learns that he can give her what she most desires which is freedom to try things. When he allows her to play in the ocean and run in the fields he can see the joy in her heart. When Emmaline is threatened, Malcolm knows he must do everything to protect her. How will he convince her brother that he is taking her back home with him?This is definitely a book that you can curl up with as the days get shorter and the cold replaces the summer warmth. You will laugh and cry as the story evolves. It is historical fiction at its best and I look forward to more Paula Quinn books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIIKD90WWJD0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RTY0BPE#wasThisHelpful","RIIKD90WWJD0U","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer ScottIll be the first to admit that urban fantasy/romance is not really what Id normally pick up, but with Dark Embrace, that reluctance was overcome by pure joy. A crafty novel with a hint of the supernatural, this book left me wanting more. Angie Sandro is a talented writer who knows when to wrench up the action to the point where the romance in the novel almost takes a side street. More Urban Fantasy than romance, I was drawn into the book gasping for air, waiting for it to end.This is where the problem lies: the ending. The book has an amazing plot and the action is well described. Sandro throws enough twists and turns to keep the reader engaged. The problem lies in the fact that the book just ends. No character development; no closure  it just ends. Granted, it does give you a preview for Dark Desire, the next book in the series. Still, I felt there could have been some character growth, and some type of closure to allow the book to stand on its own. Without the denouement, the book arcs the action to the climax and then leaves you hanging. While this is a hard part to work around, given word count or page count, but I would have liked the characters more if there was some closure on their part.Characters in Dark Embrace are fully three dimensional, save for the odd side role, and Angie Sandro shines in developing her two main protagonists: Dena Ackers and Michael Anders. Throughout the novel we see more and more facets of their wonts and desires. Charming in its own way, the characters from Dark Embrace shine with a light that few authors in this genre ignite. Told from Denas point of view, the novel cascades about her odd predicaments, and washes the other characters clean and more believable. As the book progresses, and more odd abilities crop up, this urban fantasy/mystery novel takes the characterization to the fore. I had no complaints as to how the characters related to each other. Only a little closure on the characters part, aside from one short paragraph at the end, could have helped this get a 5 star review.The writing is handled deftly, and the passions and paranormal seem to fit right in. From the police detective, to the men on the sheriffs team, to the Russian mob, Voodoo priestesses and beyond, Dark Embrace somehow manages to make these myriad elements seamlessly intertwine over the course of the novel with minimal suspension of disbelief. The style is brisk, blunt in places and lavish in others. It reads well and definitely plays the reader along. Overall, its a solid novel. The lack of a proper ending is the only fault I could find. As mentioned previously, had there been a three act structure, it would have moved me. Unfortunately, the two acts are all you get; but truth be told, theyre good acts.Overall, Dark Embrace captures the reader right off the hop. Angie Sandro writes a solid beginning of a perceivably long series. The blend of action, kung foo, gangster, murder and romance are blended well into a reality thats not far off the readers radar. It works in this book, and I would highly recommend it to dark fantasy, urban fantasy, science fiction, romance and a plethora of others, as the book holds something for everyone. Dark Embrace, whilst lacking an ending, paves the road to new beginnings. Angie Sandro will, given a proper structure, certainly be an author to watch out for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z4SYK7JGQAVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y8SOYVQ#wasThisHelpful","R1Z4SYK7JGQAVE","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer AndraFearFear has a voice in this segment and when it said: When you begin to love things, I put my feet up and let the things do the work. Attachment is one of my favorite fears..Attachment to things is blasphemy. It goes against the natural order of life. To love anything but the natural world; your children, your family, friends, dogs and cats. but to love a thing  to be attached to a thing? Its almost sad. I was moved how it truly hit home..interesting.The MinotaurA sad, heavy story and yet uplifting in the end. Jack was suffering just as his mother was as a result of his fathers death, but he put his artistic talents to such great use.The Lancaster SocietyThe world exists whether Im in it or not? Harsh, though I remember it making sense to me. When a person dies the world doesnt swallow the rest of us and start again.  Very powerful beginning to the story. A very intense read.Life, Spelt Out in a NameVery intriguing. I cannot imagine a mother outliving her son. The writing was gripping and engaging.SadnessMost powerful statement in my mind: most sadness in born of fleeting moments. Your life is a series of moments. If you let down your defenses, you invite sadness.I loved the statement: An interesting fact: Music is the only thing in your world which uses the entire brain.Interesting how sadness is described like ones friendalways therewaiting to intrude upon your life and take over. Certainly made me think. And I loved the last line: The next time you wonder why youre sad, remember, I am as necessary for your happiness as Fear is for your safety.Spirit RaceAn interesting read. I was totally captivated and NOT expecting the ending. Certainly made me think about the human race and what we stand for.LoveI liked the statement: We are here to serve you; to help you realize your best potential. Everyones at their best when they feel love! How true!I like how the story refers to another short story in this set. Dont let Fear decide what youre allowed to love.And the following passage was just great: Does Love require a disclaimer? Do you not understand the risks? How about this: Love; negative side-effects may include, but are not limited to: watery eyes, upset stomach, denial, anger, bargaining, and depression. Reads like the stages of grief! Of course Im being facetious. If you cant laugh at yourself  am I right?! LOL. Dont you just love me! As long as you love, nothing can harm you. Love trumps all.  A Halloween SpecialAn interesting, yet odd tale. It was well crafted and kept my attention throughout the short story. What did happen to the skeleton?Death WishWow. This story was quite powerful.  The stories made one think about the human condition. If you are a fan of short stories, than I highly recommend this book.*OBS would like to thank the publisher for supplying a free copy of this title in exchange for an honest review*","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27UK9F5Y2JNNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0981316891#wasThisHelpful","R27UK9F5Y2JNNR","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer OmarThe story starts with Prince Corum Jhaelen Irsei (Corum in the Scarlet Robe) when his father sends him to pay a visit to his aunts and uncles in their different castles. Corum is a Vadhang, which means that he can live hundreds of years, acquiring knowledge and creating arts. They can also see and move through the different planes that exist in the world. The Vadhang were once in fight with the Nhadragh, a race like them, but for two hundred years there has been peace between them. Because of the peace, neither race has come across each other in all those years. This is the same reason that Vadhangs dont take a lot of importance if they dont see each other so much. In this same world there is a race called Mabden, which are normal men, and they have grown in number over the years.In his journey, Corum sees Mabden torturing other Mabden, but when he gets to the first castle he only finds ruins. When traveling to the other, he encounters more villages of Mabden in poor conditions. He later learns that the Mabden have been killing the Vadhangs to extinction and the Nahadragh to the edge of extinction as slaves.He hurries to get back home, but when he arrives there he finds the castle in flames and all of his family dead. His mother and sister were raped and his father dismembered (a thing that east and south Mabden like to do). He goes after the Mabden that did it and tries to kill them. He manages to kill a few of them, but he ends up being captured. Because he is the last Vadhang they torture him, they cut his left hand and take his right eye. To escape he manages to move to another plane where the Mabden can see him.The sentient may perceive and love the universe, but the universe cannot perceive and love the sentient. The universe sees no distinction between the multitude of creatures and elements which comprise it. All are equal. None is favoredI liked this book, this is the first book in the Corum series, and the rest of the series looks interesting. At the beginning, Corum feels a little arrogant, but as the story progresses he starts to change into a better person that is more in tune with his emotions such as love and justices.This world is very different and is a little easy to lose track of things, but its very interesting and bloody. As the story unfolds we meet different Madben and beings that help Corum in his quest. He even gets a new eye and hand.The Mabden had ridden out their arrogance born of ignorance and destroyed those whose arrogance was born of wisdom.The Corum series was first published in 1971, and this year from May until October the series would be reprinted. The books have new covers and in this one we see the new hand and eye that Corum was given.The where some moments when the story made me feel sad and angry. Angry because of the Mabden killing two races just because they feel unworthy and jealous of the knowledge of the Vaadhang and Nahadragh; sad for all the people that died and suffered in the hands of the Glandyth.I need my hands and my eyes so that I may kill Glandyth and watch him perish. With only half of these, I lose half the pleasure!The hero in the book series of Michael Moorcock are all reincarnations of Eternal Champion, a being that exists in every world and time in the books of the author. The Eternal Champion is there to maintain cosmic balance.If you are a fan of fantasy worlds, or if you have read series by Michael Moorcock, I recommend you to read the Knight of the Swords from the Corum series. Here a hero grows because the world makes him one and learns that there is more in life than staying inside a castle making music and art.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7WLZKR3YJ7R6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PCLJE#wasThisHelpful","R7WLZKR3YJ7R6","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS staff member AndraIt has been a VERY long time since I began a new cozy mystery series where I was blown away. I can say without a shadow of a doubtthis story was excellent. So many things to praise. The writing style was engaging, easy to read and entertaining. I also really loved how each chapter began with a snippet from another mystery writers book.I felt happy for Lizzie when she got all excited that Mark was at her house when she drove home one evening:She felt a jolt of excitement when she turned onto Sidcup Street and saw the police car parked in from of her house. She had to admit Mark hadnt been too far from her thoughts since their hike the morning before.and then to find out it was Officer Amber Craig and then to be questioned by the officer. I found Officer Craig annoying and a bit condescending. Hopefully as she gains more experience on the force she will mellow as she was quite the proverbial hard when interviewing / interrogating each of the Ashton Corners Mystery Readers and Cheese Straws Society members.There were many threads to this mystery coming from various angles. To begin withwho is the victim? It appeared that no one from the book club even knew why he had come into Molly`s house uninvited nor why he came to be murdered right outside of her house moments later. At times I had to really think and ponder the inter relationships; but in the end it all came together and made perfect sense. I found it compelling when the death of Lizzie`s father was brought into the story and how that whole story line wove into the current murder.I liked the incorporation of Lizzies two cats in the story  Brie and Edam (love the names!). Bringing a person`s pet`s into the story makes it more relatable. Also, pets are usually good judges of character, so it said a lot that Brie liked Mike Dreyfus :)I love how I was in the dark until the very enda mark of a great cozy mystery..when I cant figure it out until I read about whodunit. I have already obtained the next books in the series and plan to get right on reading them. I can`t wait to see if or how the relationship between Lizzy and Mike develops. Will Officer Craig mellow with time? What about Molly and Bob Miller?Thank you, Erika Chase, for penning such a delightful story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAAHAVGGXG03T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GSYY6C#wasThisHelpful","RAAHAVGGXG03T","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer JeanieThis extremely well-written mystery is the 42nd in the Murder, She Wrote series, but the first that Ive read; had I known how much I would enjoy this, I would have started reading this series sooner! Jessica Fletcher is the fictional character at the heart of these wonderful books who writes her adventures and the mysteries she has solved in first person. This approach has helped me quickly come to know Jessica and some of her journey.In Death of a Blue Blood, Jessica travels to England for a New Years Eve ball at Castorbrook Castle with Lord and Lady Norrance, their family, and more than 100 of their friends and business associates. Jessicas companion is Scotland Yard Detective Inspector George Sutherland, who she met years before when attending a mystery writers convention in London and she finds her mentor, Marjorie Ainsworth, dead in her room (Gin and Daggers) They have stayed in touch over the years, and could easily be romantically involved if only they could figure out how to do so with the pond between them.Within moments of being shown to their rooms at the castle, Jessica looks out her window and sees a purple cloth in the garden below, then at the foot and leg belonging to the wearer of the purple. Jessica was accidentally locked out of the door she left propped open when racing to help the woman. Unfortunately, this important member of the household was already dead. Jessica analyzed the situation with George, who could assist the local inspectors. They were on hand, however, to hear the sniping and backbiting within the family over the family financial feudas the tension of preparing for the ball intensified. Thus began the holiday; the local police continued interviewing all in the castle, with those in charge of the case actually attended the ball. They were too late to stop the death of Earland this time, George and Jessica will be in the thick of the investigation, as they were near the Earl when he died.The author gives an excellent portrayal of the characters, especially Jessica, George, and how Jessica works through the clues she is able to see. The Earls family members were mysteries unto themselves; we catch glimpses of them occasionally in the beginning. As the ball progressed, one could see some of the true personalities of the sons and daughter. After the Earls death, the family sequesters themselves away from guests remaining at the castle. I very much enjoyed Jessicas ease of conversing with almost anyone and draw them out, including some of the people in the village. It went beyond the investigation; she was genuinely interested in those she met.The author portrays the setting expertly; descriptives were so detailed that, except in the moments that the cab and mobiles were used, it was as if one were seeing castle life in another century. I actually shook my head at one point to return to the present! The castle itself, the various meals, the village shops, and the proper English all contributed to that feeling. Another help was how the author could gently show how valuable the British sense of titles and authority is and to what degree that level of position and propriety played in the plot.This mystery kept my attention from beginning to end. I couldnt come up with the bad guy/ gal or the entire motive until Jessica asked questions that were more pointed based on the answers she received. I do like being able to puzzle out the whodunit and appreciated that I could figure it out shortly after Jessica did. The mystery was complex and the motives sad when considering the loss of lives and how that affected so many. Overall, I completely enjoyed Death of a Blue Blood and highly recommend it to fans of Jessica Fletcher and mystery lovers of all ages. This can be enjoyed by those who like the setting of an English countryside and writing that draws the reader in with suspense that builds throughout. This is not your grandmas mystery series; Jessica Fletcher is definitely a 21st century thinker!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAJASYGH0DYOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INIJJDK#wasThisHelpful","RAJASYGH0DYOW","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer AndraA lovely novel about the power of second chances. I was quickly taken in by the story and succumbed to sleepless nights while I finished the book. Immediately this reader was sympathetic to Anna as her caf burns down just after she has taken on more debt to help her sister expand the bookstore next door. What else could go wrong? In order to supply the morning goodies for the bookstore, Anna must accept help from her ex (Mark Hastings) by way of sharing his commercial kitchen (a suggestion put forth by Marks Aunt Rosemary). It has been eight long years since they have been involved (and by the wayboth Anna and Mark NEVER let anyone in the family know they were involved).As money is tight (waiting for insurance money to rebuild is not a quick process) an opportunity arises to enter a cooking contest (this idea set in motion by Aunt Rosemary of courseso are we getting the idea that Aunt Rosemary has other plans for these two???). The only logical choice is for Mark and Anna to work together to wow the judges and hopefully win $100,000. As to be expected, working together with ones gorgeous ex is not easy. Especially when no one in the family knows you are exes. But they do manage to work together (and yes, hot and sexy sparks are present). They manage to enter the contest and. (you didnt think I would tell you the results did you???).  I must say though, I definitely got hungry as a result of their practicing and run-throughs of their menu as well as Anna making all the morning goodies for the bookstore. This story also made me wish I had a bigger kitchen to bake my own goodies!With sparks abounding, Mark has regrets about his breaking Annas heart all those years ago. The question is, can each of them forget about the past and create a present and maybe even a future? It is rough going and at one point, Anna is going on blind dates set up by Rosemary. Now those dates are a hoot. I really got the sense that Rosemary had a secret agenda (and yesof course she does).How did the two manage living in the small same town without communicating:Theyd coexisted in virtual silence for years, but Briar Creek was small, and people talked. If you didnt want gossip-and neither of them did-then you had to go along with the flow, keep up pretenses. Attend Marks annual bash.Mark on Anna:I kept thinking one day youd come around, start liking me again.And Annas thoughts re: Mark:His mouth tipped into that slow, easy grin and her heart skipped a beat. Damn him. He had no right. No right at all to be digging this up, to resurrect something theyd once had.Needless to say, there are roadblocks on the path to finding each other again, if they can manage this. There is the predictable ex-girlfriend, lack of confidence that Mark has matured or that Anna has worked past being scared of being happy. And meddling relatives certainly played a significant role! Rosemary is such a hoot.As well, the secondary storylines were very engaging and certainly set the stage for further titles in this series. This, coupled with the various other secrets (which were unexpected but definitely added depth to the story), produced a very enjoyable second book in the Briar Creek series. I cannot wait for book #3., thank you Olivia Miles for creating this engaging book as well as engaging series. :) I look forward to your next title.*OBS would like to thank the publisher for supplying a free copy of this title in exchange for an honest review*","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33GV6GAYHZ2N3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNU9A4W#wasThisHelpful","R33GV6GAYHZ2N3","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by reviewer AndraAs I carry on my journey through An Ashton Corners Book Club Mystery series, I am totally enthralled and satisfied with this latest installment, Read and Buried. What bad lucky for Lizziea murder right in her own living room. That certainly put a damper on her decorating plans for Christmas.I loved that the cast of characters who could have been the murderer was long and took so long to unravel everyones connection to the deceased (and a slime ball deceased he wasin my humble opinion) in addition to finding out why he had come to town at all! I found the initial connection between the women in Derek Altons notes for his new novel quite ingenious, clever really. I did feel sorry for Lizzie at timesMANY women figured Lizzie knew something about the book Derek was writing because Derek was killed in her home. Let me just say, the path to the killer is a convoluted, twisty and entertaining road with no shortage of suspects. I enjoy Lizzies sluething style, though her boyfriend Chief Mark is certainly not as understanding of her extracurricular sluething activities.The interactions between Lizzie and Officer Craig were often tumultuous but definitely entertaining. The sparks certainly flew between the two of them. Officer Craig really seemed to want to ruffle Lizziewondering if Officer Craig has a thing for the chief??? Regardless, it will be fun to see how these two interact in the future. I wonder if in a future bookfar far awaythey will actually become friends? Lizzie bristled. Craig seemed to be enjoying this. I dont like your tone of voice, Officer Craig. Youre implying much more happened than did. It was a dinner. Period. Nothing more. And besides, the chief already knows.So tell me, did Mr. Alton take the hint when you hung the mistletoe?Lizzie exploded. No. There was no hint, no message, no kiss under it. I already told you, but in case youve forgotten, I was decorating the house when he stopped by. Unexpectedly.The slow and steady growth in Lizzie and Marks relationship was a realistic and believable portrayal. I just love reading about a love story in its infancy. Time will tell whether they last. As well, the depth and growth of Molly following the revelations about her deceased husband from the prior book was both believable and entertaining. Loved hearing about all her wild wardrobe choices. :)The decorated houses Lizzie encountered on her runs sounded so festive (I do enjoy Christmas cozies):Lizzie gave a chuckle as she turned onto her street and saw what the Beauchamps had done to their front porch. The country-style house had a traditional porch railing running across the front of it, and on that railing to the far right side sat an angel, halo slightly askew, one knee drawn up, leaning against the corner post.As seems par for the course with The Ashton Corners Book Club Mystery series, I am kept guessing until the very end. Well done Erika Chase. I look forward to book #3 in the series, Cover Story (as well as book 4 and 5 of course).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19ZUKSWMFSDLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425251780#wasThisHelpful","R19ZUKSWMFSDLM","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But its up to Dallas and Peabody to wade through the evidence and collar a killer.Its been quite a while since Ive read a book from this series, and I was hoping the break would make me love this installment that much more.

"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer DanieleChef Maurice and the Wrath of Grapes is the delicious sophomore entry in the Chef Maurice Mystery series. This book is such a fun, fluffy read, but do not be misled into thinking that the mystery is not strong. It is a well-crafted throwback to the locked room mysteries of the Golden Age of mystery. I think Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers would be proud of Langs tale.Everything seems to be centered on all things wine in this outing. The restaurant staff is busy trying to figure out what is missing from Chefs mulled wine recipe and kitchen assistant Alf will drink himself literally under the table in his efforts to get it just right. Arthur, who is Maurices long suffering yet loyal best friend, has reluctantly agreed to chair the newly formed Cochon Rouge Wine Appreciation Society. Chef Maurice and Arthur have been invited to attend a wine tasting and dinner at Sir William Burton-Trents, who has become quite the wine collector, home. Unfortunately, Sir Williams is found murdered in his own wine cellar before the dinner can even begin.Who could have it in for Sir William  his sister-in-law, the visiting vintners from France, a famous (or infamous) wine critic, an American film star trying his hand at winemaking, a mysterious stranger seen in the restaurant, or, God forbid, the butler? Chef Maurice, with Arthur as his Watson, takes it upon himself to solve the crime. Well, perhaps they will allow PC Lucy to do some of the work. Thus sets up a comical investigation where all is not as it seems, including family secrets, financial difficulties, and secret passages.Chef Maurice is a hoot, a bit annoying and oblivious, but I just cannot help but find him endearing. My favorite character, though, is Arthur. His steadfastness is charming, his exasperation with Maurice loving. The other recurring characters are quirky in their own right, but they balance each other so that they do not seem over-the -top. The suspects in this endeavor are a bit caricature like, but that makes them all the more entertaining. I was tickled when Hamilton, the micro pig from the first book, made an appearance. The secondary plot involving sous chef Patrick and PC Lucys budding romance was equally enjoyable, and I look forward to seeing where it leads.Chef Maurice and the Wrath of Grapes is pure escapist pleasure, full of amusing situations and exciting twists and turns. Bring on the next adventure!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROT470VU6IPC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1910679054#wasThisHelpful","ROT470VU6IPC2","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer ScottA fable is a short narrative usually encompassing a moral. After Aesop, they also usually contain anthropomorphized animals. But different cultures have different catalogues of stories such as these passed down from generation to generation, mostly by word of mouth. Just recently, fables have become popular again, and Fable Comics takes full advantage of it. Getting a cross section of some of the best in comic artists, Fable Comics lets the artist go crazy providing there is a moral to the story. This leads to some rather eclectic renditions of these classic narratives.Letting the artist go free spins a fresh post-modern twist on classic fables and allows them to let their creativity shine through and some rather unique endings. Twist endings were allowed providing a moral had to be told. These range from the classical interpretation of the tale, to Artists are Stupid, Art is Dead, Everyones a Critic (some of my all-time favorites). Maris Wicks uses her biology background to elucidate and educate on sea mammals. In The Dolphin, The Whale and the Sprat, and James Kochalka pulls out all the traditional stops in The Fox and the Grapes. These twists almost seemed necessary to propel the graphic novel forward, but with the traditional morals mixed in, it turned out to be a refreshing mix (although I would have changed a bit of the ordering of the fables).I have to admit, from personal experience, that letting the artist go wild is not necessarily a good thing. Some of the Fables were cute, but contrived; others left you yawning in boredom, wanting to skip ahead to the next one. Its a good thing fables are generally short. The roster of artists is also in a distinctly American style, cartoonish with few exceptions. This is not a bad thing, however, I would have preferred a more culturally diverse drawing style, but for what the book was trying to convey, it suited me fine.There are a few gems in the lot. Jaime Hernandez does a spectacular job with The Boy Who Cried Wolf, Roger Langridge handles Democles and His Fable with grace and flair, Shelli Pardline gracefully pens The Thief and the Watchdog, and George OConner renders in a prince Valiant type manner, the various Hermes tales. My personal favorite was R. Sikoryaks Krazy Kat rendition of The Lion and the Mouse. It really spoke in the words and depictions of the famous George Harriman cartoon strip. Skillfully rendered in Harrimans style, the moral at the end left me giggling inanely for minutes, at passing gags, and the stereotypical morphing backgrounds that Krazy Kat was noted for.If you are a fan of Aesop you will not want to miss this collection. Fable Comics has something for everyone, and the diverse art will defiantly have you lustering after any new artists you come across (or already know, there are a few New York Times artists here). With its easy to read format, hopefully you will learn yourself a moral or two.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FI26OG234G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CKO26U#wasThisHelpful","R3FI26OG234G","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer DanieleTrick or Deceit, the fourth installment in the Celebration Bay Mystery series, is a fun romp for readers who, like me, enjoy fall and holiday themed cozies.Celebration Bay is a bucolic, charming, small town in New York that is making a name for itself as a holiday tourist destination.  It is in desperate need of a new community center and has planned a haunted house competition for the residents with all proceeds going towards a new center.  Liv, who is the towns event coordinator, is overseeing the Halloween fun and hopes that Jon, her friend from her former life in Manhattan, will use his influence in awarding a grant for the project.  Barry Lindquists Museum of Yankee Horrors is crowned the winner, but the celebration is short lived. The museum is vandalized overnight, and all of the exhibit mannequins have been dumped in an adjacent field.  It is quite a shock when the body of one of the judges, Lucille Foster, is found a midst the detritus.  Now time is of the essence to put things to right in time for the haunted house tours and before Jon comes to town to inspect the current community center, all while trying to get to the bottom of Lucilles death.  Liv has gained a reputation about town as a problem solver, and it seems the entire town expects her to unmask the murderer.  Hopefully, she can do so without losing their chance at the grant money as more and more motives and suspects, including Jon, surface.This is my first trip to Celebration Bay, but it will definitely not be my last.  Even though I have not read the previous entries in the series, I had no trouble jumping right in with the characters and setting.  I am a sucker for holiday themed cozy mysteries, especially those set during the autumn months.  The town has a lot to offer its visitors, and this setting is perhaps the books biggest draw.  I would love to participate in the Zombie Walk and tour the haunted houses, all while enjoying the food and sundries that the local shops provide.  There is even a witch newly arrived in town to add to the Halloween vibe.Liv is a practical, level headed protagonist who does not thoughtlessly place herself in the path of danger.  Her friends, coworker, and landladies all seem to genuinely care for her.  Their sometimes bumbling assistance provides some light moments throughout the story.  I do wish, however, that they were more richly developed.  I appreciate that the local law enforcement is treated with respect and not simply portrayed as inept investigators.  Liv and Sheriff Bill have open exchanges of ideas and work together to solve the crimes.  Many times in cozies the amateur sleuths have no real reason other than nosiness to ingratiate themselves in an investigation, but Liv has a vested interest in the outcome since it affects the town and her job.  Whiskey, the Westie, is my favorite character.  He brightens every scene he was in.As much as I like the setting and the basis for the characters, I think the mystery itself is a bit mundane and predictable.  There are times when the story drags for lack of development.  However, I do not think that this took away from my enjoyment of the book.Overall, I enjoyed Trick or Deceit.  It is a frothy, entertaining trip to a quaint town.  I recommend it to fans of holiday themed cozies.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVYWZE27KITKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02FHA#wasThisHelpful","RVYWZE27KITKB","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer HeidiBlue just cant seem to get his head on straight anymore.  His world has gone to crap ever since Everett Cavanaugh died, and the truth came out, that Everett was his father and his mom has lied to him his entire life.  The only solace he found was with his online relationship with cowgirl, but even that turned to crap when her identity was revealed as none other than Natalie Palmer, the girl they suspect killed his half-sister, Cass.But the night he found out about Natalie he took solace in the arms and body of Emily Shiver, his angel.  But she left in the middle of the night making it clear what she thought about the situation.  But now her brother Deputy Shiver, just took him to jail for speeding!  But he got to see Emily again, but its another blindside as he finds out shes pregnant with his child!  Now hes out to make sure that hes the father to his baby that he wished he had had.  But Emily cant take the distance hes trying to keep between them, and pushes him away.  But now Emily and their baby are both in danger at the hand of Natalie, who thinks she has a claim on him.  Its up to Blue to protect what means the most to him, his new budding family.OMG!  I loved this book, and literally couldnt put it down!!  It was sooo good that I blazed through it.  And now Im a little sad that its over.  This appears to be the last book in the series and Im sad to see it go, even though I realize that there is no more story to tell.  The mystery has been solved.Blue has been my second favorite Cavanaugh brother throughout this series, second only to Cole!  I just adore him!  Yes he has been a bit thorny in these last few books, but who could blame him?  His world came crashing down when he realized all he ever knew was a lie.  But I loved to see how he instantly became so protective of Emily and the baby.  He was down-right swoon-worthy, even when he wasnt giving his whole heart.  You could see he wanted to, but just couldnt trust anybody anymore.  Completely understandable after what hes been through.I really liked Emily as well.  She was a good person to help Blue get though all the betrayals hes recently faced and come out a better person on the other side.  It takes her awhile, but it all finally sinks in for Blue.  It was almost too late by the time he figured it out, like it often is in romance novels.This book was great, I loved it!  But like I stated earlier, Im just sad its over.  I love the Cavanaughs like family and to not see them anymore makes me sad.  And I wont even get to see Blue welcome his baby into this world. *sniff sniff*  Ill be okay  honest  just give me time to mourn my loss!*OBS would like to thank the publisher for supplying a free copy of this title in exchange for an honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25QYBDHUKGCO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S75OJ98#wasThisHelpful","R25QYBDHUKGCO9","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer JeanieJordan Bingham has what seems like a plum job to we bibliophiles.  If one is saving money for grad school, working as a live-in assistant to a rare book collector doesnt sound bad!  It does have benefits:  Private attic room with adequate space and privacy, quaint, small-town living, all the food that one could possibly eat from a dear, feisty Italian lady, time to visit family and friends.  A climate controlled library with rare and valuable books.  There are downsides to any job, however.  The boss, Vera Van Alst is hated by most of the people in town, and she succeeds at being an intimidating old lady. She is a sourpuss at times, but many disabled, frail folks can be accused of that.  Oh, and there are cats, which I would typically see as an upside, except there is a good catand a bad, snarly, clawing cat.  They look alike; one doesnt always know which cat is in ones room.  Sometimes the people in town tend to judge Jordan based on her employer, making it hard for her to do a deal to get the books Vera seeks. There is that little thing about murderPeople just seem to get murdered around there.  That might make all those pluses go out the window for many.  Unless, like Jordan, one has an eye for detail and the ability to think logically based on the way her favorite classic detectives have solved mysteries.  For example, like Dame Ngaio Marshs hero, Inspector Roderick Alleyn.Chadwick Kauffman, the ultra-wealthy heir and end of the Kauffman family line, wanted to sell a very fine first edition set of Dame Marshs mysteries.  His people had approached Vera to see if she was interested.  Jordan and Vera would attend a luncheon at the Kauffman family summer estate, Summerlea, inspect the set of books and pay cash for it.  All went well, the estate was amazing, the deal done.  Kauffmans butler and personal assistant seemed a bit off, and Kauffman even seemedreptilian.  It seemed surreal when the news broke that Chadwick Kauffman had died at the estate sometime after they left.  Then, the police came to their door.Jordan had grown up in the care of three beloved uncles who adored her.  They had unique ideas about the law, the police, and how to break one and avoid the other.  Jordan was the first in her family to go legit, yet any cop other than her friend Smiley coming to the door was not good.  Vera and Jordan were stunned that they were the chief suspects in Kauffmans death.  Well, them and Uncle Kev.I really love the Book Collector Mystery series; The Marsh Madness is the 4th and to me, the best to date.  It can be enjoyed as a stand-alone cozy or as part of the series.  Kudos to the cover art designer; even if the author is not a new one for me, it is very appealing (especially Walter, the Pug).  The Cast of Characters listing is wonderful; I wish every author included one. The recipes look like fun for those of us who enjoy cooking.Jordan is someone I almost envy for her job with Vera, her intelligence, and her acting and people skills.  Reading this as a first person mystery quickly drew this reader in, showing who she is and leading me to genuinely like her.  We meet the other characters through her eyes, most of whom she views with optimism, capitalizing on their good traits and ignoring some of the less pleasant.  Through her eyes, her uncles and their significant others are delightful, evennormal.  Her instincts are better honed with each solved murder, and she diligently seeks the bad guy/ gal.  Who, by the way, was a surprise to me.  Without her unique background, neither the reader nor the police could find the real who or the why behind the murder.  The complexity of The Marsh Madness appeals to this reader, guaranteeing that Im already waiting for the next one to publish!  The writing style is such that this reader can stay in the story and savor it no matter how badly I want to flip the pages and get to the denouement!  It is the feeling of the location, the adventures with Jordan as she goes after clues and the bad guy/ gal, it is even Veras tude that makes the journey more fun than the destination.While reading this, I realized there are far fewer classic detective writers whose works are still acclaimed than there are mystery writers publishing today. The Book Collector Mystery series is one that I would like to think will be sought after by at least one or two future generations.  I highly recommend The Marsh Madness to readers of all ages who appreciate excellent writing, exciting plots, and fun, small-town people.  It can also enjoyed by those who appreciate ties to the classic detectives who they may not yet have read.  Dame Marsh might even gain a new generation of readers, solidifying Victoria Abbotts presence in classic suspense literature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D4YDG9MY0JIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI0B81E#wasThisHelpful","R1D4YDG9MY0JIP","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer JeanieWhen Cake Therapist opened, I had the impression that the author is a highly-intuitive individual with a talent for putting the right words together to evoke maximum connection with the reader. I lost that impression for a while, regaining it before the novel ended. Some of the descriptives are amazing, and the feelings of Claire Neely ONeil as she begins her new life in her grandmothers home and her new Rainbow Cake bakery are shared with transparent intensity.Neely left behind the glamor of New York City and her husband, Luke, an acclaimed NFL star, for her hometown of Millcreek Valley, Ohio which had become a centre for all things bridal. An extremely talented and trained pastry chef, Neely is opening the shop of her dreams, Rainbow Cake, hoping to make connections with Carriage Hill society families and the country club, catering primarily to weddings then to events of all occasions. Neely has the gift that she shared with her grandmother. She could taste the personality or driving emotions of people that she met, choosing spices and flavorings that matched them.Neelys long-time friend in Millcreek Valley, Roshonda, and high school friend Gavin, who had left corporate America to return home, provided invaluable help, including the interior design and renovation of the bakery. Gavin was also priceless when it came to his marketing and photo design expertise. Neely also had a baker, Norb, and Jett, a teen who could learn and provide elegant designs in various cake decorating pipings. Maggie would run the day-to-day operations of the bakery, keeping Neely free to handle the brides-to-be, deliveries and logistics, and sales. Then Ben Tranter came back into her life, as a friend, and Neely was reminded of the early days when she first met Luke. She continues to work out her relationship, or lack thereof, with the husband she left behind even while studying and receiving the gift of flavors when relating to the new brides.Judith Fertig is a seasoned cookbook author, and Cake Therapist is her first fiction offering. Even those of us who are cooking-challenged can see how thoroughly the author knows the substance and essence of baking. Her style of writing is inviting with regards to the conversations and relationships, and the thoughts of Neely were sometimes so descriptive that one could taste and feel as she did. Lines such as Flavor was the way people like me made sense of the world and voluptuous vanilla that your sharp-edged self could sink into like a pillow hinted at the richness of relationship.-The characters were not quite fully developed, I felt, as I had a hard time getting into any of them no matter how hard I tried. This reader was nearly through with the book before becoming invested in some of the characters. Neely was beginning to work through many situations from her past, including her absent father and the feelings that Ben once had for her in their younger years, as well as the needs of others near her, such as Jett.I did appreciate the men and women in the historical stories, but had a hard time understanding what those stories had to do with the present day until much later in the novel. I liked some of the seemingly unconnected characters, but there still seemed to always be something that tied them together that this reader had no inkling of. There were a couple times when catching a revealed detail that I could guess how some of the stories were related, but nothing solid. I will say that the ending was somewhat satisfying as the mysteries of the past were brought together into the present and Neelys heart had time to reflect. I recommend this to those readers who enjoy relationship novels centered around specialty baking with a bit of history and romance, characters with hidden depths and mystery. It would be interesting to see if the author writes a follow-up novel to show us how some of the open relationship challenges might grow or be resolved.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZAZ3LBK3J869/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425277321#wasThisHelpful","R1ZAZ3LBK3J869","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer DanieleThe Breaking Point is the ninth novel in the fantastic Body Farm Mystery series, and if you have yet to read the series this is an excellent place to start.  It is actually a prequel to the other books and takes place ten years after Dr. Bill Brockton has established his forensic anthropological research facility, commonly known as The Body Farm, at the University of Tennessee, and he is seemingly at the top of his game.  He is called upon by the FBI to identify the remains, if they can find any, of a humanitarian pilot whose plane crashed into the side of a mountain near San Diego.  The uprightness of the pilot is called into question, and Bills identification of teeth found among the embers of the crash is also doubted.  In addition to main mystery revolving around the crash and the possible nefarious activities of the pilot, Bill receives a threat from an incarcerated serial killer who almost succeeded in killing all of Bills family.  The integrity of The Body Farms practices is challenged when a local news journalist insists that Bills program is disrespecting military veterans whose remains were donated to the program.In what may indeed be Bills breaking point, his beloved wife Kathleen is given a terminal diagnosis.  Having read the other books in the series, Kathleens prognosis did not come as a surprise, but it was heartbreaking none the less.  Bills personal life is always a big part of The Body Farm books, but his depression and desperation following Kathleens death was some of the most poignant storytelling I have read in awhile.  A near tragedy involving his young grandsons provides the wake up call he needs to carry on without her.There are plenty of nail biting moments throughout the mystery, and the murderer was a little unexpected and brilliant.  The writing team known as Jefferson Basss writing style compels the reader to keep turning the pages long after bedtime.  There is tension, plots twists and turns, and forensic anthropology tidbits sprinkled throughout, and I found The Breaking Point to be highly entertaining.  I think it will end up being one of my best reads of 2015.  I highly recommend it to current fans of the series, fans of Patricia Cornwell, Aaron Elkins, and Kathy Reichs, and anyone who enjoys a complex thriller with lots of heart.  As Ms. Reichs proclaims on the books cover, this is indeed the real deal.*OBS would like to thank the publisher for supplying a free copy of this title in exchange for an honest review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPEWT30ONZ7JJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPWTH0A#wasThisHelpful","RPEWT30ONZ7JJ","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Brought to you by OBS reviewer KaytAfter having read several of the books written by Michael Phillip Cash I had an idea what to be expected in this one. Or so I thought. Well one thing that was similar, he writes books that work perfect for movies or television. This one is definitely prime for that. His writing style just reads like watching a wonderful show or movie. This one has to be my favorite so far. I expected some off the wall premise, witty dialog and interaction between characters and first rate pacing and I got that for sure. Witches Protection Program is wonderful. From beginning to end, it pulled me in and never let go. I would really love to see this as a new television show, TV needs something good like this right now.The main character Wes Rockville is self-depreciating and seems to lack the skills needed to be a stellar law enforcement agent like his father. It doesnt help that his father is also his boss. When he fails again at his job, he is sent to the last resort job. Or so we are lead to believe. A 232 year old secret government agency, The Witches Protection Program. He is paired with veteran Alastair Verne and begins to see things he never believed existed. A horrible conspiracy is in the works that could change things around the world. A famous cosmetic company is using witchcraft to attempt world domination. Wes is thrown into a world he never knew as soon as he goes looking for his new department. From that moment on things happen that push him to believe the impossible and he drags the reader along with him.Wonderful characters abound in this short but entertaining read. Great interactions with the dynamic duo of Wes and Alastair and those they are sworn to protect, witches. Evil comes in all shapes and sizes, including animals. Tempting the readers sense of reality, this book pulls the reader through strange happenings and makes them seem true. Even in the most outlandish scenarios, this author writes with a voice of truth. Explaining in a satisfactory way that makes everything feel like fact. As I was reading, I could see it all play out and imagine exactly how the show be!!Witches Protection Program is a surprisingly wonderful book. I say surprising since I am not really a fan of witches, supernatural, etc. I truly enjoyed this book and even the premise of it. As I have said Michael Phillip Cash writes in a way that just plays like a movie. This one would be a fabulous new TV series. Reading it is similar to watching an amazing movie play out in your mind. His writing is so descriptive and entertaining. His characters are so well written they pop off the page. I would say this book would appeal to any reader that enjoys a bit of witchcraft, but truly it will appeal to so many others. It is like a wonderful, suspenseful cop show, drizzled with witchcraft and supernatural fun, and then pumped up with an excellent storyline.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QA1Y00ZJT47D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YANTA4K#wasThisHelpful","R2QA1Y00ZJT47D","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review brought to you by OBS staff reviewer AndraRight from the get go, I was laughing and engaged with Double Mint!  A hilariously funny cozy mystery  Seriously though, could Gretchen Archers writing grab me any better? I think not! One of my new favorite authors!  Starting this series at book 4 was not a problemenough back story was told so that I caught up quickly enough with who the main characters were. The sense of humor really (I mean REALLY) grabbed me  as can be seen by the bit of dialogue from Davis:Ive slept with animals before (I was married to the same ape twice before Bradley, a long story I dont want to tell)The players:  Davis Way Cole is a redhead, a newlywed, and the lead investigator on an undercover team (with partners Fantasy Erb and Baylor, just Baylor  like Batman) for the Bellissimo Resort and Casine in Biloxi, Mississippi.  Davis is married to Bradley Cole  the casinos general manager.Davis describing a specific piece of equipment from her Super Secret Spy bag  brought a chuckle to this reader with respect to where she picked up this handy tool:my Quik-Piks, a set of universal bump keys.  The only doors I cant get in with my Quik-Piks are cockpit, White House, and my mothers. (Shes onto me.)  Where did I get this amazing tool?  AmazonAnd the secret of the cat (whos cat is it anyways ???) continued on until the endloved it!  Throughout the crime solving antics of Davis and her team, I was entertained by her sheer tenacity.  She had an idea and would not let it go.  The lengths she went to prove (whether rightly or not) her theories were entertaining.  There were plenty of twists and turns which kept me guessing until the end.The plot includes platinum, counter-fitting, bank robbers, organ transplants and that darned refrigerator.  Luckily, this will all be revealed when you read this hilarious cozy mystery!  I loved Gretchen Archers fast-paced storytelling.  She injected plenty of witty humor along with an intriguing mystery.

"Brought to you by OBS reviewer OmarWhat do you call a cat lady that charges for helping you with your cats? A cat behaviorist. But when Edie first hears Magnus talk, he calls her a crazy cat lady. From there on, they dont start on the right foot. At the dinner party, Edie with her sharp tongue, doesnt let any men redeem themselves, most of all, because she cannot understand how guests of her best friend can talk like that in somebody elses home.Content that she wont be seeing Magnus, and any of those men until the masquerade party and the wedding, Edie tries her best to put the incident behind. But her sister and Magnus brother have other plans. Levi, Magnus brother, believes that he has found the love of his life, again, and insists Magnus to date Edie, so her sister Bianca can date Levi secretly. Magnus needs his brother to get his new love out of his head so he can work on their next project, and accepts to help them. The only complication is that the more time he spends with Edie, the harder it is for him to deny his feelings for her.First of all, I liked that the story was different. Yes, there was the plot of opposite people falling in love, and betrayal, but I can say that the characters surprised me. I found Edie quite unique and Magnus very charming when he sets his mind to woe Edie.The cats, what can I say about the cats? Just that the need to want one has increased. Because of Edies profession, in the story there are a lot of cats, owned by her and by other people. Also, all the cats have funny names. The end of the book was very cute, bringing a trend from Japan to the United States, *spoilers* a cat cafe.In this book, we meet Edie and Magnus because they are friends of Hunter and Gretchen (Beauty and Billionaire). Edie was the one that gave Gretchen her cat, and Magnus is a client of Hunters. We see both Hunter and Gretchen throughout the story and a glimpse of their life preparing for the wedding.The book had a lot of funny lines and scenes throughout the story, my favorite ones were the ones regarding how the characters treated Bianca, most of all Gretchen,Except for you, Bianca. Youre not invited unless we need another usher or some s**tThis book was full with surprises. Magnus line of work was one of them. He and his brother are game developers, and when the author describes an app game, she describes a lot of games that are out there regarding war and strategy. I wonder if Jessica Clare played these games. I do, and I was pleased that she adds them in her story.Being a story of Billionaires and Bridesmaids, the story has its hot scenes involving Edie and Magnus in compromising places. For fans of her books and this series, I think you would be pleased with these scenes.If youre a fan of Jessica Clare or her Billionaires and Bridesmaids or Billionaire Boys Club series, then I recommend you read The Taming of the Billionaire. In this story, two people learned to trust that their own strength and that being family doesnt mean that they can step on you; there are love scenes and most of all, cats.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3II2PFGJ6HJ4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JV1294O#wasThisHelpful","R3II2PFGJ6HJ4N","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer JerjenDougal Lachlan is a true crime writer.  He has never met a mystery that he did not want to solve.  So when he receives an anonymous email telling him about unsolved murders that happened thirty years ago, he is definitely intrigued.  When he does some investigating he finds that he needs to pay a visit to Twisted Cedars to follow some leads.  He grew up in Twisted Cedars, in a trailer park, and he has not been back for a very long time.  Not even for his mothers funeral.  He knows that his sisters wedding is coming up soon, and he can spend time there trying to talk his sister, Jamie, out of the marriage.  He does not like the man she is marrying, even though they used to be friends.  He does not trust him and he knows that he is a cheater.  But his sister is not very likely to listen to him, she is upset because he never came back for his mothers burial.Charlotte Hammond is a librarian for the Twisted Cedars library.  She lives a quiet life which is very predictable and calm.  But when Dougal shows up at the library, asking for information about the deaths that had occurred years ago, that quiet life abruptly disappears.  She remembers Dougal from when she was younger and she finds him fascinating.  He was friends with her sister, Daisy, who disappeared after giving birth to twins.  She gets excited at the idea of helping him with his research and getting to spend time with him.The characters are well developed, well rounded and three dimensional.  The characters all have flaws and imperfections which make them seem even more realistic to me.  Many of the characters have past history and their relationships are finely woven together.  Family relationships are strained and there is a lot of guilt and regret felt by many of the characters.  Some of those cannot be changed and fixed, such as Dougal never saying goodbye to his mother.  Some can be fixed but it will not be an easy to do that.Dougal has a lot of regret that he has to live with and after returning to Twisted Cedars, he realizes just how much he has done wrong in his life.  He wants to try and make things right, where he can, but he does not know how to do that.  Charlotte has regrets concerning her sister and wishes that she knew where she was so she could try to mend their relationship.  She does not know where Daisy is or how she is doing.  She feels confident that Daisy is alive somewhere because there are withdrawals from their joint bank account, but she does not know anything for sure.  What she would not give to see Daisy again and tell her she loves her.The mystery is carried on well throughout the book and the author is very talented in creating suspense with the written word.  There are twists and turns and I kept second guessing myself with the answer to Who did it?.  I will say that I was a little disappointed in the ending.  When I finished the book, I still had questions with no answers.  I do not feel like the book had a true conclusion and that bothers me.  The next books in the series may address these questions and give me the answers I am missing now, but that is what I want when I finish a book.  This is only my opinion and it may not bother other readers.I enjoyed the characters and I enjoyed the fact that there was romance as well as mystery in this book.  The thing I liked the most about the book was the plot, the fact that the murdered were librarians and that the killings took place in the library.  I thought this was very clever and what better place for all that to happen but in a library, where there are thousands of mystery books.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well written mystery suspense.  This is the first book I have read by this author but I will getting the other books in the series to read.  Hopefully, I will get my questions answered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7KZRVQSO8DRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009XIGY4Q#wasThisHelpful","R7KZRVQSO8DRL","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer jerjenAvi Grant has returned home for her one month long furlough from Afghanistan.  She is there to visit her parents and to rest and relax before she starts her new assignment, stateside.  She also plans to pay her respects to her commanding officers wife, Patricia.  Both her commander, George, and his wife have been like second parents to her and she loves them both and greatly mourns the loss of George from her life.  She knows it will be painful to see his wife but she also hopes it will be healing for them both.  On her first visit to see  Patricia, Avi meets her son, Ben.Ben is struggling with the fact that his mother left her family and started a whole new life with George.  It was only after his death that Ben reconnected with Patricia but it is a relationship that is very strained, to say the least.  When he meets Avi and sees the love she has for both his mother and George, he is surprised and curious about the relationship between them and Avi.  He begins to see George in a different light, and although the hurt of his mothers abandonment is still there, he feels now he is beginning to understand the deep love that they had for each other.Avi and Ben feel an instant connection with each other.  Avi is hoping to find the person that she is meant to be with and she longs for a lifelong love, family and children.  The more time she spends with Ben, the more she thinks he could be the one.  But she knows that Ben has strong ties to Tulsa and he would never move away from his sisters and his job as a surgeon.  Ben realizes what has been missing from his life, someone to share special occasions with as well as daily triumphs and sorrows.  He thinks that Avi is special and that she makes his life much  fuller and richer.  But he knows that Avi still has eight years left before she can retire from the military and she will only be in Tulsa for a month.  He knows that he will never abandon his sisters like his mother did so long ago.  Neither are willing to change their life and follow the other and there is no compromise that can be reached.  So their relationship is doomed to be only one month.I fell in love with these characters, the story line and the entire book.  The characters are well rounded, realistic and three dimensional.  I feel like they are people I really know and care about rather than characters in a book.  Avi and Ben have both been hurt in the past and the hurt is hard to let go of.  Avi has lost so many of the people that she has loved, both family and fellow soldiers and she will not be able to handle losing someone else she cares about.  Ben has never totally forgiven his mother for walking out on her family.  He still blames her for his fathers death, feeling like he died with a broken heart.  Although his sisters have reconciled and formed a new relationship with Patricia, Ben just cannot seem to let his guard down and forgive her.  The supporting characters are also well developed and an important part of the story.  They are a close knit community of military wives who have all lost so much.  But they stand behind each other and support each other unconditionally.  The characters are all very easy to like and you cannot help but to care what happens to them.The writing style flows smoothly and it is a very well written book. The story is an emotional story of love, forgiveness and second chances.  Its a story of forgiving others as well as having the courage to follow your dream.  It is a story of remembering those you have lost but not allowing those losses to control your life.  The characters and the story line are heart wrenching and heartwarming at the same time.  I do not think this an easy thing to do as an author but Marilyn Pappano does an excellent job of blending the two together.  Although this is the fourth book in the series, I feel it can be read as a stand alone.  The author gave enough of a back story on the characters that I knew who was who and what was going on but not so much as to become repetitive.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading well written womens fiction.  If I could I would give this book more than five stars, that is how much I enjoyed it.  I have also read the third book in the series and I am looking forward to reading the first two books.  I want to spend more time with all of the characters and learn more about each of their stories.  I am definitely a fan of Marilyn Pappano and I think you will be too.*OBS would like to thank NetGalley for supplying a free copy of this title in exchange for an honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LU7MCKFZECEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7X61GI#wasThisHelpful","R1LU7MCKFZECEY","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer AndraOne sunny afternoon in Ottawa (spring 2015), I attended a literary event called Prose in the Park (http://www.proseinthepark.com/ ). It is there that I met Rebecca Diem  author. We got to talking and from that point in time; I knew I had to read her books. I could sense Rebeccas joy and love for her craft and while I have not previously read this genre, I wanted to give steampunk fantasy a try.I am totally delighted to say that my first voyage into this genre has been enjoyable. Thank you, Rebecca Diem, for penning such a captivating story. From the beginning I was drawn into Claras world through your use of words, which definitely brought the story to life. I loved Claras quick wit, ingenuity and her daring. And the spark between Clara and Captain DukeI cant wait to see where that might leadI quite enjoyed getting to know some of the other characters in the book as wellCat and Mouse! What interesting children. I loved how they took Clara under their wing and trained her on the art of the ropes (and such glee Clara got from this training). And the first mate, Nessa  her character, I am hoping, has much more depth than we have seen to date. She is intriguing and I cant wait to see how her character develops as the series continues.My one disappointment is that the book ended WAY too quickly. I was immersed in my reading and before you know it.the story has ended! L As luck would have it though  I had purchased the second book (From Haven to Hell) at the same time as the firstso I have it on hand and will continue the saga momentarily. Whew. Again, congratulations on a fine first book and please continue to write as your stories are too good to keep to yourself!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BS8LR02G9HR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MP7RJBO#wasThisHelpful","R1BS8LR02G9HR6","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer ScottFast forward to the future  the Second Civil War between the States is well underway. The Liberty Union Democracy (the North) clings to outmoded, ancient traditions, placing value on material worth rather than the human condition; Avantica (the South) provides for the people who are genetically engineered, from birth, to do tasks they are most suited for the productivity they provide the state. Thus begins the rollercoaster ride through a myriad of plot turns and twists and plenty of food for thought on the way things are headed in society today. As most fine speculative fiction, Avant Nation proffers a delightful spin on the world as we knew it, and from threads, weaves the extremes of both sides of these rather poignant topics.The writing, deceptively simple, plays up the various themes and the overall story arc. The citizens of the L.U.D. are an extreme of capitalism and the horrors that merit brought on by material acquisition entail. Higher crime rates, increased poverty, a division between the haves and have-nots and increased violence because of this. By way of comparison, Avantica seems idyllic, except that its citizens are sterilized and vat-grown embryos are the norm, save that they are genetically engineered to be the perfect cogs in the machine that feed the state  however, since the entire population can be controlled, nobody really wants for anything  but everyone lives in fear of discovering theyre defective (i.e. not fit to carry out their duties). At no point in the story does the reader converge on one side or the other, as the blacks and whites portrayed are mired in shades of grey. The prose flows from chapter to chapter, trickling from the viewpoint of the lives of Avants from Avantica, to what a skillfully written plot, and gushing into high adrenaline pumping action adventure.The main protagonist, Claire, is from the Compassionate class and it is through her compassion that the force propels the story. Although others appear in the novel, they arent as fully fleshed out as Claire. With Claire, the reader is given a sounding board and the people passing through her life serve as reflectors of her current state of mind. She is a fully fleshed out character that exudes compassion (as shes supposed to) and a deep three dimensional understanding of how things work in the setting. Sadly the other members of the cast are two-dimensional in flavor and her Academy classmate Hawk (from the Rugged class), is the only other individual we get to know, somewhat well.Overall, Avant Nation is a joy to read, right up to the climatic ending. Well executed in plot and setting and the theme of genetic engineering vs. rampant capitalism should earn this a spot on any Alternative History or Science Fiction fans shelf. Had there been a little bit more character development, this easily would have received 5 stars. However, the story itself is sound and should keep readers guessing until the very end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11VF3WU0A9KE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVRQ5JW#wasThisHelpful","R11VF3WU0A9KE3","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer HeidiI found this book to be quite the pleasant surprise.  I started the series at book two, Come to Me Softly, when we saw Aly and Jared trying to work through their many issues.  I found the characters to be pretty immature.  I did not think I would continue the series, figuring it was going to be more of the same.  But I saw this book was going to be about another couple so I decided to give it a chance, and Im glad I did!  I didnt even make the connection that this book was about Alys brother, Christopher, until I sat down to read it.  I have to say that I found this couple much more entertaining!Samantha Schultz was in love once, when she was in high school, to a beautiful boy named Christopher Moore.  But Samantha was the daughter of a pastor and was forbidden to even have a boyfriend.  But Christopher would come to her window at night and sneak her away.  That is until one night when her parents discovered she was gone.  Then they did everything in their power to rip the couple apart, they even went as far as to move across town and enroll her in a different school.  The couple was crushed, but tried to hold on to hope that their love would survive.You see  theres this girl whos on my mind every second of every day, and she drives me kind of crazy because I dont really understand the hold she has on me. But she has me in a way no one else ever has and more than anyone else ever will. And this girl  she needed me, and I didnt think twice about that jump, because getting in deep with her is the only place I ever want to be.And honestly if a guy in high school said that to me, Id be head over heels too!But it all came crashing down when Christopher pushed too hard one night, Samantha ended it and he lost all hope.  And, then she walked in on the worst betrayal imaginable, one that ripped the two apart for good  or did it?Seven years later Samantha is living with the boy that picked up her broken pieces and took care of her, but of course hes all grown up now!  But Samantha has never truly gotten over Christopher.  She cares for Ben, but she knows its not like the love she had with Christopher.  In fact, she didnt even want to move in with him, but was a bit manipulated by Ben.While at the store one day, Samantha runs into Christophers sister, Aly, and she agrees to meet with her for coffee sometime, even though she knows its a mistake, it turns out they live in the same neighborhood!  She and Aly become quick friends, which puts her right in Christophers path, and he makes no qualms about the disgust he feels for her  if only it was the truth.Once the duo puts away some of the pain they have inflicted on each other they are able to be friends, but the more time Samantha spends with Christopher, the more distant she becomes with Ben.  How can she keep the charade going?  She soon must decide which fork in the road to follow.I really cant believe how much I enjoyed this book.  It was a complete night and day difference from the previous one in the series.  I didnt want to put it down and was cursing things like work that kept getting in the way of my reading!!  The book is longer than it looks, but was so worth the read.It was nice getting to see Jared and Aly again, a much happier couple, then they were before.  It was also great getting to know their baby girl.  I loved how she had Christopher and Jared wrapped around her little finger!But I loved Christopher, even if he did have a darker side.  But it was a dark side that Samantha has all the power to erase with her light!  He was very swoon-worthy overall, and I loved his devotion to fight for what has always been his.Youre my world, Samantha. Everything I do, from now until the end of time, Im going to be doing for you.Samantha was a decent character in her own right.  She had definitely been through a lot, although was a bit too gullible at times where Ben was concerned.  I was glad to see her finally take charge of her own life.Speaking of Ben, what a jerk!  He made the perfect villain in this story though.  Acting more of a father figure than a lover, and he definitely didnt treat Samantha as an equal partner.  He was so manipulative and controlling, a prime example of a toxic relationship.I also loved Samanthas brother, Stewart!  Broke my heart that boy did!  But I could not have loved him more.  And I loved how much Christopher cared for him to and that he truly got what Stewart meant to Samantha.Everything was tied up in a nice neat bow at the end of this story, so I dont expect to see another installment about Christopher and Samantha, but hopefully we do get to see more of them.This was a great love story and a tear jerker to.  You could easily skip the previous two installments and dive right into this one!  And, I hope you do!  This was a beautiful second chance romance that draws you in early on and doesnt let go.Never stop believing in magic.*OBS would like to thank the publisher for supplying a free copy of this title in exchange for an honest review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AGZXEHK9TB4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWG5Y6W#wasThisHelpful","R2AGZXEHK9TB4O","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer DanieleA Gilded Grave, the first book in Shelley Freydonts new Newport Gilded Age Mystery series, is a delight. This well-crafted historical mystery transported me to the opulent world of the Gilded Age, and I cannot wait to return.The year is 1895, and it is custom for the most eminent of the upper class to summer in Newport, Rhode Island. This is Deanna Randolphs big year as she is being presented to society with hopes of making an acceptable, and profitable, marriage match. For most of her life it was expected that she would marry her fathers business partners son Joseph and combine the R & W Sugar Refineries families. However, Joseph caused a bit of scandal when he called things off with Deanna and announced that he would not return to New York but stay in Newport to work on his inventions for sugar refining. Though humiliated, if truth be told, Deanna really wishes she could capture a bit more time as a child, with the freedoms that childhood allows.She is looking forward to the first ball of the season and meeting Lord David Manchester, a sugar plantation owner with whom R & W hopes to do business, but is horrified to find Joe in attendance. Things take a dire turn when one of the hosts maids is found crumpled and lifeless at the base of the cliffs during the ball. Did Daisy jump or fall? When it becomes apparent that she was pushed, Joe, who was in the wrong place at the wrong time, becomes the prime suspect. As a member of the upper class, albeit a bit of a black sheep at present, the police surely will not place blame on Joe. The police soon set their sights on Daisys boyfriend, who also happens to be Joes assistant and Deannas ladies maids brother, Orrin. Deanna and Joe call a reluctant truce and set out to prove Orrins, and ultimately Joes, innocence.Ms. Freydont does a great job of taking the reader on a journey through time to the late nineteenth century. Newport provides a lush backdrop with all the glitz and glamour that defined the excess of the Gilded Age. I was captivated by the descriptions of ball gowns, vast ballrooms and mansions, and the mores of the elite. There are also glimpses of the bleaker life of servants below the stairs that are equally interesting. Deannas unconventionally familiar relationship with her ladies maid Elspeth provides some of the most touching moments in the book, and I really like Deanna. Though suppressed by the trappings of what is proper and expected, she does not hesitate to do what she thinks is right and just, conventions be damned. She is wise beyond her year, vivacious, curious, and intelligent. Joe, though offered a bit more freedom as a man, is also confined by what is expected of him, and I love his devil-may-care attitude about it all. He is equally likable, and the interplay between the pair is charming.There is a touch of romance included and the smart writing has a cozy feel to it, but A Gilded Grave is a true historical mystery. There are plenty of well-drawn characters from which to cull suspects, and Ms. Freydont kept me guessing throughout. The final plot twist, which I will not disclose here, came as a surprise yet resolved things nicely. This novel affords a fascinating look at the dark side of the upper class, and I look forward to future adventures with Deanna and Joe. Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT7KWBCR6N17Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4FIA#wasThisHelpful","RT7KWBCR6N17Y","A1D7CDK7HS68NP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D7CDK7HS68NP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brought to you by OBS reviewer JerjenVivian Westfield has returned to Christmas, Colorado to attend a wedding. She has just gotten demoted from her newspaper job and is now the writer of an advice column. To say that she is upset about this would be an understatement. Adding to her problems is the fact that she knows when she returns to Christmas, her best friends will do whatever it takes to get her to move there. And that is so not happening. She also knows that she will see Chance McBride again and this is a bigger problem. She fell in love with him once after being with him for only a short period of time, and then he left her without a backwards glance. It has taken her a long time to get over him, and she is afraid that she really is not.Chance McBride is also returning home to Christmas for the same wedding. He has not been back for a long time, because he cannot bear the memories. Everything in the town reminds him of all that he has lost, his wife and unborn child. He blames himself for their deaths because of a case he was working on and the guilt is overwhelming. Chance knows that he will see Vivian at the wedding and this scares him. She is the first woman since he lost his wife that has made him feel alive again and wondering if he can have another chance at love. And this scares him more than he is willing to admit.When Vivi and Chance meet again (on the plane) the sparks are still there. But so are the feelings of distrust, betrayal and frustration. Vivi has not forgiven Chance for walking away from her and breaking her heart. Chance is not happy to see that she still has the ability to make him want more out of his life. Neither knows how they will survive the time they are together for the wedding.The author is very talented in creating characters that are relatable, likable and lovable. Vivi wants to present to the world the image of a tough, no nonsense kick-butt reporter who can take care of herself. She is all those things, but the reality is that there is definitely a softer more vulnerable side to Vivi. She is loving and caring and loyal. She also has her fears, such as flying and animals (especially Chances little dog, Princess/Cujo) and never finding love. Chance is protective of those he loves and a loyal friend. He will do whatever needs to be done to take care of those he loves. But he can be stubborn and controlling (if it means protecting Vivi) and he carries so much guilt that it almost suffocates him. It was heartwarming reading about their relationship and watching it grow.This book has it all. There is suspense and mystery, humor (the bickering between Chance and Vivi and the interaction between Vivi and Princess had me laughing out loud) and the hope of a second chance at love. I could have read about the interactions between them all day long. The supporting cast of characters were also well rounded and realistic and added a lot to the story. I really enjoyed reading all of the interactions between family and friends. Aunt Nell is quite a character and keeps everyone on their toes.The writing style flows easily and the book is an easy, enjoyable read. The romance is sweet and heartwarming and you can tell how much Chance and Vivi love each other. It is a clean read when it comes to the romance, not steamy but heartfelt. The mystery is carried on throughout much of the book and there were enough twists and turns to keep me guessing. I just kept wanting to read the next chapter to see what was going to happen. I found myself totally immersed in the romance, the mystery, the characters and the drama.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a well written romance that offers so much more. I would give this book more than five stars if I could, thats how much I loved this book.

"The author Ryan Pyle is a great photographer as well as writer. He tells of his adventures in a way that makes you feel like your there. His pictures opens your eyes to a world you never imagined existed. I am a huge fan of his and was very excited to be able to read this book. When it was offered to me free in exchange for a  honest review I was really excited.I was not let down either. I have watched his other works with his brother and their motorcycle treks in India and China was inspiring and a great watch. I watched the whole season at once.The book is the same, I have sat and read it on one sitting.He tells story's in a way that helps you realize you could do this as well. He is not a superman, he is a normal guy that struggles and has a hard time at times like the rest of us. I think that is what makes his stuff so good. He is beside you on this adventure, not beyond your reach.It puts you in a frame of mind that you as well could do this but since your not here is the great story of what happens.If you like nonfiction adventure this book is for you. He even gives you estimates of how much it would cost you to do these journeys. While I do not think I will get to China, it was fun to entertain the notion that I might one day.He just really makes things real to you.Fantastic read and I really recommend this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSB00R5NFJHZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0992864410#wasThisHelpful","RSB00R5NFJHZY","A17BTIFZTFKA33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17BTIFZTFKA33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I received this item free in exchange for an honest review. I did a unboxing to show you what is included in box and how to install battery. I also show a video of it playing a video off the 128 gb micro sd card.  Not all phones read such a large microsd card and that is only part of what makes this phone great. The picture is just really nice on this size screen it is 6'5 inches with resolution at 720 by 1280. It also has great cameras so you have 2 mps and 8 mps which is a lot better than many phones.It comes with 1 gb of ram to run your programs and 8 gbs storage.  When you get the phone its initial storage after system leaves you about 4 gbs on phone so I really recommend using a microsd card with this phone. Also , I would take advantage of the online storage out there that is free such as google drive, drop box, OneDrive and Amazon primes unlimited photo storage to really expand this phone a lot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ41Z05EVO1RM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01617YKCY#wasThisHelpful","RJ41Z05EVO1RM","A17BTIFZTFKA33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17BTIFZTFKA33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have used this tablet about 8 months now. I originally received it free in exchange for a review. However, after I reviewed it, I kept using it up through the current time. Here is my honest opinions of this tablet.  I would not upgrade this to windows 10. This tablet runs great on 8.1 and windows 10 can lag down a much heftier system. Now, I have not tried that with this tablet. I just would not do it based on specs. After using Windows 10 through beta I can say you will not miss much by not having it on this tablet. I have 4 desktops that I built myself. 1 That I just purchased from IBUYPOWER. Windows 10 lags them. I currently am running intel core i5 with 32 gbs ram plus a amd r390 video card with 8 gbs memory hooked up to a 49 inch 4k monitor and it lags me at times,.This tablet is great for what it does. It can read a 128 gb micro sd card. You actually can install to the card and play diablo 3 off of it. It will not get 40 fps. But it is a great option when away from main gaming computers. Also, this tablet plays stream games like Borderland 2. You again will not get high fps, but it is playable in an enjoyable way. When I say that I mean for under $200.00 this will be one of your better options to play a game when away from home.  I have had several laptops that could not even play Diablo 3 or Borderlands. So I was really happy this one actually worked for a bit of gaming as well as work. It also plays Hearthstone.  Did You get the part of it reads a 128 GB Card? That allows me to have a ton of movies on this baby. Plus all my music.I look at this as a entertainment center. I use a usb splitter to hook up a normal size keyboard and mouse. I also can hook up a usb dvd player if needed.Then this becomes a really nice and inexpensive laptop. I personally have no issues with smaller keyboards but my husband does. His fingers needs the normal keyboard and I usually use it out of habit.  I also normally use this tablet while it is plugged in beside desk since I have to have room for keyboard and mouse.  Now for when I take off and go away from home, or want to lay in bed. This tablet is perfect for that. It can hook up to a hdmi moniter. Now, honestly in bed, I do not hook it to one. But, at my desk I do. I like the bigger screen. The problem with a bigger screen is it takes more energy to fill all those pixels. That is why I keep mine plugged in.  I hope your getting the idea how versatile this tablet is and its under $200.00  So far I have covered games ,movies, and music, how bout work? Well it runs and comes free with a year of Office 365. It prints easily if your hooked up to your wifi network. Also, you could add in a lan dongle to get higher speeds if you wanted to for very little investment.I have Amazon Prime, so This works perfectly watching all those free movies. The picture is honestly great.Next thing I want to discuss is weight. I have problems with my hands. I can not hold heavy objects long. My hands will do a ""spock"" on me. With my fingers cramping and drawing to weird positions that I normally could never do if I intentionally tried. So being lightweight is important for when I am laying in bed on tablet/computer. This one does not make my hands as tired as quickly as others I have tried. I can not do a laptop long at all.I also have circulation problems so it is important that I put my feet up at times. So holding this on my lap in the recliner works ok. I do not like laying back and doing this. But, If I have to it really does fit my needs on that point.  The next thing I want to discuss is storage.,This ends up with about 22 gbs free after windows is installed with updates. But it reads a 128 gb microsd card as I have said, but also I use Google drive. Google drive is a storage program that allows you to store 15 more gbs. If you google free online storage your going to find a good bit of programs that allows you to store stuff on the cloud. I also use drop box. Amazon prime allows unlimited photo storage. My main thought here is if you need more you can easily get to about 200-250 gbs of storage or more if you store online as well as on the card plus the internal hard drive.One thing I have not addressed is this actually can take pictures and you can skype on it. It is awkward but convenient to use the camera in it if you have it in your hands. I have only Skyped once and it worked fine and looked ok. So that is all I can say about that.Bottom line, look at this tablet as a entertainment center that is expandable if you think outside of the box. It is extremely versatile and easy to use.Once a beginner learns Windows 8.1 they would love this tablet. On up to someone like me with way to many computers around who still finds it very useful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YVUTR0MM7PJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GZQ1I4#wasThisHelpful","R2YVUTR0MM7PJX","A17BTIFZTFKA33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17BTIFZTFKA33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The best Humane AntiBark Collar of 2015.This is a great bark collar. The sounds goes off all the time when my dog is alerting me by barking.Unfortunately he thinks I need to know when the fly on the wall moves or a flea jumps or a cat meows. You get the picture!I think I need educating on how to make him listen to the beeps. Because so far at first he hesitated now, I think he is barking to make it go off. Great for any dog in the world but mine. And I have not gave up. This is a good product. I just have a stubborn dog. I cut the hair on his neck so he could feel the vibrations. I think it is because I honestly did not intercede and reinforce it with any thing different than me yelling hush.So I plan on keeping working with this product for the next week.#ViBrationCollarUpdate:This is a great product,it does not hurt your dog.I just have a dog that refuses to take a hint. But, after three days he is starting to listen. Now when it goes off, I the alpha leader responds with a loud no as well. He has started shutting up. My ears thanks this collar.

"The worse thing about bath time is the bending over and getting all the cool little toys up. As parents we want our kids to use our imagination and this includes even in the tub. Therefore we all have a multitude of sharks,boats and dolls floating around. It is the one time we get to have our kids not use electronics and use their imagionations. But, my back kills me and my bathroom is small so there is no real storage space for this in their. So that takes time as well putting them up where they are kept.This product stays in the bathtub and it saves your back. You just bend over once and start putting toys into the organizer. Not multiple trips back and forth bending over.Fantastic product to save parents time and effort.I received this item free in exchange for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23IP8782JOU2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SK75OZ6#wasThisHelpful","R23IP8782JOU2Q","A17BTIFZTFKA33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17BTIFZTFKA33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not one to generally sit back for hours and watch tv. However, I started watching this series and did not stop til I had finished the whole season at 3 am this morning. That is just how good this really is.I learned a incredible amount about china. You can tell that this is a story made with love about this country.I had no real idea what china was like. All we ever see is a few stories here and there and generally about negative things.This gave me a real idea of just how varied a place China is and how beautiful. The people they met was very nice and it was good to see that.I felt bad for the mishaps they had, and I was really happy that they turned out ok.I also found it to be really funny at times especially when dealing with the frustrations of getting a GPS in China.It was enlightening to see how motorcycle riders are treated differently.I did not expect that. I always thought most people rode motorcycles in China.

I did not jump in the water to test it at the depths.But, It would be a big help in our murky waters in the lakes around here.The Light turns on through the top turning it tighter or loosening it.I recommend you use the velcro and attach this to your wrist area on top of your hand. You do not want any cords to ever be loose and take a chance on getting it tangled in a guide line.This is shown to be good for diving and I think it would be as long as those precautions are taken.The light itself is very very bright.

"I love this tracker!I have had a fitbit flex for years, but it finally stopped working. I didn't feel like spending the $120 for another one, so I decided to go with a version that wasn't quite as pricey. I am so happy I did!

"This is a beautiful maxi dress!!I have always been a huge fan of maxi dresses and wear them very often. I live in California, so I can wear them in the summer and in the winter. When it's cold I just throw on a cardigan and I'm good! I love that you can dress them up or down depending on the occasion and it is really easy.This dress is gorgeous and so comfortable! It is made of a very light chiffon material, but is not see through because it comes with an under layer of fabric. It has a super cute bow that you can tie in the front that gives a little decoration to your chest, and is fitted around the waist to give your body really nice shape. The only thing that I have to say that is negative is, it was really long on me. I'm 5'2 so it didn't really come as too much of a surprise as most dresses are really long on me, but that is something to consider if you are short and wanting to wear this with sandals.

It comes with a string that your child can hold on to an pull around the floor, and the toy lights up and makes sounds to go along with it!

"I love these nail clippers!!!I always pay to take my four dogs to the groomers to get their nails clipped. I have heard so many horror stories about people cutting the nail too much and making the dogs bleed, and since my dogs are all pretty squirmy, and two of them are huge (husky and pitbull) I have always been way too afraid to do it myself.I finally got sick of paying $15 per dog to get their nails trimmed every month, and decided to just try it out.

"I love to cook and bake, so I have really needed a good utensil set. I have always purchased whatever was cheapest at target, but after receiving these, I will never do that again. This set is AMAZING. Not only is the quality fantastic, the set comes with literally everything that you could ever need to cook or bake with, and they can be used on non-stick pans safely!!The best part about this set is the stainless steel stand that it comes with. I really love having my utensils displayed on the counter for easier access and these are so beautiful, they deserve to be out and not stuffed in a drawer somewhere! This would also make a fantastic gift for someone who loves to cook and likes colorful things.It was delivered very quickly and was packaged perfectly.

"I love this tracker!I have had a fitbit flex for years, but it finally stopped working. I didn't feel like spending the $120 for another one, so I decided to go with a version that wasn't quite as pricey. I am so happy I did! This tracker actually does a better job of tracking my sleep, movement, general activity, than the fitbit flex. I have tested this a few times with my friends who have a fitbit.The battery lasts for a really long time and it charges really fast when you do need to charge it, so you can get it back on as soon as possible. It displays the time, your calories burned, your steps, and distance! I found it to encourage me to get moving even more! I love everything about this except for the fact that it isn't waterproof. That seems to be the only downer in my opinion because it cant track swimming and you can't shower with it on.

"The benefits of having fruit infused water are wonderful, and this bottle gives you that without the messy pulp that you would normally get with a regular bottle. Its extremely well made, and very durable. The spout that you drink out of is my favorite part. I constantly have issue with the mouth being way too wide and awkward with other bottles, but this one resembles a sports bottle that I really love. I love that it is glass so you know it doesn't have all of the disgusting chemicals that cheap plastic bottles have!Its super cute and even has a handle and sleeve, which is really awesome if you take it to places like the gym!My favorite fruits to use are strawberries and kiwi because I found that they last throughout the whole day if you are filling up your bottle constantly, and they give you the most flavor too. I also add a few drops of lemon juice to it in the morning and it tastes great with any fruit that I choose to use!I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"This is the perfect massage stick for those who workout!!I workout 5-6 days a week and often take classes that challenge my body. Even though I am used to working out, my muscles get super sore after being worked in ways that I am not used to. I often find myself rubbing my thighs, or begging my boyfriend to give me a massage because of how tight my muscles are.I read about massage sticks in a health and fitness magazine and decided to give it a try. The first time I used it was the night after I did a body combat class that killed my muscles (in and good and bad way.) I took a hot shower and when I got out, I rolled the massage stick across my thigh muscles. It felt SOOO good. It hurt, but it was the kind of pain that you enjoy because you know how much better you will feel after.

The first thing I noticed was the amazing packaging. The seller really does a fantastic job of making sure it is packaged as best as possible.

"I LOVEEEEE this wax. I'm not ashamed to admit that I have hair in unwanted areas as most of us do. I'm only 27 but I am already getting the dreaded chin hairs that we see on older ladies, so of course those are the first that I tackle when it comes to grooming.I'm naturally blonde, and although much of my hair that grows on my face is medium to light brown, there are still the annoying hairs that you can only see in natural light, and since I don't really feel like sitting out on my porch with a pair of tweezers, waxing is definitely the way to go.I love that this wax removal kit is gentle enough for sensitive skin like mine, but it also strong enough to get rid of the annoying thicker hairs, especially around your bikini line.

"These headphones are amazing!! I always wear headphones whenever I am working out, walking the dogs, or just cleaning my house. I always struggle with my regular headphones because the wires get tangled and take forever to separate, or they end up getting caught on things and the headphones get yanked out of my ears... I can't even tell you how many times that has happened!!These headphones have saved me from so much headache! They are wireless so you don't have to worry about the tangled mess or them getting caught on anything, and they are Bluetooth so they can easily connect to your phone, ipod, or whatever device that you use to listen to music that is Bluetooth compatible. These are especially comfortable to wear if you are a runner. They don't move around or get in the way of anything, or fall out of your ears while you are moving!The ear pieces are VERY comfortable. I have smaller ear holes, so I am always dealing with headphones that are too large and I end up with sore ears from trying to stuff the headphones in, but I don't have that issue with these at all. I can wear them for hours without worrying about them falling out, which is super convenient!Another great quality about these headphones is they cancel out all of the outside noise... kids, pets, boyfriends, wives... you don't have to hear anything when you have these on! Just pop them in and you can enjoy your music without any worries or interruptions!

"The sweatpants are fantastic!!!When I first ordered them I thought they would be just like regular sweatpants that I would buy at Walmart or Target, but the quality is SO much better than I expected.When I first received them, they came wrapped in plastic which was really awesome because it made sure they arrived in perfect condition. Once I opened the plastic, I noticed the quality of the fabric right away. It is thick fabric, but not too think, so you could wear these in the fall as well as in the winter without overheating. I actually got these to wear to the gym while I workout. I love how comfortable they are and how form fitting they are. They don't feel to big or ""baggy"" like many other sweatpants, and the elastic and drawstring make it easy to adjust to your waist size and comfort.They are fitted at the bottoms so you don't have to worry about them getting caught on your shoes, or hanging over and stepping on them like many other pants. They are made of mostly cotton, so they did slightly shrink in the washer and dryer even though I did it on very low heat. I expected it, so I ordered a large instead of a medium which is what I usually wear, so they still fit me perfectly and comfortably!I definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for a high quality pair of sweats to wear to lounge around the house or wear to class or the gym!

"First off, I love how easy these are to clean. It's not huge and doesn't cover up a ridiculous amount of the back seat, it's perfect size to go underneath the car seat. And if you have one of these, you know that you needed in order to keep your car seat from being stained and or dented.As much as we love our nieces nephews sons and daughters, having the dent in the seat when they grow out of the car seat is not necessarily what I would consider a good option. Having this seat protector, is.This is a great idea, whoever came up with it is perfectly genius, and I absolutely love how is designed, and that you get to put whatever else you decide to carry into the two front pockets of it.

LolBut I am comfortable enough to tell you what my results have been. I didn't think that I had tired skin no I drink a whole lot of water every single day, I don't drink sodas. My skin is always been pretty average to me, but after using this for a while, I can swear by the fact that my skin is better!Using a dry brush was a little weird to me at first, and the first time that I used it I was a little uncomfortable, but it didn't hurt, it was kind of like you better back scratcher, and it felt really good and relaxing. Getting the dead skin cells off wasn't something that I had ever even thought about. Helping my blood circulation so that my skin could rejuvenate itself was also not something that I had ever thought about before. I really wish somebody would have told me this before. My skin is absolutely glowing now.Do after using this for a while, I definitely notice the difference, especially when I'm putting moisturizer on or lotion on my body. My skin just feels better, it looks better, it looks and healthier, and I have been telling everyone about dry brushing out. This is really simple to keep clean, & I can get on one of the hooks in my shower. I love it and can't see myself ever not doing this.I received this for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F1OCLYQVBR1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013F2K5PO#wasThisHelpful","R2F1OCLYQVBR1D","A3E81J4EKDY96H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E81J4EKDY96H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great metallic temporary tattoos set. Whenever I have my tan going on, I love the cold against my skin tone. Whenever I don't have my tan, the silver is absolutely stunning. I think I'll save those for later on in the year though.There is a sheet of completely different tattoos, and each sheet has something different on it. So it's not like you're getting a repetitive task, which is really annoying. I like that I'm able to change it up anytime or as much as I want to, especially considering that there are over a hundred tattoos in this set.These are super easy to put on, and even if you go to the beach or to the pool, it doesn't just come off. I really like that it only takes me maybe a minute to put this all on, and if I don't mess with it, then it can stay on for up to 6 days. I think that for the price, definitely getting my money's worth.These are absolutely beautiful and stunning, I love being able to have different choices and options, so I would tell anyone who was looking for the metallic temporary tattoos that these are the ones that you should definitely get.I received these for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE22IOIW1ZZ9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010SWOMUS#wasThisHelpful","RE22IOIW1ZZ9S","A3E81J4EKDY96H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E81J4EKDY96H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love this Shea butter! I use Shea butter to make soaps and homemade lotions and body butter, so I have definitely tried many different brands. This is honestly my favorite because of the quality. It's is organic and raw, and very fresh. The way the company packages it is the way every company should. I have ordered others that were delivered in small boxes without any type of protective wrapping, or anything to keep it fresh. This Shea butter comes as a block in thick wrapping that seems to really do a great job of maintaining the quality.I used this over the weekend to make a whipped body butter along with some organic coconut oil and a few drops of lavender essential oil. The smell is amazing, and my skin absorbs it so nicely without feeling greasy or heavy, especially since it is still summertime here in California, and gets really hot.The benefits of Shea butter on your skin are absolutely amazing, and I would definitely recommend this company to anybody who is looking for a high quality product!I received this at a discount for an honest and unbiased review.

"Cop carI didn't know how much fun a bump n go could be until I saw my nephew chasing after this like a little chicken with his head cut off. It was the most adorable thing I've ever seen!!!Every time this would hit a piece of furniture or the wall, and still keep going he would laugh like only a little kid could. He's usually all over the place when it comes to paying but this one will keep his attention, I think it's the fact to that it transforms all by itself or maybe it's the lights that flash!There's no way to tell why he keeps playing with it and it doesn't really matter. What matters is that he loves it, he's happy, and it's a really cool toy.The sounds that come out of this R surprisingly realistic, he hasn't quite gotten the voice command yet, and even though I don't like the sound of the gunfire, he does. I think that's a boy thing.My favorite part is that it turns into a bear. A bionic bear but still a cute bear.  How a cop car can transform into a bear is beyond me but it's super cute and I like it enough to watch my nephew play with it. It's not so loud that it's annoying, even after 30 minutes. Which is odd because usually toys that make a lot of noise or even noise that's constant will drive me crazy. My sister doesn't seem to mind it but she's used to it.I think it's a great gift and I'm glad he loves it as much as he does.I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JT9IBAISVO92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZDBL1BS#wasThisHelpful","R2JT9IBAISVO92","A3E81J4EKDY96H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E81J4EKDY96H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FiretruckHave 3 triple A batteries on hand because  you need them in order for this to Light up! As soon as you put the batteries in, there's a power switch that turns this on and be prepared because it's LOUD.  Which is great for keeping little ones interested it.This fire truck is really cute, and seems to be well made and it's going to hold up against little ones destructive manners. I only say that because I know that my nephew is pretty rough with his toys, and this one has lasted.It moves on its own, and whenever it hits a wall it just bounces off of it and keeps moving. Which is kind of cool because it makes my nephew chase after it which is adorable to watch. And it makes for the perfect nap time. He can play with this for hours if we let him, and it really neat that the top part will turn. It has a few phrases and it will the really bright, so be prepared for that also.

"I hate clutter and all things messy when it comes to the cords from my computer monitors to my printers to my mouse to my keyboard- you get the point. I hate how it looks so messy behind any desk, or even my tv. I LOVE these sleeves. Not only do they hide the mess by they keep my cat from temptation (he like to swat at the swinging ones). My mouse is rarely ever on the floor anymore! So great! I also love that my cords no longer get tangled into a web of mess. Before, when I would need to restart my router, I would have to search a knot of messy cords. Now I can easily find which one belongs to the router and unplug it to reset. You get a bunch in this packet of sleeves and I couldn't be more pleased. Oh, and don't let me forget to mention they are very large! They can handle the biggest bunch of cords, I'm sure!

"oliating bars. Like a lot. Most recently I used Biores charcoal bar but it tore my face all up because the exfoliators were so hard. So M, in my ever growing quest to go all natural undecided to try this bar and OMG was it fantastic. The bar is gentle and yet leaves your skin exfoliated. Some natural brands don't leave that squeaky clean feeling and while I knew my face was clean it just didn't feel clean, ya know? This bar is not like that. You can feel the deep clean and I absolutely love that because you want to feel clean after you've washed, don't you?

"Wonderful aid to blocking and possibly help healing.  I had been having knee problems due to injury and tried various options.  I tried truMedic TENS Unit Electronic Pulse Massager (I have two of them).  They work about the same, however this small tens unit from OTC HealthmateForever is better, though a bit more in cost.  I went with the cheaper unit before.  I was happy with it.  But it only runs for about 15 minutes, then you have to through resetting it all over again.  Not a big thing, but that means I have to set it four times in an hour. Distracting.  Also, the other unit was plug in model that doesn't allow you to move about with it.  This tens unit is very compact, less than the size of a credit card, very light weight and the cords are very long.  I can put the leads on my knee, run the cord up the inside of my jeans, and use it all day long.  This unit charged on a cord.  You take it off when fully charged.  You can set it for one hour at a time, with 8 different options.  You can set the strength of the options from weak to VERY strong.  I put this on, run the cord up the inside of my clothing and can go about various activities, shopping, vacuuming...whatever, and then tens is blocking the pain as I move about.  Once it's run, you can reset it, and reset it.  It last me close to 8 hours on a charge, and is running nearly continuously for the 8 hours.  The pack is so small and light weight, I just tuck it in inside my jeans pocket and go.  When I am walking or driving, I get superior pain blocking from this item, with 1/4 the resets, and the ability to go anywhere.Just be careful -- if you remove one lead while it's on, the power doubles to the remaining lead.  I accidentally tugged the cord on one side and instantly the power doubled the other and was uncomfortable!!Since I had the two other units already, I shied away from buying this one.  A friend kept insisting I get this one, and when I didn't she gave me one she had bought for another friend.  Blessing for good friends for this is amazing little product that helps me so much.  If you are choosing between this model and less costly version -- you pay for what you get -- this is WORTH the difference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP5GB28QP7NHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BTD5Y9E#wasThisHelpful","RP5GB28QP7NHW","A3GQKB1KF0CRPE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am battling knee problems with damage and injury, and it's causing my right knee not straighten fully when I walk.  It's putting heavy pressure on my big toe.  Since I broke the second two last year it tends to lean toward the big toe and bruise the side.  It's actually getting more painful than the knee pain...lol.  I have been wearing toed socks and they help, but I end up taping second toe and third together, trying to keep it from slamming into the big toe.  I have tried several toe spreaders, but nothing is helping the big toe.  Until I tried these.  Wow, what comfort.  I was running around without flinching with each step.I would recommend you work up to wearing them all day.  Maybe 2 hours a day for a week, then increase to four.

"The assortment show isn't quite right.  There are a lot of duplicates, but whatever.  They are comfortably made, separating toes.  I have been experiencing a problem of my second toe starting to crash in to the side of the big toe and cause bruising.  This doesn't totally stop that, but it's been a big aid in controlling the problem.Easy to get on, and they stay on.  The are comfortable to where I don't notice I am wearing toed socks.  So many of the footies just won't stay on.  This is made with a special heel grabber, that catches the footie and keeps it in place.  Quite unexpected in a sock of this price range.  I end up tossing footies away because they keep sliding off my heel.  These do not.  Plenty big.  Again many footies tend to be stingy in material.  These cover my toes and heels they way they should.At this price I expected less quality, frankly.

"I have indoor cats that never go out, but I had to take in a mother and two kittens last winter.  I kept them safe in the carport room through winter, but come Spring they left that home and moved onto my porch.  They refuse to go back.  With winter coming on, I had to do something.  I bought this because of the features.  I put it where they could check it out all summer.  They ignored it.  But the other night it was chilly.  I put a heated blanket in there with a bunch of catnip.  The nip got them in there, the heat kept them inside.  Now, every evening all three go into their igloo and sleep until daylight.  They love it.  It's plenty room for three grown cats.  It's dry against rain, insulated.  They can sit close to the opening and have plenty of fresh air.

"I really hated to see this book come out with all the hyper and noise.  It made me really scared to read the book.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a first book for Lee, and all like all new authors, she is finding her voice.  The beginning is pretty rocky, but she finds more assurance as she goes along.  Ignore what you have heard, read the book with understanding it was a first book, also keep in mind today's politically correct mindset, was different then.  A good measure of how we have grown and attitudes have (hopefully) changed.  Just read it for yourself.***** Be warned *****  my view of Go Set A Watchman contains SPOILERS, but I couldnt see how to express my thoughts without touching on a few points (many already discussed in the countless reviews before the book hit the shelves).I finished Go Set a Watchman this morning and have so many thoughts about the novel.  For one, I think the media flap over Atticus being less than a paragon was hardly more than the publisher sending out PR stories to up their sales.  At some point they took a look and saw presales were not hitting the big money mark that they had greedily anticipated, so they set out to create a mountain out of a molehill; with the help of a few reviews of outrage, they fueled the sensationalism-hungry media and social networks, the pursuing flap drove everyone out to buy it to see for themselves.  Well, perhaps there is a lesson there  never truly judge a book by its cover  or rather, we need to pay smaller heed to the fray and just read it for yourself.  You might be surprised.  I was.I went in to buying the book feeling concern for Harper Lee.  Had she been taken advantage of?  Did she even pen the book?  Some of the circumstances of the finding of the novel have been called into question by various sources.  This came on the heels of Lee having to sue to get her rights for To Kill A Mockingbird back from the nephew of her former agent, that she had been duped into signing them away, even an investigation into concerns of abuse of the beloved author, who had trouble seeing and hearing and no champion to protect her.  It was a murky whirlpool of speculation that saw the book making it into print.  I know one thing without a doubt  Go Set A Watchman was penned by Harper Lee.  The book is hers.  Unpolished in places and dealing with a period of growth for the nation, it wasnt a pretty picture she painted, but it was an honest one from her stand point and typical for the era.  But beneath the shaky start to the book, you hear Lees beautiful prose ringing clear, especially when you go through the flashbacks of Jem, Dill and Atticus.There is a tendency to see this book as a sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird.  It begins with a grown up Jean-Louise Finch returning home for her annual visit to Maycomb, Mississippi.  Atticus is now aging, nearly eighty-years-old, and fighting to retain his pride though crippled with rheumatoid arthritis.  He needs Jean-Louise home, but is too proud to ask her.  Instead, his sister (which we met in To Kill A Mockingbird) is there to help him through his everyday life.  Jem is gone, lost to a sudden heart attack  the same thing that had claimed their mother when Jean-Louise was too young to recall.  You have a sense throughout the whole story that Scout hasnt truly grieved over the loss of her hero brother, hasnt been able to let him go.  It gives you a sense that he is still alive for her, as long as she keeps him locked in the cocoon of childhood memories.  Dill is spoken of, but never plays a role in the book outside of flashbacks.  You sense a detachment from her beloved childhood friend, which mirrors Harper Lees own estrangement from Truman Capote (the model for Charles Baker Harris).  And beloved Calpurnia, who served as mother to Jean-Louise, is now retired.  Their reunion is bittersweet and tears at the heart.  Other characters from To Kill A Mockingbird are scattered about, lending an instant familiarity, but their roles are changed in various ways.  Walter Cunningham, who got her in trouble with that dumb lady teacher, is no longer that poor little boy who pours molasses all over his plate, the son of the man who works off his entailment by bringing nuts to the Finch house early in the morn  the only form of payment he can afford.  Instead, Walter owns the Maycomb ice cream parlor, built on the land where Scouts old home once stood.In the first few chapters you hear a young writer struggling to find her voice.  The first three have a flat, detached feel to them, almost another voice, almost like Lee was trying to sound like an author rather than be one.  The harder she tried the farther she got away from her own natural magic.  Other times, shes dead on target and straight from her heart.  As the book progresses you are treated to remembrances of Jem, Dill and Atticus.  Oddly enough, there is no mention of Boo Radley.  There is a mention of a trial, an echo of Tom Robinsons, but this young black man, accused of rape by a white woman, lost his arm to the sawmill instead of the cotton gin, and this time Atticus saw him acquitted.  Seeds planted that would come full force and be the center of Atticus great journey in To Kill a Mockingbird.  All these changes see Watchman a sequel, and yet not truly a sequel.You quickly sense there are two voices struggling within the character  Jean-Louise in the present, but also Scout who never truly went away.  She has moved to New York, tried to be worldlier.  Instead, she just put a veneer over the shy, tomboy that never quite fit in.  Its that duality of the book, which took a few chapters for Harper Lee to master.  Through the unfolding of the story, we learn Jean-Louise is really just Scout in an adults skin.  Its the battle between who she thinks she is, and who she truly is that causes most of her misery.  She still sees the town and Atticus through Scouts eyes.  Following Scouts recollections as she grew we learn, while horribly bright and encouraged to read about everything, she is quite backward about life in general  terrified she is dying when her first period comes, which evolved later into nearly nine months of wretchedness after she mistakenly thinks shes pregnant from French kissing Walter Cunningham.  Currently, she loves Henry, the boy next door, but shes not in love with him.  In many ways the young man, best friend to Jem, has stepped into Jems shoes for Atticus.  What to do?  She hates the town she grew up in with a passion, yet loves it and wants to cling to the past with equal measure.  Shes horrified Atticus could have ever attended a KKK meeting, but in Jean-Louises simplified view of life, there are no grays.  It never occurs to her Atticus was a man who moved through Maycomb, handled legal matters, dealt with judges, lawyers, politicians and businessmen, and it was vital for him to know which ones hid behind a mask.  Scotland has a saying, you hold your friends close, and your enemies closer.  Atticus was merely following that sage adage.  However, Jean-Louise cannot see beyond the surface, only that Atticus had done something that went against everything she believed he was.As we grow our perceptions of the world changes.  We learn, accept, reject and are changed by the various trials and tribulations.  Jean-Louise didnt change.  She was still Scout inside, still clinging to her childish views of life, her hometown and the people she loved.  Much like Lee herself.Go Set a Watchman is a worthy companion to the later To Kill a Mockingbird.  Its different in many ways.  Its a first book of an author, and showcases the shining talent of that writer finding her way, of becoming a wordsmith that would go on to turn out a masterpiece.  I think its an example, showing any author how to take their novel and go back and do second, third or fourth drafts to take a good story and make it something special.  Some of the writing, where Jean-Louise is examining the views on race relations of the period, Lee wanders between a Joan of Arc mentality to mounting a very preachy soapbox.  Much can and will likely be made of her simplistic views of the period, of good and evil, of the towns resistance to the coming end to segregation.  For those too young to recall the ugly face of history, you will probably judge the book harsher than those of you who lived through the upheavals and changes and understand the complexities first hand.Frankly, I was scared to read the book after all the hoopla in the media.  I so loved To Kill a Mockingbird that I feared this book would destroy that love somehow.  She says Maycomb had once been told it had nothing to fear but fear itself.  I supposed I should have recalled that line.  In the end, I laughed, I cried, and I was sad when the book ended.  And extremely sad such a wonderful, wonderful writer never penned more books for the world to enjoy.  I loved this book almost as much as I do To Kill A Mockingbird.  Harper Lee has said she is Boo.  The summer we started so long ago has ended and Boo has finally come out.  When considering this book one needs to recall what Lee wrote about Atticus saying never judge someone until youve climbed into his shoes and walked around in them.  That is good advice about reading Go Set a Watchman.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PABS5J1PPVHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062409859#wasThisHelpful","R2PABS5J1PPVHV","A3GQKB1KF0CRPE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my FAVORITE shoe for walking.  Have bought this brand and style for two years.  However, the shoddy workmanship this year is really turning me sour on them.  I seriously buy about six pairs a year (or more), so what I am seeing is not just one pair.  I have worn the same size for two years, have a dozen pairs.  I have purchases 5 pairs this year and each one had flaws.  One pair the heel was 1/2 inch shorter in the back causing the heel to slid up and down and rub a blister.  Two pair were too narrow, wore, the vamp of the shoe was nearly 1/2 inch or more shorter.  I bought two more pairs a half a size bigger, and they came in SHORTER than the first batch.  The padding in the front is thinner.  It hurts my metatarsal bone in my right foot, because there isn't enough shock absorbed.  And strangely enough, the show strings are too short.  You cannot tie them in a bow!!  I see so many corners cut in the quality from a pair two years ago compared to this years crop.  DO NOT buy them mail order, but go try them on.

"I have been using KT tapes since last December, when my Physical Therapist used it to stabilize my kneecap injured in an accident.  I cannot say how much how it helps with stability without the problems of sports tape (allergy) or ACE bandages (too tight, too loose, wrapping slips constantly.  I am not having any allergy problems with KT.  I get superior support, easing my pain.  You DO need to learn how to apply them, cut and trim them etc.  That said, once you get the knack you will love this aid.  Gives me support, stabilization (love it more than Tommy Copper).However all KT tapes are NOT the same.  If you opt for cheaper ones, you won't get the long lasting results or the needed support.  Beast is tops, but ARES compares very well with it.  It feels slightly lighter in fabric, but I found it to be very long lasting (5-7 days easily for me - be sure to dap at the tapes after showering - do not rub).

"I recently bought one that is auto-pedal.  I am going through Physical Therapy and want the motion with no stress on my knee joints.  I really like it with the minor reservation of it being light to where it scoots across the floor away from me when I am sitting on the sofa.  I am used to walking 3-7 miles per day, but haven't been able to do that with the knee injuries.  My friend Candy walks with me, so she is unable to walk while I am on the side like.  She tried mine, and loved it -- same problem of it scooting though.  I decided to buy her one so she wouldn't miss out on her exercise.  However, since she didn't need the auto option, I looked at a similar model without the electric go....lol.  This one looked really good.I bought it on Amazon Prime with two day ship, but it came the next day.  It was very easy for me to put it together for her.  The pedals screw into the bar easily and had it's own wrench to tighten them down.  The bottom strands, again, were very easy to put in.  Allen wrench is provided.  Within a minute, it was done and ready to use.  It's heavier than my version, so it stays in place.  She absolutely loves it.  She can crochet and pedal at the same time to her hearts content.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19ICWY7SXBOLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SZO6WU#wasThisHelpful","R19ICWY7SXBOLQ","A3GQKB1KF0CRPE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cannot believe what this tape does.  The stuff is a miracle.  My Physical Therapist has been using them on my knees and I cannot believe how good it works.  You MUST learn to apply it properly, learn to round the corners.  This company gives you an e-book with purchase.  Read it.  You simply cannot just slap it nilly willy and get the correct results.  Once you learn, and you see the immediately protection and pain relief, you will be kicking yourself for not using this before.  I am getting PT on my right leg, which they were wrapping.  Only my left began to grow even worse in pain.  So I wrapped it myself, and instantly the pain stopped.  We are talking level 9 pain, and it just quit.  The roll will give you 3-5 cushion wraps around your knee (this is double tape on each side of the knee cap.  If don't right, they generally last me 5-7 days.  You must be careful when showering (I wouldn't recommend soaking in a tub).  Pat the tap dry - do not rub.  You have no bulk or slippage as with ACE bandages.  Way better than any type of sports take out there.  Great for walkers or runners, great for people with arthritis or muscle strains.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYRCQUWI0GO68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M286JYE#wasThisHelpful","RYRCQUWI0GO68","A3GQKB1KF0CRPE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Absolutely love these!!  I am going through rough spot with my knees after several accidents this summer.  I have been going to Physical Therapy and part of that is heat packs for my knee.  I am having problems convincing them it's BOTH knees...lol.  So I decided to get my own heat packs.  These looked study enough.  I wanted something heavy and big that would wrap completely around my knee.  They do that, so it's a cushion for your knee plus having the heat wrapped around the whole leg.  2-3 minutes zap in the microwave will give me half hour of good solid heat.  Feels like heaven to the joints.I saw a complaint about the buckwheat shifting or not being even.  Well, it can shift.  Anyone who has had a buckwheat pillow will not what you are dealing with.  You just shake the filling back into place.  The covers come off so they can be washed.  They also can be used for cold packs, though I haven't tried this as yet.  My target is good heat.  I think they provide heat as well as the Physical Therapy ones, maybe even better.I cannot be more pleased with the results, the size, the quality of the wrap, or how they work for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FDRN3WRPQRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0061NOU0Q#wasThisHelpful","R3FDRN3WRPQRY","A3GQKB1KF0CRPE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I mostly bought this to stop two cats from play pattycake under the door.  Mouse nearly put out Boots eye when he was peaking under, so I assumed this would be a good solution.  No one could see under the door, so no more pattycake.  WRONG.  Boots hated he couldn't see under the door and about drove me NUTS pulling it under the door.

It is a heated carport room, but the draft was blowing like crazy.  I needed to stop the draft.  I recalled I had bought it for Boots and went to get it.

"the concept of these hoses are great.  Contract to nothing that is easily stored, expand with water pressure.  THERE the good ends.  I have bought two different sets of these - the original green ones and two of the blue ones.  Of the four, two have the inner rubber lining explode from water pressure.  One had the inner rubber lining pull away from the attachment fitting.  They never contracted as good as they said.  If they could make one that is quality that will live up to what the promise, then you will have a good hose.  Unfortunately, so far they are junk.

"I love the features of this pedometer.  I walk nearly every day, and love to keep track how far.  I just start this at the beginning of the walk and it tracks it, gives me distance, calories burned and how many steps.  Easy to use.  However, it seems to 'hang' giving you inaccurate readings.  I can walk the same route and get 4 different distances walked.  Sometimes it crashes or just stops working.  It was free version, so perhaps the paid version works well.

" 4:04 Mins I had actually been looking for one of these and they happened to reach out to have me do a review.  I immediately liked the shape, compact design and faux wood look when I saw it in person.  The lid easily comes off to add the water and oils making it simple to refill and use.Included is a measuring cup as well as a marking on the side of the water tank itself. They make it so you cannot make a mistake there.  I added a few drops of different types of oils over the test and enjoyed the quiet function of the unit as well as the lights.  You can choose a mode to cycle through the lights, pick a specific color or even shut the lights off entirely.They built in auto shutoff capabilities when the tank runs low making this perfect for filling the room at night with a relaxing scent and falling asleep with no worries. It is also great to run after cooking and before guests arrive.We did try this is varying sized rooms and found that mid sized rooms were best.  Large open air design rooms never got enough scent pushed into them.  While small hall bathrooms it became too much. You cannot adjust how much flows out of the unit, just when it is on or off.

" 2:33 Mins I was hesitant when thinking this would be useful or work as advertised.  This doorknob just makes life simpler.  The ability to work with the door when your hands are full by bumping the handle, pulling the handle or using it regularly makes you frustrated when you get to other standard doorknobs that do not have the same feature.We installed this between the kitchen and laundry room first and found carrying clothes or coming in from the garage to the kitchen with groceries was so simple.  Even normal usage of twisting the knob works great.  Installation was simple and took less than 30 minutes.  They send multiple size fitting in the box for most any door.  You just need a couple screwdrivers and you are on your way.  I changed out the knob, latch and lock portion without any other tools.When I moved this to a storage room door I found myself bumping into the door to the laundry room expecting to hit it with my hip and it not opening.  I am eager to get the other ones I ordered to place them around the house on doors where you tend to carry items.NOTE: this is not made for doors on the outside of your home. It does have interior locking but not a key feature.  See the the other models made by Brinks that are made for the outside with the same feature.- The video and the enclosed instructions make it so simple- It fits standard 1 3/8 and 1 3/4 width doors.- It fits both 2 3/8 and 2 3/4 backsets- Installs in about 30 minues- It is an interior door only with no key lock but the pin hole on other side to openSee the video for unboxing and enclosed parts.  Then see the above videos from Brinks themselves on installation and how cool it works! We didn't feel the need to recreate that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5IFSSPJIXUZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYRR6U2#wasThisHelpful","R5IFSSPJIXUZB","A2YT5IO3DKN3AN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YT5IO3DKN3AN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:09 Mins See the video for the unboxing and moreWe were eager to get a new mixer for the kitchen and this was a good option since it included a couple bowls and attachments.  The weight of the unit makes it sturdy on the counter while it operates.  We were lucky and got all the feet on the both unlike some reviewers.  We tested this with liquid and heavier fought and did find vibration on the heavier ones at medium and higher speeds.We really enjoyed the slider on the front bottom to move the bowl around so we could add ingredients. Also the rotation of the bowl also made quick work of scraping the sides as it mixed.  We do wish the power cord was a bit longer.The attachment eject button worked each time and was easy to use being located on top.  The side button that tilted the head back into a lock position made getting the bowl in and out and removing the mixer tools simple.Other features were:Variable bowl speedOff center head and beatersBowl selector12 speed control dialTwo sizes of stainless steel mixing bowlsDie-cast metal bodyChrome steel dough hooksregular beatersWhisksOverall this is worth having in the kitchen and the value.

"The first thing we noticed was the length of the rope.  At over 9ft it should be great for taller people. The ease of adjustment makes it a winner for everyone.  You can unscrew the end cap on one of the handles and simply untie the knot, resize and tie again.  You can either cut off the execs cord or  fold up extra and retie it to make it expandable again.  If you need to keep all the length then unscrew each end, untie the knots, center it to desired length and retie and tuck the cord.  That way you keep the extension as someone grows into it.We did find that it was a little light in weight compared to some others making you pull it down in the back swing part. The cord could be a bit heavier.  We cheated and placed a couple small ring weights on it between knots and that solved the issue.The foam handle was nice but I can see that wearing out eventually.  Not a huge deal for the price.Overall we will get good usage out of this. Make sure to check out all the colors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QEHESYVW251K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7VE2BE#wasThisHelpful","R2QEHESYVW251K","A2YT5IO3DKN3AN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YT5IO3DKN3AN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:32 Mins I admit to being a person that would often wear foam earplugs at loud events to be cheap and better protect my ears.  I am glad I was able to wear these. I now carry them everyday and use them at least once a day.  The DUBS help filter out that loud and harsh middle range of sound while still allowing me to hear easily.  They are wearable for long periods of time without driving my crazy like most other in ear plugs do.I successfully wore these at clubs, concerts, the office, home, outside and even a mall.  I was curious to learn how much extra noise we actually pick up everyday and it is amazingly different.  Now these definitely do not totally protect your hearing. They are not designed for that so I would not list that as a con. They are made to help filter and protect your ears while being more discreet.It was interesting on the discreet portion as they do fit well as we show in the video. Yet everyone still wanted to know what they were based on the look. I let some people sample them and they were online either bookmarking or buying right then and there after seeing the price point.CONS:- I wish they had more than one size- The carrying case could be smallerIn the video we talk more about the usage test and experiences and show the DUBS from unpacking to trying them on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10CGI1LQ5YI05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YRNK056#wasThisHelpful","R10CGI1LQ5YI05","A2YT5IO3DKN3AN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YT5IO3DKN3AN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:25 Mins We ar pleased with this car smartphone holder from Getron. they sent it over for review and we put it to use right away on the dashboard and windshield.  We prefer the windshield more than the dashboard for sure.  It stuck longer and more secure there.  WE test this live in the video with an iPhone 5S and a Samsung Galaxy S6 (with case). Both fit well and exposed the underneath ports for charging as needed.Always use the side button to one and close the ratcheting brackets.  We pulled it open once without and found that it was stuck until we played with the side button.  We show this in the video. Otherwise it held the phones securely in place, even upside down on the windshield.The suction cup worked well and help in the heat. We had minor issues on textured or dusty dashboards as expected.

" 2:06 Mins We instantly liked the weight of the neck pouch from Landing Gear.  The nylon made it breathable and easy to wear.  the strap was luckily not the thin nylon but more like a flat shoestring.  The top velcro has an inner mesh separator that helps keep documents. There is a clear front slot that I do not see anyone really putting anything in as it does not seal at the top.  There are two side zippers allowing you to easily put things in and take out with a simple sliding motion.There is really only two things we wish it had to give it a perfect 5 star.  A headphone cable slot to let me keep my phone or player fully enclosed in the zipper sides.  Also something to help close or seal the clear plastic card holder on the front.We liked how breathable the material felt and could see someone wearing this under their clothes or jacket to keep travel info or daily things close.

Not a problem if you are not planning to run on wet surfaces, but I would still be concerned about the shoes' durability.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XXWV9KIWNLFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEYSUIM#wasThisHelpful","R2XXWV9KIWNLFO","AQMQI5K7MNW76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMQI5K7MNW76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I learned of ""Living the High Life in Minsk"" from an October 2015 article in ""Nasha Niva"" newspaper, which mentioned ""High Life"" getting a prize as the year's best foreign book about Belarus at a Belarusian-studies conference. I googled the award's short-list and was surprised to find Per Rudling's remarkable ""Rise and Fall of Belarusian Nationalism"" among the non-winners. ""So this book was selected over Rudling's?"", I thought, and clicked ""Buy"".A week later, I wonder if the award committee's thinking featured a ""currency premium"": ""High Life"" was one of only two entries dealing with recent Belarusian history, vs. WWII-and-earlier. On one hand, I see a first-ever history of Belarus-Russia negotiations on oil and gas; given the crucial role they play for Belarus, this naturally comes with context about Belarusian politics, Belarusian economy and Belarus-Russia relationship in general. On the other hand, I just can't get overly excited about a translation-and-synthesis exercise based on 150-200 relatively recent Belarusian business-newspaper articles - but not, say, economic studies - with some sociology sauce poured over to make the book more ""academic"".... Perhaps I can't, but English-speaking scholars of Belarus can. ""High Life"" is a well-researched and engagingly written monograph which can greatly improve outsiders' understanding of Belarusian affairs.PS. Who did the translation, actually? How do you (twice) de-acronymize ""MAZ"" as ""Minsk tractor plant""? Minsk Automobile Plant (MAZ) and Minsk Tractor Plant (MTZ) are Belarus's two biggest industrial brands and employers. Having a book about Belarusian economy confuse the two looks odd - ""New York Red Sox"", anyone? - and shows that the manuscript was not reviewed by a Belarusian peer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z63Z8R9OWYL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6155225192#wasThisHelpful","R2Z63Z8R9OWYL0","AQMQI5K7MNW76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMQI5K7MNW76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Packt has published most of the QlikView books out there, starting with the de facto ""QlikView bible"" by Garcia and Harmsen, and following up with (a) the substantial books by Stephen Redmond and (b) the thin, richly priced books by Karl Pover [ok], Tim Floyd [bad], Diane Blackwood [bad] and Christopher Ilaqua [bad].""Creating Stunning Dashboards With QlikView"" joins the (b) camp, and brings its average up. The book has an appealing informal, enthusiastic style, and talks about (i) dashboard design in general (think Tufte ultra-lite), (ii) QlikView's visual elements, and (ii) concrete QlikView tips. It is open-and-shut too sketchy for my taste - I would have gone for Garcia and Harmsen or Redmond; let me call the three authors ""GHR""  - but here is a more general reservation. By choosing not to discuss data, only the front-end, CSDQV rules itself out as one's ""starter"" QlikView book: it has to be the second at least.

"I really like the book, but want to bring up two things neglected by its author.One is acknowledgments. ""Bayesian Methods For Hackers"" did not appear in a vacuum. I would like to see a hat tip to the creators of PyMC, and at least a mention of BUGS, the still-very-much-alive software which brought Bayesian methods to academic masses and inspired MCMC-engine projects like PyMC. Then there are PyMC's cousins JAGS and STAN - these can be familiar to the R crowd - and people who wrote popular books on Bayesian analysis, such as John Kruschke, the author of ""Doing Bayesian Data Analysis"". (I should also mention James Stone, with his ""Bayes' Rule"". ""Bayesian Modeling Using WinBUGS"" by Ioannis Ntzoufras could have had more impact, but its publisher, Wiley, sabotaged the book with greedy pricing and no-frills presentation. Looking into the near future - I see that Manning have their own ""probabilistic programming"" book in the works, by Avi Pfeiffer). Naming those people, programs and books would provide useful pointers to aspiring ""Bayesian hackers"".The second reservation is about editorial effort. The very first page (when it used ""ascribe"" instead of ""subscribe"") told me that the manuscript had not been proof-read. As I went through the book, I found more unpolished passages, and a handful of lines capable of triggering a facepalm by a statistics professor. Now, this is not a book for statistics professors - they don't tend to use Python, for starters, while BMH assumes that you have Python installed - and the practical question is whether these issues are going to seriously frustrate or mislead the average reader. My answer is ""not really"". Chapter 3, for example, is dodgy, yet realistically a ""hacker"" can just skip or skim it. (Kudos on page 77, by the way - simple and effective). Classical, non-Bayesian statistics misunderstood and unfairly maligned? Only a stats prof will care. I think you can get through smaller slip-ups. For example, on page 15, you can quickly figure out that ""lambda_"" is a vector - unlike ""lambda_1"" and ""lambda_2"", which are scalar parameters - and understand what it's for, even though the author is just telling you that it's a function. Or, on page 142, you can figure out what loss function is implemented in stock_loss(), even though the text does not tell you what it is. Page 42 asks ""Why is the gamma axis greater than 1?"" You realize that it's Y, not gamma, and the question is asking whether the PDF of a continuous distribution can be above 1, and move on.I find these complaints easy to overlook. Thinking ""big picture"", I see the first-ever accessible, engaging, visually appealing, practical, inexpensive introduction to Bayesian methods. Echoing - now in a positive way - the beginning of my review, there is a feeling of continuity, of a long-running collective project being advanced. First, a user-friendly MCMC engine is built by the BUGS team. Then, the PyMC team incorporates their MCMC engine into a programming language popular with the ""data science"" crowd, sprinkling Pythonesque syntax sugar over the BUGS model definition language. Finally, after a few years, a good book on PyMC shows up. Bayesian methods are now accessible to a broad, non-academic audience.American Statistical Association - give this man a medal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LYKU25Y84WKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0133902838#wasThisHelpful","R2LYKU25Y84WKQ","AQMQI5K7MNW76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMQI5K7MNW76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Little things like page 101's listing of Windows and .NET as distinct ""platforms"" (Unix, Linux and ""mainframe operating systems"" also feature in the list) or page 159's dodgy description of ROLAP make me question the author's hands-on experience with data warehouse implementation. If Mr. Khan has indeed ""consulted for major corporations on data warehousing and business intelligence"", he must have dealt with ""softer"" or higher-level matters. The book feels exactly like a book by a consultant or an academic:  organized (although in this case moderately padded with a number of self-repeats), methodical, big on bullet-point lists and definitions, encyclopaedic, useful to a novice, but not useful to practitioner. Add ""out of date"" to the list of complaints: the book's substitution of OLAP for ""business intelligence"" is just one of the things that make the book feel as if it were written in late nineties. Repeating myself, the book will be useful to a beginner - offering an introduction to (a) data warehouse design, (b) OLAP, (c) project management; you can easily find better books on (a), but here you get a 3-in-1 - but people who have been building databases will not lose anything if they pass.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UU3TX3G3M3U2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936420325#wasThisHelpful","R1UU3TX3G3M3U2","AQMQI5K7MNW76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMQI5K7MNW76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first encounter with the author's oeuvre was ""QlikView 11 Application Development"" - boasting a total of 60 pages, and priced at whopping $2.14 per page. I dismissed the book sight unseen, pointing potential readers to two superior, varied choices: the thin, popular book by Pover, and the heavy de-facto-QlikView-bible by Garcia and Harmsen. Reviewers who did give it a chance were not impressed, complaining about missing files and confusing directions.I suspect that ""QlikView for Finance"" will be getting more of the same: I am looking at page 5, and already (in the last line) the author is asking the reader to build a QlikView table - but is not telling how! Running through vignettes should be easy on an author: Blackwood is not doing that to a high standard, and does not aspire for anything higher-value-added. (An attempt to introduce set analysis, on pages 24-28, fails). There are not nearly enough screenshots - will a QlikView newbie get through, or get stuck?I am not going to dismiss ""QlikView for Finance"": let a thousand flowers bloom, the book may find a grateful reader. That said, Pover's still looks like a better deal to me - and now there is another appealing alternative, ""QlikView Your Business"" by Troyansky et al. Do not be swayed by the title's reference to finance - that's a marketing gimmick and a non-factor.PS. Are you sure you want to go with QlikView? Have you seen Qlik Sense?

"I will side with the positive review, yet acknowledge that the negative ones are right to say that there is nothing ""pro"" about this book, and that it does not feel like ""expert's voice"". This is an introduction to SSAS multidimensional modeling, not something more advanced, like ""Expert cube development with SSAS multidimensional models"" by Webb, Ferrari and Russo. Moreover, as introductions go, it is not hands-on in the sense of working through specific tasks - the way ""Getting started with SQL Server 2012 cube development"" by Lidberg, or ""Delivering business intelligence with Microsoft SQL Server 2012"" by Larson do. The book's strong suit is good writing. You have to have read a bunch of IT books that feel like a run through a multitude of screenshots to take note when you come across an author who works on his text. (A negative review has alleged an inadequate discussion of dimensions - I myself noted an unusual, but not obviously wrong, choice to defer discussion of attribute relationships, and gave the author points for (almost) explaining a couple of things neglected by the other SSAS books). Where does this approach leave ""Pro SQL Server 2008 Analysis Services""?

"""Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair"". Starting tinkering with databases in 2010 and mastering 20 databases by 2014 - while finding time for poetry, dancing and badminton - is an impressive accomplishment in anyone's book. Apart from Vertica (last touched in 2012; I remember the atrocious projections crafted by DBAs using Vertica's designer tool, and the database choking on ""select ... where x in (select ...)"" queries), SSAS and QlikView might be the only new technologies which I myself picked up over these years - and in each case, there was a good Packt-published book to help me along the way.Sadly, those books were exceptions, and the typical Packt book is a low-quality quickie that looks like a digest of a better book, written by a first-time author hailing from the Indian subcontinent. ""HP Vertica Essentials"" is just one more example of this quantity-over-quality approach. (And so is one of the other reviews). The book is transparently inadequate, and unnecessary, given that Vertica documentation - helpfully split into thematic volumes - is only a Google search away.

"... is my measured response to the reviews entitled ""Full coverage of the subject matter"" and ""A great reference book on SSIS 2012"". It is also my warning to those considering this book as an SSIS learning aid.You have to wonder what's going on if the book gets around to building its first SSIS package in Chapter 7: if it were a book for beginners, Chapter 2 or 3 would be a more appropriate place, and if it were a book for intermediate or advanced SSIS users, this introductory material would not be needed at all. The beginner who persevered through Chapters 1-6, learning about the upgrade procedure and the new features of the 2012 release (revised syntax of XML-format SSIS package files, anyone?), gets to load a text file into a database - and then, without a single transformation explained, is asked to implement parent-child packages, and execute them with T-SQL (!) and C# (!!). With this, core SSIS training is over, and the book moves on to more advanced or niche topics like CDC, ""fuzzy"" transformations and DQS, administration and performance.It is only those more advanced topics, found in Part III, which can make this book worth a look. (The upgrade-and-new-features stuff of Chapters 3-5 can be found online). Although I did consider hiring an assassin to go after the author of Chapter 10 - when talking about SSIS 2012, it is very important to be clear about the differences between package deployment model and project deployment model, and that chapter fails this test like there's no tomorrow - the problem is not really with the individual chapters, but with lopsided, incomplete nature of their sum.Dial M for ""Microsoft Press, you sure dropped the ball with this one"".","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33WD6MIEAUWH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0735665850#wasThisHelpful","R33WD6MIEAUWH7","AQMQI5K7MNW76","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMQI5K7MNW76?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My original review gave the book three stars and complained about it hastily running through SSAS tasks and examples, without stopping to think. Recently, I had another look, and got a more positive impression. One should not demand depth from an introductory book, but one should give points for an accessible, dynamic writing style. ""Getting started..."" could use more editing - often, the book indulges in ""showing off"" an intermediate-to-advanced SSAS morsel that looks out of place in the book for beginners, but forgets an essential.

"This is a nice basic timer with a large display. The timer is always on and you cannot turn this off without removing the battery, which is not included. For another dollar in price I would pay to have the battery included. The timer works will and press the minute and second together will clear the timer. The timer counts up or down and includes a magnet which isn't very powerful. As a timer this unit works well and is fairly inexpensive.

"I love these croc flip flops. I never wore flip flops very much because I always found them uncomfortable and just too flat. My feet would hurt or just be stiff after extended walking in other flip flops. These are nicely contoured with a small rise in the heal similar to a sneaker. I wore these all day walking at Walt Disney World without a blister or sore feet! They are very sturdy and my first pair lasted me two years. They would have lasted longer but I was playing soccer with my puppy and stopped too quickly pulling the strap out of the sole. After two years I really cannot complain about that happening.I really wanted another pair of these but anywhere in the store they were $30-$35 but I checked out amazon and they were $26 and I had to have them. I wear a size 9.5-10 sneaker and these fit me perfectly. They go great with anything especially khaki shorts and a t-shirt.I would recommend these to anyone looks for a comfortable all day flip flop at a good price.Thank you for reading","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33BJVCQ15SVM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BLPSI4#wasThisHelpful","R33BJVCQ15SVM6","A203WLJ31GIUTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203WLJ31GIUTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My puppy loves this, she is a chocolate lab and loves to chew on everything. This is perfect for her, she can chew on this without bits and pieces of stuff getting all over or cutting her gums. She will just chew on this until she falls asleep. I really like this it seems almost indestructible. Her little teeth just make grooves in the antler and even then it will take her at at least 8-12 months to get through the antler.I would recommend this to anyone with a larger breed chewer. I only saw larger breed because the antler is very hard and may be hard for smaller dogs. I received an antler that was about 8 inches long and about an inch think at the base, a good size product.Thanks for reading my review and check out my profile for a link to my puppy blog to see pictures : )","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I1XSZFD4AHAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053WMOJA#wasThisHelpful","R2I1XSZFD4AHAR","A203WLJ31GIUTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203WLJ31GIUTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been looking for a product like this for a few years. I love electronics and I hate the fact that I could not easily view what is on my PC without having to hook my PC directly to my TV. A computer tied to my entertainment center just was not what I was looking for but this is. The iShare dongle is perfect, it is very easy to use once you get it going. The directions could be improved and when I hooked mine up for the first time, the language was in Chinese but with a little guess work I was able to select the right buttons to enter my wireless password. ONce that was completed a popup appeared and looked like an update screen, once this was completed, the language was changed to english and I was ready to go.I tested this using my iPhone 4s and my windows 7 pc. For both items this worked seamlessly, I installed the EzCast software and I was able to mirror my PC screen on my TV as well as mirroring my iPhone screen.I love the fact I can now watch shows I couldn't get through Netflix, hulu or my SmarTV apps on my TV.I would recommend reviewing the instructions and having a little patience but you can get this going and it was well worth the time spent. I would give this five stars if the standard language on my unit was not Chinese and if the instructions were a little clearer.I like this product a lot and I recommend it if you are looking to stream anything from your phone or PC to your HDMI equipped TV.I received this product from the vendor in exchange for the honest and unbiased review you just read.Thank you for reading","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DQ742REZQB56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNPUYCQ#wasThisHelpful","R2DQ742REZQB56","A203WLJ31GIUTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203WLJ31GIUTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an interesting multi-function lamp. You first have a 3 setting touch desk lamp that works perfect as a 50 watts equivalent light source with an adjustable stand. You can change the angle of the light, move the arm to get the light right where you want it. Next, you can simply unhook the lamp from the stand and take it with you! You still have the on/off with the dimmer capability. They hook you up with a carabiner so you can clasp the light to your belt or backpack. Based on everything included with the lamp and the quality of the product this is a good value.I found the led is very bright as a emergency flash light or desk light.

"This is the third TheraPearl product I have used and each have been very beneficial. The first one I used was the THERAPEARL Neck Wrap, 1.44 Pound and that worked great and I have used the THERAPEARL Sports pack - Rectangle Bag which is similar size as the contour pack without a strap. The contour pack is an oval relief pack filled with therapearls that allow the pack to microwave or frozen depending on the type of relief you need.

"Another masterpiece by Mark Twain. I had never read Adventures of Huck Finn or Tom Sawyer until now, in my 30's and I wish had read them as a boy. These are the classic misadventures of a young boy, reminds me of me as a child, always looking for fun, adventure and a little bit of trouble. If you realize who the characters are, what the setting of the story is and read the book, you will see that though there is a very liberal use of the N-Word, Twain writes his characters with dignity and pride, not with racism or bigotry. In today's society it may be hard for some to read the n-word and continue on without being disgusted but I ask that you do and you read the story that is there because it a well written novel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34HXK0VU6T3XH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486280616#wasThisHelpful","R34HXK0VU6T3XH","A203WLJ31GIUTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203WLJ31GIUTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this product as a sample from the manufacturer in exchange for a fair and honest review. I was pretty skeptical upon receiving it as it doesn't look like much. There are 7 compartments filled with little blue beads making the wrap pretty flexible, I would agree with other reviewers that this is more for your upper back shoulder area than your neck. Each area was filled with beads fully and was not lacking as in older images/reviews. This is really flexible and can be used anywhere on your body.My wife had a lot of lower back pain the other night and I said hey lets try this out. I threw it in the microwave as the directions indicated, 40 seconds for my microwave. It came out hot but not too hot and it stayed warm for at least 20 minutes. It provided nice even heat to relax her muscles and it worked really well. She was so relaxed she fell right asleep.Update - 7/14/14 - We used this an an ice pack over the weekend and it works great. it stayed cold for longer than I would need it to and was still flexible.This really worked well and I will be looking to purchase their other products after using this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ABLUIL5P4J8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003FK83MO#wasThisHelpful","R3ABLUIL5P4J8A","A203WLJ31GIUTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203WLJ31GIUTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this case/keyboard combination. I use with my Kindle Fire HD when ever I need to type something longer than a  few words. I also use it with my iPhone because I am a terrible typist on those little screens. I also have hooked it up to my TV to better use the web browsing capabilities on my Samsung SmartTV. The directions are a little lacking but if you have ever hooked up a Bluetooth device this is the same. If you have not, hit the connect button on the keyboard, you'll see it flash, go to your device and select the appropriate Bluetooth menu and select the keyboard. To pair the keyboard you will have to type a few numbers to verify connection, then you all set to go! There are several different hot keys for quick searching, locking the home screen, turning volume or brightness up and down.This is an excellent Bluetooth keyboard. Using this as a case for my Kindle Fire HD was nice as well. The Kindle fits well in the case and it works nicely. Sometimes it is a little difficult to get the angle I was looking for but this was a minor inconvenience.Overall this is an excellent and versatile Bluetooth keyboard case combination and an excellent value for $20.Update 6/24/14 - I found that the keyboard is attached to the case via magnets! So if you are looking to use this keyboard without the case, simply detach the case from the keyboard and you have a portable Bluetooth keyboard!I received a sample for review purposes from the manufacturer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PXU4SUY9LEV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUF7VPE#wasThisHelpful","R3PXU4SUY9LEV2","A203WLJ31GIUTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203WLJ31GIUTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This OBD2 scanner will pay for itself the first time you need to use it. The scanner will work with any OBD2 compliant vehicle which is almost if not every car made from 1996 to present. All you have to do to use the tool is locate your OBD2 connection, usually under the dash near the steering column. If you cannot find your port, a quick Google search will revel its location usually with pictures. Then with the ignition OFF, plug the scan tool in and then key the key on. Press enter and start the scan. From here you will get your results, you can clear any pesky codes or find out what is wrong with your car. You will get a worst a general idea what is wrong with your car and if you handy you can fix it yourself or at least be armed with the knowledge you need not to get ripped off at the mechanics. This comes with an almost 50 page manual that is invaluable and if there is something that is not covered in there, you can find all the answers and then some on the codes on the internet. I have been able to pin point the cause of the problem with the code(s) provided and description of the problem via an internet search. This saved a lot of money repairing my 2000 Honda Accord.I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in repairing their cars, on a budget, or doesn't trust mechanics(not all are bad!) this will save you a lot of money and provide you with a great source information on your car for less than $25I was provided a sample of this product for a fair and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U95GP8ZZ471Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A66OAKE#wasThisHelpful","R3U95GP8ZZ471Y","A203WLJ31GIUTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203WLJ31GIUTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used this to mount my 21"" Insignia TV from Best Buy. This mount worked perfect with the 75x75 VESA pattern on the TV and it was easy to mount. The mount came with a template so you can easily drill the holes in the wall and a level to make sure it is straight. The only this I had to do was tighten the bolt where the mount pivots closest to the TV. This was easy with a pair of pliers. The mount moves both in/out and left and right so it is very versatile. This is a heavy sturdy mount and you wont go wrong for less than $15!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUQMB86BATOZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00898482G#wasThisHelpful","RUQMB86BATOZA","A203WLJ31GIUTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203WLJ31GIUTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are having issues with playing the playlist, Amazon asking for credit card info etc, make sure you are logged into your Amazon Prime account before playing music. Without being logged in or having a Prime account you will not be able to use Amazon Prime Music. I hope this helps.This is a good start for a feel good country playlist. There are some great classic songs like:Its a Great Day to Be Alive - Travis TrittJust Another Day in Paradise - Phil VassarChicken Fried -  Zac brown BandThere are a lot of other songs out there they could have added to this playlist. This should be called Feel Good 90's-2000's playlist. The classic country playlist could have a few songs on this playlist as well Like Take This Job and Shove It by Johnny Paycheck as well as others.Amazon is doing a real nice job with the labels they have agreements with so far and I cant wait until they are able to add more.

"This is a great classic country compilation with classics from the 50's 60's 70's and 80's. Songs you remember and some you forgot how good they were. This will get your feet tapping and you'll probably want to buy a few of the songs too. This is great to play at a party or just relaxing outside on the porch. If you have friends that aren't into country you can play this and bet by the time its over they will singing along and asking you for more.My favorites from this playlist are in no order:Kenny Rogers - The GamblerHighwayman - The HighwaymenGuitars, Cadillac's - Dwight YoakamFolsom Prison Blues - Johnny CashThere are many other great classics on this album and I know you'll really enjoy this playlist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1265BBVQEXH1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRN0HE4#wasThisHelpful","R1265BBVQEXH1B","A203WLJ31GIUTB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A203WLJ31GIUTB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have previously used Armorsuit protectors on all my tablets and phones, but since the Ipad Pro version was not in stock, I tried this based on the reviews. While the installation was similar, the product is not. It is thicker than armorsuit, and while all bubbles left when installing an armorsuit go away within 24 hours, this one has left some permanent ones, despite repeatedly squeegying it when installing. I will be replacing it with an Armorsuit. I am concerned about the thickness vis a vis the Apple Pencil.

"I purchased the ""HDD not included"" version of this and installed my own drive. If you are nervous about installing a drive, no worries, it is easy. I had a four camera system and wanted an eight camera one.Bottom line is it works and was very easy to set up in terms of the hardware. As far as connecting to my iphone/setting up remote viewing, it worked well using a ""generic"" system and a generic mobile option. This DVR uses a seperate ""Media"" port setting.

I am not using PTZ (panTiltZoom)cameras so cannot speak to that feature.I was concerned about heat given the small size of the case and lack of fans, but after running for about 7 hours it was just warm, not hot. Obviously you do not want to put this or any other component (stero, cable box, etc) on a tight space anyway. Since the case is all metal I'd say it probably dissipates heat nicely.On first turning it on it has an annoying alarm/beep system that goes off if you have a disconnected camera.

When the Linksys started randomly losing wifi and causing latency spikes, I ordered the Asus. Took just a minute to set up, and instead of the crappy 7 or 8 Mbps I was now getting 29-40....on all my devices...laptop, iPhone, iPad, desktop, and my latency for gaming dropped from the 200's to the 70's.

"Our church bought one of these for our hall to use with our projector, laptops, and Bluray players. Range was amazing...we mounted this about 8 feet up onto the pole that our projector is suspended on (with some plastic ties) from a crossbeam, and once my laptop connected, i walked all around the hall as far as around 40 feet away, and the signal remained connected and the video ran smoothly. When connecting to a projector, the projector becomes the audio ""control"" and you have to run an audio cable from the projector to your sound system. Ours had a standard 3.5 mm output, and a 100ft cable on Amazon was about ten bucks, and the sound was perfect. I also realized that you had to turn up the projector volume to a decent level first, then you can use your house system to shape the sound. I will post an addendum later to comment on whether it is still running well. So far so good.Addendum 3/24/13: system works fantastic, including with bluray player. Because we mounted it high, we also picked up a remote control power outlet on Amazon so it was not on all the time.update 6/22/15 - this device is still going very strong...works great with bluray players that have usb port.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R66K630IGM7WE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009E6R89C#wasThisHelpful","R66K630IGM7WE","A3R7R8ARVN2P3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R7R8ARVN2P3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Absolutely perfect!! Came with all necessary cables. I am shocked at how great this sounds with an acoustic guitar in my Church. I'd say i posed the ultimate challenge acoustically: a Taylor 12 string with the Expression system, played through a Fishman Loudbox 100w acoustic amp. The quality was stunning. No pops, no dropouts, no line noise, just crystal clear acoustic goodness. Bass response is excellent, and I could not tell the difference between this and when I am cabled. I also tried it in the hall and did not lose the signal, but at around 100 feet away I could start to detect a slight delay. No prob for me since I will have no reason to be that far away.-has its own volume control dial on the back..very cool as I have seen come criticism of lower end wireless rigs that reviewers said lowered the volume.-no need to even clip this anywhere..I just put it in my pocket and let the antenna hang out; it does have a belt clip though.-has a 'standby"" setting on the device which I believe makes sure the signal stays connected for instant play.I highly recommend this system. I am a professional who has played live acoustic guitar in churches for 35 years. This will be great for our special services with children than require me to maybe move around without dragging a cable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16D8TLJBXUBPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UV8KNI#wasThisHelpful","R16D8TLJBXUBPH","A3R7R8ARVN2P3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R7R8ARVN2P3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have used the Anger Management for Youth (available on Amazon) CBT book since the 1990's, and was looking for something that would cover a broader spectrum of behaviors for an alternative suspension program. This fits the bill. It especially emphasizes the four thinking errors (blaming, awfulizing, minimizing, self-centered), and provides some nice scenarios that you can use as worksheets or as a group activity/lesson.If you are looking to actually impart a skill and have a great opportunity to interact with at-risk youth, then this is the way to go.The original EQUIP system is based it seems on having the time to develop a Positive Peer Culture, while this book as I said is more suited to working with individuals or targeted groups within a school.I do recommend purchasing Anger Management for Youth: Stemming Violence and Aggression. It has some nice summary and template sheets that can be made into a useful packet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DNPE6PZLFJVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0878225099#wasThisHelpful","R3DNPE6PZLFJVD","A3R7R8ARVN2P3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R7R8ARVN2P3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, yes, five cats is a lot and they sort of snuck up on me. I was faced with using two ""tip and sift"" boxes and my litter robot, but this was NOT working. Had to clean three boxes and litter was everywhere.So, I decided to get a 36 gallon tote from walmart and make one large litterbox; thought of making some kind of giant rake to clean it, but saw this scoop at the pet store and liked the feel. It works perfectly. I can get deep in the litter with no bending over, and it only takes a minute or two to clean the box..no litter in my face, no sifting, no tipping, and no litter scattered around. Best of all no smell at all.In short, this device was the perfect addition to my multi-cat, homemade litterbox scenario. It stays extended and does not slip, the scoop is very sturdy and does not bend, and its easy to get it under the larger patches of solidified urine. Now I just use the little shopping bags I have laying around to put the clumps in and toss them out.I highly recommend this product, and I highly recommend making your own litterbox out of a plastic tote. Cats have room, you can cover it and it still has lots of room for the cat to stand, and you can easily take it outside and hose it out if necessary. I loved my LitterRobot, but two of my cats would not use it. They all use the home-made one.addendum: 7/17/14: six cats now, and I switched to the Biddy Box. This scoop is still going strong.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GJOJZA7XJBSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IVGC90#wasThisHelpful","R3GJOJZA7XJBSO","A3R7R8ARVN2P3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R7R8ARVN2P3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Recently rescued/fostered a stray cat, which shall we say caused some problems with marking and or missing the litterbox. My entire house has tile floors (florida), and a regular mop was not cutting it. Tried this out and it was amazing right away. Nice fresh clean smell after use, and it is easy to move and use.

"I rescued a stray male black cat, but already have 4 young cats, 3 males 1 female (big house, 3 litterboxes, not a cat hoarder). Plan to put him up for adoption. After he healed up and I gradually let him in the main house, all but my alpha-black male cat were ok with him. The alpha refused to even come into my bedroom anymore or to his cat tree once the new male was there...alpha cat would growl and warble even within 10 feet of new cat. This stuff had arrived a few days earlier so I decided to plug it in my room near the tree, and there was a response within several hours. Alpha cat not only entered the room, but he stopped making noises and fixating on the new cat, and even began playing in the room. He got within a few feet of new cat and just looked at him, no posturing or noise. This transferred to when they were out of the room together as well. They don't exactly love each other, but I am very pleased with this quick change in behavior...no way it was a fluke or accident. Curious to see how it develops. new guy is being neutered this week, and at that point I will remove the feliway and see what happens.addendum 2/13/13: well, all is well.

" 0:29 MinsBased  on having 5 cats, only my siamese likes it as you see in my video. none of the other cats like it.however, they do play with the hanging balls and use it as a scratching post, so that is good.I would highly recommend this for a kitten or very small cat, but not for a multi-cat house or for large cats.One of the screws would not go on on the bedrail because there was a piece of metal stuck in it.it is worth it if it makes at least one cat happy. my siamese weighs around 9 pounds and is pretty slim. my 12 pound tabby cannot fit in the tube or on the bed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CEJZH7BJNWCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AS57XQ#wasThisHelpful","R3CEJZH7BJNWCX","A3R7R8ARVN2P3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R7R8ARVN2P3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had been using a sub-$100 android tablet and really did like it, but stepped on it. The samsung has a crisper display and is faster than the 'cheap"" androids, but what really shocked me is the wifi range. I can now be in my back room 50 feet away, through 5 walls and a closed door and the signal still shows more than half the bars. The cheaper tablet I had would disconnect once I got about 20 feet from the router.Other than that, I was disappointed to find no HDMI out or mini usb.

"Picked one of these up just to try a larger screen than my 7 inch android tab. I am very pleased with this tablet. Plenty of room for apps, speed seems great compared to my little tablet and my android phone. It feels good in my hand/hands even when using it as an e-reader at night. Wifi range is fine..have had no issues connecting, and the on board lan jack is very convenient since a hard-wired lan is much faster than wifi. (I happen to keep an extra cable in my living room).The only reason I was going to ding a star is I did feel the battery life (about three hours in full use) was not the greatest, but then again it is one fourth the price of an IPAD... I have had two opportunities to use this side by side with an IPAD and frankly the differences were negligible in terms of surfing speed, loading apps, etc. Obviously an IPAD screen has higher resolution and a slightly better touch response, but the Irulu is still easy to read, very bright and videos look great. I enjoy typing on the 10 inch much more than the 7.I did order a case on EBAY that is kind of a flat leather folio case, as it did not come with one, and I like the folio cases better than the zipper cases, especially when using the tablet as an ebook at night.One issue that came up was the wifi sometimes would not come back on after sleeping. A free app called ""wifi-lock"" corrected this immediately so that was resolved. It also contributes to saving battery life. I also found, via experimentation, that a cheap USB wifi device works well in this tablet, and has a larger range than the on board. Did not have to run an app or install any software...ICS 4 just defaulted to the usb wifi...very cool!  However, I don't use the usb device since the on board has been just fine. Nice to have as a backup, though.Overall, I highly recommend this tablet; it had no hardware issues at all, runs great, and its nice having the lan jack feature and two usb ports. Lastly the stereo speakers are pretty nice.Now, one of the ports does not respond to USB 2 cables but does read thumb drives, but I am told that this is because it is an exclusive USB 3 port that will allow me to charge via USB. Once I check that out I will post back.I should also mention that I dropped this tablet on a hard tile floor from about 5 feet, such that the binding of the front screen popped out, yet the tablet still worked perfectly and the binding just popped back into place. So I would say this is also a very sturdy device.addendum 11/19/12: Still working great, but I discovered some nice apps that let you send files wirelessly from your pc to the tablet..pretty amazing..your tablet's folders will appear on your pc desk top and you can just drag files into them. Just activate the app and set your tablet down anywhere, and you can move files, no cables at all. Only about 2 bucks for the pro versions that have no size limits.Addendum: some people have asked about a case. This is a 10.2 inch tablet, so just search Ebay for ""android 10.2 tablet case"" and you will find them. They run about 10 bucks with free shipping.Addendum 2/6/13: Tablet still working fine, no issues.Adedendum 8/30/13: still working, no issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FR1JSO0K7H8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009HISC3I#wasThisHelpful","R2FR1JSO0K7H8F","A3R7R8ARVN2P3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R7R8ARVN2P3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Been playing for 35 years, have owned about 8 Taylors. Got this to use in a small-medium church (350 seats). Stunning would be an understatement. Sounds rich and full unplugged or plugged. I had been soured before with the ES system on my jumbo Taylor 315 six string, and even replaced that with a fishman soundhole system. However, the ES system with this guitar is just mind-blowing, played through a Fishman Loudbox 100 or the native church sound system, or combined ( loudbox has a clean mic out to a soundboard). I have NEVER been happy with any 12 string plugged in until this. The ES system really works to mitigate the grating high end you often get with 12 strings. Unlike with my six string, the sound is very natural. Received several compliments.Unplugged the guitar has great action and just a sweet, balanced tone. The body style is very conducive to just sitting around and fingerpicking. I compared this directly with a similarly priced Martin, and both the feel and sound of the Taylor passed the martin, which also had plywood sides (for $1600 !!!).I have finally found the perfect guitar.Addendum 12/6/12: I am now using this guitar exclusively for church, as the ease of fingerpicking and the balanced tone when fingerpicking are just amazing. As I said before the body size contributes to that as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12YXR31J40NU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UN67PQ#wasThisHelpful","R12YXR31J40NU7","A3R7R8ARVN2P3D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R7R8ARVN2P3D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The weight really feels identical. The blade is definitely dull and rounded all over, but the point was still, well, ""pointy.""

"For all its virtues, well described in other reviews here, there is an underreported aspect of this movie that ought to give pause, its implicit defense of the edges of pederasty. Hector, the teacher who is treated with the most sympathy in the film, is a pederast, one who gropes the genitals of his high-school-senior-age students for his gratification. He's presented as an innocent, a child himself, and has been explicitly defended as such by the film's author, Alan Bennett. In this way, and by making at least one of the boys he abuses uncannily adult in personality, among other devices, the film does a nice job of complexifying and muddying lines contemporary culture has tried to make simple and clear and (literally enough) puts a smiley face on the pederasty. That this is put in the context of homosexuality/bisexuality may account for the apparent reluctance of critics to address it.I won't try to sort all that out here. I just think viewers should be aware of this element of the movie, and those who have already seen it and haven't reflected on that element of it probably should. Those who would like some more context might start with Johann Hari's article ""Alan Bennett and the question of innocence,"" easily found via Google (Amazon removes links from reviews).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4SE3L5O68FVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NIVJFO#wasThisHelpful","R4SE3L5O68FVP","A1K94LXX833JTT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K94LXX833JTT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This movie tries to be good, and in the end it may succeed, but on the way it crosses lines in ways that have offended some and struck others as unrealistic. Whether the reasons for crossing those lines are ultimately good enough, I don't know. The filmmaker regards this as a fable, and things happen in fables that we wouldn't accept as real, especially symbolic ones (like being bound with a chain). One thing that makes that confusing here is the otherwise realistic style, and realistic, serious themes.That aside, despite initial appearances, the movie becomes a sweet, soft-hearted tale of the triumph of love in the end, and is fairly effective at that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RMXCZZC9TKCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEFXJ86#wasThisHelpful","R3RMXCZZC9TKCU","A1K94LXX833JTT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K94LXX833JTT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

For most purposes it's sharper than it needs to be, but there are a few things it can do that other knives can't, some very fine layering for example, and cutting easily through some bones.

"I was in Paris a few weeks ago. This guide is helpfully divided up into eight main sections according to the part of the city, useful for consulting on the ground. Each geographical section is dominated by brief descriptions of sights and sources of food and entertainment, including shopping. Lots of alluring photos. Info is concise.It also has brief sections on practical matters like money, transportation, general advice on food, etc.It's too big for a pocket, but it will fit easily in a bag.There's a removable map at the back, detailed enough to use for walking or driving, showing metro and train stops with a smaller map showing the lines. I would have liked some more information on a map and in the little text section on the metro, a video tutorial might be more helpful to get oriented to the metro if you're not accustomed to how it works. It's the best way to get most places you can't easily walk to.The guide mentions the hop-on hop-off busses that run along several routes through the city. These are very popular, hit most of the places most people want to go. Sit on the top level for the best view if weather permits.The guide fits the hectic tourist approach of getting to as many places as possible, but it can be used for less pressed visits. You can easily spend a week at a single site like the Louvre. This guide can help you find what's around you at whatever speed you wish to go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24JD5UQVAGUGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743214618#wasThisHelpful","R24JD5UQVAGUGG","A1K94LXX833JTT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K94LXX833JTT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This isn't a series of biographical sketches. After an introduction, each chapter is built around one of the seven liberals referred to in the book's subtitle, but in each we encounter numerous people, ideas and events, forming a web of connections within and between chapters, showing the development of a community of American liberal thought from the eighteenth century to the mid-1930s.The seven liberals that function as vantage points for the movement are John Adams, Mary Moody Emerson, William Ellery Channing, William James, Thomas Davidson, William Mackintire Salter, and Jane Addams. A revolutionary, founder and President of the country; a maiden aunt and early example to Ralph Waldo Emerson; a leading Unitarian preacher and theologian; a key American philosopher who treated his depression with a will to believe; a Scottish-American intellectual and pluralist idealist; a post-Christian preacher of Ethics; and a local and international social activist and founder of Hull House.""Liberal"" here doesn't mean what it typically means in contemporary politics, though there is a connection. The author explains that the first people to call themselves liberals (in the eighteenth century) did so in reference to some religiously mediated beliefs formed in reaction against Calvinism. They held no human could have full knowledge, which was taken to imply a duty of humility, open-mindedness and pluralism. They also insisted that humans have moral agency, i.e. free will, largely on the practical ground that the denial of it encourages bad behavior. Together these beliefs established the need for liberty of conscience and a ground for belief in equality. These spiritual but practical points are the basic foundation of the liberal ""Religion of Democracy"" in America, democratic beliefs that were central to revolutionary politics and beyond.The author sees this original culture of liberalism as having taken a turn to ideological dogmatism, and thus away from its original foundation, when it tied itself to the principles of the New Deal. But she does see contemporary liberalism as having grown out of the older liberalism.The author is herself a contemporary liberal in some respects, as well as an aspirant to the ideals of the original liberalism. She isn't overbearing, but an occasional remark or sermonette shows a current liberal sensibility relating to, say, the unfair treatment of women or the need to admit that the Civil War was about slavery. The book is also shaped by a contemporary liberal sensibility in making the effort to include women and minorities as active agents in the conversation. The author ends the book with a brief plea for the pluralism of the older liberalism, eschewing dogmatism and prideful contempt.A point that motivates the book appears in the first sentence: ""Somehow the word 'godless' got attached to the word 'liberal.'"" The author is at pains to show there's no valid connection. She doesn't entirely rise to the challenge. She effectively shows that liberal heritage is rooted in religion, that a vital culture of liberal religion can and did exist (it continues today), and some of the figures in the book provide arguments and felt reasons that would tie liberalism to religion. Those are good lessons for both conservative religious critics of liberalism and liberal critics of religion.But readers may split over what the book achieves in that regard. The religion of some of the liberals in the book, consisting of little more than a commitment to the pursuit of good, and faith that something really is ultimately good, will be regarded by some as extremely attenuated, while others will see it as getting at the pure essence of true religion. The author does little to mediate that split. Despite acknowledging that there's ""more than grain of truth"" in conservative criticism of liberal religion (page 12), she mainly dismisses it as based on a myth of what constitutes religion. The author only rarely shows a flash of insight into the virtues and deep humanity of conservative religion, which seems to me a lacuna in her open-mindedness and pluralism.And of course many liberals have felt their liberal values led them away from religion and God entirely. For the author this view may be precluded by a belief that the pursuit of truth and virtue requires a belief in the divine (or ultimate, as she sometimes calls it), a belief taken for granted by early liberals, and argued for in some form by William James. But she doesn't ever state that belief as her own, and it would be vigorously disputed by many, possibly most contemporary liberals.Not all of the seven figures are equally developed, but all are brought to life to some degree. I don't know enough about the history to evaluate how accurate and fair the book is. It's fully annotated with endnotes. I know enough about William James to notice that the author sometimes makes him seem more of a believer than he probably was, but that's a matter of subtle shading. I don't see her getting anything I know about James definitely wrong, and I learned things that put him in a better light.Mainly the book's style is lively, the terrain often rich in detail. Some readers have complained it's difficult to read, so I've provided a brief sample in the first comment to this review. And some readers have complained about the seemingly random flow of the book, so be prepared for a less than entirely linear development. The author cares about the issues and the people she focuses on. I found the book interesting and engaging throughout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30P1AMQPUR96W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204853#wasThisHelpful","R30P1AMQPUR96W","A1K94LXX833JTT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K94LXX833JTT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since it isn't raining here, I tested the waterproofing by putting the top of the cover into a large sink, running water over it, and letting the water drain off. That left a little pocket of water in a fold of the fabric, which might also happen when in use. I checked back in a couple hours, and water had seeped through at the seam that ran under the water pocket. Not necessarily a big deal. If you use this over the kind of grill it's designed for, you can probably avoid any pockets of water collecting, though I suppose prolonged rain or high wind with rain might also cause a little leaking at seams.Other than at the seam, the fabric didn't allow water in. The double-sewn seams are moderately tight and feel like they'll hold up to ordinary use with no trouble. The fabric itself appears moderately durable. The four-year warranty is only for manufacturing defects, not for wear from ordinary use.The cover had a plastic smell that I didn't want clinging to my grill, so I let the cover air out, inside-out, for a week, and it helped. It hasn't gone away completely yet, but I don't think it will be an issue. It's most noticeable when the sun warms it up.There's an elastic draw string around the lower edge that makes it easy to slip the cover over the grill without undoing the string.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30AVZH0ZEFPN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R4J5DVG#wasThisHelpful","R30AVZH0ZEFPN0","A1K94LXX833JTT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K94LXX833JTT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't know why Amazon lists this as from 2002, but it's from 2008. This is the rental version of the DVD, identical to the regular retail version except for the bar code as far as I can tell.This is a David Mamet film about a jiu-jitsu master who finds his principles tested by extreme circumstance. The title refers to the honorary red belt belonging to his mentor. A few tips for enjoying this:1. It's not really a martial-arts or action movie. Mamet says, ""It's a story of the journey of a man who wants to be pure and gets tempted."" Though limited, what fighting is in it is well done.Mamet is a student of jiu-jitsu himself and calls this ""my love letter to the world and philosophy of jiu-jitsu."" He had the help of numerous world-class fighters, including five-time UFC champion Randy Couture, who has a role on screen (and accompanies Mamet on the DVD commentary track), world jiu-jitsu champion John Machado, who is the opponent in the climactic fight, and renowned jiu-jitsu teacher Renato Magno, who choreographed most of the fights. (It's fiction--depictions of shady activities aren't an attack on real MMA fighting, they're obstacles on the journey of the hero.)Mamet also sees this as a film noir, and there are elements of that to appreciate about it.2. Sometimes a coincidence is just a coincidence. That it's Mamet makes us look for a grand conspiracy at work from the start. Don't try to make the conspiracy bigger, earlier or more planned out than it needs to be. The grander you make it, the less plausible it is. Properly trimmed, it's plausible enough.3. Even if you have trouble following all the plot details--typically a risk with Mamet, though not unduly so here--the main character, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, is worth knowing. In this role he reminds me of Laurence Fishburne in The Matrix, but not as ponderous. (There is a little philosophy in this movie, but the principles, like the hero, are simple and down to earth.)4. Mamet sees the main character as being tested and, at a crucial point, giving up. One might easily see his action as just sticking to his principles, but if you understand it as giving up, the film makes more sense, including the slap (you'll see).Also keep in mind the principle of not being distracted. The main character meets with some powerful potential distractions near the end.5. The ending is a bit incredible in a couple ways, but if you keep in mind that Samurai films are among the models Mamet's working with, it fits the genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S7T8ZP7IYTUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CVTL4D0#wasThisHelpful","R3S7T8ZP7IYTUB","A1K94LXX833JTT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K94LXX833JTT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bostrom: ""This is quite possibly the most important and most daunting challenge humanity has ever faced. And--whether we succeed or fail--it is probably the last challenge we will ever face.""The challenge Bostrom refers to is properly controlling the creation of superintelligence, which he believes will bring awesome superpowers and corresponding risks not only to human life but the entire portion of the universe that it's physically possible to reach (humanity's ""cosmic endowment""). He gives compelling reasons to think it may be a lot harder to control than we might at first suspect. He doesn't get far in outlining solutions to the problems he raises. He's clearing space for and inviting further work.Prof. Bostrom is well suited to address this. He's widely respected as a scholar and has long been reflecting on issues of cosmic import related to foreseeable trends, particularly ones for which what humans do may have a crucial effect on the result. He's familiar with the relevant technical and philosophical points. He seems to read and write around the clock, having already published over 200 articles and a few books at the age of 41. Among the issues he's worked on over the years is whether we live in a simulation, like a cosmic computer game. May be more likely than you think! Check out his website (nickbostrom dot com) to learn more about him and the concerns in this book.The target audience, according to Bostrom, is an earlier version of himself, which would presumably be a very bright person interested in but not yet familiar with the material. But he has made it accessible to people not quite as smart as a future Oxford prof, and without a background in the technical or philosophical issues, though some familiarity with those helps. Several customers have complained it's hard to read. I'd say it's written at a college level.The urgency Bostrom feels in this book is mainly revealed at the beginning, where the above quote appears, and the end, where he likens humanity to children playing with a bomb, with no grown-up in sight. Those parts of the book have some of the qualities of a manifesto and call to arms, but the bulk of it is a lucid, measured outline of the wealth of issues involved.Though some of this book reads like science fiction, the tone is generally moderate and careful, leavened with a little mostly dry humor (e.g. the endnote explaining that not all endnotes contain useful information, or the note comparing tenured academics to a sea squirt larva that digests part of its own brain once it's served its purpose). Much of it is written in a way characteristic of how many philosophers teach philosophy, giving opposing points sometimes to the point of dizziness, but he does show his own views.The title I've given my review might give the wrong impression in one respect. Bostrom does present the likely superintelligence to come as having godlike powers and effects, and some of the ideas he covers (and some he develops more elsewhere) might make the basis for an interesting if highly speculative natural theology. But he doesn't mention God, and he mostly steers well clear of religion.He also stays away from partisan politics, but some of the ideas he advocates, or their implications, might stir up quite a hornets' nest in some political/ideological quarters, if those so inclined could be brought to take them seriously.I'm inclined to take Bostrom's ideas seriously. I may be a couple shades more pessimistic than he is, and he's far from Pollyanna. The additional pessimism is based on points he doesn't focus on in the book, probably with good reason, doubts about the limits of rationality in an existential test that appears to pit basic human motives against each other, and possible negative effects of increased rationality and knowledge on motives, something superintelligence might aggravate.In his own words from the end of the book, ""In this situation, any feeling of gee-wiz exhilaration would be out of place. Consternation and fear would be closer to the mark, but the most appropriate attitude may be a bitter determination to be as competent as we can, much as if we were preparing for a difficult exam that will either realize our dreams or obliterate them."" The reward for success would be ""a compassionate and jubilant use of humanity's cosmic endowment."" A noble goal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L11GPKOMVXXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199678111#wasThisHelpful","R1L11GPKOMVXXR","A1K94LXX833JTT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K94LXX833JTT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite the closing scene, any parallels to Casablanca are loose, but if you imagine that film with grimmer ties to the darkest elements of WWII and its aftermath, with Ilsa having descended to prostitution and terrible crimes while still maintaining commitment to a small and equally morally compromised Laszlo, with far less comedy and redemption, you'll have the flavor of this film.Clooney is the Bogart in this, and while I'm a big fan, and he's not bad at all here, he doesn't have the same noir gravitas as Bogart, which the material seems to call for.It's tricky to try to combine the entertainment conventions of a love story and mystery with such morally dark material. I don't think it entirely works here, with each undermining the other. The moral complexity of the character played by Blanchett is interesting and compelling to a degree, but the gravity of how its presented is somewhat at odds with the necessarily manipulative fantasy Hollywood elements.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37M0AEDORCA9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OY8NBK#wasThisHelpful","R37M0AEDORCA9Z","A1K94LXX833JTT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K94LXX833JTT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I put off setting this system up because in reading the manuals and the reviews it was apparent that there are a lot of details to consider in getting the most out of it, many of which require some knowledge of the technical workings. It's a flexible system with lots of options. For now I just want top use it for backup, but it can do much more.I finally went with the simplest option to start with, the basic setup with default settings and, for my Mac, a Time Machine backup. Even that had a few wrinkles, such as deciding how much space to allocate for Time Machine. (For those who use Time Machine, ReadyNAS helpfully automatically sets up a portion of the drives of the size the user specifies. By default Time Machine would use all the space available on the drives.)The setup and Time Machine backup went smoothly, no glitches. I needed to consult the ReadyNAS software manual (available online), and in some cases had to hunt a bit for the right button to click next.The fan that operates whenever the unit is on has a soft but quite noticeable sound.The two 1-TB drives that came with this system are Toshiba DT01ACA100 7200 RPM drives (from November and December 2013). User reviews at Amazon and NewEgg suggest these aren't the ultimate in reliability, though they generally perform well. They make the redundancy of the default X-RAID configuration desirable. (In that configuration, the total data that can be stored on the two 1-TB drives is only 1 TB because of the redundant storage. If one drive fails, all the data can be recovered from the other.)The Toshiba drives are supposed to be energy efficient, which is good, because the ReadyNAS keeps them spinning continually when the unit is on. You can schedule times for the unit to power up and down, and you can remotely shut it down fairly easily. Remotely powering it up is a little trickier, but can be done via Wake on LAN. NetGear says they're working on a disk spindown option for their next software update (6.2.0).Screws are included to mount 2.5"" drives.The power cord is helpfully long, a little over 11 feet, in two pieces with a power brick in the middle.The construction is solid.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AEIWO5U02PO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BNI4BE4#wasThisHelpful","R3AEIWO5U02PO3","A1K94LXX833JTT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K94LXX833JTT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It isn't fast enough to write ""up to 360 photos (8 MB) per minute,"" as Samsung also claims, though. (That would require a 48 MB/s *write* speed, which Samsung doesn't claim for this card.)Your camera manual, or online camera info, should say what speed you need, probably in terms of a speed class (see more on speed classes below). In theory you can figure out how fast your card needs to be for maximum shooting speed by multiplying how many shots per second your camera can take by the file size (in MB, not MP) of the photos. For example, if your camera can shoot 2.5 8-MB photos per second, you need a card that will write 2.5 x 8 = 20 MB/s to keep up. In practice, the speed that cards write in tests and the speeds they write for a given camera can be very different, so this can only be a rough guide. (In my own camera, a Nikon V1, doubling the tested write speed of the card doesn't even come close to doubling how fast the camera can shoot after the buffer fills.)There are other cards at similar prices that write up to twice as fast as this one, but there's usually some trade-off. For example the Transcend 32 GB High Speed Card is currently the same price and about twice as fast, but it isn't as rugged (and it lags this one in random-access transfer speeds, important for those who might use the card in something other than a camera--see below).Digital cameras: videoWith a sequential write speed that tests from 15 to over 35 MB/s, this card is plenty fast for anything short of 4K video. It's fine for 1080p HD. (For 4K video you need a consistent 30 MB/s sequential write speed, offered by some Class 10 and all UHS Class 3 cards. Currently, few consumer-level cameras shoot 4K video.)Transferring photos/video to a computerThe speed that matters when you transfer photos or video from this card to your computer is the *sequential read* speed, usually the first (or only) number cards give for speed. This card claims ""up to"" 48 MB/s. It tests close to that, mostly in the mid-40s, which for the 32-GB size means it will take about 12 minutes to transfer a full card.As with the sequential write speed, there are cards with faster read speeds that will transfer photos to your computer faster, some twice as fast or more for a similar price, but usually with a trade-off.Other devicesFor most devices other than cameras, including tablets, the *random-access* read and write speeds are crucial. Most cards that state speeds are giving sequential figures only, and some of the fastest cards for sequential transfers do poorly for random transfers, so if you compare card speeds for use in a computer or mobile device, be sure to include random speeds in your comparison. Random reads and writes are measured for blocks of data of different sizes; only results from the same-size blocks should be compared to each other.For *random reads* with *512-KB* blocks of data this card is just a little slower than for sequential reads, low 40s MB/s. That's a good speed, though nowhere near the fastest. For *random writes* with *512-KB* blocks this card tests at 23-35 MB/s, a very respectable range, faster than some otherwise very fast cards. For example, the SanDisk Extreme Pro 32GB 95MB/s card, one of the best available for sequential transfers, tests at only 5-9 MB/s for random 512 KB writes.Small-block read and write speeds are more a measure of how fast a card accesses a location in memory, so they're sometimes expressed in terms of input/output operations per second, IOPS. For *random reads* with *4-KB* (small) blocks, this card tests at 4.6-4.7 MB/s, over 1,100 IOPS, which seems slow compared to the other speeds but is actually quite good. For *random writes* with *4-KB* blocks, this card tests between 1 and 1.7 MB/s, 265-410 IOPS, still pretty good for what's usually the slowest spec for a card, about the same as for the SanDisk Extreme Pro.There are better cards for random-access transfers, but like the faster cards for sequential reads, there's usually a trade-off, often price. For example, the all-around excellent SanDisk Extreme Plus 32GB card has faster speeds than this card in every category, including the random 4-KB read and write speeds, which are roughly twice as fast (7.4-10.4 and 2.2-3.7 MB/s), but it's currently 75% more expensive. For comparably-priced cards that also have good sequential speeds, this Samsung card is among the best for random read and write performance.Notes on speed ratings and speed testsThere are two speed class rating systems for sequential writes. The older speed class ratings are symbolized by a C with a number inside, Class 4, Class 6, etc, with the numbers representing the minimum MB/s. Class 10 cards, the fastest under the old speed class ratings, write at a minimum of 10 MB/s. UHS or Ultra High Speed ratings refer primarily to a different speed (bus speed), but for sequential write speeds UHS ratings start where the old speed class ratings leave off: UHS Speed Class 1, symbolized by a U with a 1 in it, writes at 10 MB/s or faster and UHS Class 3 writes at 30 MB/s or faster. (UHS ratings use Roman numerals for bus-speed classes, currently I or II, and Arabic numerals for write-speed classes, currently 1 or 3.)The test results I give here are from various professional and amateur tests, using several programs for sequential speeds, and mainly CrystalDiskMark for random speeds. You can find such test results in professional reviews and posted online by actual users. For Amazon, there are sometimes screen shots of test results posted in the customer image section of the card's product page, located near the top right of the customer review section. (You have to be sure the results are from the same size card, as reviews of different sizes are often given together.)In sumThis is a high-quality, well rounded card that should perform well in most cameras and other devices. Not the fastest, but more than fast enough for most uses, with a good reputation for durability, a good deal for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JF1LGFRO4FRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVPU5LU#wasThisHelpful","R3JF1LGFRO4FRY","A1K94LXX833JTT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K94LXX833JTT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In most respects this is an ordinary, if fairly heavy-duty, moisturizing skin cream, with water, glycerin, and petrolatum (petroleum jelly, the ingredient in Vaseline) as the first three ingredients by weight, along with other common moisturizing ingredients like mineral oil and dimethicone.It also has an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA), lactic acid (the acid in sour milk) in this case, as the tenth ingredient by weight, which means it's not present in a high concentration. AHAs help remove dead skin cells, which can build up abnormally with certain skin conditions. Dead skin cells form the outermost layer of skin, so removing some of them removes some of the natural protection one has against sunburn. That's why those who use AHAs on skin that may be exposed to sun should also use a sunscreen.There are also other AHAs, in the form of fruit juices, in this lotion, but they're in such low concentrations as to probably have no significant effect (other than to allow them to be advertised on the front label).The lotion leaves a waxy, oily feel after it absorbs into the skin, as most moisturizing lotions do. That pretty much goes away after fifteen minutes.Though fragrance-free, it does have the slight scent of the petrolatum.The retail price of this 13-ounce size is seven bucks, if you can find it.

"This incorporates what are deemed the ""essentials"" of some of Zondervan's most popular Bible study aids. Some of the notes are aimed at beginners, both in level of understanding and in creating interest, and the NIV translation is in modern English, so this is well suited to new Bible readers. There are notes for more advanced readers too. The format is busier than an ordinary Bible, but not excessively so.The orientation of the commentary is broadly Protestant, but aside from not including the deuterocanonical books that the Catholic Bible includes, it's fairly ecumenical. The truth of the Bible is assumed. Controversial topics, e.g. contraception (page 739), the extent of Noah's flood (11), and gender roles (1476), are generally covered from various points of view, though some don't show up at all--the word abortion doesn't appear, for example.The type size for the main text and commentary is comfortable.

"This is a good lotion, but the scent is too strong for me. It's a pleasant floral scent, with some coconut in the mix, there's just more of it than I prefer. And it's persistent, lingers for hours. I see quite a range of views about the fragrance in the reviews here. Some find it just right.The lotion absorbs into the skin quickly, and leaves only a slight waxy, greasy feel, which is OK for moisturizing, but it isn't a heavy-duty moisturizing cream that can last for hours or withstand hand washing.The list of ingredients can be viewed in the second image on the Amazon product page, which shows the back label. The main ingredients are mostly natural, with water, shea butter (15%), glycerin, and coconut oil derivatives as the first four ingredients by weight, and there are numerous fruit and other plant extracts. There are also some synthetic ingredients, nothing very controversial, mostly rated low (the best rating) for health and environmental concerns by Environmental Working Group, which monitors cosmetics ingredients. A few ingredients, such as benzyl alcohol and linalool (those two happen to be naturally occurring chemicals also produced synthetically), are rated a medium concern for concentrations higher than the very small amounts in this lotion, or in regard to manufacturing issues. Some of the chemicals used, such as Lilial (butylphenyl methylpropanal), can cause irritation or allergic reaction in sensitive people (which is true of many natural ingredients as well).The front label has raised Braille lettering for ""Shea Body Lotion,"" a nice touch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J2P634SBG71L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052H2JXW#wasThisHelpful","R3J2P634SBG71L","A1K94LXX833JTT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K94LXX833JTT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That's about normal for me - I rarely read fiction, because I can't bring myself to care about the characters or the writer.These stories almost always made sense.  Competent writing... it's sometimes enough.  Good job.More books like this, please.  Keep publishing these more interesting authors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MIFVODIQ2QRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062204718#wasThisHelpful","R1MIFVODIQ2QRQ","A13G1TKIKHGV3F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13G1TKIKHGV3F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This toy has seriously been my almost 5 year old's favorite since Christmas.  She plays with it non-stop and makes the most interesting and different structures each time.  She also uses them with other toys (makes mazes for her hexbugs and chubby puppies, add-on units to her magna-tiles, etc.).  It's so cool how the little magnets stick to the walls -- and the quality of the tiles and the magnets is very good (very strong!).  The illustrations are adorable too.  Any boy or girl from 3-10 would love this.  I recommend getting the full three sets - you can get them for a package deal on the company's web site - because then you have so many more variations.  That's what we did and I never regretted it (in fact I keep checking out their site to see what's coming next - I think a pet salon and a fairy tale theater are in the works!).  I really love playing with these myself and I know my son (who is only 4 months) will be playing with them soon too.  (I think it's okay for younger kids as long as you take away the little magnets - the tiles themselves wouldn't be choking hazards and the magnets can't come out -- but you would want to store the actual little magnets until your child is 3).  Love this so much.  I really wish we had more! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I6Q9NJHD0T8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8DGYH0#wasThisHelpful","R1I6Q9NJHD0T8D","A1DD9MSMEKYOVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD9MSMEKYOVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My almost 5 year old daughter LOVED this.  We downloaded the free app which lets you create a plan out how you'll paint your project - mixing and matching until you come to the perfect blueprint.  She then really followed what she had planned out - which was surprising to me.  She took great care at matching the colors and really created something that mirrored what she had planned out on the app.  She was so proud of the end product - and took a surprisingly long, concentrated time producing it.  I love the way it came out too.  The paint seemed really quality -- thick and brilliant.  The wood was okay quality -- strong enough to survive a high drop onto concrete (PHEW).  I want to buy her another in this series. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO7BAXDWJPYW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5M3J3E#wasThisHelpful","RO7BAXDWJPYW2","A1DD9MSMEKYOVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD9MSMEKYOVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the Platinum right as it first came out in June 2015 and am very disappointed.  When it's working, my daughter really does love it (and this is a child who uses an iPad and Kindle Fire way too much - bad mommy!!).  She loves that she can design her own profile, she really likes the Leapfrog apps (which I was surprised to see, as she has so many apps on the family iPad), and she enjoys taking videos and photos (which she can't really do on the iPad because it's in a heavy case).  The apps are expensive (even with the promo codes), but she does seem to really enjoy them and they are more educational than many on the android or iTunes stores.My problem? 1) there is VERY limited memory on the device and no way to supplement it with an SD card.  It comes preloaded with advertisement apps and other junk that takes up a lot of the limited memory - and it won't allow you to fill the device to the full 16 GB (or whatever it is).  When you get even remotely close, it crashes all the time.  2) It crashes all the time anyway.  Really slow and buggy. I sent it back to Leapfrog and they fixed it for a while, but a month later and it's crashing again.  I've already had to wipe the device and reload everything after it ran updates (after less than 3 months!), and now it won't let me download half the apps -- they are in some no man's land where I can't delete them and I can't download them.  It says they are installed but they aren't.  I reached out to Leapfrog (who generally seems to have great customer service - at least the first time there was an issue) yesterday and they sent me instructions for restoring a Leapfrog Ultra (which did not work).  So definitely very frustrating.  3) The apps are very expensive.  My daughter really did like the Paw Patrol Imagicards set.  I loved watching her play with that app in particular to see her go between ""app world"" and the real world. :)Conclusion - I would recommend buying a Kindle Fire and using their kid-safe app (which my daughter loves).  This way the device can really grow with your child and you have access to Netflix and can use the tablet as a browser yourself.  If you really want access to the Leapfrog content (which I think is really great - although maybe not exactly worth the price), I recommend waiting to purchase the Leapfrog Epic, which is supposed to come out this month (September 2015).  I hope it's not as gllitchy as its predecessor.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ5P1V2QVW3J3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1P6AM#wasThisHelpful","RJ5P1V2QVW3J3","A1DD9MSMEKYOVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD9MSMEKYOVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a little hesitant to buy this toy (and I bought 2 different ones and the vet set), but no regrets! This is such a great idea VTech (which I'm usually not a huge fan of) had! My daughter loves transformers (the robots) and the power of switching a toy into another toy...and this set has that option so she feels she has options and enjoys maneuvering the set from kitchen to ice cream shop. It makes a lot of different sounds (scooping, plopping ice cream, kitchen sounds) and the girl has a few different sayings and interacts with the other girls/other sets in this line. But honestly, I don't even think all the sounds are necessary/add too much: my daughter really just loves changing the dolls' hair, clothes, and transforming the sets themselves. While she likes the sounds too, I think VTech could have made these at a cheaper price point (and encouraged more creativity) by leaving out the sound element. (Also, if there were no sounds, we could have used these in the tub). Overall though, this is a great set. I recommend getting this one and at least one other so the ""girls"" have a friend to interact with. I wish they came out with some boys for this line too. Really great line of toys though!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34NCWLZ2E6MV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAZC9PA#wasThisHelpful","R34NCWLZ2E6MV5","A1DD9MSMEKYOVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD9MSMEKYOVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My almost 5 year old daughter loved this so much.  The 6 posters are big and bright with all different themes and a diverse set of girls (redhead, blonde, brunette, and then three who could be from anywhere (Asian, Indian, African-American) but without seeming like it's trying to be PC - just a nice mix of happy, playful girls doing all sorts of activities (sports, dancing, cooking, being princesses, going to the beach - but sadly no girl scientists or artists, my daughter points out). It comes with a bunch of stickers (colorful) and a bunch of white/blank stickers that you can decorate with the included crayons and rubbing templates (which were pretty cool) to further design the posters.  My daughter has been quietly doing this activity on her own for 40 minutes...and she's rarely still for that long.  At twenty bucks, it may be a little overpriced - but we spent fifteen with a coupon on yoyo dot com, and I'm very happy with it at that price.  I recommend this for 4-6 year olds, although a 3 year old would enjoy it with some help.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KNK80PRTEPIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RHGF9EW#wasThisHelpful","R1KNK80PRTEPIC","A1DD9MSMEKYOVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD9MSMEKYOVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The songs and sounds are not annoying at all (yet?) and the food is well made and adorable. I love the sizzling sound for the egg, the way the bread can be broken into pieces, the pizza - it's any kid's dream toy. Even though the recommended age is 2-3, my almost 5 year old loves playing with it (even though I bought it for her younger brother, who is fascinated by it too). I like that it's gender neutral too.

"I never trust the reviews where the reviewer got the item for free - but I have to say, they were true here. This game is so much fun for my almost 5 year old. It is pretty easy for her (but she is at the upper age limit) - but still reinforces numbers, shapes, sequencing, etc. She's playing it while I write this and the sounds aren't too annoying. The graphics were so much better than I expected and she loves finding and using the cards. They work really well (until we lose them all - lol). I wasn't thrilled with our leappad platinum (although Leapfrog had great customer service and fixed it for us), but I'm glad we bought it now that I see how cool these imagicards are. It's really easy for my daughter to use them and it's interesting to watch her switch between using her finger, the stylus, and the cards. It keeps her more engaged. I like watching her play too! We bought this ""used"" (just the packaging was damaged a little, but still new) through the amazon warehouse deals for twenty bucks. It was worth the price. And I'm cheap! :) oh - for Everest fans (the new girl pup) - she's part of the game (and is on one of the number cards), but isn't one of the ""pup"" cards - those are just the original dogs and Ryder.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DBGW4B8IF8JP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1P5MG#wasThisHelpful","R3DBGW4B8IF8JP","A1DD9MSMEKYOVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD9MSMEKYOVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I hesitated when buying this as ten bucks seems steep, but now that it arrived I am totally happy with my decision. It is a big book w/ 100 unlined pages, some cute stickers, and decent crayons. The top handle is VERY sturdy and there is a sturdy flower clasp to secure the notebook closed (I think w magnets?). There is a clear plastic pouch to store the crayons which is is connected to the spirals on the top so you never lose them.  It's bigger/better than the plastic pouch you see in the photo -- that one is just to store the crayons this comes with, but the bigger pouch can fit more crayons too.

"My almost-5 year old loves this and it was so much cuter than I expected!  The colors are really bright and vibrant - and it would be enjoyed by a wide age range (I would guess from around 2 until 6 or 7?).  At almost 5 years old, my daughter was very interested in trying to assemble the tree, castle, and carriage (which was a little tricky for her without having the picture in front of her) - but a younger child would enjoy decorating these items with the other pieces (flowers, hearts, etc.) and playing with the squirt toys.  For this reason, I think it would be a particularly good toy for a family with 2 children to play with in the bath (or pool) together.  It had more pieces than I thought from the picture too - and the bag it comes with (which suctions to the wall of the shower) is really awesome!

"This was pretty cool!

After watching me do the first one (while I figured it out) and doing 2 together, she can now do them on her own -- but she's almost 5. She's very proud of herself that she can do them though - and I definitely think an older kid would have fun with these too (I'm having fun doing them with her). They should make sets with animals.

"This is the cutest set of little books which comes in a box which can also serve as a mini dollhouse.  The set contains 6 little board books - each of which is about 5 pages and is named after a different part of a home (kitchen, bedroom, garden, garage).  Each book fits into a compartment which is decorated as whatever spot in the house that particular book represents - and there is a cute little cardboard Jojo bunny which comes with the set (hidden behind the garden book) which my daughter enjoys placing in the spot of whichever book we're reading at the time.  This is also a great set to keep by the diaper changing table as the little books are the perfect size for little hands to hold (and to distract during a diaper change - haha).  The illustrations are SO CUTE and the books and outside box (which is also sort of a mini-dollhouse itself) are so colorful and high quality.  The box is decorated on the front, back, and all parts of the inside.  it secures closed  - I think by magnet?  It cost ten bucks at tar get.  It would make a great first birthday gift (but you would need to buy something else to go with it; it's a decent size, but not big enough as a stand alone present unless it's someone you don't know too well).

There are four adorable collage projects - each one with a very sturdy cardboard base and a corresponding envelope with the materials needed to create each separate collage (so you don't need to go through the box to separate them out).  It also comes with a glue stick. I thought the set was great but my 4 year old art-loving daughter was frustrated because I (rookie mom) was trying to get her to follow the instructions to make the exact design shown, and she wanted to be more creative (bad mom!!!). She would agree with one of the other reviewers who said that this set, as adorable and well-crafted as it is, doesn't encourage creativity.  Although she's a glue-lover, she was also frustrated that the glue wasn't sticky enough to hold the (high quality cardboard) pieces - but sticky enough that the pieces kept sticking to her hand and she couldn't get them off and onto the base board. That said, the bad rookie mom enjoyed the project very much (and I'm someone who hates following instructions!). I think she will enjoy it more when she's in a different mood. We did this on New Year's Day after too many sugary snacks (again, rookie mom) and not enough sleep. :) I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 based on her reaction (not mine - I loved it!) and because even though the quality is great, the price is high. It comes in a beautiful box and looks expensive though -- makes a nice gift.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWD4ZBRUPB8S7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012BU0L0#wasThisHelpful","RWD4ZBRUPB8S7","A1DD9MSMEKYOVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD9MSMEKYOVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 4 year old loves these.  She is already a huge Magna Tiles fan -- and we also have a bunch of the knock-off versions (Picasso Tiles, Metro Mags, Playmags - which all seem pretty much the same quality as Magna Tiles, but you can get so much more for the price.  The only one that had noticeably weaker magnets was the Stick & Stack brand, but they have really cool arches that none of the others do).  She likes these because they can make see-through ""windows"" for her creations and she likes to make cages/enclosures for her My Little Ponies, etc.  Definitely adds a whole new element to the play.  She loves to use these with Hexbug Nano (little robotic bugs - about four bucks on Amazon) -- making mazes for them to run through.  With these completely clear tiles, she can see what her creatures are doing more clearly than through the colorful ones.  When used with the other colorful tiles we already own, the ""ice"" clear ones make a really nice contrast - making the colorful ones seem more vibrant somehow.  It also helps that my daughter is obsessed with the movie Frozen and  likes to feel like she is making ice castles with these.  The only other brand of these types of tiles that I have seen which offer clear tiles is the Discount School Supply Building Brilliance tiles by Excellerations.  They are a hundred and fifty bucks for 150 tiles - but you can always find a promo code to get at least ten percent off. Those tiles are slightly smaller than the Magna Tiles but offer a trapezoid and rectangle shape that Magna Tiles lack.  The magnetic strength seems the same but they have more texture (and aren't quite as clear as the Magna Tile ice - but also a really cool look for less cost).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CFQZEZOH8HY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PRAZN1E#wasThisHelpful","R2CFQZEZOH8HY","A1DD9MSMEKYOVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD9MSMEKYOVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(I am writing the same review for this set and the related set, but if you can only pick one, I recommend buying this one as it's larger and more blocks = more options for creativity. I bought all three in this line as a group set directly from the company's own website). This is a cross between Magna Tiles (which has been my daughter's favorite toy since we bought these Build + Imagine sets) and those magnetic sets where you can build a scene using the magnets to tell a story. My daughter loves how some of the magnetic blocks in these sets have doors for the characters to walk through (unlike the Magna Tiles sets) and all the detail on the walls. The magnets are pretty strong - but it does take a little practice to make taller structures (and my daughter enjoys that challenge, as she does w/ the Magna Tiles). This is really easy to clean up and stores in a very compact way with all the magnetic walls sticking together. I have to admit, I enjoy playing with these sets too. (If you know your child already likes the Magna Tile/Magformer type sets (and I recommend those too - especially the cheaper knock-off versions which are just as good), I STRONGLY recommend these Build + Imagine sets for the added creative element. I love listening to my daughter make little stories for the magnetic characters and play with the sets like dollhouses - but also love seeing how proud she is of her architectural builds. I honestly think a little boy would love these sets too (which is good b/c I'm pregnant with one - lol). I'm not someone who got the set for free or anything like that, and can honestly say I'm so happy with the $ spent and look forward to playing with my daughter with these sets and don't even mind the cleanup. It's sort of fun to snap everything back together to put away (although my daughter cries when we break down her ""masterpieces.""). Another cool set for a younger child is the Hape Geometrics House. But I think this Build and Imagine line has more longevity as it will be more interesting to an older child. UPDATE: My daughter played with this for four hours straight yesterday!! I wish I could give it more stars.  She added magnets from other sets she had (like the Mudpuppy magnet sets) and also uses some of her dollhouse furniture in the rooms she makes with these tiles (as they are much bigger than the Magna Tiles).  I love watching the creative things she does with these sets. I really recommend getting all three because even with the three sets, she wishes she had more.  She spent such a long time looking at all the details on each wall - and she isn't one of those kids who can sit still like that for too long.  I really hope the company makes more in this line. I'll try to post photos showing how some of the walls/tiles have windows and doors which really open and close - and the beach set has a cafe window which opens down to serve customers.

"My husband has been playing with this for a while tonight and seems to be having fun (!) and my 4 year old is intrigued. The quality of the cardboard is very good and the colors are bright.  Not the most exciting ""toy"" in the world, but something interesting to have out to mess around with. Might be good to have on a coffee table or to work on together with an older child while chatting. I think there are some people out there who would love this and others who wouldn't use it twice - and not too many people in between.

"This set is so beautiful and well constructed.  The two little dolls which come with it are adorable. The colors and theme are gender neutral. I was afraid it wouldn't be sophisticated enough for my 4 year old, but she loves the unique architectural element of designing and re-designing the three separate segments of the house. I also bought the purple Hape Happy Family Modern Girl doll - and she is too big to fit with the two dolls which come with this one (although she can fit inside the house just fine - just not the same scale exactly), but my daughter explains that this is because she is their mom. (!). I like the cut out windows in the segments. There is a lot of furniture which comes with this - all of which is really sturdy and beautiful. The wood is very smooth and the paint is bright. The umbrella part is nice felt, but everything else is wood it seems.

"In highly untechnical terms, this is a beautiful monitor.Setting it up was a wonderful experience start to finish- something I can almost never say. Assembly was extremely simple and straightforward. The stand is nice and sturdy. A swivel feature would have been a nice addition, and as a minor thing is my biggest complaint. When installing the monitor to work with my computer I was apprehensive, but my computer (running windows 7) recognized the new monitor immediately on connection. It was unnecessary to use the included cd/software, and I didn't need to change any settings.The monitor itself is wonderful. The picture is phenomenal; it has clean, crisp, vibrant color. My HD tv sits right next to it, and reflects a lot of glare from the windows, but the monitor shows minimal glare. The differences that I think I can attribute to the curve are the reduced glare (wonderful!), and that the picture is sharp and clear from any viewing angle. When viewing straight on I don't notice any difference between this or a really good HD tv; that said, that kind of viewing experience is much better than most other computer monitors I've used.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCE8R3AYSU91S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012AQIQ3Y#wasThisHelpful","RCE8R3AYSU91S","A23WE2XLY1MROA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23WE2XLY1MROA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Since anybody that orders this bench will be starting with assembly that's where I'll begin.ASSEMBLY: I have put together numerous other exercise benches, from your standard flat bench press, to sit up benches with adjustable heights and angles, to adjustable bench presses with more moving parts than I care to recall. This was by far one of the easiest. Everything was clearly labeled and numbered, there aren't a million parts and screws that look identical so you don't know which is #1 and #8. Everything goes where it's shown to on the diagram and fits together puzzle perfect. All in all ASSEMBLY 10 out of 10.USE: Once the bench was assembled I decided to give it a go. It's relatively the same height as any flat bench you'll find in your basic gyms (NYSC, RETRO, YMCA, etc.) as well as being just lower than the standard bench for power-lifting. The cushion is great, plenty of it but not so soft that it creates an unsteady base for exercise causing you to shift around. As for wiggle, there is none, and that's saying something because out of all the exercise benches I've put together and even used in gyms they almost all have at least some wiggle to them. The weight limit also says 300 lbs but from my testing can easily go above (not a recommendation, just saying). The only complaint I do have about the bench is I wish the height were adjustable which would therefor allow for a greater range of exercises, but this is still one of the best flat benches I've ever had the pleasure of owning. All in all USE 9 out of 10.DURABILITY: I beat my exercise benches up, always have always will. Some last a year, some last 5. I can tell you I put this one through the ringer - dragging 45lbs plates off, resting dumbbells, exceeding the weight limit, testing weight placement on all the corners and edges... Not a mark on it that a wet paper towel couldn't remove, this thing is a rock solid piece of equipment that will easily last the average exerciser a lifetime and someone who really beats the crap of it will have their work cut out for them to get rid of this thing. DURABILITY 10 out of 10 (one of the best I've ever used).OVERALL: If you're looking for a basic flat exercise bench for a plethora of exercises and exercise styles with decent comfort and that will last a lifetime, then this is the one for you. Good job Adidas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K5ITXA1T3ED7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WHIG6X8#wasThisHelpful","R3K5ITXA1T3ED7","A23WE2XLY1MROA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23WE2XLY1MROA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Oster 12-speed blender is an ok low cost blender, but it has multiple problems, and better blenders are available for a similar price.Plastic- Most blenders today are made with plastic jugs, and this one is comprably well made.

Blending frozen fruit and large chunks of fresh banana and peaches took significantly longer and did a poorer job in this blender than in my Oster BPCT02-BA0-000 6-Cup Glass Jar 2-Speed Toggle Beehive Blender, Brushed Stainless.The blender doesn't have a large footprint on the counter, and otherwise seems generally well made.Overall, I'm not particularly happy with this blender, and would recommend looking for another.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KWFBHNS11ZOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J2DSI2#wasThisHelpful","R3KWFBHNS11ZOT","A23WE2XLY1MROA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23WE2XLY1MROA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The product statement says-- ""Grows new grass thicker and quicker""  - Thicker yes, quicker I'd dispute- ""Accelerates root growth of new grass plants and existing lawn""  - This I would agree withIf the soil is prepared properly- 5-15 inches of good quality top soil, good grass seeds, adequate water (not drought or flood), adequate sunlight, and no foot traffic- Scotts Turf Builder will help new grass grow thicker and healthier root systems, and thus thicker and healthier grass. The Scotts itself must be applied properly (more is not better). I have seen no evidence that the grass grows more quickly due to the fertilizer, but plenty of evidence that lack of proper care in other areas will stop growth in its tracks.Additionally, I like that this product doesn't include any crabgrass or weed killer, both of which prevent germination, and I think, make fertilization of new grass far less effective.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L3217CPAT9KR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DK49BXK#wasThisHelpful","R1L3217CPAT9KR","A23WE2XLY1MROA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23WE2XLY1MROA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These pruners are constructed of heavy duty plastic and strong steel blades. The unique design causes the handle of the cutting blade to roll along your hand as the blade is being squeezed, ensuring that pressure is not concentrated on one spot in your hand. This is intended to prevent significant pressure from being placed on one area of the hand, and to increase cutting power. Unfortunately, it means that the pruners are only designed for right-handed people.

"I took the plunge- literally- with this case (haha), and my ipad lived to tell the tale.The lifeproof case comes with an ipad ""stand in"", which allows you to practice putting the case on, and to test the case for defects before subjecting your ipad to potentially destructive experiences. The case is initially difficult (bit of an understatement) to get on and off even using the provided tool, but it becomes a bit easier once you're used to it. The case is made of thick, heavy-duty plastic, and thick rubber edging, which seals the ports and seals around the edges of the screen. There is no screen cover, despite the ad copy, which says ""Built-in scratch protector for total touchscreen defense"". That lack gave me a few strong moments of doubt and panic, but the rubber seals so tightly against the screen it's one of the most difficult parts to remove, and is undoubtedly secure.Once locked up tight in the case I submerged my ipad in an icy snow bank, in warm/hot bath water, and in a cool sink. No leaks, and no damage. I also dropped it from about 5 ft., twice. Both times it bounced on an corner and fell flat, with no damage. The only test I didn't perform was to drop it flat on its face, or to drop it with the screen hitting an edge.Although the case definitely adds bulk, I wouldn't anticipate using this as a day to day case, so it doesn't both me. I would want to use the case in a pool or bathtub, both situations in which the lack of stand is a drawback.My number one complaint about the case is that it comes with a 1 year limited warranty, which specifies that ""The LifeProof warranty only covers the LifeProof product - it does not cover any non-LifeProof product or device, and does not provide warrenty protection in all circumstances."" The warranty further states, ""It is your responsibility to take reasonable precautions regarding how you use your device. Expose your device to hazards at your own risk"". I considered researching and selecting a LifeProof case to be a reasonable precaution against those dangers, but since the company doesn't trust their own product enough to consider it so, neither will I.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E15VEZ174F1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOXN9NK#wasThisHelpful","R1E15VEZ174F1I","A23WE2XLY1MROA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23WE2XLY1MROA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Understanding wood/pine litter-Wood litter is produced as a byproduct from various types of wood manufacturing.  The wood is compressed into pellets, which break down into saw dust when urinated on. It is biodegradable, produces minimal dust, and is therefore environmentally friendly. It can be flushed down the toilet or disposed of in the garbage.Using wood litter-Unlike traditional clay litters which form a clump when the cat urinates, with wood litter the pellets break down into dry sawdust. The sawdust is sifted out of the box, using a slatted scoop, and the pellets returned to the box. If the sawdust is wet, either not enough litter was present, or the litter box should be cleaned more frequently.Smell-The wood litter smells like pine, much more pleasant than clay which I found to have an unpleasant chemical smell. I have four cats, and with the clay I often had to clean the litterbox multiple times a day during the summer because in the heat nothing got rid of the urine smell. With the wood litter I can't smell it at all. Unfortunately, because the litter doesn't clump, it doesn't adhere to feces, so if your cat doesn't like to bury, that can smell quite a bit.Duration-I find that the wood litter lasts approximately a third again as long as the clay litter did for equal weight; i.e. about the same length of time by volume.okocat Natural Pine Litter-I have tried other brands of natural wood/pellet litter, and haven't noticed a particular difference with the okocat litter. Unfortunately I haven't tried any of the other okocat types of litter (they do have a clumping wood litter) and can't comment on the differences.Price-The price is the biggest down side to the wood litter. It is prohibitively expensive compared to most clay litters. I buy in bulk and get a good discount, but without that option I wouldn't be able to afford it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U0AQFHHVXP9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYI0O4M#wasThisHelpful","R1U0AQFHHVXP9K","A23WE2XLY1MROA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23WE2XLY1MROA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many other readers I selected this book because of the author's name, and in spite of the title, cover, and other marketing. And thankfully, I was right to give it a chance. Although the marketing all screams romance, this is an urban fantasy that happens to have a romantic subplot. Readers who have enjoyed Andrews' previous series- Kate Daniels, and The Edge- will also like this one, and should look to summaries of those books for a better indication of tone and genre.Magical ability was imparted several decades ago by a serum administered to create better soldiers. Different abilities and power levels are passed through genetic lines; the stronger the magic, the stronger- read wealthier and more powerful- the family. Nevada Baylor runs her family's PI firm, and when the company that owns the mortgage on the firm gives her no choice, she's pulled into an investigation that is well beyond her power, on both personal and family levels. (The story is told in first person POV from her perspective.) Her investigation soon collides with 'Mad' Rogan's, (we learn about his interest in the case through a short prologue), and they reluctantly team up. As things progress, Nevada must do her best to protect her family and herself from all of the other interests involved, including the man she is trying to capture, the company that hired her, and her questionable partner, Mad Rogan, and oh yeah, save the city.'Burn for Me' is an enjoyable read, with generally good writing, but it does have some ups and downs. The world building in particular is excellent, and that information is relayed smoothly throughout the book.Writing first person point of view is always difficult, and that I barely noticed it while reading says a lot. However, it makes character development difficult, as normal individuals only do so much self-analysis, and can only know a limited amount about other characters and their thoughts and intentions. A short prologue and epilogue were designed to impart a bit more information about 'Mad' Rogan, and the over-aching plot, but are clumsy and the epilogue ends the book on an awkward note. The need for that random info relay is unfortunately indicative of the unevenness of the plot (both substance and pacing), and is my primary complaint about the book.However the overall writing is so good it disguises many of the weaknesses. I thought that the first books of Andrews' previous series' (Kate Daniels, The Edge) were more uneven than the subsequent books, particularly in terms of character development and plot, and I'm hoping we'll see the same improvement in the next book of the Hidden Legacy series.Like Andrews' other books, 'Burn For Me' has a good mix of action, adventure, and humor. Although they've written better, it was an enjoyable, engaging read, and I'm looking forward to the next book in the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DJV5X08XPYH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062289233#wasThisHelpful","R3DJV5X08XPYH6","A23WE2XLY1MROA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23WE2XLY1MROA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If it hadn't said ""reconditioned"" on the box, I wouldn't have known it wasn't brand new. All parts were present, in perfect condition on visual inspection, and all speeds/programs worked without a problem.For reviews of the actual blender, I recommend reading both the reviews on this page, and on the page for the Vitamix 5200 Series Blender, Black.I compared the Vitamix to my Braun MX2050 5-Speed Heavy Duty Blender, 220-240-volt (mine is 120v for the US). I use the blender almost daily to create smoothies using a combination of frozen and fresh fruit, and yogurt. I have also used it to chop cheese and ice, make milkshakes, and more.Construction-The Vitamix has a taller, heavier base, which means it doesn't fit on the counter under the cabinets. Overall feels very well made.The Braun has a slightly shorter, and definitely ligher base, but still feels well made.Container-The Vitamix jug is made of heavy plastic which feels very sturdy, but I am worried about staining over time from fruits such as blueberries and strawberries, although after a month it is cleaning well. The container holds 8.5 cups (2L), which is slightly more than the Braun. It pours easily; a trait I have learned not to undervalue.The Braun container is made of thick glass, and I love it. It is simple to clean, and even after 2 years of use, comes out sparkling new every time. The triangular shape of the container means that it also pours very well.Speeds/Functions-The Braun has a dial, and 5 speeds. When using you immediately turn to the speed you want, and at the end switch to off.The Vitamix has a 'Variable/High' switch, and 10 speeds within variable. You almost always start at variable 1, and slowly work up. Unfortunately the On/Off switch is separate, therefore you must remember to return the other switches to the starting position after each use.Noise-Both are quite noisy at higher levels, although not quite as bad as some blenders I've tried.Functionality-For my current purposes, the two work equally well; they both blend quickly, smoothly, and evenly. I have never tried to blend greens (spinach, kale), or hard vegetables (carrots, etc.), in the Braun, as is suggested in the Vitamix cookbook.For your basic, and even slightly more advanced blending needs, the Braun or a similar blender will serve you well (for significantly less). However, I suspect for serious juicing purposes the vitamix has the advantage, and if you're looking for such a blender, the Reconditioned 5200 is a good choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LGXISI8CUWW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K8NKWMK#wasThisHelpful","R3LGXISI8CUWW7","A23WE2XLY1MROA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23WE2XLY1MROA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was looking for a keyboard case for my ipad mini that works well, is easy to use, is a secure and protective case, and is conservative/professional looking (no neon pink). Unfortunately the Belkin universal portable keyboard only fits the bill on looks.The case is made of a conservative black leather, and appears neat and professional once set up. If that is your primary concern, this is the case for you. If not, unfortunately it's all downhill from there. The case holds the tablet in with plastic tabs that fit around each corner. They stretch easily and hold the tablet relatively securely, but there is no screen cover and all 4 sides of the tablet are left exposed to dust, dirt, etc. Fine if you're leaving the tablet and case in an office. Not great if you're transporting it anywhere. I'm not sure how secure the tablet would be if dropped.The keyboard is frustrating to say the least. I am an experienced typist and have small/medium sized hands, however have a lot of trouble using the keyboard. The keys are generally somewhat small and crowded, and I have more problems with this than other similarly sized keyboards. The spacebar in particular is awkwardly sized and positioned; 2.5 in. and right next to the internet search key. (I also have a Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover Mini for iPad mini - Black- the spacebar is 3.5 in.) After hitting the search key for the 10th time I was ready to pull my hair out.An additional note that may only bother some people- there is no Delete key to allow forward deletion (vs. the more common backspace). (The Logitech does offer this feature.)The Belkin comes with no instructions, and setting up the case itself is not intuitive. It took me a while to figure out how to prop the case up, and to discover that it only props at 90 deg. and ~35 deg.; not the best angles.I didn't have any problems getting the keyboard to connect to the tablet via bluetooth, but again there were no instructions for those who may not know what to do.If you're going for looks only, and this case will be staying in one place, this may be the right case for you. But if ease of typing and protection while transporting are important, I'd keep looking elsewhere.

"A few points about the Bose SoundTrue headphones--They are among the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. They are so lightweight I forget I'm wearing them. They create no pressure against the ears or head, no matter how long they're worn. They don't overheat or become sticky or muggy, no matter how long they're worn. The leather on the ears cups is very soft and non-abrasive.-They are made of plastic, which doesn't feel particularly heavy duty (probably why they are so lightweight), but don't feel as if they'll break any second. The ear cups swivel widely, and the plastic is flexible in general.-They feature a long cord, with inline volume control and microphone that work great. They also come equiped with a study carrying case.-The sound quality is excellent for this level of headphones. As I explore different headphones more widely, I am gaining a better appreciation of the more subtle differences between different headphones and different brands. (Although my ability to describe such differences remains minimal.) These headphones generally sound great. As for more subtle differences, the Bose-lover in the family can't get enough of them, saying the sound is ""stronger"", while I prefer my Sennheiser Momentum Headphone - Brown, which I would describe as more ""detailed"".In the end, there is no better way to choose headphones than to try them out youself, especially to determine whether the size and fit are right for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REGXL9HYA54V0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUICOR6#wasThisHelpful","REGXL9HYA54V0","A23WE2XLY1MROA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23WE2XLY1MROA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is for the Almonds w/ Cranberries, Honey, and Sea salt, one of my favorites of the Sahale Snacks line--They are healthy: 4 grams of fiber, 7 grams of protein per bag; although they do contain 17 g of fat, none is saturated fat. 220 calories is not unreasonable for a snack of this size with this much protein.-They are tasty: The almonds and cranberries are delicious, the salt is at the perfect amount to add a bit of flavor, but isn't too salty, and there is just a hint of honey and sesame seeds to finish it off. (I couldn't taste any vanilla.)-The quantity is perfect: 1.5 oz per package; The measurement doesn't mean much to me, but eating a package leaves me satisfied, rather than still hungry, or over-full.-The packaging is good: It is easy to open, but sturdy enough that it doesn't tear all the way down and spill everything.-The price is reasonable: I have seen similarly healthy snacks offered for more than twice the price; although these aren't cheap, they are reasonablly affordable.I highly recommend these, and have already ordered another box for myself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PX8OCPT2Z5PI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8VGD0E#wasThisHelpful","R2PX8OCPT2Z5PI","A23WE2XLY1MROA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23WE2XLY1MROA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This printer meets most of my requirements for a good printer, excels in a few areas, and leaves me with only one complaint.-Size:  The printer is small (~12 x 6 x 18""), and lightweight (~10 lbs).-Quality:  It prints excellent color, (and I'm quite picky). It also prints good black and white, and has gray scale and draft options to save ink.-Speed:  It isn't the fastest printer on the market, but at ~20-30 seconds per print (faster for B&W, slower for color), it isn't the slowest either.-Set-up:  Unlike the Epson WorkForce WF-3540 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner, 2-Sided Duplex, ADF, Fax. Prints from Tablet/Smartphone. AirPrint Compatible (C11CC31201), which I recently tried and found a disaster to set up and use, this Canon Pixma was a pleasure. It took less than 5 minutes to set it up on 2 laptops, a smartphone, and an iPad. Fantastic.-Warranty: There is a good 1-year warranty from Canon. (A rarity with less expensive electronics these days.)Complaint--Ink cartridges: Rather than come in individual color cartridges, they are a block of color cartridges, and a separate black cartridge. The color block costs $50 to replace, almost the same cost as the printer itself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MLF4GHPGJNN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1XI900#wasThisHelpful","R2MLF4GHPGJNN3","A23WE2XLY1MROA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23WE2XLY1MROA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The most important thing to realize when selecting this product is that it is a 1 year license. In other words, you will need to repurchase Office, or at least a new subscription, in a year. There are multiple packages for Microsoft Office 2013, each slightly different, with a different cost. I recommend looking up a chart and comparing each before making a purchase. (The basic version, 1 user, no time limit is Microsoft Office Home and Business 2013 - license (T5D-01575) -.)Office 365 w/ a 1 year subscription contains a bonanza--Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher, and Access-SkyDrive with 27 gb of storage, free for a year-Skype with 60 minutes of international calls free per month-Licenses for 5 computers (either PCs or Macs)However, there are notable exceptions for macs--OneNote, Publisher, and Access are not available for Macs.-Office 2013 is PC only; Macs receive Office 2011. (The updated mac version is produced the year after the PC version, therefore expect Office 2014 for Macs.)If you are buying for PCs there are few changes in 2013 from Office 2010, but if you have an earlier version, the update is likely worth it. Similarly, if you are buying for Macs and don't already have Office 2011 it may be worth the purchase, but otherwise wait until next year.The registration process is clear and easy to complete, registration of further computers is also simple, and adding the subscription to your skype account is as simple as putting in your password. Unfortunately the installation process is not so simple. Although the installation problems on the Mac were eventually sorted out; on the PC it eventually ""failed"" and could not be completed, desite entirely uninstalling previous versions and spening more than 3 hours following various instructions.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R188G2VGC5A4TX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SPTUW2#wasThisHelpful","R188G2VGC5A4TX","A23WE2XLY1MROA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23WE2XLY1MROA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Whirlpool Energy Star 70-Pint 2-Speed Dehumidifier is, as far as I can tell, identical to the Hisense DH-70K1SJE4 Energy Star 70-Pint 2-Speed Dehumidifier, with the single difference being that it does not have an ionizer. The Whirlpool dehumidifier comes with paperwork saying that it is manufactured by Hisense, and all contact and repair information refers to Hisense. That said, I've been relatively happy with both the Hisense and the Whirlpool.The Whirlpool meets many of the important points I look for--It is constructed of sturdy plastic and seems well made.-It weighs approximately 20 lbs, (not including water, which can add a significant amount of weight), but has wheels on the bottom that make it easily maneuverable.-It has a large water capacity.-It has an automatic draining feature, that is very easy to set up and works well.-ALthough it doesn't come with its own hose for the automatic draining, it uses a normal garden hose, rather than a proprietary size as some do, which makes it easy and cheap to buy a hose and replacements.-When manually emptying, the drawer slides out very easily, and is easy to replace. (This is a very important point, as in some humidifiers they can be almost impossible to fit back in correctly.)-The noise level is standard for this size dehumidifier. (Although I am using the unit in a basement; I'm not sure I'd want the noise in a living area, but I don't think I've ever had a dehumidifier quiet enough that it wouldn't bother me in a living area.)-It is an energy star model.-It has digital controls, which are bright and easy to see, and the buttons work well.The controls/display include current humidity and temperature, and a timer.The settings allow control of--Fan speed (low, high, and auto)-Deired humidity (continuous, normal, and auto dry)-TimerThere are several ways the humidifier can be controlled--You can set it to maintain a particular humidity, leaving it on constantly.-You can turn it on with a particular fan speed, leaving it on constantly.-You can set it on a timer to run for a certain length of time. However, unlike other humidifiers I've used, this is a one-time setting. I.e. It can be set to turn on for 2 hours, but cannot be set to automatically turn on every day for 2 hours.-You can set it to turn on at a certain time. However, when using that setting, as far as I can tell, you can't set the length of time it will run; you need to come back to turn it off.I have two main complaints about this dehumidifier--There is no warranty. This is a massive problem for a relatively expensive item. If you are considering purchasing, I would recommended learning what purchase protection is offered by your credit card.-Second is the lack of specific control of the timer; more specific controls would allow more efficient use and energy savings by allowing it to be turned off when not needed. Although it can be set to turn on at a specific time once, it cannot be set to turn off, so it will be running until you can make it back to shut it off again. Also, it is a one-time setting. I.e. It cannot be set to come on at a certain time every day. However, this seems to be fairly standard in every dehumidifier I've seen recently.Overall a solid dehumidifier; although it doesn't stand out in any way, I haven't had any problems with it after more than a month of use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R377BVXRJ8VK26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CYLYKJA#wasThisHelpful","R377BVXRJ8VK26","A23WE2XLY1MROA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23WE2XLY1MROA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good wraps made out of strong, supportive material. Unlike some wraps, these are not just made out of fabric, but instead are a thick, wide foam (2in x 6 mm) that is both more supportive and more comfortable than plain cloth. These are just as supportive and well made as the more expensive Schiek Black Line Heavy Duty Wrist Wraps.The wraps are well made. The metal bar provides leverage to get a tight wrap, but never bothers the wrist. The wraps are quite secure, and never come loose, even on heavy lifts. After 3 weeks of use there has been no stretching or loosening of the fabric, and the foam hasn't become compressed or weakened. These have been used for benchpress, weighted dips, and shoulder presses, and have been great for all.Although the notes say hand wash, there have been no problems machine washing on cold, and hang drying. They do absorb a little bit of sweat every week, so this is necessary. Other than that they are perfect, and highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RWK1KSCKYVYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BS2O39I#wasThisHelpful","R2RWK1KSCKYVYA","A23WE2XLY1MROA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23WE2XLY1MROA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coffee is one of the most difficult items to review; ask 5 people what makes good coffee and you'll get 5 different answers, and 5 different descriptions of the same cup. To offer a well known point of comparison, I would describe Starbucks' Pike Place roast as a medium/dark roast that has a strong flavor, is smooth, non-acidic, and minimally bitter. I'd describe Peet's regular similarly, albeit slightly stronger. I enjoy even stronger flavored coffee, but would describe such as extra-strong/bold.I like strong flavored coffee, with bold/full body, without bitter or burned taste, and usually drink it black. I drink decaf just as frequently as regular/caffinated, and expect there to be no difference in flavor between the two. I am always looking for new and interesting sources of coffee (my version of micro-brew beer?), and found the history of Community Coffee interesting.Unfortunately, the coffee doesn't hold up to the promise. Although smooth, I would describe the flavor as weak at best (watery at worst), with little body or aroma. I tried adjusting the grind, and brewing it extra strong (3 scoops for 1 cup) willing to accept an increase in acidity for increased flavor. Although there was little increase in acidity, there was also little increase in strength; it didn't make a notable difference. It is possible that I had a bad batch, but I had the same problem with Community Coffee Whole Bean Coffee, Cafe Special Decaffeinated, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3).Although the Community Coffee half-caff didn't fit my needs, those who like lighter/mild coffee without acidity or aftertaste, may find it to their liking.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCJP6D9VZ86NS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BIEU700#wasThisHelpful","RCJP6D9VZ86NS","A23WE2XLY1MROA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23WE2XLY1MROA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amy Lane's writing can roughly be divided into longer, more serious and more emotionally involved novels, (ex. Dex in Blue or Sidecar), and shorter, lighter novellas, often with a bit of a suspense plot thrown in, (ex. Turkey in the Snow or Knitter in His Natural Habitat (Knitting Series)). (She also writes in genres other than contemporary.) Both groups of books are good in their own right, although I tend to prefer the former.Left on St. Truth Be Well is novella length, and unfortunately, although  has a great deal of promise- a strange and interesting setting, a funny character, and an engaging mystery- it doesn't come close to meeting it. The dialogue is smart and funny at times, but rushed, inconsistent, and confusing at others. The mystery is given little attention; although the mystery being secondary is normal for Lane's shorter books, it should be woven throughout the plot, not brought out, or ignored, when convenient. The pacing is inconsistent, both in the plot and in the prose. Overall, the book reads like a first draft of something really promising that needs some strong editing.Amy Lane is capable of so much more, and if this is your first time reading her work, try one of the other books linked above before you give up. They are more than worth it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TKNJ7MFX1XGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4OH4LG#wasThisHelpful","R3TKNJ7MFX1XGW","A23WE2XLY1MROA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23WE2XLY1MROA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Think Thin Brownie Crunch Bar-Taste/texture:On the first bite it seemed powdery, but it quickly became smooth and had a pretty good taste; although taste is all relative, so certainly don't expect a great chocolate bar.Ingredients:There are lots of ""health"" bars out there from big named companies that are known for ""health"" food that have trans-fat and unhealthy oils in them; having read all the ingredients in Think Thin I don't see any such oils (ex. palm oil, etc.).There are in Think Thin, as in every food (except maybe for those you grow yourself), ingredients I am not knowledgeable about, for example ""Maltitol"". Although I did look those ingredients up online, and there were no red flags. Bottom line, in comparison to other protein bars the Think Thin is healthy. (Cliff Bars are other protein bar I have found with no bad oils etc. that are also reasonably priced.)Protein, Fiber, Calorie content:Protein is very high: 20g per bar (vs. Cliff bar- 9g)Fiber is ok: 2g (vs. Cliff bar- 4g)Calories: 230 per bar (vs. Cliff 250)Price-Cliff bars are often sold for ~$0.99.

"Update- 8/15/14After approximately a year of very light use (2-3 hours a day once a week or less frequently), the sensor that determines whether the bucket is full has broken and the dehumifier is completely non-functional. Because the machine thinks the bucket is full, the extractor/dehumidifier function won't work.Original review- 4 starsThe Friedrich D50BP 50 pint dehumidifier hits all of the major comparison points that I look for--It is constructed of sturdy plastic and seems well made.-It weighs approximately 40 lbs, but has wheels on the bottom that make it easily maneuverable.-It has a large water capacity.-It has an automatic draining feature, and comes with its own hose.-It has digital controls, which are bright and easy to see, and the buttons work well.

It is possible to set the unit to maintain a specific humidity level (between 30-90%), or set the timer for a specific length of time.

"This is the perfect size knife for me when I am peeling and cutting fruits. I have tried using other paring knives but the handle was either too short or the blade was short. The knife is really sharp so be careful using it, it cuts through fruits like apples and other tough fruits with ease. I love the fact that the knife is very sturdy and the handle is wide enough for me to hold, which is very important when it comes to the handle due to my arthritis and carpal tunnel.

"My son had a pirate themed birthday and these are great party favors for our guests. We had little pirates running around and well these also fit many of our big kids (the moms and dads at the party). The black felt is soft and does not irritate the skin and the skull is eye catching and on there pretty clean. Only thing I did change for my own boys was the rubber band that holds the eye patch to the head, the rubber band slips to their free eye, where I was afraid it can cut them. I did however changed the rubber band for a black ribbon I just tie, the boys like the ribbon better.

There is no flaw from the ribbons that wraps around the ring to the feathers that hang down the dream catcher.

"I accidentally came across this title on Amazon and decided to pick it up about a month ago. I had forgotten that I had it until I was on vacation in Los Angeles last week and it showed up on my Kindle. I wound up reading it in 2 days under an umbrella at the Malibu Beach Inn then by chance met some friends for a late night bite at the Polo Lounge.  I started to wonder so I thought Id see who I could find that would fit the descriptions in the book.  I couldnt help grinning like an idiot when a Maitre d named Mr. P showed me to my table by the bar, and I think Shakil was my server. I was seated at table 25 where the newscaster Rob Kovacik had his lip split open by a crazed Lisa Vanderpump fan. Although my waiters name wasnt really Shakil the description fit very well.  He even managed to mess up my dates order, a Pellegrino with lemon -- Shakil served lime.  Ha! Where was Pauli when I needed him?It really was so cool sitting there and remembering the details of the story as they were so fresh in my mind from just finishing the book. I felt like I knew the place from the inside out. As I looked around I saw the bartender and the barstools where some poor woman had shat herself, and the musician who was performing was the same man Pauli had described in the book.  He was playing his guitar, singing and blowing into a harmonica whilst playing bass with his feet -- simply amazing and all with fluidity and great pizazz. The story of Waiter to the Rich and Shameless came alive for me right before my very own eyes.I will not forget my visit to Los Angeles, and Paul thanks for being my tour-guide in Beverly Hills, your book topped off a great vacation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTV902FTK4QH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXA0TX4#wasThisHelpful","RTV902FTK4QH0","A2ILYMPTWSD4JK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ILYMPTWSD4JK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As far as the taste goes this has a pineapple/citrus flavor. I really like that they have used stevia as one of the sweeteners, I'm not crazy about the fructose as I am trying to avoid sugars that spike  an insulin reaction but it is an negligible amount (*I've given the ingredients below).I like to mix this into my unsweetened iced tea, perhaps those that do not like to chug a nutritional supplement  would like it better if they enjoyed it as a beverage as part of a meal or ""coffee break"" with a snack.As far as seeing the benefits of it, I am 58 years old and while I know there is medical studies that show these nutrients ar VERY beneficial for us as we age, I cannot attest to SEEING results with only a 21 day box, which is also strange that they didn't package it in a 30 day/serving package! I mean really, why only 21 days??  I like it but I don't think I would pay this much to continue with it long term as I cannot afford the price with our budget but if price wasn't an issue I would definitely continue because ingesting this in a drink gives you the very best absorption of these nutrients as all other similar supplements I've seen have magnesium stearate, cellulose other binders and fillers etc that  hinder absorption.Calories 36Total CarbohydratesDietary FiberSugars1.6 g0.2 g0.9 g<1%<1%**ProteinPeptan Hydrolyzed Type-1Collagen Peptides7.2 g8,000 mg14%**Sodium (as sodium hyaluronate) 3 mg <1%Vitamin C (as Ascorbic acid) 180 mg 300%Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) 0.9 mg 53%Folic acid 0.4 mg 100%Biotin 20 mcg 7%Pantothenic acid 25 mg 250%Manganese (as manganese gluconate) 2.4 mg 118%MSM (as Methylsulfonylmethane) 300 mg **Beta-alanine 250 mg **Hyaluronic acid 5 mg **Immortelle (Helichrysum arenarium) flowers dry extract 20 mg *** Percent daily value based on a 2 000 calorie diet.** Daily Value (DV) not established.Other Ingredients: Fructose, powdered lemon juice, natural pineapple flavor, stevia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ8VSQMNYM8XY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KZGVB2#wasThisHelpful","RQ8VSQMNYM8XY","A2WC9NFLG57W4H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WC9NFLG57W4H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed this for my ipad Air2, but when the E7 arrived none of the lights came on that indicate charging... maybe this was just a defective batch...Anyways I purchased from Amazon (not a third party seller) so I had no problems initiating a return, the next day Anker contacted me and worked with me to resolve my problem. The replacement battery they sent arrived with 1/2 a charge (there were 2 blue lights steady and 1 blinking) I plugged it into the wall with my ipad Air2 charger and their cable that came with it and by morning it was fully charged. It works exactly as described. I charge my ipad with my Apple cable my ipad came with. Now any company (*especially one that makes these batteries) can have an occasional lemon but it is what they do about it that keeps consumers either coming back or away in droves.....I have NEVER received such great customer service from ANy company for ANYTHING like the way Anker provided me EVER!!!Not only was it prompt and courteous but I didn't even solicit them for help!!I absolutely detest those long drawn out ordeals where you argue with someone forever and then they pass you off to another person and you have to explain all over again and nothing usually is accomplished other than you having wasted hours from your day/life! In hindsight I should have contacted Anker BEFORE initiating the return, perhaps there was a ""fix"" they could have walked me through. I feel bad for lumping them into the same category as other manufacturers that could care less about customer service.They really are different. from now on I will buy their products with confidence. I've already told my kids that are in college that these are the ones to buy! They are Computer Science majors so any ""tech"" type info really gets around fast there at their University. Anyways, the replacement battery is working fine as described.

"We recently switched from latex to nitrile  gloves when  treating rescue dogs with contagious skin issues like ringworm and mange. Nothing was worse than having a finger pop through the latex gloves when rubbing medicine into  their contagious lesions. We would have to stop and disinfect our hands and resume , which made it harder on the animals and us!!  The nitrile gloves are superior in every way, they fit better, last lomger and actually are cheaper per 100 as we use less per animal. Well all of a sudden I noticed my supply of the blue Amnex nitrile gloves was diminishing more rapidly than usual and I discovered that my husband and sons were ""borrowing them when working on the engines in the cars they were restoring! So when I saw these black ones that were better suited for their needs I gave them to them to use so they would leave mine alone! A bonus is that now when they come in and out of the kitchen door here is no black grease marks all over the door where the pull it closed , I would have to wipe it down daily or we would look like we were dirty slobs when people came to the door.

"These are much more puncture/tear resistant than the latex gloves we've been buying. We work a lot with rescue dogs and most arrive having skin issues so these are so nice because we can apply treatments without having to double up on wearing 2 pairs of latex gloves so we can get through a treatment now with one pair of these nitrile ones without them breaking through.Even though the latex ones are cheaper per 100 box, we actually were spending more money on the latex because we always had to wear 2 pairs as they broke apart so easily!  So if you are watching your pennies and have to double up on the latex gloves continually you might want to switch to these nitrile ones and save a little $$ and frustration!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20LJRDQ0B8N3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DQRC5E#wasThisHelpful","R20LJRDQ0B8N3H","A2WC9NFLG57W4H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WC9NFLG57W4H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this fragrance it is light and floral, not overpowering at all. I am very sensitive to most perfumy products like fabric softeners and scented detergents, this is just right. I use 3 sprays and it works surprisingly well  and it doesn't give me a headache like most perfumy things do.So why the 4 stars instead of 5?Well the bottle is a regular type spray bottle and to use it to aim INTO the bowl you need to hold at a horizontal angle down pretty far down into the bowl if you do not want to spray the seat, and as you use the contents up, your ability to tilt it and produce a full spray lessens!For $10.00 ($9.44 plus tax) this is too pricey to lose the remainder due to the sprayer not working when tilted almost horizontally  to get it into the bowl. So I deducted one star for that, maybe they will read this and find a way to revise the spray pump to work when held horizontally.I would definitely rebuy a 2 OZ bottle to take w/me when traveling and visiting friends if they could fix that spray issue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12N5AJFSVPR3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01486Z5G0#wasThisHelpful","R12N5AJFSVPR3L","A2WC9NFLG57W4H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WC9NFLG57W4H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So don't think they are ""unscented""! As for their colors and tips, as good as any others I've used. Then why the 2 stars??They are ""Amazon Basics"", they are supposed to be a better value, these are more expensive than my name brand Expo low odor chisel tip markers that are for sale here on Amazon!

"My husband and boys have always worn Dockers so when I selected these for my son I assumed even though they are ""slim & tapered"" they would fit around the waist the same. I was wrong, I think we needed the next size up 34X32 instead of the 32X32.Other than that they are well constructed as the norm is with Docker products, so if you order up a size you should be good. We were only offered this one size to review so we have no way to exchange them for the next size up to be perfectly sure.

"This is probably one of my best purchases for my home office in a long time. I've used it for everything from running printers to desktops to extending the range on my external HDDs.

If you are planning on extending any of your peripherals over anything over 5-6 meters go for a repeater! If it was available in 3.0 I would give it 4 stars!

"OK, so I am one of those gadget people.....We had a spiralizer for about 3 months before we saw this recipe book, which was great timing as my enthusiasm (and my family's) for all things ""zoodly"" was waning fast!*BTW you can get a spiralizer very inexpensively now on Amazon,but I digress, the timing for this recipe book was perfect for us as I had pretty much thought I had exhausted the meal options for my beloved zoodles.But OH! Wait! There's more you say......... (sorry couldn't resist the ""infomercial"" in me) ;-PThis book is BIG on easy flavorful and quick meals, *one of our newest favorites is the Shrimp with slow roasted tomatoes and zucchini linguine.I've attached pictures so you can see the steps and how delish it looks and can better imagine how good it tasted.My only negative would be that there are not many pictures (there are only about a dozen) I really like to see how, what I am making, is supposed to look when finished. Even though it is weak in that area we found the recipes to be excellent and flavorful and a great jumping off point to customize many of them to suit our family's tastebuds. Like with this shrimp recipe, it goes without saying all the various protein substitutes you can do to this along with spicing it up or into a more ethnic version with your favorite spices.See my pictures of this recipe, it was A mazing!!

"My first impression was, ""WOW"", sharp looking headset. You can tell some thought went into this design.I would say that the very best thing about them is their sound system.After testing them for an entire day the feature I am most impressed by is the GREAT sound options that you can customize to whatever you are doing whether listening to music with the pure direct bass boost  or the clear chat during game play.The movie theater dolby surround option is not just for watching movies, when in a fps game it gives you an edge with the assistance it provides with footsteps etc. It also has a competitor & stereo mode that are pretty good as well.  It is totally customizable to suit YOUR preferences in different situations. *The Cue software it has allows you to control the headset, keyboard & mouse as well!Now for the not so awesome features...OK, it is EITHER going to be the cool lights or the run time due to the battery consumption of those cool lights.....Oh the choices we have to make...sigh......If you use this with the lights on (*you can select any color  you want and 11 different effects!) but that will only give you about 6 hours of play before they need to be re charged.If you disable the lights  (*which btw also disables the notifications on the mic, so NOT cool!) you get about 20 hours of playYeah....your choice. If you are a casual user for only a few hours a day, no biggie but if you are like any of my friends this is a MAJOR issue!You decide but for me that is a HUGE miss!Also as for the comfort, it is so-so. while they are well cushioned and feel great at first, after hours of play I noticed that they kept creeping forward, which is not a deal breaker, just annoying at times when you are sitting for hours and not taking a break and removing them more frequently than I do while gaming or whatever....The mic is just OK, it would be better if you could adjust it in and out, not just up and down and leave the light feature on for it to send notifications when disabling lights on the rest of the headset to extend the battery life for all day/night playing....Construction is average for a headset in this price point. There are strengths and weaknesses.  The average headset at this point usually lasts me about a year of heavy use.....it looks like these should do that. I will update if they fail anywhere.Overall I am pleased with them, they are not perfect but more towards a 4 than a 3 star rating IMO","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32LIPYC4JG4X9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013GMX9HE#wasThisHelpful","R32LIPYC4JG4X9","A2WC9NFLG57W4H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WC9NFLG57W4H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've already dropped it from counter top height and no problems,...whew!! It has a unisex look to it. It is not aimed at either gender by the color and I just love leather!!I have not had the issue with the mount needing to be reglued t but then I've only had it for a little while.

"My A/C is the main reason our electric bill is OUTRAGEOUS, I have a houseful of people that leave AFTER I do (college kids) and turning down the A/C when they leave is never at the top of their thoughts as they rush out the door to get to class. This lets me stop fighting with them and take control of the matter without having to be upset when I come home and find the A/C has been running all day at a low temp!  So if you are the one that pays the electric bill but are not the last one to leave your home each day, GET THIS!!  Not only will it save you money it will keep peace in the family/home if you have someone else living with you that can't remember to turn the A/C off (or higher) when they leave for the day!Now if you were just wanting an  ""app""  to replace your remote controller for your A/C system I would say pass, this smart A/C control only controls the very basic functions of off and on and adjusting the temperature. It does not control the speed of the fan or anything else your RF remote that came with your A/C does.What this can do is remotely, (VERY remotely!)from waaaay away from home, turn it off for you IF, you, in a mad dash to get to work, forgot to turn it down  and left it running full blast! If that is you, this will save you LOADS of $$! But FIRST if you have an older A/C unit check their website for information on supported units. If yours is not on the list but does have an RF controller they say that it most likely can work but it will take a bit more time setting it up as like with any remote it has all the most popular ""brands"" pre set info at the top pf the list and then as you go down the list to find the correct setting for yours. you may need to test each one until you get to one that works for your A/C unit.  We used it with our ihone 6 and did not have any problem but one person said they had an older phone that they couldn't  get to work with theirs so as long as you are at their website looking at the A/C units you might want to check that out also if you have an older phone. *They have an online LIVE ""chat"" option so you can just ask them any other questions you might have!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R597Y0HKYTHGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010ACFKNE#wasThisHelpful","R597Y0HKYTHGT","A2WC9NFLG57W4H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WC9NFLG57W4H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I live in the south and my family just loves fried foods (who doesn't!?) but as that's not healthy for you, we rarely indulged in them. Well now with this Delonghi Low Oil multifryer  we can have them as often as we want without feeling guilty.There are so many things this fryer/cooker can do besides just your run of the mill  french fries and fish, there is even a free app here with an ever expanding, online recipe book that you can install here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.delonghi.kitchenapp.prod&hl=en_GBI am going through a stir frying phase as this takes all the work out of cooking it with the stirring mechanism and the non stick ceramic coated pan makes clean up a breeze! The pan is dishwasher safe but it is just as easy (and faster) to wash it out with a soapy sponge or nylon scrubby. I am so SO glad that they did not use teflon (like so many other manufacturers do) for their non stick surface as it would have negated the health aspect of this low oil, multi cooker.Sure it costs a bit more than some but look at how it is made and all it can do from frying to baking or cooking fast or slow full sized one pot family meals like stir fry or chili! They thought of everything even the clear lid so you can see the progress of your dish without letting all the heat out.As for the convection fan, in the multi cooker, noise aspect I would say it is quieter than me running my gas oven or stove's hood/ exhaust fan on high, (like I do when I'm cooking) to vent out all the heat that cranking up that range/oven gives off! Not to mention the energy savings running that small tabletop appliance verses my oversized gas oven which in turns makes my refrigerator work harder and my A/C!So if you really look at what it offers, I think you would agree it ends up being very economical and portable to boot!This has a relatively small footprint (aout a foot wide and high and about 15'""deep) as far as ""fryer"" that can cook family sized servings at 1 time. I've found that the key to getting food really crisp faster is not to over crowd and it comes out nice and cripy that way also.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R68QD6KYB05J4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCP6OU4#wasThisHelpful","R68QD6KYB05J4","A2WC9NFLG57W4H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WC9NFLG57W4H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have very dry skin, that said, this Gel/Cream certainly did moisturize it rapidly with no greasy residue. I applied it right after washing my face and it did a very good job of making my normally tight and dry skin feel moist and supple all day. Now if you like a dewy fresh face look (no matter your age) this will definitely deliver! If you are looking for a fast absorbing cream for under your make up, you may want to test it on a weekend to see how rapidly your skin absorbs it all in so it is dry enough to apply makeup over it.  I only have to wait about 10 minutes but my daughter who only has dry ""areas""  on her face had to wait about 1/2 an hour until her face wasn't so tacky feeling. Once you get the correct amount and now the timing there is no problem.

"Admittedly, I never volunteer to open wine or champagne bottles as it always seems a daunting and frightening task. Although most bottle openers are purchased at low cost for home use, not all are and this product is certainly different.Sent to me for review, this product comes very well presented in a very modern and retro box and has 2 separate units inside, held by protected foam, a simple photo user guide and a hand written note.The 2 set pieces are made of high quality material that's fit for purpose with the main materials in question being the steel 'body' and chrome on the exterior.In terms of design they have a 3 in 1 function as they can be used as a corkscrew, bottle opener or serrated knife for removing the top foil. You also get the bottle stopper.In use, I found that these worked very well and I didn't have any issues with opening bottles. They were a good size and had fit for purpose designs.

"This product was sent to me for review and my biggest concern was will it fit my large sized yoga / pilates mat. Thankfully it did!.From a quality point of view, it's high quality with a less smooth harder material on the outside and a much smoother material on the inside. It closes via a zip and has a shoulder strap that's removable at one end.There is a zipped pocket on the outside thats ideal for holding your phone, car keys, purse, wallet etc. The pocket is more than twice the size of a hand (approx) in width and there are ventilation holes at the bottom of the bag. There is also a netted zipped pocket inside for either holding similar items as listed above or something different.In use, I found that this protected my mat very well and it saved the yoga / pilates mat from having a soaking when it was taken from the car park to the yoga class in my nearest town.

"My partner bought these for us last year as we were having a Halloween party in our house and we only had a strict budget to work with.The stickers are made of high quality material that's fit for purpose. They are well made, have a nice design and good quality artwork.Applying the stickers to the correct locations was reasonably straightforward and the bubbles generated underneath the stickers were easy to get rid of.The product looked very good on our white toilet seat but not as effective on the black toilet seat. The feedback that we had from the party guests was of a positive nature (along with  a couple of screams!) and they hadn't seen anything as unique as it before.

The solar panel unit comes in 3 parts and took seconds to put together.Once mounted, you can adjust the solar panel via the adjustment mechanism and having it in the ground lets you move it left, right, forward and backwards. There is a power and mode button (8 modes) on these and with the 'warm white / yellow' produced they are ideal for any time of year.What I like about these is that you don't need electricity to power them and they seem to pick up light well.

They certainly weren't cheap and the best deal available on Amazon at the time was 4 Panasonic ones with free delivery (I had to borrow some from my neighbour before mine turned up because non prime deliveries can take ages).The cable is 13.1ft in length and there are 50 LEDs spread out over that area. The battery box is very military and that along with the rest of the product is green. There are 8 varied modes on the control box and these offer a good amount of options.In use, I found that these worked very well and I really liked the light colour that they produced. They can be used indoors or outdoors and if you cannot find an area that receives the least amount of rainfall then you can put a resealable zipped food bag around them. Not essential but it's what I do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DIPVKX1G2H7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010LMMJFU#wasThisHelpful","R3DIPVKX1G2H7J","A3OPEGX73TES11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OPEGX73TES11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product was sent to me for review. The quality is good (for the price point) and the materials in question are plastic and metal. The size is large and the mass is lightweight.The design on this is modern and boho and the beads are oval shaped. The chain is extendable and attaches via a clasp. What I like about this is the colour and geometric pattern.I found that these were more ideal in a formal setting such as a wedding but also in informal settings such as cinema, casual dining or going out drinking. It goes well with smart clothes with a nice blouse being a top pick or a nice dress of a turquoise colour.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VYZCV4R6QJTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009DK9504#wasThisHelpful","R1VYZCV4R6QJTV","A3OPEGX73TES11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OPEGX73TES11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Art therapy books are extremely popular at the moment and they seem to be with everyone I know, including me!. This pencil set was sent to me for review and come in a set of 36, 48 and 72. I received the 72 so I could comment on all 72 colours.The quality is good given the price point (colouring pencils are not cheap these days) and they are hexagonal in design which means that they give you a better grip (much better than the circular type).They are normal coloured pencils and not water coloured and the 72 offers an excellent range of colours with some colours being present more than others (e.g - 5 reds, 4 oranges, 4 yellows, 9 pinks, 6 purples, 12 blues and a very rare mint!).In use, I found these to be nice to draw with and they are quite waxy on the paper / books. There were plenty of warm colours to choose from  (e.g yellows, pinks, reds, oranges, purples) and an adequate amount of 'Cold colours' (e.g blue, green, brown, black).The pencils are an ideal size for teenagers and adults (average sized pencils). Our 6 year old uses pencils that are half the size but the quality is not as good. With my experience in this field I would say that the 36 set would offer enough colours for children about 7-8+, the 48 size would offer enough of a selection for teenagers and non artist adults whilst the 72 size would be more ideal for more skilled artists.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMHHUHP6M6YN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01532TSCA#wasThisHelpful","RMHHUHP6M6YN4","A3OPEGX73TES11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OPEGX73TES11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product was sent to me for review and is the second set that I have received in 3 weeks. They come in a small box along with a microfibre cloth and a drawstring bag (there are no instructions).There are 3 lenses in the box; wide angle lens, macro lens and fisheye. They attach to a clip and then you clip the clip onto the outer section of your camera. I've tried them on several devices and they worked OK.They are quite easy to attach and once cleaned / attached the end results were quite good. The  wide angle lens increased about 50% of the viewing angle so you can see more from the same distance.

"This product was sent to me for review and my first impressions were of a very well made thermometer (for the price point).I've come across thermometers like these before and they are usually thin and fairly small. This is the exact opposite as its chunky and longer. The instructions are documented on the back with more useful instructions on the Amazon product description page. Sadly, this did not come with batteries but it only needs 1 AAA.It's easy to use and gives you readings within a few seconds. It can operate from -50 Deg C to +300 Deg C. In use I found this to work well and be accurate. I really liked its chunky design and you can fold it back on itself when not in use so you hide the temperature probe. The probe is quite a good size but would be more ideal if it was slightly longer.

"This product was sent to me for review and came in a small toothpaste sized box. Inside the box you get a hand sized 15ml hard plastic tube with sealed plastic surrounding it.The applicator delivers an accurate shot of white cream that has a very appealing and unique scent. Although there are a number of different ingredients present, the one that came through the strongest was the rose.I've been using this for about 2 weeks and found that it was best to apply after cleansing and toning and half a 'pump' application was enough to cover both eyes.It certainly made a difference as the areas around my eyes were slightly smoother, softer and healthier looking in general.

"We bought these last Halloween and had low expectations due to their price. We thought that we would at least try them as we only had a small budget to work with.There are 3 in a pack and they measure about 35 inches in length. To save you getting the ruler out, that's about the same height as your kitchen bench or waist height for many.They are essentially balloons with a plastic sheet (ghost bags) and twist ties.The quality and artwork is a bit disappointing but OK for the money. They were a bit of a fiddle to put together and there were certainly no 'willing victims' for the task.We firstly placed them outdoors and found that the wind blew them too much. They were better indoors, especially when placed relatively near the doors. If its not windy outside though they are suitable for outdoors.Would we buy these again?. Probably not but they were worth trying at this price point and the kids liked them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPZYWL0MGHA6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FWW1NG#wasThisHelpful","RPZYWL0MGHA6Q","A3OPEGX73TES11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OPEGX73TES11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Note: This product can be used with both indoor and outdoor plants.Sent to me for review its made of good quality material that's fit for purpose and whilst the 19cm long probe is made of a bronze coloured metal the 8 x 5 x 3cm upper section is made of a green plastic with a 3.7 x 2.1cm viewing panel with the measuring numbers ranging from 1-10 with 1 being the driest and 10 being the wettest.Now before anyone jumps to a conclusion that all plants must be somewhere in the middle of the scale think again as each plant requires an ideal range and these are printed on the back of the packaging. In total there are approx 150 plants listed and that's very useful information to have at hand as not all meters supply it.It does not require any batteries to use it you just insert the probe into the root area and make note of what the reading is. Once you have finished you simply wipe the probe clean and dry it carefully. You then adjust the moisture levels of the soil accordingly and continue to monitor each plant on a frequent basis using the guide at the back.For anyone that might be thinking ""yes but my plant is not on the list, how do I know what moisture levels it needs a lot of plants come with a plastic insert which gives you that information included when to water it and what sunlight conditions it needs. If it doesn't have it then you can obtain the information from a reliable website after you have types in 'plant moisture level guide' into a well know search engine (Amazons reviewing guidelines does not allow reviewers to add Internet links on reviews I'm afraid).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R280792D84JZUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W2ZKK38#wasThisHelpful","R280792D84JZUL","A3OPEGX73TES11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OPEGX73TES11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've always been amazed at how many people don't monitor the moisture and pH levels of their plants and these days, there are many products available which can do it easily for you and most are incredibly simple to use.Sent to me for review, this product is classed as a 3:1 meter as it measures pH, moisture levels and light. At 27.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm its a few cm shorter than a full sized ruler and at 118g it's lightweight due to the thin probes making up 3/4 of its length.To use this you just insert the probe deep into the bottom of the roots and wait for the meters readings to stabilise. In general, 15-20 seconds should be ample time and the results are then displayed very clearly with a separate test scale for each.Upon completion of the test(s) you just clean the probes and match your indoor / outdoor plant type to the chart at the back of the pack.

The 2 cups are much thicker than normal and have memory foam. Secondly, the strap can be adjusted via a strong velcro.I found that having the cups large and more padded with memory foam covered more of my eyes, blocking out more light and the wider velcro secured it better to my head.

"I must admit that I've never been a big fan of electric salt and pepper grinders as they don't seem to last for long enough in terms of durability.This product in particular was sent to me for review and stands at a similar height to a 1L milk carton or large hand. The quality is good (mainly stainless steel) and the design is modern.Unfortunately you will need 6 (yes - six) AAA batteries and they don't come with it so you will need to factor that into the price point. To open the battery compartment you just align the arrows and twist.I loaded this with black pepper corn which I already had in the house and it worked well, a few minutes latter producing sufficiently fine pepper 'powder' with the unit being able to control the 'fine-ness' by twisting the bottom to +/-. It also has an LED light at the bottom which comes on when you grind the peppercorn.As an added bonus you get a 2 years warranty and for me that's very important because our last 2 only lasted 12 months and 18 months respectively.

It's made of good quality stainless steel with a sufficiently long handle that's made of 'TPR' which appears to look and feel a lot like normal plastic but with a thin, rubbery exterior.I've been using this for nearly a week and have found it to work well, creating well formed, sufficiently thick slices which were ideal for our sandwiches.

"I decided to buy this product and another 2 seitan brands from Amazon during the spring of 2013 as I had temporarily switched to a vegan diet and found it challenging at the time to find a suitable protein source that I could have with salads etc (I had very limited cooking skills). For anyone that has never heard of this product Seitan is a type of textured vegetable protein made from wheat gluten, used as a meat substitute.Because it's suspended in a watery solution the seitan looked very fresh when I removed it and I cooked it in virgin olive oil at a temperature setting of 4 from 6 in the frying pan. When it started to harden I added a variety of spices to it (garlic, turmeric, parsley and sage) and kept on turning it until it just started to turn dark brown. Total cooking time was about 10 minutes. If you leave it for longer it will dry out. I added it to a normal salad with himalayan salt, pepper and I really enjoyed it.I also cooked it without any spices but the taste was very, bland therefore I believe that it is a must that herbs & spices are added (add the ones that you enjoy the most). My favourite 2 to date are curry powder and turmeric although adding too much can make me cough repeatedly.In summary, this product is an decent tasting meat substitute when added with herbs and spices etc. I also believe that it is healthier and easier to digest than meat.I also bought 2 other seitans at a similar time (as mentioned earlier) and I found them both to be more or less identical in appearance, texture etc so I cooked them the same way with the same herbs etc. I still found them all to taste very similar if not identical and I concluded that all seitan might taste very similar.(For that reason my 3 seitan reviews will sound quite similar. I usually buy the one that offers best value at the time).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN96U04XRZWHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010DR9EUQ#wasThisHelpful","RN96U04XRZWHN","A3OPEGX73TES11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OPEGX73TES11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"BRI Nutrition Phytoceramides - An All Natural Anti Aging Healthy Skin Supplement Derived From Wheat, 30ct 350mg Veggie Caps from Beautifully RadiantGetting old is something I have to do, but I can do it with grace. As we age, our bodies produce less of a lipid (fatty molecule) called ceramide. This results in wrinkled, rough, aged skin. Phytoceramides are the plant-derived extract equivalent of your body's ceramides. Ceramides, replenish the lost ceramides, thus restoring the skin from within. We can do all we want on the outside of our bodies, but we know health begins from the inside, so does anti-aging. I have been taking this for about a month now, and I can see a glow to my skin and I can tell a difference in the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes. I love that this is 100% safe and natural with no fillers or artificial ingredients. Do I recommend it to others?

"ZAQ Jellyfish Essential Oil Diffuser LiteMist Ultrasonic Aromatherapy with Ionizer and Color-Changing Light - 80 ML Capacity.I chose this diffuser because of its unique shape, I have a large SUV and a power adapter and when I go on trips, I love to be able to diffuse my oils. I find it makes the trip much more enjoyable. At 80ml capacity, it will run for up to 4 hours, which it perfect, it takes me almost 4 hours to go see my son and daughter-in-law, and other day trips. Its unique shape helps it to fit in my console without being in my way. I can put it on the no light mode so it isnt distracting at all. When I use it in my home, I find the soft LED lights very relaxing to look at. I love that it shuts itself off, so if I stop and were to forget to turn it off, it wont continue to run for hours and run my battery down. It is very energy efficient. It is very quiet, so it doesnt interfere with my music, or when Im on a phone call via Bluetooth. The ZAQ Jellyfish Diffuser is BPA free and is made of safe, health friendly materials. I love this diffuser and it definitely gets 5 stars! I am more than pleased with this product and would recommend it to others!

"I recently reread this story together after rereading the 3 preceding books in the series. Sadly I didn't enjoy this one nearly as much. There are lots of other summaries and reviews so I'll just say that this one was too modern in feeling, I felt like it was the Regency version of ""Criminal Minds"". The dialogue between the main characters had lots of modern moment that were jarring too. I wonder if the author wasn't pressed by a deadline to finish this book - it would explain so much.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L7XP6RRMA118/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671744208#wasThisHelpful","R2L7XP6RRMA118","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This author has the ability to write very different main characters in each book in a series - I think that it's a gift! There are loads of summaries and reviews so I'll just say that I loved the way the h loved her husband and had absolute faith in their love (even though the H never loved her in the beginning) - it was so sweet.

"I recently reread this book as I read it ages ago and I enjoyed it the second time around. I like the way this author writes and her main characters were as good as the ones in the first book in the series. There are loads of reviews and summaries but I'll just say that I loved the way the h led the H a merry dance at the beginning. I liked that the h was strong without being overbearing.

"I quite enjoyed this story after I got past the first half. As others have said, the h was way too managing and strident for me in the beginning. I'm not fond of a shrewish h even though I understood she had a heavy load bringing up her large family by herself with very little money. The H comes along to deliver the sad news that the h's brother died in the war. Although he didn't know the brother very well, he was asked to deliver some letters and money to the h. They get off to a difficult start and when the H offers a marriage of convenience, the h suggests that he ask her sister instead. Once we got past all of this I began to enjoy the story more as the interactions between the main characters were better. The H seemed to manage her better and she didn't come off as shrewish as she had been for the first part of the story. I liked the fact that this was a clean and traditional book. It's a pity that there were so many errors that I assume were made when converting this book to Kindle format.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G9TMEYN9KYAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDTQCQW#wasThisHelpful","R3G9TMEYN9KYAG","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoyed this Christmas-themed short story about an Earl meeting the sister of one of his injured guests. The h's twin brother is injured in a hunting accident and loses his sight temporarily so the main characters begin corresponding. The brother talks the H into coming home with him for Christmas. The h is having a hard time because she lost her mother a year ago and her father is still mourning. She is responsible for everything in the house and she has been unable to have her season because she was nursing her ailing mother.

"I really didn't find this story sweet at all. Firstly it is riddled with errors, which usually only get on my nerves when I'm not fully involved in the story (as was the case here). The author switches words e.g. stroke instead of stoke, ring instead of wring and she misspells e.g Cane instead of Cain (and Abel). She also has the dubious honour of using a swear word that I don't believe I've ever read in a Regency before and hope never to read again. Aside from that the word 'wh**e) appears on nearly every page and got on my nerves. I realise I sound like a prude and maybe I am but I read romance for escapism not for crudity. The story itself was also fairly weak in my opinion, the middle bit where they were travelling to London really dragged on.+++Spoilers+++Finally the ending requires a leap of imagination since I doubt it would ever have happened in those times. After the H took the h's innocence and he was the illegitimate son of a traitor, I'm pretty sure the h's family would have taken his life in those days instead of happily overlooking all of that and allowing him to marry the h.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V0GNXAEOGEWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LAE8S4K#wasThisHelpful","R1V0GNXAEOGEWX","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this book years ago before I began doing reviews and decided to reread it. It's one of those books that can be reread without losing it's initial appeal. I loved that this had a h with a difference. When she was a child she was raised by Native Americans and then sent back to England in accordance with her late mother's wishes. When the main characters meet the H is intrigued by the h and the strange things she says. The H was burned by his first marriage and is not keen to remarry again - ever. This being a romance of course means he doesn't always get what he wants.

"This is one of those times when I'm going to disagree with my friends regarding a book (some of the other reviewers) because I didn't love it. Let me clarify immediately by saying that I don't like second chance love stories as a rule, and there are 2 of them in this 3 novella book. Obviously Ms Balogh writes very well and that saves this effort.Please don't read any further unless you want to know what I disliked enough to spoil the stories.+++Spoilers+++I don't like second chance love stories and I really hate infidelity even more. Both stories contain adultery. The first story had a particular set of circumstances and was easier to stomach than the third. Both stories were about married couples seeing each other for the first time after years of estrangement. However the fact that in both cases the husbands never sought out their wives sooner to sort things out again spoilt the stories. The third story also contained a paranormal element that might annoy some readers. The middle story wasn't terrible but it was a bit ""insta"" to be very believable given the H's history and some of his thoughts about his mistress.Nothing this author writes is ever terrible and if you can live with the above then you'll enjoy this compilation","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VTLNVC1LR0UD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CN53KA#wasThisHelpful","R2VTLNVC1LR0UD","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Firstly let me say that if you read the reviews you could become confused. There is a mixture of reviews for 2 different books - this one and Everything and the Moon. The main characters in this book are Alex and Emma and only reviews mentioning their names are correct. Then added to that there is no Amazon summary of this story. This tale involves a Duke, Alex as the H and the h is Emma, an American heiress. Emma has been helping her dad with his shipping business for years and hopes to take it over from him one day but her father has other ideas and sends her to her aunt in England for a season. She meets the H in an unconventional way when she is dressed as a maid and is concussed after saving the H's nephew's life. Neither of the main characters want to get married and it's a bit of an annoying theme. I believe this is one of the author's earlier books so it lacks her later finesse e.g. the misunderstandings and bickering detracted from the romance. I doubt I'll remember this book in the future.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AO66ZXJ726RB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC28BC#wasThisHelpful","R3AO66ZXJ726RB","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been rereading this series because I'm so miffed at the latest offerings in the Regency historical romance genre. This is another that didn't improve in the rereading. There are hundreds of other reviews so I'll just say that whilst the H was a wonderful secondary character in the other 3 books preceding this one, he didn't make a great H in his own story. I found him whiny and far from the witty and charming character we'd come to know. I also didn't find this story particularly romantic and let's face it, it's hard to accept his falling in love with a character he's overlooked for 12 years. Normally this author creates a wonderful romance between her main characters but I just didn't feel it here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R314623BP53SAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC1PNE#wasThisHelpful","R314623BP53SAE","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are already tons of reviews here so I'll just say that this story is my least favourite in the series for more or less the same reasons that the other 3 star reviewers gave. I bought and read this book years ago (when I didn't do reviews) and recently reread it because I'm so disillusioned with the current crop of new offerings in the Regency genre. This one didn't improve in the rereading.+++Spoilers+++I think one of the things that killed me the most was the fact that the H kept harassing the h to be his mistress. It's not a theme I love to start with but the H would not let it go and eventually took the h's innocence. This despite the fact that she told him several times in the past that she didn't want to and we know she feared having a child out of wedlock because of her own sufferings as a bastard. The h annoyed me too with her not telling the h who she was, it went on for too long and became annoying. She loved the H and her status as an Earl's illegitimate child would have made it easier for them to marry.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FXRKA3UF2Y4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC1PN4#wasThisHelpful","R2FXRKA3UF2Y4C","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After really enjoying the 4th and 5th book of this series, I didn't love this one for the same reasons I didn't like the first two in the same series. Once again we have a wilfully strong h who rushes headlong into all sorts of situations. The h's brother is arrested for the murder of his best friend and fellow soldier. He asks his sister to hire his former Captain, the H, as his lawyer and she does. The H begins putting his defence together but here is where the h began getting on my nerves. She kept certain information to herself and began to try investigate things on her own, which put her in danger. The H seemed to be forever bailing her out of difficult situations and she isn't at all grateful. On several occasions she questions his strategy, which I found particularly annoying. I wanted to remind her that the H was trying to save her brother.

"I read this as part of the KU programme and thoroughly enjoyed this sweet and clean romance. The H eventually comes back from the wars to take up his estate near to where the h lives. The H is the younger son of a Duke and an eligible bachelor who wants to find a wife. The parents in the surrounding neighbourhood are keen to match him up with one of their daughters. The H's sister arrives on the scene and is also keen to match him up and even invites one of their childhood friends to stay with them, in order for them to discover that they suit. In the meanwhile the h is busy trying to make sure that her family are provided for after their father dies. To her horror she discovers that he is the writer of the gothic romances that her sister and aunt enjoy. The only way for their estate to prosper is if she finishes off her father's last book. It's a lovely story and quite entertaining. Some readers might not like the fact that the main characters only really come together towards the end of the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ226RLB30Z1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CRSLUU#wasThisHelpful","RQ226RLB30Z1V","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The story isn't bad but there were things I wasn't crazy about. The H is a commoner and a soldier and well below the h's place in society. He rescues her when one of the h's suitors tries to compromise her. The h's parents don't accept him as a possible match because of his low birth and try to force her into marrying the suitor. When the suitor tries to force himself on her whilst 'proposing' to her, the H rescues her again. Meanwhile the H is on his way to Lohenberg (a fictional country) because the ambassador believes him to be related to the current king. The H is adamant he isn't related but slowly he begins to remember things from his very early childhood that perhaps confirm that he is. At one point the main characters pretend to be married to allow them to travel together on their own and the inevitable happens. It's a theme I'm not crazy about because neither of them consider that she might fall pregnant. Now the boot is on the other foot and the h believes she isn't good enough to marry royalty.

"This was my first book by this author and I loved it. The main characters are 'forced' into an engagement early on in the book through circumstances where they end up helping an injured friend of the H. The h fancies herself in love with another man and the H is not keen on getting married at all. They both enter into the arrangement for the sake of propriety but agree to get out of it as soon as possible. We have the historical backdrop of the Georgian era and the background of the Jacobites rebelling against the English. The injured party is a Jacobite with everyone trying to find him including the h's love interest (he's an English soldier). The story follows many twists and turns involving the injured friend and our main characters trying make sure he doesn't get captured. The relationship between the H and h develops very nicely throughout. I enjoyed this book and the only thing putting me off reading the rest of the series is the price of each book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROEQRY1JMQ8I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WBFPBA#wasThisHelpful","ROEQRY1JMQ8I6","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've slowly been reading through this author's books and enjoyed most of them but this one was just average. I'm not sure what precisely I didn't like aside from the fact that the H, an Earl, is presented to us as a strongish character, yet he doesn't have the backbone to stand up to his aunt arranging his marriage. In fact he actually runs away from the event where everyone expects him to propose to the woman his aunt has selected. He is in hiding at one of his lesser estates when he meets the h, who is living with her family in a cottage on the H's estate. Initially the H really just wants to dally with the h but over time his feelings change towards her. The h was extremely irritating in her insistence that she was incapable of loving and I think it was taken too far by the author.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EM0PSDH50Q11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044UHWHQ#wasThisHelpful","R2EM0PSDH50Q11","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've liked so many of this author's books and I enjoy her writing style but this story was not her best. The other 2 star reviewers sum up my feelings well so I'll just add that I thought the whole plot was silly. Basically the selfish, selff-absorbed, petulant and spoilt h wants to prevent her father from marrying a woman nearly 20 years his junior. The H wants to prevent his childhood friend from marrying the h's father because he wants to marry her himself. How can I respect an H, who acts so foolishly when he's supposed to be a mature, worldly wise Earl? I just couldn't make the leap that the h would propose to this other woman. The contrast wasn't acceptable and it was hard to view him as a H when he just seemed stupid. The h was very unlikeable as a character too.

"After reading a very disappointing preorder this morning, I had the joy of reading this delightful Victorian this afternoon. I wasn't really sure of what to expect as this is the first book I've read by this author but I truly liked her writing style. The h is a spinster of 28 years, who has come from India to England to settle her family, a younger sister of 20 and twin brothers of 11, at the estate her father has inherited unexpectedly as as an Earl. The h is a managing type of female but I liked her because she really loves her family and wants the best for them and this always came before any of her plans for them. She is quick to admit when she is wrong. Her sister is a beauty, whom the h wants to marry well but in the end she accepts when her sister finds true love in a person that the h didn't quite agree with. The H is initially introduced as a bit of a tough and jaded customer but we slowly see their relationship develop and grow. It takes quite a while for the h to recognise her feelings since she never had intentions of marrying or falling in love, She was quite content with managing her family and their homes on behalf of her thrice-widowed father. I think other readers rated this book lower because there's no real conflict or tension but I actually enjoyed this aspect of the book. It's a traditional and clean romance too, which I highly recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TPWB0LXXTXC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MZ3QEO6#wasThisHelpful","R2TPWB0LXXTXC8","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I preordered this book some time ago hoping that Ms Foley would produce a new series up to her old standards (Lord of Fire, Lord of Ice etc). Unfortunately very quickly in, I realised that I was going to thoroughly dislike the book. Already in the first scenes where the H and h meet again, the h sees the 2 prostitutes the H has spent the night with in his house. Aside from the problems I had with the story itself, I found that the author filled pages with background filler scenes. It felt like she was having to make up a certain amount of words and since there wasn't enough happening between the H and h, we were treated, for example, to scenes in an artistic house that the H supported.+++Spoilers+++Unfortunately more disappointing was the fact that the h, who had loved the H for years, still threw herself at him and didn't back off. I'm really not fond of this kind of plot as I think it very demeaning to women in general. The H has always had everything his way and gets whatever he wants. I also felt a bit disgusted by the H and his sordid background, I kept thinking he might even have STD's with the way he carried on. After the first time he pleasures the h and she confesses she loves him, he rushes off immediately to a brothel even though he isn't able to do actually do anything. It doesn't stop him getting 2 prostitutes again soon after that, and although again he doesn't have sex with them, he plays cards with them until they end up naked. Meanwhile this doesn't stop the h from chasing after him and this is all only 60% into the tale. No matter what the H throws the h's way, she's happy and accepting - loads of women - no problem, 2 illegitimate children by different mothers - again no problem because of course he's changed. In fact they go to see the H's son and he's sick so of course the h begins nursing him. There is no tension in the story i.e. no misunderstandings, no instance of the h fighting back or testing the H in any way.  The h is just so worshipful of the H that in the end it made me feel nauseous. It's all just easy for him as per usual, he gets whatever he wants including the h doting on his 2 children. I found the whole book extremely tacky and obviously a 'mistorical' with an incredibly undeserving H and a besotted, naive h. I won't bother to go into the details of their trysts and how they were unchaperoned and spent nights and days together alone. How she was happy to go to his lair, knowing that he'd done the same thing in the same place with dozens of other women. She wasn't special in any way as far as I'm concerned. There is no way on earth I would believe that this guy would be faithful in the future. The book wasn't romantic. I'm very disappointed and will not be preordering any further books by Ms Foley.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPIWKV6571AKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012LFQFV4#wasThisHelpful","RPIWKV6571AKY","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been enjoying this author's work over the past week or so but I didn't love this one. I think the problem with short stories is that you don't have a lot of time to develop the characters. Here the relationship between the main characters was too 'insta' to be believable. The h meets the H while she's rushing off to get to her childhood sweetheart because she's desperate to marry him before he marries someone else. The H is burnt by a previous relationship and he was conned out of all of his money and property so he can't get involved with anyone at this point because he can't support a wife. It was too much to swallow at one point, when they met up with the H's ex at an inn.

I liked the way the H fell for the h so quickly but was in a sticky situation because he was already engaged to be married - with a wedding date looming in the near future. It was very difficult to see how it was all going to work out for the main characters because the H's fiancee is a Duke's daughter and she is not willing to let him go.

"I just loved this story and it had me laughing out loud in so many places. I read 'A Pressing Engagement' some time ago and this is the follow up to that story but it's not necessary to have read it, because this story does stand alone. The h is an absolute character throughout the book. The idea is that the h is acting as companion to her cousin Winifred, and she is trying to marry her off well so that she can then get her younger sisters launched into society. Unfortunately Winifred is a bit of a loose cannon and is dead set on becoming an actress rather than a wife. Winifred is also very beautiful. The H comes along as Winifred's guardian but if he doesn't get her married off in a few weeks, he will be obliged to marry her himself, which he absolutely doesn't want to do. For all sorts of reasons visitors keep arriving at the property that the H has inherited and where Winifred and the h have been staying. Winifred decides to put on a play and gets all the visitors roped in to acting in her play. It's a great Regency romp and well worth reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1668BRZ06KETY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WDRXZQ#wasThisHelpful","R1668BRZ06KETY","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Our h is a talented artist and ends up being paired to a book with the H, who writes witty commentary on the ton. The H is engaged to a beautiful woman, whom he adores and refers to as a goddess. The h is plain and can't compete but over time her friendship with the H develops. The h is taken under the wing of her good friend and given a makeover.

"I thoroughly enjoyed this story and reread the ending chapters three times because I loved them that much. I liked the way the author revealed bits of the back story slowly so we weren't party to what happened between the main characters all at once. It was a bit mysterious. I liked both the H and h and thought that the story developed at a nice pace. We were shown the love story and I liked the fact that it happened over a longer period of time rather than being all 'insta'. Our H wasn't the marrying kind and all our h seemed to want was a steady, reliable husband after her adventures in Africa. I did feel a bit sorry for the h's fiance as he was obviously a sweetie and in love with who he thought the h was but we do realise that they both had a lucky escape in the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REZL84TIXPOW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3HFF4E#wasThisHelpful","REZL84TIXPOW5","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a huge fan of this author and have read everything she's published but this one was lacking something. I do like the 'best friends to lovers' theme but this wasn't entirely convincing. It didn't help that it was a short story so there was no time for real development of the characters. Still a mediocre story by Ms Adams is better than the best of others.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV6A24HXE8EZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OPIACK#wasThisHelpful","RV6A24HXE8EZ7","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read a number of this author's books over the past few days and this was by far the one I enjoyed least. I think it's mainly down to the fact that I didn't like the h very much. I found that she came along all guns blazing to get her nephew recognised as the Earl in place of the H, without any kind of sensitivity towards the H and his family despite him being the perfect gentleman and taking her claims seriously. I didn't like that she immediately began referring to him as Mr Beresford instead of by his title - she showed him no respect. All of her claims still had to be proven and who was she to decide that he was merely a mister? Then throughout she was hot and cold with the H and he was so nice towards her all of the time. Honestly by the end I just didn't care anymore.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SE1P9AMOFGLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047O2RHE#wasThisHelpful","R2SE1P9AMOFGLJ","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a lovely, lovely book. It's a clean and traditional Regency where the h is impoverished and then rescued by a distant relation who is a duchess. The duchess is one unpleasant person, who decides that she can mould the h into the perfect wife for her son, the heir to the Dukedom. Unfortunately for both the duchess and the h, the h is not meek, mild and biddable. The H senses a marriage trap and decides to act like he's crazy, which backfires on him because the h is incredibly compassionate towards him but actually thinks he is crazy. There is a secondary love story in the background but I like that it wasn't perfectly tied up in neat little bows. I highly recommend this story","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CX8QUOPI0WHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00642RMS6#wasThisHelpful","R3CX8QUOPI0WHZ","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't love 'mistress' themes in my Regencies but I made an exception for this book and I'm glad I did. Basically the h is the illegitimate daughter of a famous courtesan and nobleman. She was gently brought up in a ladies academy thanks to her late father but when he dies and then the owner of the school does too, the h is left unprovided for. She goes to her mother for help and the mother promptly 'sells' her to the H in settlement of a debt. The H is blown away by the beauty of the h and decides to make her his mistress but the h will not agree and this is the theme for most of the book. The relationship is developed throughout the story and it had a very sweet hea. It's clean and traditional too. Unfortunately there were formatting errors throughout the Kindle version, which were off-putting because on nearly every page there was a line break with '151' and then 'Playing to Win'.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LOUJ6OE6PQRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KYZ9C0#wasThisHelpful","R3LOUJ6OE6PQRX","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this book ages ago before I began doing reviews. I was reminded of it by another reviewer and decided to reread it quickly because I couldn't remember it at all for some reason. I found it delightful all over again and although both main characters are strong, I enjoyed their interactions very much. I loved that the H was adamant about marrying the h regardless and never changed his tune. We saw him changing (rather than being told) from a hardened rake and fortune hunter, and even though he didn't realise it, the h was changing him as their relationship developed and deepened. The h unfortunately tended to be a bit annoying, and her absolute stubbornness about not marrying did eventually begin to wear on my nerves and cost the book that precious extra star. I absolutely loved the last couple of chapters and adored the hea these characters reached through a touch of brilliance used by the author. Well worth reading.+++Spoilers+++It's perhaps worth mentioning that the book is largely clean and although there is a strange type of steamy scene where we can imagine what actually happens between the two (heavy petting), no details are really given. One wonders why the author really bothered with it at all - although it does serve as a plot device to get the h to finally agree to marry the H.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XNDYFX0FMRST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0066B2GD6#wasThisHelpful","R2XNDYFX0FMRST","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this bundle as part of the KU programme. It's a pity that a few updates weren't made to make them a bit more modern because we hear about faxes and mail etc. I think part of the dating is also the harshness of the Hs in most of these stories - I seem to remember this trend from about 20 years or more ago. The other big stumbling block for me personally is that 3 of the 5 stories are second chance stories and I'm not a fan of them.+++Spoilers+++Sell me a dreamI truly gritted my teeth through this story. I usually love this author but this one was a bit harsh. As I said, I'm not a fan of second chance love stories usually and this is one of those. Unfortunately the ""H"" and I use that term loosely, was incredibly nasty to the h for most of the book. The h was no prize either since she never bothered to tell the H that he was a father after they divorced very quickly. There were non stop incidents that bordered on cruelty at times. I didn't like the fact that the H kept buying his daughter material stuff either. Truthfully there were so many things I didn't like and right at the end when the h asks the H not to hurt her or be nasty to her he replies that he can't seem to help it. OMG that's a few pages before the end.Once and for alwaysAgain another second chance love story and this is one where the h had rejected the H's offer of marriage some 8 years before. She is a model and he is a business owner in a small town. What tore them apart is she wanted the big city life and thought he shared the same dreams until his father got ill and he went back to the small town he came from to help his dad. He proposed before leaving but made it clear that he wasn't interested in ever living in a big city. They meet up when the h has a shoot in his town. The attraction is immediate but it turns out that the h is a widower and has a 6 year old child. It's a difficult story to read and again the characters are not particularly nice to each other - I had no idea how they would ever get their hea. The h was as bad as the H but also quick to give into her attraction for the H despite not wanting to live in a small town. The H had some nasty things to say to the h on several occasions, which doesn't endear him to the reader. One question that was never resolved satisfactorily but raised up by the author - was how the H quickly married and had a child with another woman after being so in love with the h at the time. It was glossed over in my opinion.An Uncommon AffairIt was one of the 2 decent stories in the book mainly because it wasn't a second chance love story. The premise is pretty cute in that the h and H end up owning half an old, dilapidated house that needs a lot of work done to it. The H wants to own it outright as he is getting married in a few months time and he tries to buy the h out. The h has given up her life in LA to come and try to jump start her career as a comic strip artist and has an opportunity to be syndicated if she gets it right. Sparks fly from the beginning and it's fun to read initially, although it's irritating that everything seems to go the H's way more than not. When the two eventually give in to their attraction for each other, and I appreciated the fact that the H had broken up with his fiancee by this point, it all seemed to point towards a nice hea. Unfortunately the two have a big misunderstanding (I'm not a fan of them) and what truly irked me is that the H never bothered to try and sort things out. The two quickly decide to get rid of the house and the h packs up to move back to LA. Really?? I would want the H to fight but he can't be asked and is unemotional towards her. Truly the ball was in his court but if it weren't for the fact that the h bumps into him while she's packing and she decides that they need to at least part amicably, then I didn't get the impression he would have tried to resolve things. There is a point during their final confessions where the h thinks that if she doesn't confess then he's going to walk away from her forever. Gosh it would't have killed him to make a grand gesture. Not the best hea everThe Best-made PlansThis is the third and final second chance story where the main characters had been involved as teenagers 10 years before. The H cruelly rejected the h after she gave him her innocence and confessed her love for him. This is always a very hard plot device to swallow at the best of times but the fact that the H continues to make nasty and snide comments to the h for most of the story, really, truly got to me. He makes remarks about how he was never prepared to marry her on more than one occasion and then he congratulates her ex on not making the biggest mistake of his life. Is this romantic?? We know that the H suffered a terrible tragedy in losing his parents at the same time as he and the h were involved but this is 10 years later for heavens sake. I barely managed to finish the book and by that stage wished she would end up with anyone else rather than the H but she of course was a bit of a doormat where he was concerned. She just loved him and didn't have much pride where he was concerned. I would skip this oneFamily SecretsThis was by far the best story in the book and reminded me of why I like this author. Here the h is the manager of a small town inn and the H is a famous actor, who is in town to shoot a movie. The H has a small 4 year old boy, who is prone to temper tantrums and is very spoilt. The h loves kids and gets involved helping with him when he gets sick with chicken pox. The H and h are thrown together a lot and begin developing feelings for each other. I didn't expect the curve ball regarding the child but I could live with the stretch of imagination I needed to accept it because the romance was coming along nicely. There is a big misunderstanding but I loved that the H stepped up to the plate and behaved like an H. I was rewarded for sticking out all of the other stories to get to this one at the end","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC8DG0C3PKT88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081UIZOE#wasThisHelpful","RC8DG0C3PKT88","A2VXSQHJWZAQGY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VXSQHJWZAQGY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wes Avery is the owner of a Texaco gas station, happily married to Sarah and father to Charlotte.  Life has been moving along nicely, when Wes and his neighbors notice fighter jets flying overhead in massive groups along one of Floridas busiest highways.  The military air traffic is much busier than normally occurs and then President John F. Kennedy announces that Cuba has nuclear missiles provided by Russia.  He is demanding their removal.  Averys assistant is a Cuban exile who is very upset by the ramped-up crisis situation as his mother is in the precise area where these missiles are located.Charlotte is a typical teenager obsessed with friends and an upcoming dance for which she has no date.  When she accepts an offer from Averys assistant, her mother Sarah is completely undone.  She becomes obsessed with their home-made air raid shelter and is clearly mentally unraveling.Here is the simple yet complex plot evolving in miniscule stages.  Russian ships approach Cuba with more nuclear arms.  Attempts are being made to negotiate a treaty with Turkey involved, promising equal removal of military arms that could destroy the world in seconds.The Avery family has its own secret that will threaten to be as devastating.  Averys former military experience knows more than the average Floridian that the increasing military build-up in Florida presages war-status action.By the time the chaos comes to the very brink of attack, the Avery family has completely come undone.A Place We Knew Well is a realistic account of the Cuban crisis that swept across America and Europe that is perfectly plotted, revealing the doubt, fear, anxiety, and psychic inability to cope that occurred in a very short time.  It was the first time that the existence of nuclear arms went beyond a contest of Whos got more toys? to This is for real, folks.Nicely crafted fiction about all-too-real turmoil in American history, Carol McCarthy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ6ME2JAZGZ66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080417654X#wasThisHelpful","RZ6ME2JAZGZ66","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jordan Walsh comes from a family of notable journalists but their interest in the business has died with the loss of their son and Jordans brother who died in a hit and run accident.  Their family has truly been broken by this loss; no one speaks about thoughts or feelings about Jordans brother and Jordan is practically invisible as far as attention goes.  Now shes finally getting a break and about to start a job as a journalist who writes about womens issues in a column known as White Collar Girl.  But Jordan has far greater aspirations than writing about how to dress, apply makeup, find a husband, etc.  She wants to write solid investigative news and is willing to do anything to make that happen. But little is Jordan prepared for the consequences of her choices, both professionally and personally.Jordan begins to be fed information on political corruption for medical insurance fraud but instead of receiving accolades her notes are given to a male to write the copy on the story.  The next time she scoops a huge story about more corruption that causes a severe accident, she plays it differently.  Little by little we read about tension-riddled, dangerous events and situations in which Jordan becomes the investigator and the one who writes the story.  The Chicago political machine run by Mayor Richard J. Daly and other supporters is rife with crooked politics.  And some who consider Jordan friend are really the opposite which she will discover with intensely emotional chagrin.Romance unexpectedly arises for Jordan but is challenged by competition and familial problems of a fellow journalist working for a rival newspaper.  Another friend who attempts to woo Jordan winds up in a precarious situation which he believes Jordan arranged; indeed she is accused of choosing betrayal and success in her job over a growing friendship and possibly more.Toward the end of the story, Jordan begins to investigate a story that might have to do with the death of her brother.  By now her reputation precedes her and so few are ready to whisper secrets that may be catastrophic for professional and personal lives around the office.White Collar Girl is well-plotted historical fiction (1950s Chicago) that is thrilling to read in Rosens easy and well-researched story.  The dangers seem vivid and the personal plights seem no less enjoyable, albeit somewhat contrived.  The reader gets to know Jordan so well that one feels her joys and pain and is rooting for her through every challenge.  Its a rough road women traveled to obtain equal standing in journalism, as well as other careers, and Rosen depicts what it was in the early days of the struggle for equal treatment at work and respect.  Her writing gets better and better!

"Hugh Pike and Wolf Tongue are again working together on a task that seems to be riddled with mystery and betrayal.  Wolf Tongue is silently mourning the degradation of his Sussquehannock tribe, which has lost many to disease and most of the stronger men and women to union with other tribes.  However, now the tribe is being accused of attacking and murdering residents of Millers Town.  Pikes superior, the General who seems to despise him and refuses to promote him even after years of commendable service, has ordered him to investigate the Millers Town debacle and report back in three days, an almost impossible task for sure.When Pike and Wolf Tongue arrive at Millers Town, they are far from welcome and suspicion about their presence is fiercely spoken.  They meet the man who reported the Indian raids, a suspicious character named Dobs and a French woman who knows a great deal but says little initially. As a war with the French is clearly looming, her words are deemed questionable.An almost immediate attack by the Indians, composed of members of various tribes, including an enemy of Wolf Tongue, occurs and reveals the cause of their anger.  Pike is given an ultimatum to solve the cause or watch the massacre of the Millers Town residents.  As hes clearly outnumbered, he realizes he must solve the mystery.Through the Narrows is the second volume of this Colonial American series.  While the characters and scenes are somewhat loosely constructed as far as actual reality of the Pennsylvania conditions, they do reflect the problems and terrors that truly did exist as colonialists faced divided Indian tribes and the ever-present conflicts caused by the perpetual warlike state existing between France and England, with the Americans caught in the middle.  While colonial characters are rather stereotypical, he presentation of several points of view with respect to the native Indians is remarkable and interesting.For those who love adventure, a mystery, and an interest in early American history, this series by Green and Ronan is a fascinating, intense and tension-packed story.

"Mao Tse-Tung is at a crossroads in China in the year 1966.  His original plan to increase agricultural output has been a disaster and stories about brutality, starvation and disease travel like lightning despite efforts to curtail dissension and negativity.  Three young Chinese students, Benfu, Pony Boy and Wen, are divided in their loyalty to Mao.  However, little by little, a transformation occurs in their devotion, an evolution in which they believe they must publish the abuses and brutalities being committed by Maos notorious Red Guard, a group of supporters who become Maos arm of accusation and compliance.  The latter discover they have power and they carry out that formidable opportunity with terror and death.  Benfu, Pony Bok and Wen carry out a plan to reveal this travesty of progress but the consequences will be phenomenal and costly.Benfu is a talented violin player who comes from a distinguished family.  His mother is constantly monitoring his every move and her demands are almost paranoid in her efforts to preserve and guard the family honor and social status they have worked so hard to possess.  Benfu is becoming a man and so finds his mothers efforts to control him unbearable.  His only consolation is the time he spends with his best friend, Pony Boy.Tragedy worsens Pony Boys status as a poor young man.  When his father becomes ill, Pony Boy must work long, long hours just to allow his family to retain their home and have meager meals to survive.  Pony Boy after turning from an ardent Communist realizes Mao is repressing and brutalizing his people during the period when all high status Chinese people are being purged and reeducated.  Pony Boy and Benfu plan a publication that will expose all that is wrong with Maos plans and actual realities.Benfu and Pony Boy will fall in love with women they respect, independent, strong-minded women who are willing to testify to the travesties of justice now rampant throughout China.  Benfu is sent to escape to the country to escape the Red Guards investigations into wealthy families but that country journey is one of working on a collective farm in which self-criticism and judgment by others is a constant threat to life and limb.  Pony Boy continues their efforts while Benfu works and suffers.  Eventually their reunion will spark a final challenge that is breathtaking in its fierce challenge and involve some other very special characters.The Palest Ink is a potent, beautiful story about resistance and loyalty to friend, family and foe the reader will find hard to forget.  Its insistence that the written word surpasses all memories proves significantly true about this particular, significant historical period.  The mission of serving as a witness to history is valuable beyond words and so succeeds beyond expectations.

At first Theodora doesnt realize she is marrying the heir to the throne but in true feisty style Theodora adjusts to the change and proves to be a very wise ruler, often controlling the kingdom while Justinian was obsessed with creating a new code of laws that would last forever.David Potter tells the story of Theodora by recounting the writings of historians famous in her lifetime.  This makes for some very ironic, suspicious and avid reading as the reader faces many accounts that were probably not true but which reveal a modicum of the truth amid the exaggerations and outright falsities.Procopius was one such writer who speculates that Theodora opened a home for former prostitutes because she was one in her younger years.  His accounts seem to place an unduly large amount of space denigrating her and at times reveal prurient texts and scenes that perhaps say more about him than the object of his writing.  Yes, she later opened a home for former prostitutes who would be able to learn a career that would not place them in so much danger.  Another writer treats her with exaggerated respect and his treatment almost seems like a biography of a different, wholly loved and honored historical ruler.A large part of the book is concerned with the Chalcedonian and anti-Chalcedonian factions concerned with interpreting the nature of Jesus Christ as fully divine or partly divine and partly human.  One can underestimate the rivalry between these two groups but in reality it was as intense as the Green, Blue and other factions which affected politics, religion and culture in Theodoras younger years. Theodora had a great deal to do with lessening the conflicts and potential violence always waiting to explode.Although this is a biography of Theodora, it is also an explication of the culture and history of the Byzantine era.  The author introduces the reader to the layout of the city, the structure of the games so important to Byzantine citizens, the entertainment offered through the denigrated actors and actresses, the yearning of the poor to escape their rigidly set social structure, the faith that ruled the country and empire, and Theodoras role in all of the aforementioned subjects as well as the chaos that was to emerge during her rule.Honoring her and Justinian in the icons or mosaics of Byzantium seems right after reading this book in which fact and fiction reveal a dynamic, intelligent, and very smart woman who is featured as an honored saint to this day.  Well-researched, fascinating look at a remarkable woman!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JU7EDU08OOZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199740763#wasThisHelpful","R2JU7EDU08OOZY","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nicole Jones has been hiding on Block Island, off the New England Coast.  She runs a bike touring business during the tourist season and has only two good friends, a slightly older man, Steve McQueen, and friends who run a spa and sponsor Nicoles paintings in a local gallery.  Life is good and Nicoles no longer always looking over her shoulder.  Perhaps she was too comfortable but thats all about to end!Zeke Chapman and Nicole crash into each other.  At first the reader thinks its pure coincidence but its really not that simple.  Zeke first of all has assumed the name of an FBI agent.  His presence is as exciting to Nicole as it was when they were lovers in Paris, France.  For both of them are professional hackers.  Years ago they did something years ago that involved stealing a huge amount of cash and leaving behind someone who wasnt supposed to die but did. As the story progresses we learn that Zeke has a job for Nicole to do, but after a while were not sure if Zeke is truly friend or foe.  The confusing but terrifying scenes raise the tension level a hundred-fold for sure.Nicole doesnt want to tell anybody her secrets but eventually winds up doing so as the friends she has made on the island truly care about her and dont want to see her in this perilous condition.  Others arrive who were totally unexpected and it turns out that Nicole left a clue for certain persons to find her; whether it was an accident or just plain stupidity doesnt really matter as shes now in very serious trouble, with both her enemies and her friends.Hidden is the first in a new series that will thrill those who love mysteries, thrillers or adventure novels.  Its a complex yet simple plot at the same time that is all too credible in this day and age when hacking is developing into an international problem that can shake the financial world of companies, individuals and even the government.  Reading it makes one realize no ones bank account is really safe and the power behind hackers is more of a near threat than perhaps we previously thought.  Nicely done, Karen E. Olsen!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W033QI1EJH4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015RJHWKO#wasThisHelpful","R1W033QI1EJH4I","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Penrose Llewellyn has called his clan together for his 60th birthday in November 1928.  Since hes recently suffered from a heart ailment, everyone in his family feels obligated to attend.  From the very beginning, the reader realizes this is a family not quite happy to be together.  Pen seems like a loving relative, but theres an edge to his relationship with his brothers, Theo and Huwie, the latter who has been absent for years.  Theo is a successful lawyer and a rare book collector of books about music.  He and his haughty wife Claudia live well above their means but Theo is close to Pen and may be looking to inherit some wealth that is sorely needed.  Huwie seems like the black sheep of the family and others indicate hes not to be trusted. The females in the family each have a bit of the wild side in them and clearly dont get along, even the mother and daughter in the tale. Theres a close family doctor and some others who would like to marry into the clan but dont seem able to accomplish their desires.Imagine then the shock when Pen holds a family dinner before the big event and announces he will marry his garden designer, Anna.  The expectations for the family are now obviously diminished but even more so when Pen is found dead the next morning after the exciting family dinner.Herbert Reardon, a detective, is called into the case immediately.  Hes a shrewd character, physically scarred from the Great War, but no less loved by his sensible, liberal wife Ellen.  He sets about his investigation with the help of an assistant and becomes intrigued by the towns antique bookseller from whom both Pen and Theo bought books for investment and love of old books.  The novel moves on rapidly with fascinating twists and turns and is totally unpredictable as who committed the dastardly deed.  Two other murders, one human and one canine, add to the mysterys complexity.Heirs and Assigns is a super historical mystery that is evenly paced, well-plotted, and contains just enough clues to sweep the reader to its very surprising end. It also adds some minor information about treatment of veterans from the War and those who refused to fight in the war, as well as the womens reform movement for equality in that time.  Descriptions of the homes, shops, cooking, etc. abound realistically, including the great love for tea and some classic British meals.  Highly recommended for those who love a good mystery and a touch of Downton Abbey in between the puzzling and satisfying investigations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSBU3KDS3DXNQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0727885286#wasThisHelpful","RSBU3KDS3DXNQ","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I heard the bells on Christmas Day/ Their old familiar carols play/ And wild and sweet/ The words repeat/Of peace on earth, good-will to men!  This is the famous chorus of the poem/song written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.  The story begins in the pre-Civil War year of 1860 when we are introduced to the Longfellow family, an almost ideal family who deeply cared for each other and thoroughly enjoyed their Boston, Massachusetts environment.  Harsh, then, is the extinguishing of the joyful flame when Henrys wife, Fannie, dies in an accidental fire.  Longfellow is extremely overcome at the loss of his beloved wife and the thrill of Revolutionary times is also being squelched by the decisions made by Southern states to secede from the Union.  The issue of slavery and its economic realities has become the divisive factor calling for the split of a barely one hundred year old united nation. Longfellows family will be called to also sacrifice much during the duration of the war, perfectly summarized in Longfellows entire poem, Christmas Bells.Travel in time another hundred years and we are watching how a devoted and talented music teacher, Sophia, is devastated with the news that her job has been eliminated because of financial budget cuts.  Shes also the conductor and director of a local church choir that is preparing to perform Longfellows poem as part of the annual Christmas celebration.  Her accompanist, Lucas, loves her but is afraid to honestly broach the subject with her.At the same time another family suffers because they have not heard from their husband and father who is serving in the National Guard in Afghanistan.  He used to call regularly but all of a sudden those calls stop.  Some other conflicts arise from here, later to be challenged by a Catholic nun with remarkable intuitive powers  or are they divine?There is so much more than can be described herein that makes this story real with all of the pain and grace-filled happiness that normal life challenges bring, even in the beloved season known as Christmas!  Jennifer Chiaverini crafts stories that convey an easy style intertwined with real, harsh challenges that dont crush the reader with the elicited tension riddling so many scenes.  This reader is always delighted to read another Chiaverini novel and highly recommends this excellent work of historical fiction!!!! Perfect for any season!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32P4PT62RQEUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525955240#wasThisHelpful","R32P4PT62RQEUS","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Alexandra Coopers job isnt pretty but its all about justice.  Shes the chief prosecutor of the Manhattan Sex Crimes Unit and has made more enemies than she can count on both hands.  So no big shock when shes called into the scene of a murder of a pimp, a creep who was so passed out from booze that he probably never knew that the gal who clambered over him was just aiming for a guaranteed hit!Mike Chapman, one of Alexandras peers, quickly becomes involved in finding the murderer.  A series of events will quickly connect a very well-known Reverend to not only the murderer but also many other connected crimes.  The problem is the so-called Reverend is connected to just about every high politician and their family members in New York City.  So the job is clear but where it will end up and through how many mazes before they get there is for the reader to discover.The plot becomes rivetingly more intense when Alexandra disappears. Since she and Mike have recently become a couple, everyone seems to think he knows precisely where shes gone.  More deaths will follow and the investigators will have to ramp up their skills to capture the elusive killer, who is not who the reader thinks committed the brutal kills.Theres a story behind the term Devils Bridge, a story obviously connected to the practice of evil, a connection all too real and too well-known, a fact of life that grossly tarnishes what is otherwise a remarkably lovely view along the Manhattan waterfront.Devils Bridge is fine crime fiction with just the right amount of tension, tenderness and humor.

"British-born Celia Davis became a nurse and served in the Crimean War, a womanly career frowned upon by late 1800 society. Now Celia has become the caretaker of her half-Chinese cousin, Barbara, and has opened a free clinic where she cares for anyone in need. Her concerns compel her to visit even the ill Chinese prostitutes in Old San Francisco, acts that further ostracize her from decent society.  In 1867 there is a huge and growing anti-Chinese segment of society that is part prejudicial and part fear as the Chinese laborers are accused of taking jobs that would normally go to Caucasian workers.  So the story opens with Celias visit to the bedside of a very physically abused and ill Chinese prostitute.  The setting is starkly described and we quickly come to understand Celias compassionate attitude for those living in such poor conditions.  Later she will become involved with Li Sha, a young woman who escaped this way of life and whose horrific murder becomes the source of Celias quest to find the killer.In her initial appearance at police headquarters, Celia makes clear her assertive demand to see Li Shas body will not be denied. While most of the police she encounters dislike her attitude, Detective Nicholas Greaves finds her feisty attitude amusing.  They quickly begin a prickly yet close bond in their investigation into Li Shas death.  They also have painful backgrounds of loss that they slowly reveal in their chats, a force that compels them to care more for others and which also places each in considerable danger! Their inquiries bring them into the seedier side of Old San Francisco, including Chinatown and the Barbary Coast area, where secrets are gradually revealed that involve smuggling, prostitution, gangs, bribery, and the political machinations that ruled the City and protected the guilty from discovery and prosecution  at least until Celia and Nick aggressively pursue their case.  Their insistence will bring both sleuths close to death and the mounting threats and attacks make for riveting scenes! The anti-Chinese riots, attacks and fires are based on actual historical facts!No Comfort For the Lost is fine historical mystery reading with surprises at every turn (not spoiled by above description) and an exposure of a social atrocity within the late 19th Century California area.

"Ally Morris and Beth Abbott have been best friends since they were children.  They pictured each other as sisters from the well-known and beloved novel, Little Women by Louisa May Alcott.  But sometimes expectations about how these novelistic characters will fulfill their destinies cant account for what is missed about these stereotypes.  And sometimes via the circumstances that suddenly arise call for each young woman to dig deep and allow what may emerge.When we meet Ally and Beth, they have not seen each other in several years as Beth has been working in Haiti.  Ally is hurt that their regular communication just seemed to decrease and then disappear.  In their several meetings, in between reminiscing about their past and filling in that time between then and now, some harsh comments are dropped but just as quickly apologized for.Ally wants to be a great singer, songwriter and musician but feels like shes lacking the sparkling touch that would wow producers and people who deal with individual and group musicians on a daily basis.  Her lack of confidence has history we learn as we keep reading and hope as we continue to an unexpected meeting.Secrets will be revealed about both young women.  Readers will be tempted to think that Beths painful memories about Haiti are worse than anything Ally or any American could experience.  But we come to realize it was pain that drove Beth there, within a story that you will never forget once you read about it.The nice thing about this novel is that a fine balance exists between light-hearted and very funny moments and the intense, heavy scenes that are inserted in just the right places and always at the right time.  Characters dont have to travel far to be a healing presence for friends and acquaintances and more than that, their own selves.The past and present are magically interwoven in this unique novel about truly growing and loving life no matter where it leads!

"Power and its consequent manipulations, betrayals, immoralities, favors, and dysfunction are characteristic of 17th Century England under the reign of King Charles II, King James, King William III and his Queen Mary, and King George III.  But Lady Diana de Vere is an anomaly in the middle of the turmoil that ensues from royal chaos and those who vie for favored status. Diana and her husband Charles share a common background; their fathers sired many children out of marriage and the status of bastard has innumerable consequences that are hard indeed to survive. Financial worries are ever-present as well.  But Diana and Charles are made of feisty stuff and their love endures no matter what ever-changing circumstances surround them.To begin with Charles knows he must become a soldier in order to make enough money to hold any higher status and connection to the royal family.  Fortunately for him, the arrangement he makes with Dianas father will become reality, a fact Diana will not discover for years.  Diana lives through the trauma of King Charles IIs demise and wonders how the absolute tyranny of King James will end.  Political parties connected with Parliament abound and as those parties change so do those in royal favor.  Some become so powerful that their demands supersede those of the kings and queens they serve  amazing!War with France is on and off throughout most of this novel and Charles conducts himself so favorably that he attracts the attention and favor of King William III and his Queen, Mary, becomes very fond of the companionship of Diana.  That bond will be broken but justice will eventually be served as Lady Diana remains a woman of practical skills and impeccably moral character.Joys and tragedies fill the years of Charles and Dianas marriage and these scenes are delightfully depicted in a vivacious style by this obviously skilled author, Margaret Porter. She quite clearly knows how to balance plot and character development and present 17th Century English royalty and service in a dynamic and enchanting manner.Fine, fine historical fiction that this reviewer highly recommends!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JQ8MSL3993TV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990742040#wasThisHelpful","R2JQ8MSL3993TV","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What are the Ten Thousand Things that the artist, government official, and philosopher Wang Meng says are Mind at the conclusion of this remarkable story which takes place in 14th Century China?  They are everything sublime and temporal, every experience one could possibly experience combined with the exquisite expression of nature through art.  Stories abound in this rich text of Wangs life events and stories others have told him that have really occurred or are tales of Chinese history, mythology, and art.  Characters are presented with their highly or poorly developed skills of dealing with the political troubles besetting China at the time and the mix is entrancing.China of this time is experiencing the attack of rebels on Kublai Khans Mongolian rule, the beginning of the movement that will eventually usher in the Ming Dynasty.  Wang is so disgusted by what he experiences as a low-level bureaucrat that he escapes to the solitude of the mountains to draw and paint.  There he loses the jade ring he inherited from a notable and talented relative; the loss seems to affect his ability to paint and he wonders about the power behind objects and their connection to nature.  Is the artist one with all he experiences and expresses?One tale describes an artist who appears to be almost a madman who throws paint upon paper placed on the floor and dances upon it until what he wants to create appears.  After reflection, while watching, Wang sees the genius of the technique and realizes how limited his skills and paintings are.  Mind creates through multiple and even unimaginable avenues!The concept of student and master is explored through multiple stories, revealing the possibilities of openness or closure depending on ones perception.  The same might be seen in the political spectrum; things are not always what may be perceived by participants or observers.On and on it goes, but what is most remarkable about this collection of tales is the beauty of discovery in each scene, in each painting, in each conversation, in each conflict, and so on.  The characters are complex and simple, revealing the overlay of perception and motivation, again not always so clear and sometimes as clear as an epiphany of revelation.The Ten Thousand Things is a literary masterpiece that reveals classical philosophy and art of 14th Century China; it is bound to be best seller and a classic novel that will remain a timeless work beloved of its many readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVRBG47WFMR9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1468308327#wasThisHelpful","RVRBG47WFMR9R","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Put away your notions of how a woman should behave in the 1920s.  Instead picture a woman whose initial love was for the wilds of Africa, in particular Nairobi where her father raised horses. Imagine her life after her mother deserted them with a brother and returned to Africa, not to return for years upon years upon years.  Where does one fill that aching hole, especially when her father acted like hed never been married and even chose another woman as a common-law wife and not a nice one at that?  Beryl Markham turns to the animals on their farm, especially the horses her father is raising to race, and the natives who place such immense pride in acting kindly, friendly and in becoming men and women of the tribe.  Their focus is on community spirit and strength, not on personal happiness.  Perhaps this is a subtle key to everything that follows.Efforts to school Beryl are futile.  Shes a child of the land, her education in watching the foals born, in learning she cannot wander alone when she is fiercely attacked by a lion but survives to tell the story, and in becoming a skilled rider whose sensitivity and skill allow her to merge with the spirit of the horse she is racing. Later she will marry but not for love.  Thus begin the rumors and gossip about her flirtations with other married men, including even Prince David of England.Then comes what most well-read people know was the scandal of all time, Beryls rivalry with Karen Blixen over their love for Denys Finch Hatton.  This is the story many movie lovers know was fleshed out in Isak Dinesens Out of Africa.  Beryls evolving love for Denys begins with a very comfortable friendship, epitomized by their sharing of Walt Whitmans poetry about the wildness of animals that is more important than the vicissitudes of men and woman.  That wildness is the essence of their relationship, a spirit that even Karen Blixen admits is the spark of a great love.  While others are busy scandal-mongering, Beryl just lives her life with her passion for horse racing and eventually for flying airplanes.Ironically, the reader can feel the peace and beauty of Africa when reading Beryls observations about the African countryside or when shes reaching out to her favorite horses but at the same time tense up at the convoluted relationships that are always up and down and very rarely stable for more than a few evenings.  This is Paula McLains remarkable skill, to describe with almost supernatural connection and to sense what lies in the depths of men and women who are always searching for that something or someone but too restless and yearning to settle down with any one person.  Is it linked to the abandonment she suffered as a child?  The reader must decide, but remarkably Karen Blixen is the same in spite of a very stable childhood and background.  Finally, one absorbs the value of struggle for what one is passionate about and this is lovely, lovely, lovely wherever it appears on multiple pages.Circling the Sun: A Novel is beautifully crafted writing that far exceeds the writing in her previous novel, A Paris Wife.  This is very special historical fiction at its best and perceptive readers who want more than just stereotypical stories are in for a fine treat/read! Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33O5CEPES9P36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345534182#wasThisHelpful","R33O5CEPES9P36","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

At first Warshawski thinks that now Stella has returned from prison, she is trying to reinvent herself in the eyes of South Chicago.  She reluctantly promises Frank shell give him a consultation gift of one hour of investigation and makes him sign a retainer that states hes got to pay for anything beyond that.  Little does she realize just how much more time will be involved in this investigation that is much larger than just Stellas guilt or innocence.Warshawskis late cousin, Boom-Boom, used to be a huge hockey star but was killed and now Stella is saying he was responsible for Annies death.

"Barbara Stirling is almost sixty years old and is now being ousted from her job as a special education teacher due to budget cuts. Its a huge loss to the school as she is very good at what she does and really cares about these kids who come from homes rife with poverty, abuse, violence, starvation and just plain neglect.  Some parents dont care and others are quite realistically doing the best they can which means their children suffer from a number of physical and emotional problems that affect any, if not all, learning. Barbara clearly cares and goes above and beyond the call of duty to help wherever and however she can. Harder still, she takes her job home and worries about her kids, but she gets very little feedback from her husband, another story in itself.Barbara is also worried who went to college but has been unable to get a job.  Her daughter is an ecology fanatic who is about to begin using cloth toilet rags in place of toilet roll, quite a gross idea although it is certainly admirable in purpose. Add to that she has a friend who admits shes got a lousy sex life with her husband but uses sex gigolos to satisfy her avid desires. Money is tight at home and hubby Frank is only caught up in his film job which doesnt pay so well.  The real issue is his semi-concerned feedback to Barbara about her job and needs. Not even when she begins to suffer panic attacks does he really respond in the way she needs. Mom is the queen of criticism, hardly an asset in Barbaras decomposing world.Before her job concludes, Barbara becomes involved in the life of Troy, one of her students who is clearly being abused but who wont answer questions. This then is the story of her intervention and how Troys world gives her purpose and direction, and it also enables her to learn to speak up and call things as she sees them.  Transformation comes about with determination and challenging those who prefer to complain but not much beyond that.There are several issues of importance in this novel which Margolis treats with both seriousness  and levity, where appropriate.  The characters are so very real in far too many families, and the author handles each issue honestly and clearly, including the apathy of co-existence which is symptomatic of so much emotional distress in the world.Very nicely crafted, Sue Margolis and recommended for all readers! Hope lies eternal!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DHTJKBQAKV1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451471849#wasThisHelpful","R1DHTJKBQAKV1I","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Avery Delacorte is an accomplished swimmer, a 19 year-old young woman who has excelled in her sport beyond high school into college.  Still, shes a typical gal when it comes to romance and Colin Shea, a college friend, has always encouraged her to move beyond her current level of competition.  So far she has refused but that is all about to change.On her flight home to Colorado, she realizes that the plane shes on is about to crash land in the Rocky Mountains area.  Five members of the flight initially survive, Avery, Colin and three young boys.  In the beginning, it doesnt seem so bad as the group eat the remainder of the snacks they find, attempting to build a type of hut to survive the bitterly cold and snowy weather they know will come soon, and so on.  But the tough part of their journey is yet to come.No spoilers here but suffice to say when they are finally rescued, they arent together.  All have serious physical injuries and the post-traumatic syndrome they each suffer is very real.  Claire Kells has got it down pat the way she depicts Averys long road back to a semblance of normalcy.  At times she tries to convince everyone shes fine and at other times shes still physically falling apart and trying to deal with a secret she shares with no one.  She will eventually meet up with Colin and several secrets will come out and their relationship will be very different from what it was before their nightmare crash.Girl Underwater is a superb contemporary novel about surviving and a love that defies description because of what it has endured.  It is said that the young are resilient which in this novel is true but only after each survivor tells his or her story and shares the process of healing and growing into a new life in which one moves on but will never forget the most traumatic, definitive crisis one could ever experience.Fine writing, Claire Kells, and highly recommended for readers of all ages!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30JM33SKY5QVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525954937#wasThisHelpful","R30JM33SKY5QVM","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Some readers and TV viewers thrive on anything to do with lifestyles of the rich and famous! Well, heres a sneak view into the life of the personal assistants who spend 24/7 doing the biddings of the semi-famous but rich stars of Los Angeles.  Jess Dunne belongs to the third generation of Hollywood wanna be great actors and actresses and certainly knows the workings of the desire for that ultimate win, success.  But shes not doing so well on the acting scene; and when our story begins, shes working as a barista at a local L.A. coffee joint and being passed over for decent hours because shes not young and chic enough! Her only consolation is her roommate Megan who is also auditioning for every possible actress position on the planet.  Their snappy and snarky dialogue puts plenty of humor and reality into what would otherwise be absolutely pitiful and moronic situations!At an acquaintances suggestion she applies for and is accepted to be the personal assistant of a semi-famous actor, who turns out to be an agoraphobic, demanding son of a gun whose every whim becomes Jesss desire to fulfill!  The real question that keeps occurring to the reader while reading page after page of this unreal but ironically real world is how long will it be before Jess quits.However, Jesss Mom appears on the scene soon enough, another potential actress who everyday life is an endless drama, usually ending with an empty hand held out to Jess for financial assistance for her Moms latest project.  Oh, did I say Mom  because Jesss not allowed to call her that but instead calls her by her name, Donna.  But theres a dramatic change coming that will shock and soften Jesss heart about Donna, a rather poignant, seductive scene about the possibility of change in every scene that struts across lifes stage.Jess next is able to land a job, again as a personal assistant, for another near-famous actress, due to Jesss amazing culinary skills.  The story beyond here is where Jess begins to start analyzing what is really happening here and what it means for the rest of her life if she chooses to keep pursuing her own dreams!There are some meaningful and potent scenes in between a great deal of absolute nonsense (acceptable euphemism)!  Plenty of funny comments and scenes save the day for this novel especially geared for Hollywood watchers, lovers of certain newspapers and magazines tending to this specific life form, and those who are true people-watchers who are always looking to connect to fame, even if it is vicariously!  Highly recommended for only those who thrive on this world!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KPQ1EALPXC88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525955046#wasThisHelpful","R3KPQ1EALPXC88","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hannah Farr, a popular Louisiana TV talk show host, receives an offer to submit an idea for a talk show she might be hired to host.  She chooses the Forgiveness Stones  a project or program that is the rage of the nation right now.  The idea is to send out a pouch of stones and send them out with two requests, to use them as a sign of forgiveness you ask of another you have hurt and to use them as a sign of forgiveness you are being asked to give to someone who has hurt you.  Its a heart-throb topic that has attracted many people but the process is certainly not as easy as it sounds.Forgiveness requires honesty and purity of motive that calls for some gritty recognition of truth, lies, glib attitudes, and may even make a situation worse instead of better.  But all in all, Hannah is determined to make it a part of her life; at least she is willing to initiate this process which will call for far more than shes ever given to any person or project in her past experience.In the course of this story, Hannah will find a true love and discard those who are more into appearances than anything real.  Shell be forced to examine familial relationships that are not the story she has formed carefully to protect herself. Shell get a better look at what a future with a certain person would be like, a vision thats both shocking and not so pretty.A wise old Southern lady, a good friend and the woman who started this forgiveness trend will provide the wisdom that makes this story so real and saves it from being just another melodramatic soap opera.  Sweet Forgiveness is a wonderful, heart-moving story that is poignant to read and memorable to think about when it reaches its unexpected final pages.Nicely done, Lori Nelson Spielman!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SP8600GJNL3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0147516765#wasThisHelpful","R1SP8600GJNL3P","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hilary and her friend Veronica are off to vacation in Glastonbury, the famed, sacred site where it is believed King Arthur and Guinevere were buried, where the Isle of Avalon existed, where ancient Celtic Churches were founded and where danger lurks for our two main characters.  A place like Glastonbury is a place that attracts not only sincere, curious, educated and sincere tourists but also some people who can best be described as strange.  Yes, there are New Age followers, staunch Christians, Muslims, and other individuals one would expect in any tourist spot in the world, but some of the characters in this story are colorful to say the least.Hilary and Veronica on their first day of visiting the are run into a Muslim woman dressed in tradition burka, a gentleman who dresses more like a court jester than a 21st century male visitor, and a deeply conservative man who promises curses and damnation for all those who are not Christian.  His intolerance gives him an apoplectic look that actually frightens Hilary and Veronica.  But their shock at this person is nothing compared with what is to follow.Without spoiling the story, the reader will be flipping the pages as Hilary and Veronica explore a potential bomb plant, a devastating bomb explosion and a shocking murder.  Its these two spunky ladies who are always two steps ahead of the police and detectives in their slow but precise investigation.  The plot is complex, several characters are the targets of our heroines search, and the conclusion is so staggering the reader could never imagine it all coming to pass as it does.  Suffice to say that the need for attention in several characters runs over the top and the author challenges all who would stereotype certain characters to task for their erroneous thinking.In a world where terrorism on the national and international levels seems always looming, this novel explores the issue with its ambiguous, complex and deeply frightening complexities.  If you see something, report it, becomes much more than just a nice platitude in this cleverly crafted mystery thriller.

"How do individuals not only change over time but also cope with that change as it occurs?  And how do we cope with other people around us who are also changing gradually or dramatically? Linda Abbott has written a story that examines some fascinating scenarios for exactly those scenarios described above.  The account of these people takes place on the gorgeous island of Sanibel Island located off Floridas Gulf Coast, a place of such immense beauty and serene ambience that it relaxes visitors.  As the rest takes root, it allows reflection which raises pleasures and pains in stark relief!David and Marianne are at odds about how to raise their children.  David thinks they are spoiled brats who can get anything and everything but just throwing a rousing tantrum and Marianne claims they are Indigo children with special needs that must be fulfilled in untraditional ways.  Add to that the fact that David meets Ellen, a sexy-looking woman. Ellen is on a vacation from life, work, her passionless husband and a teenage son straight out of a horror story.  Ellen is questioning whether this is normal, whatever that word means anyway, or a difficult transition she should abandon or faithfully endure!David and his family are here on the island to celebrate the 50th wedding anniversary of his parents.  That in itself may be in jeopardy as Davids Dads behavior is worrying his Mom, with his Dads mood swings and forgetfulness suggesting something is seriously wrong.  Add to that his successful sisters are eventually going to be present, and the family definitely has problems with both of them.Add to that a non-denominational Church thats been given a date to either relocate their building or have it bulldozed!  The urgency of the devoted members quickly becomes concerted, united effort!Fiction reflects the truth about reality, and this is human life with all its fun, passions, and foibles which Linda Abbott finely depicts.  While there are many characters, once one has distinguished them, the story jettisons forward, with plenty of conversations and scenes to rivet the reader on every page.

"Flora is a mother with grown-up children.  Working in a law office, along with her good friend, Philip, has given some sense of purpose.  Yet its clear that shes experiencing some kind of empty nest syndrome although she would never even think of that as something to explain her present dissatisfaction.  Her ex-husband disappeared years ago and she has some thoughts about Philip as being more just a friend but wouldnt dare express those vague whispers of thought to him.A local case has intrigued everyone in Floras office.  A two year-old girl, Charlotte, was murdered by her father, Ally, who then killed himself.  The only problem for Charlottes mother, Suzanne, is that Ally never told anyone where he left Charlottes body.  This then now becomes Floras quest who believes the detectives and police have been looking in all the wrong places.  Little by little, she becomes obsessed with finding Charlotte and Philip becomes increasingly concerned.

"Warning  if raunchy language or scenes with graphic violence offend you, this is NOT the book for you.  However, if you love a story taut with tension and also enjoying a different culture, this is a novel that will grip your attention and thrill you with the excitement about a beautiful island, Crete, and the dark, violent plot about to enfold.In 1942 in Crete a young English woman named Marianna, who is part of the resistance movement,  is caught by Germans. When they raid her home and see the red silk undergarment, that was originally part of a German parachute, she is executed while her child screams as she watches her mother die.  The child is taken away but it is actually a rescue as she is ultimately returned to her home in England.Two years later a young couple, Patrick and Eleni, Mariannas daughter, come to ferret out the truth and they too disappear.Thus begins a tale of honor, courage and revenge.  The search for these missing figures is carried on by Kirsty a widow from Scotland and a village elder, Barba Yiorgos.  The authorities refuse to offer any information and when opposed take on a different tone with the investigators.  The bottom line, however, is that every participant winds up suspecting other characters and so the pages fly by, enticing the reader to believe he or she can figure out the few clues but in reality the secrets and plots offer stories within stories.Greek culture, architecture, food and more are celebrated here.  One admires the feisty honor code of these people even while cringing at the stark brutality that results from violation of this code. The Threshing Circle would make a superb movie as it is so easy to visualize the intriguing characters and events that remain thrilling on every page.

"Jonah Miller and Elaine Shrock are in love; and while no verbal proposal has been made, each understands they will wed in the future. At least thats the way it was planned in their minds until Elaines grandfather passed away after making Elaine promise she would take care of her grandmother in the future.  Elaine takes that promise very, very seriously even while she is doing her own mourning for this Amish family man whom she adored, a real father to her in her orphan status after losing her own parents.The tension begins when first Elaines grandmother insists on being independent, even though it is clear after a while that something is physically and mentally wrong with her.  Jonah is trying as best he can, while he is running his own business and working very hard, to offer help to the Shrock family.  But even though these characters are Amish and living in an atmosphere of mutual support and care based on Biblical principles, stubbornness and denial begin to rule the day.This then covers the remainder of the story, with small problems growing rapidly into large ones, when decisions are made that cannot be taken back, and when one realizes that costs are higher when caring for a loved one in need.  How does one live through such a tempestuous time without becoming bitter and angry? In addition, the imminent and constantly stressful moments from dealing with a loved one with dementia are so very important, more important than the Amish community that directs the daily lives of every community member.  This is a growing universal problem that Wanda Brunstetter addresses and depicts with graceful but gritty style.There is a lovely, calm tone throughout this novel that actually communicates peace to the reader.  This is because these people live by the spirit of the laws they obey and their worship which they share.  In a world that is more and more chaotic, The Decision is a lovey way to step aside and relish how faith endures and bolsters the ups and downs of every man and womans live.

"A doctor waits for the head of a baby to appear as the new life of two anxious parents.  In one second the electricity is out and hospital generators arent working.  The father, Kermin, pulls out a flashlight and he watches the baby comes out, covered with a white plastic-like covering.  The tension increases with the sight when the baby is cleaned; the child is as black as a Nubian native.  The usual questions are gently hinted at but the mother has not had any relationships with anyone but her husband Kermin.Charlene also has an unusual after-effect; all she can smell are noxious odors, a phenomenon that gradually diminishes but still leaves her with unpleasant olfactory experiences.  Her life is dedicated to finding out how and why her son was born like this, her son whom his father calls Radar after the old TV show M*A*S*H.  Kermin believes his son will have special powers.Radar does indeed to be a unique character. After being subjected to an experiment that is nothing short of a failure, the Radar in the remainder of the story travels throughout the world with a group of puppeteers, a group who try to create work in areas where extreme wars and other terrible events have left residents with nothing.  Radar is now the color of beige and therefore more acceptable to everyone they meet.  The puppeteer use complicated science, technology and quantum physics to create robots but they wind up very hurt from an explosion while working with nuclear matter.  The quantum physics is very complicated but is simple for Radar who has the ability to read radio messages just by putting his hands on the transmitter.A group of teachers steal radioactive material with the notion of creating something new as an artistic presentation. Different stories follow in Bosnia and Cambodia involving chaos and violence, but they do connect with the general theme later on in the story.  This novel at times reads like a complicated science article written by physicist academics.  The best advice is just to go with it, even when it makes very little sense at all; this reviewer is not sure whether this makes a difference to the reader but it is what it is.Are Radar and other characters paths one of healing, pure science exploration or something more philosophical, psychological or social?  How is Radars epilepsy connected to his uncanny ability to understand radio transmissions? Does his suffering truly lead to his understanding about love who he really is?  I am Radar is a complex work of science fiction that truly stretches the imagination with its disconnected parts that in some ways unite and in others just seem like another round of dystopian fiction with free-floating ideas and attempt to form a new, coherent reality.

Its also the story of spies, double agents, and killers who attempt to change the course of history at the onset of World War I.  The beginning of the novel proceeds at a slow rate but jettisons to riveting plots and counterplots as the story progresses.The pages reveal an explicit diary documenting the insatiable appetites of one character while a young British army captain turns out to be so much more than any character in the story anticipated.  If you love mystery, intrigue, spies, murder, chaos, cheating lovers, and so much more, this is your next best springtime or summer read!  Beatriz Williams never disappoints with her deft plotting, twists and turns, and hearty, hot romance.  This is her best novel to date!!!

"Flossie Jayne is the New Woman behind this story of the artist and entrepreneur, Louis Tiffany, whose first major project was creating stained glass religious windows for the Worlds Fair in Chicago in 1893.  The glassworkers working on his project go on strike and Tiffany has no choice but to hire woman to do the cutting, pasting and other chores that are part of fashioning the project windows.  Thus begins a fascinating novel in which Jayne is one of the chosen, a dream for her who loves colors and designs beyond life itself and will do anything to help Tiffany complete this project.While shes working she has chosen to live in a family style boarding house where the residents share meals and conversation.  Jayne is a wonderful addition as it is she who turns what were formerly stilted greetings and curt remarks into this family style.  She creates dinner cards with questions to draw out conversation, quickly organizes skating outings, and more.  But one of the residents, Reed, is a bit of a curmudgeon who hates the idea of the New Woman who wants to be independent, self-sufficient for salary and career, and more.  This is also their story as Jayne little by little, and I do mean little, softens Reed who is really nothing more than a man hurt by the past.  However, he plays the part well but also plays it stupidly as he projects his animosity into creating short stories that are serialized into the local paper.This a great story with something for everyone.  Plenty of descriptions of the art Jayne and Tiffany create as well as the processes involved fill the pages, and Gist is perfect in depicting the beauty and difficulty of each task.  Then theres a not-so-budding and budding romance that slowly evolves which makes a great story in itself.  And then there is the consideration of what would happen if the New Woman becomes the norm  would society be forevermore changed in a positive or negative way?Very nice historical fiction which this reviewer thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommends!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37ZZA0ZQEK720/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451692447#wasThisHelpful","R37ZZA0ZQEK720","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sophy Peabody is an accomplished artist who suffers from viciously painful headaches, especially after she has exerted great effort in creating a beautiful painting.  She is raised with her sister to believe that great female artists should not marry because marriage is a demanding role that will deplete her of all the energy she will need to grow even greater as an artist, a push and pull tension that Sophy will actually struggle with for years.  On a trip to Cuba where she falls in love, she realizes that she can be passionate and still remain as totally invested in her art as is possible. But she also discovers that people can be so dearly loving and blindly evil; so she flees that beautiful country she had come to love with its lush natural scenes and hospitable families.Upon her return to New England, she meets the dark but sensitive writer, Nathaniel Hawthorne.  The magnetic passion drawing them together is instantaneous and after a delayed wait they marry. They finally settle down into their own home after trying to live at Brook Farm, the Transcendental, agricultural community.  While they agreed with the principals of such a life, they were not up to the hard work of farming.  They are artists who must write and paint.  This is their love story which grows and grows with tender but fierce commitment over the years.They endure much suffering during their lives, including the family illnesses and deaths and the dreadful American Civil War.  They, however, are privileged to be able to afford to travel to England, Portugal and Italy, all of which they write about.  Sophy is a life force to Nathaniel, whose dark moods have both genetic and historical roots in his ancestors perfidious judgment in Salem, Massachusetts during the brutal witch hunt that condemned so many innocent people.The House of Hawthorne is remarkable and beautiful historical fiction.  The characters are uniquely drawn and their perspective on art, marriage, parenting, slavery, and more compel the readers attention and excitement.  Nothing is predictable and everything is unique for this perceptive and endearing couple who create a beautiful tapestry out of the vicissitudes of life and death!

"Annie Black is writing to her son who has just been seriously injured in a life-threatening car accident.  As the story unfolds we realize that her confession has changed her whole world.  She and her husband Jonathan have separated but are forced into close proximity with Robbie as they wait for his body to heal while he remains in a medically induced coma. And what happened to Emme, who was driving the car at the time of the accident but who has disappeared?The story is told in letter form and fluctuates between the present in California and Annies past in her twenties while she was living in London.  There she falls into a relationship with her boss and then with her bosss wifes lover.  Its a triangular love fest that is not only appreciated by all involved but which supposedly adds zest to the lovers trysts.  While the reader is struck with the incredulity of the whole situation, Jan Ellison manages to do more than pull it off as the tone remains almost removed, observing characters from afar and inserting a sense of almost surrealistic wonder that it is all evolving as it does!Meanwhile, we are also watching Jonathan and Annies brief interactions.  They had a twenty year close, relaxed and deeply bonded relationship.  Now we see some occasional hints of closeness and wonder where it will all go. Does the confession mean twenty years of closeness is wiped out?This is more than a coming of age story but is a story about realizing what one would keep as memories to do again and what was not worth wrecking a future?  More than that it really isnt to be judged  it was what it was and is what it is in the present; thats not loosely stated. Its what the author is coming to realize as the story progresses; how her husband handles it comes late in the story although not as explicitly detailed. It also concerns imagining Annies role as a wife and mother in the present, with a poignant, almost searing, realization of what one takes so much for granted in the normal day-to-day patterns of life.Whether or not one believes the exposed memories Annie divulges, there is a remarkable literary and frequently surrealistic quality to these letters that draws in the reader to keep turning the pages, wondering where this story is going  or not!Nicely crafted, Jan Ellison!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL0N92L5N6IPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812995449#wasThisHelpful","RL0N92L5N6IPI","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It takes a while to figure out whos who in this richly nuanced novel depicting the civil rights struggle.  Mary Marcus is a believer in those who march for the cause because of the intimate relationship she had with Lavina, the black woman who cooked for the Marcus family.  Now Mary has returned to a father who is obviously terminally ill and a sister who is just downright mean.  Lavinas son is the famous Billy Ray Davis, the harmonica player of musical legend, but his life is a sad outcome of the harsh divisions of the time.Billy only feels connected to life when hes making music or presenting it although his appeal has declined later on.  It may be the drugs that take over his life more frequently.  Later, he swears hes clean but the wild yearning never goes away and the drugs were all that ever covered over the loneliness he has felt constantly.  Mary describes that sense so well without ever precisely naming it.Now Mary has returned to watch her father die, a father she has hated for most of her life.  The care she always wanted has come too late and so it is bittersweet to say the least. Lavina remembers the years of black struggle, hated by the whites she served.  Yet there was always fear mixed with the ever-yearning dreams, hopes, aspirations for a different world. Yet in the middle of the mixed emotions, Lavina is the only one who has a realistic sense of humor, a healthy sign that life really isnt all that dismal as the people around her seem to be hell-bent on proving otherwise.The story is told in different voices that reflect all of the above and so much more, reading like sultry blues with occasional bursts of something approaching a wild, musical cornucopia.Lavina is a historical novel written in a unique style of reminiscences that brings alive the period of the 1960s to the 1990s. Its got swagger, violence, languorous moments, and nostalgia to go with each phase of the historical and familial evolution.  Very nicely crafted, Mary Marcus!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35KXB6MMCNO20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161188201X#wasThisHelpful","R35KXB6MMCNO20","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the revealing story of Kim IL Sung, the so-called Great Leaders rise to power.  In some ways theres nothing new here for anyone in touch with the current news stories about North Korea, and yet theres everything new about this account.  Its as much about Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian history as it is about the Great Leader.  Having served his time in the military, Kim IL Sung is eventually elevated as the Great Leader of Northern Korea and is determined to invade the South, misguided as to whether or not the Americans will return to help the South.  Stalin pacifies him until the time is right. Mao Tse-TungMeanwhile a North Korean soldier, No Kum Sok, has watched his people suffer even though he carefully excels in spouting the Communist party line.  Eventually, he will escape and defect to the Americans, bringing with him a Soviet MIG-15.  He is a valuable turncoat and brings phenomenal information to the Americans. His act propels Kims insistence that revenge will be paid.This account is obviously well-researched, including the cruelties inflicted on the Korean people and the propaganda lines that literally built up a fantasy story fed to the believing North Korean people.WWII and the behavior of North and South Koreans, as well as the American involvement under General MacArthur are vividly described.What remains of dubious quality is how much the North Korean people were forced to acknowledge Kim IL Sung as someone slightly shorter than divine, no matter what he said or did, no matter that his people were literally starving to death.  All available money was apportioned to the military and industrial development.  What kept so many from rebelling is described carefully as well as the fact that one rebel would equal numerous deaths of family members of the accused.  Brutality is and was the norm for this megalomaniac!The Greatest Leader and The Fighter Pilot is the true story of two opposing individuals, one who became worshipped by a subjugated people and one who refused to embrace tyranny and was willing to suffer the costs of leaving Korea.  Excellent non-fiction account of a dynamic historical period and two formidable heroes who chose different roads to fame!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10KX1ISW6Q5TQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670016578#wasThisHelpful","R10KX1ISW6Q5TQ","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Royal Ordinance Factory is the site of a massive explosion in 1951.  As the story unfolds in the beginning pages, the reader feels the mounting pressure as characters recognize what is about to happen but are powerless to prevent it as the countdown progresses.  No one is claiming responsibility for the massive failure and it all comes down to blaming two men for the lack of cooling down procedures to prevent the looming disaster.  Gunner Wade was sent for help at the very last minute but failed to get there before the fireball lit up the skies and surrounding area and literally shook the earth. Those remaining behind never had even the slightest chance of surviving the ensuing, devastating event.Twenty years later, the son of that dead man, Byron, is concentrated on becoming employed at that same facility, and the reader quickly realizes that secrets and muscling weaker employees are what enable the factory to continue to operate.  Byron initially doesnt make much of an impression especially as his educated background is hard to hide that he really doesnt fit in here.  Add to the fact that he looks like his father and might be recognized that some previous workers present from afar on the date of the earlier explosion might recognize him, putting him in even more formidable danger.  He quickly, however, learns how the game runs and succeeds in obtaining the confidence of those in power.The remainder of the story concerns his battle against those who one could call murderers and those who assist Byron, a woman whose husband was murdered and Gunner Wade.The writing style of Neil Grimmett is tension-ridden to the point of explosive, much like the works of the best thriller writers.  Characters are vivid and the plot is complex enough to keep the reader guessing how it will all unfold, although the foreshadowing elements are deft and increase at just the right moments.The Hoard by Neil Grimmett is great thriller fiction with enough passion and adventure to satisfy every reader.  Great job, Neil Grimmett!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10X8NJSJZ92AT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGLPNF8#wasThisHelpful","R10X8NJSJZ92AT","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It all starts so simply  a strange person stands next to Adam, a happily married man, at least he thought so despite some ups and downs normal in any marital bond.  He tries to ignore the hints given by the person to verify that his wife Corinne is hiding something.  He follows the hint and discovers his wife has had contact with an online site for some purchases with a shocking connection.  He immediately distrusts her and that makes all the difference, a very wrong conclusion. Her response  wait  we need some time apart until I can tell you about this secret.Another whispered secret to other persons cause the same misjudgment.  Meanwhile, Adam has a disagreement with a fellow parent over lacrosse selections and there seems to be more adversity out of the situation than is warranted over just a sports game.The Stranger is about a series of planned events that all have a haunting quality about them and all lead to terror and fear pervading the involved characters lives.  As in many plots of Coben, however, the outcome is far from what the reader expects.  What seemed so simple to unravel is more complex and far-spreading than each character realizes.Money, debt, and promises, with heavy costs, proceed to ruin the lives of many. The end of these separate yet united connections is quite shocking.While the plot sometimes slows a bit too much, the pages where danger increases are riddled with tension and mystery.Harlan Coben is a talented writer who has written a rather simple story with some adventurous, intriguing moments and a haunting conclusion.  Good read for those who are fans and even those who love a good mystery!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K0IF6DFRA655/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525953507#wasThisHelpful","R1K0IF6DFRA655","A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WH1YZ5VGTKXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Because I used to be around agriculture work and noticed the people around me wearing the brand. They were out there to work, not play around and look fashionable.

Needs charging after a long day's use. That might be because it's wireless and probably uses a lot of juice to deliver quality sound.My cat has chewed through $400 of electronics, most notably my wired headset while I was using it. One minute sound, the next nothing. I looked down, she looked up, and into the darkness she fled like nothing happened. Does she chew on any of the cheap replaceable cords? Nope.

"Halfway through and I must admit: This is not for the feint of heart.If you want to know the details of medical marijuana, coupled with a nice history, this book is for you. There's short questions after each chapter, as if the book was intended to teach a class.This covers in good detail each state, president, impact, law, et cetera. Keep in mind as MMJ laws change parts of this book may not be accurate. For example, Illinois has an MMJ law that isn't mentioned in the book. That does not diminish the book's accuracy in the least, rather, it adds historical value to the reading material and the reader is able to see how laws have changed over time.This book highlights the contradictory laws and the huge ""grey"" area of who can have marijuana and can't.There's more than a history lesson in this book as well.

"The 5 films: Mean Streets, The Untouchables, Goodfellas, Heat, and The Departed. A 32-page hardcover booklet is also included. Overall, the picture quality is great and the audio quality is very good.

The DVD release of 'The Departed' included an 85-minute documentary, ""Scorsese on Scorsese,"" which has been dropped from the Blu-ray versions of the film. My only complaints are that the transfer quality of Goodfellas is fairly average, the longest featurette is only 30 minutes long, and some of the supplements are rather bland.

"Coreyography has 288 pages in 22 chapters along with 8 pages of black & white pictures. This is one of the better and more honest celebrity autobiographies that I have read. While many autobiographies hold back this one spills the beans about the inner workings of Hollywood. Corey was a superstar in the era of excess and speaks frankly about his life experiences. The book starts out by describing the impact of Corey Haim's death. Feldman directly points to what he feels is the cause of this tragedy: The pedophilia in Hollywood that is even today the industry's darkest secret. Both Coreys were sexually abused as children and Feldman discusses his experience of going to the police but being hampered by the statute of limitations. It took a lot of courage to write this book because Feldman is real in describing the lows of celebrity life as a child star. The book isn't always pleasant to read but it is raw, compelling and honest. Details of Corey's dysfunctional family, drug abuse and career decline are candidly revealed throughout. Clearly there are self-destructive influences at work and it seems most people in Corey's life tried to take advantage of him in some way. Unfortunately, even friends like Corey Haim and Michael Jackson don't get the warmth you might expect from Feldman in this book so there is little to uplift the spirits of readers. It seems Feldman has struggled to simply survive since he was a teenager. My only complaints are that the book lacks a table of contents and an index.There are many interesting stories about Feldman's movie career:[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial] Feldman was set to appear as Elliott's best friend in E.T. before his part got cut.[Gremlins] He relays working in the hot summer during filming where he had to wear a Christmas tree and heavy clothes because the film had a winter setting.[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter] Crispin Glover threw a temper tantrum because he lost his yellow submarine on the set.[Pee Wee's Big Adventure] Paul Reubens himself offered a part as Francis but Corey turned it down as he was already working on The Goonies.[The Goonies] Feldman was introduced to Michael Jackson who was invited onto the set by Steven Spielberg.[Stand by Me] The film was almost shut down by the independent production company due to financial problems before Columbia Pictures stepped in.[The Lost Boys] The director almost fired Corey twice and was unsatisfied with some of the performances.[License to Drive] Feldman received a legal emancipation from his parents after being cast.[Dream a Little Dream] Corey Haim broke his leg while riding a scooter. He shut down the entire production for days and became addicted to prescription painkillers.[The 'Burbs] Director Joe Dante dreaded coming to work in the morning because he had to deal with Feldman.Feldman's later films are also covered. Notably, the Lost Boys sequels get trashed by Feldman due to their low budgets and poor scripts.My favorite celebrity biographies ranked: 1) Arnold Schwarzenegger, 2) Bret Hart, 3) Corey Feldman, 4) Michael J. Fox, 5) Christopher Reeve, 6) Hulk Hogan, 7) Howie Mandel, and 8) Rowdy Roddy Piper.Buy this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ST20N2515P5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312609337#wasThisHelpful","R3ST20N2515P5R","A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is 28 chapters in this 1030 page book along with some maps and pictures. Kershaw is a superb scholar who provides a very interesting account of one of the world's most notorious dictators. An incredible amount of research went into this book. This is an abridged version of Kershaw's two-volume biography, Hitler 1889-1936: Hubris (1999) and Hitler 1936-1945: Nemesis (2000). Author Ian Kershaw set out to answer two questions: 1) How Hitler had been possible, and 2) How Hitler could exercise power. Kershaw sees ""charismatic authority"" as providing part of the answer. While I'm not normally a fan of abridged books I must admit that at 1030 pages it certainly doesn't feel like anything was left on the cutting room floor. Kershaw notes that 650 pages of text, references, and notes were removed for this single volume edition of Hitler. Therefore, the book is much easier to read without the ""scholarly apparatus"". Kershaw notes ""the essence of the book remains completely intact"".This book is a great read since it flows like a highly detailed, compelling novel. The first three chapters cover the first 30 years of Hitler's life and show an unremarkable man (though he was committed to the army as well as a failed artist). Some important events, like The Night of the Long Knives and the various assassination attempts on Hitler (e.g. Valkyrie) are required reading. Roughly half the book covers the events of World War 2 from the perspective of Nazi Germany. The book gets even better towards the later chapters because the tension is palpable. You almost feel like you are sitting in the bunker with Hitler awaiting the end. Some of the key themes behind Hitler's world-view were his crackpot idealism at his own ""triumph of the will"", his overreliance on expecting enemy weakness to present itself, and his disgust at the ideas of capitulation and peace that could have saved Germany from total destruction. Also, he was open to the murderous overtures of those closest to him. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels is frequently mentioned throughout the book. Goebbels was almost as much of a monster as his leader since he suggested and orchestrated murders of Hitler's inner circle to expand and consolidate his own power in the Reich.According to the author himself, writing a simple biography about Hitler would be insufficient in understanding Hitler. Many writers have described Hitler as an ""unperson"" and an ""empty vessel"" who was very secretive and had no private life. Dr. Carl Jung said, ""Hitler seemed like the 'double' of a real person, as if Hitler the man might be hiding inside like an appendix, and deliberately so concealed in order not to disturb the mechanism... You know you could never talk to this man; because there is nobody there... It is not an individual; it is an entire nation."" Hitler's private and public life were inextricably combined in his role as Fuhrer. Hitler himself possessed remarkable rhetorical skills and a keen grasp of politics. However, his own physical attributes, intelligence, social skills and organizational abilities were rather average. A study of Hitler must focus on ""the character of his power"". His power came from the institutions, the ideologies, and the social expectations of the people so those factors must be examined to understand the man himself. The book investigates German society in addition to Hitler. Kershaw sees Hitler as the ""chief exponent... [of] the Nazi assault on the roots of civilization"" but not its ""prime cause"". This book examines Germany, the Nazi party, key subordinates who planned and implemented many of the most atrocious acts and war crimes, Hitler's rise to power, leadership as Fuhrer and eventual suicide.My favorite biographies ranked: 1) Abraham Lincoln (David Herbert Donald), 2) Adolf Hitler (Ian Kershaw), 3) Steve Jobs (Walter Isaacson), 4) Dr. Carl Jung, 5) Mahatma Gandhi, 6) Jim Cramer, 7) Stephen King, and 8) Dr. Eben Alexander.Buy this book!

"The original Rollerball with James Caan is vastly superior to the remake. It is a confirmed sci-fi classic that explores some very interesting themes regarding violent sports and their effect on society.Special Features:New Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrackA featurette with behind-the-scenes footageInteractive RollergameRollerball (2002) on Blu-ray [Sold Separately]This is another remake that cannot hold up to the original. It is surprising how much it bombed (likely due to the insane $70 million budget). Yes it was bad but I thought it could pull in a few bucks. It has the same rating as the horrible Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Next Generation which is pushing it a bit far. Considering it had a wide theatrical audience it seems people overwhelmingly turned their thumbs down. Chris Klein isn't bad but admittedly little works in the remake. Rollerball could have been Battle Royale bloody but it wasn't. It doesn't seem to take itself seriously at times. It places the time three years into the future despite the credibility gap (we still aren't there yet). This over-commercialized work has cameos tossed in to carry the movie so it's cheesy and forgettable. Klein made this after his American Pie work so he seems to play it the same way. It is rated an astounding 2.9 on IMDB and 3% on Rotten Tomatoes! The Blu-ray isn't very good either (the DVD had more extras) and the transfer is fairly low quality.Buy this DVD. It's a travesty the original is stuck on DVD and the remake is available on Blu-ray.

Included are the six-page booklets from 'The Short Films Collection (1920 - 1923)' and 'Lost Keaton'. The discs are stored in four blue keepcases.My only complaints are that some of the restorations could have been improved even more and this set does not include the ""Keaton Plus"" DVD that is in the ""Art Of Buster Keaton"" DVD set. That DVD contains the only complete version of ""Hard Luck"" missing on the Blu-ray shorts collection, surviving scenes from ""Ten Girls Ago"", excerpts from the TV series ""Life with Buster Keaton"", Buster's first dramatic role in ""The Awakening"", Buster's appearance on TV's ""This Is Your Life"", as well as a collection of Buster Keaton's TV commercials.

This collector's edition also comes with a new commentary and new interviews.The following scenes included in the unrated version were cut from the theatrical release to earn an MPAA rating of ""R"" rather than an ""X"":*The scene in which Angela bites off Stooge's tongue is a few seconds longer with a little bit more blood.*When Suzanne gouges out Jay's eyes, the shot lingers slightly longer, exposing more gore.*The close up shot of the razor blade ripping from the old man's throat is slightly extended with more gore.*In the convenience store scene at the beginning of the unrated version, Linnea Quigley's character asks the two male clerks if they have ""Sour Balls"". In the R rated version, she simply walks past them, and out of the store.*In the unrated version, the party scene is a little longer with more exposition.*There are substantially more shots of Angela floating through the hallway.*For reasons still unknown, the giant demon head that appears over Hull House at the end of the film has animated glowing red eyes in the unrated version, but does not in the R-rated theatrical cut.Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 | Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 Stereo, English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1Subtitles/Captions: English SDHSpecial Features:NEW commentary with Director Kevin Tenney and actors Cathy Podewell, Hal Havins, Billy Gallo and FX artist Steve JohnsonNEW interviews with cast and crews including director Kevin Tenney, writer/producer Joe Augustyn and actress Linnea QuigleyAudio Commentary With Director Kevin Tenney, Executive Producer Walter Josten and Producer Jeff GeoffrayPromo Reels, Trailers, TV and Radio Spots; Still GalleriesBuy this Blu-ray.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13CJ0A61LNVIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHH9IIA#wasThisHelpful","R13CJ0A61LNVIP","A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This 1995 book was written by a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize and was a NY Times Bestseller. It has 21 chapters along with maps and pictures. Lincoln was an incredible man who may have failed more than he succeeded yet his legacy endures even today. Fans of the Civil War era will appreciate getting a look at Lincoln's life through Lincoln's eyes. The research by author David Herbert Donald is superb.

"This 2007 book by Bret the Hitman Hart is better than most wrestling autobiographies. This book has 47 chapters in 4 parts: 1) Stampede Days, 2) The Foundation, 3) Steal My Crown, and 4) Pink Into Black, along with a preface, afterword, index, and a key to Bret's cartoon (located on the inside front cover). There is also 32 pages of black and white pictures included in the book. Bret takes you behind the scenes of professional wrestling and reveals the man behind the legend. Common to all professional wrestling biographies, Bret holds some grudges much like Hogan and Piper did in their own biographies. However, there is some brutal honesty here because some of the stories are shocking and others somewhat depressing. Fans of the Hitman will appreciate his story. The Hitman clashed with many people including members of his own legendary family not to mention his wife. Many of the highs and lows of life in the ring are similar to the stories Hogan, Piper, Ventura and other pro wrestlers have written about.This autobiography is more of a tell-all than other wrestling biographies because Hart has retired from wrestling and does not seek a return to the sport he both loves and loathes. Bret admits to steroid use, confrontations, the difficulty of raising a family, and financial problems. Bret is aware of the many wrestlers who have died: Road Warrior, Hawk, Bossman, Earthquake, Bam Bam Bigelow, Bad News, Chris Benoit, Owen Hart, and many others. The book is based on Bret's audio diaries that he started keeping in his twenties. He says ""my family knows very little about me"". Bret married an Italian girl late in his life but they ended up splitting when Bret finished the book to move back to Italy because she missed her family. He says he will ""never forgive Shawn, or Hunter, for killing the business that so many gave our lives for"". Ultimately he suffered a massive stroke and retired from the ring.Buy this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PGHP416KJX8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446545287#wasThisHelpful","R1PGHP416KJX8P","A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 2005 60-minute drama is not so much a straight up documentary but more of a recreation of Braddock's career with Lucas Grace playing the part of Braddock. Fight fans will appreciate this inspirational story. While it's not as enjoyable as Ron Howard's Cinderella Man (2005) it is more true to the real life account of James J. Braddock. Many common criticisms of Howard's film (with Russell Crowe in the lead) are addressed in this docu-drama (e.g. Max Baer wasn't so much of a villain in real life). The author of the book on which the film was based has asserted that Baer was kind, charismatic, loved and respected, and pointed out the emotional pain that Baer endured the rest of his life following Campbell's death, and the fact that he gave purses from his bouts to Campbell's family to help give Campbell's children an education.Buy this DVD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N39JKK6GN8K2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007WFXIU#wasThisHelpful","R2N39JKK6GN8K2","A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You get the complete Bourne collection in this UK box set. It includes Bourne Identity, Bourne Supremacy, Bourne Ultimatum, and Bourne Legacy. US purchasers should know the UltraViolet codes do not work outside the UK. That's a big minus because you can't access the digital copies or the 2.5 hours of non-disc special features provided by Universal that are available in the US Blu-ray releases of these films (there is still 3 hours of bonus content on the discs themselves that are accessible). I would rate the films 4 stars and this release only 3 stars because it's not a deluxe collection since it only bundles the 4 stand-alone Blu-rays together in one package. Fans who own The Bourne Trilogy may opt to purchase Bourne Legacy separately (yet it remains the weakest of the franchise films). If you can buy this box set at a good price it does work well as a value pack.

"This book examines many alternative ideas that are not accepted in the mainstream scientific community in 26 chapters. Interestingly, Gardner attempts to debunk flying saucers alongside more ""acceptable"" topics like vegetarianism, homeopathy, osteopathy and chiropractic. Other topics are much more obscure. Gardner provides copious examples to support his two major themes: 1) Statistical problems relating to a small data set cause people to theorize before they have all the facts, and 2) The need to believe causes people to select evidence to support their beliefs and ignore other evidence.1 - In the Name of Science, the introductory chapter2 - Flat and Hollow, the Flat Earth theory of Wilbur Glenn Voliva, the Hollow Earth theories of John Cleves Symmes, Jr. and Cyrus Reed Teed3 - Monsters of Doom, Immanuel Velikovsky's Worlds in Collision, William Whiston's A New Theory of the Earth, Ignatius Donnelly's Ragnarok; Hans Hrbiger's Welteislehre and Hrbiger's disciple Hans Schindler Bellamy.4 - The Forteans, Charles Fort, Tiffany Thayer and the Fortean Society, The Hutchins-Adler Great Books Movement5 - Flying Saucers, Kenneth Arnold, the Mantell UFO Incident, Raymond Palmer, Richard Shaver, Donald Keyhoe, Frank Scully, Gerald Heard and the Unidentified flying object movement6 - Zig-Zag-and-Swirl, Alfred Lawson and his ""Lawsonomy""7 - Down with Einstein!, Joseph Battell, Thomas H.

I must side with Colin Wilson who said, ""after half a dozen chapters this non-stop superiority begins to irritate; you begin to wonder about the standards that make him so certain he is always right. He asserts that the scientist, unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. So how can he be so sure that no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing rod to locate water?"" Not everything that Gardner discusses should be labeled pseudo-science as some of these ideas have passed the test of time. He often overlooks the psychological benefits of alternative therapy (such as chiropractic). The book's biggest failing is to refuse to make any real concessions because not everything is an exact science. Oddly Gardner says general semantics ""may or may not have considerable scientific merit"" before he rips it apart. There is room for fallible human experience in the world but apparently not in Martin Gardner's world. Gardner's hatred of spiritual ideas is obvious and everyone who disagrees with him is labeled a ""crackpot"" and there is quite a bit of mud-slinging for a person who claims to be on the side of objective scientific knowledge. Chapters 16 (Medical Cults) and 23 (General Semantics) have more merit than Gardner is willing to admit. Two ideas Gardner was wrong about include the expanding universe astronomy theory and the abandonment of the gold standard economic theory. Most people today believe that these ideas are true (or at least worthwhile). Gardner just wasn't open-minded or courageous enough to adopt new viewpoints so the book remains stuck in 1952 when it was originally published.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G5MQI2FLY2UM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486203948#wasThisHelpful","R3G5MQI2FLY2UM","A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This autobiography has 30 chapters (648 pages) and dozens of compelling pictures to supplement the text (one page has an interesting reproduction of 28 movie posters in small size and another shows the magazine covers Arnie appeared on during his political tenure). The pictures are mostly high quality, previously unreleased and complement the text well (not the usual stock filler added to increase the price of the book). Though this is billed as Arnie's autobiography, he did get help from a co-author, Peter Petre, who also collaborated on the Thomas J. Watson (IBM) and General Norman Schwarzkopf (U.S. Army) autobiographies. Arnie talks about moving to America, learning English, body-building, getting his college degree, his acting career and getting elected governor of California. The focus of the book is split between family, politics, business (e.g. Planet Hollywood), bodybuilding and movies with each getting roughly one-fifth treatment of the total book (although most chapters include a little bit of everything). The chapter on Total Recall is about the 2003 California recall election not the film. The writing style is fairly breezy and there isn't much depth (this isn't a ""tell-all"" book) although it is an interesting read geared towards fans. Arnie's worldview can be very entertaining and inspiring but if you aren't a fan your opinion of Arnie probably won't change much by the end of the book. The aggressiveness, competitiveness and perseverance of the man shines through every page.Movie fans may be disappointed that Arnie's filmography isn't given a greater emphasis (which doesn't really start until the filming of Conan the Barbarian in Chapter 14). His early filmography is discussed (e.g. Conan the Barbarian, Conan the Destroyer, The Terminator, Predator, Twins, Total Recall, T2, Last Action Hero and True Lies) but coverage of his later films taper off. Red Sonja, Commando, Raw Deal, Red Heat, The Running Man, Kindergarten Cop, and Junior aren't mentioned much (it seems they weren't Arnie's favorites but a few interesting tidbits are provided). Discussion of his films from 1996 - 2012 is even lighter. He has a lot in common with his on-screen persona and admits he doesn't change much from movie to movie so he essentially plays himself (at least in action roles since Arnie also worked hard to branch out into comedic roles). Arnie believes 1982's E.T. hurt the market for R-Rated action (studio executives advised you can sell 50% more tickets with a PG rating). Arnold admits he pushed for a sequel to Twins for 25 years that is titled ""Triplets"" with Eddie Murphy. Triplets has been inching closer to becoming a reality since 2012. We are told that Minority Report was envisioned as a sequel to Total Recall with Arnie playing the detective role that eventually went to Tom Cruise. His 1998 absence from film stems from his heart surgery that almost ended his career while studio execs fretted over the physical demands of being an action star. Arnie's movie career didn't get back on track until an independent producer took a chance on him with End of Days.As one could expect from a larger than life Hollywood celebrity, Arnie lacks humility and self-awareness at times. In terms of bodybuilding championships Arnie says, ""winning was a given"" and ""Okay, did that. Let's move on to the next competition."" Some wild psychological tricks were pulled on Lou Ferrigno and Sergio Oliva. Jesse Ventura's transition to political life is described as ""failed"" while Ventura served a ""shaky term as governor"" despite the (former?) friendship between the two stars (who appeared in Predator, The Running Man and Batman & Robin together). Arnie's Republican roots stem from growing up in a socialist country where 70% of the people work for the government. Meetings with Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and others are recounted. Almost everyone in the book gets a comment from Arnie about their physique so action stars like Sylvester Stallone and Clint Eastwood are talked up while others are simply ""girlie men."" You hear Dino De Laurentiis is a ""small man, very short"", James Cameron, Paul Verhoeven and Gray Davis are ""skinny"" and Henny Youngman is a ""fat pig."" Arnie is very deferential towards Ivan Reitman and obviously wants to work with him again. There are many amusing anecdotes throughout that may rub some non-fans the wrong way, for example, neither Wilt Chamberlain or Grace Jones consider themselves to be African Americans and Arnie was warned before he got married that wedding cake kills a woman's sex drive.Overall, Total Recall may be a bit too long for its message and it is not as candid about certain well-known events (e.g. Enron electricity scandal, Arnie's womanizing, Arnie's 23% approval rating when leaving office) as it could be. Chapter 29: The Secret talks about Arnie's marital infidelity. While filming Batman & Robin in 1996, Arnie had a liaison with his housekeeper that conceived a son in his guest house while the family was away on vacation. He considers himself still married and believes he will reconcile with Maria one day. Arnie says he has always been secretive but ultimately reveals little that is not already known about the affair. He also recognizes the need to move on with his life. One does get the impression Arnie's goal in writing the book was to win Maria Shriver back. He is very complimentary towards her and casts the Kennedy family in a good light. Ultimately I do believe Arnie's star will rise again post-scandal. I do respect how hard he worked and how unlikely his success was when he could have ended up being a beach bum. Arnie advises people to sleep 6 hours a day and work hard on your dreams the rest of the time. While Total Recall does have its flaws I must admit the book is rarely dull and keeps you engaged.Buy this book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YC4CCCKQ2HK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451662440#wasThisHelpful","R1YC4CCCKQ2HK9","A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"William James was an incredible psychologist turned philosopher (who also studied medicine at Harvard). This book was originally published in 1902 and was an immediate bestseller. It was based on lectures James provided in 1901 and 1902. The Lectures: Religion and Neurology, Circumscription of the Topic, The Reality of the Unseen, The Religion of Healthy Mindedness, The Sick Soul, The Divided Self and the Process of its Unification, Conversion, Saintliness, The Value of Saintliness, Mysticism, Philosophy, Other Characteristics, Conclusions, and a Postscript. Many reviewers have noted this book is one of the 100 best nonfiction books of the 20th century. The Modern Library Classics edition is 616 pages and has all 20 lectures along with a postscript. There are a few different versions of the book available. No matter the edition you pick up you will be enlightened by James's ideas on conversion, repentance, mysticism, and hope of reward and fears of punishment in the hereafter. James examines the direct experiences of people under the influence of religious moods and mystical states of mind. He is critical of dogmas and mainstream spiritual beliefs as he focuses on the individual experience as the root of religious experience. These lectures are descriptive as they are loaded with specific examples so it makes for very interesting reading. My version of the book provides extensive footnotes (some take up nearly the entire page) but these are essential to appreciating the examples provided by James. Some editions dispense with the footnotes entirely leaving a book that is less than half of its original size (as little as 284 pages).The chapter on Religion of Healthy-Mindedness is interesting as it describes ""mind-cure"" (new age) methods of achieving union with the divine. These techniques are structurally similar to some forms of religious conversion that you would find in Christian Fundamentalism (e.g. born again Christians). James describes religious experience as primarily personal and related to feeling. He sees little compatibility with intellect and religion but recognizes the individual religious experience as vital to humanity. James connects religion with the unconscious mind and goes so far as to identify some saints and mystics as nearly psychotic but refuses to dismiss their experiences as he sees them essential for life and worthy of study. For example, he sees the value of prayer (but only praying for yourself or others and not for better weather or lottery numbers) but believes it does not matter who the prayer is addressed to as he prefers to view the act itself as important without the need for formulas or dogma. Despite the critical examination of religious experience James does remain a believer and proposes a science of religion to replace current systems of dogma. To his credit, James reaches conclusions that are quite a bit different from what you might expect. After listing scores of examples he manages to bring his own original insights from a psychological perspective. He was truly an original thinker who had something unique to impart to his audience. My only criticism is that James provides mostly examples so there isn't much analysis and James himself admits his interest in religious experience is intellectual so he lacks a personal experience of the direct spiritual awakening that he values so highly (he claims he does not have the ""constitution"" for mystical states of consciousness).James grew up in a very tolerant household and had parents who were influenced by the ideas of mystic Emanuel Swedenborg. The pluralistic wisdom of James flows through these pages. He focuses on one major idea per lecture and strips away the core element that can be used in a practical manner. James does not get swept away by metaphor and drills down to the root of the religious experience. One of the major messages I took away was how varied religious experience is since James feels that no single experience deserves to be called the ""truth"" except by the person experiencing it. His philosophy is one of Pragmatism while he points out the deficiencies of other philosophers (such as Immanuel Kant). James ultimately feels philosophy should abandon religion and metaphysics. James studied associationism, spiritualism, and was a founding member of the American Society for Psychical Research. He was interested in the practical, successful use of ideas rather than their representative accuracy so he wasn't given to flights of fancy common to people studying paranormal events. Some strongly religious-minded people of faith and new agers probably won't turn to this book unless they want their metaphysical balloons deflated a little. My only complaint is that some of the descriptions seem long-winded and dry to the modern reader.Buy this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZPF5YCSX6RUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439297274#wasThisHelpful","R2ZPF5YCSX6RUS","A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was originally published as ""Huxley and God"" in 1992. I had only read three of Huxley's books before turning to ""The Divine Within."" In this anthology of 26 essays and two poems published between 1941 and 1960, Huxley looks at the nature of God, enlightenment, being, good and evil, religion, eternity, and the divine. In 1926, Huxley declared himself an agnostic and was ""scathingly skeptical of religion"" who believed in ""life, love and sex."" However, since he wrote frequently about metaphysical themes he did find himself drawn towards the divine and eventually had a change of heart. He shares his methods for seeking God and believes all who seek will eventually find God. I was impressed at the clarity of his thought and insights. Though some of his ideas have been absorbed into the public consciousness almost all of them remain relevant today. Huxley wasn't content to repeat time-worn clichs about enlightenment. While some of Huxley's other books are a bit too detailed for my taste I found this book to be quite accessible in comparison. Huxley remains critical of religious tradition, dogma and nationalism as he weaves a common thread to spiritual thought. Huxley's main theme appears to be that self gets in the way of Self. My only complaint is that most of the message is on what *not* to do and some of the essays repeat his core ideas; fortunately Huxley also provides some practical suggestions for the individual seeker who wants to find the divine within for himself.Most of the chapters are about 10 pages long with the exception of Knowledge and Understanding which is almost 40 pages in length. The chapter on Religion and Temperament examines three psychological types (viscerotonic, somatotonic, and cerebrotonic) and is well worth reading to understand how religious ritual, active good works and contemplation relate to each other. The chapter on Idolatry dismisses technological, political and moral hubris (""overweening and excess"") as narrow-minded and lacking the grace of God. Action and Contemplation shows Huxley's reversal from the pragmatist position espoused by William James (who is otherwise well-regarded in the preface and introduction to this book). He sees action as having value only as a means while Huxley promotes contemplation (beatific vision of reality) as the end goal. Knowledge and Understanding reveals Huxley's sympathies with existentialist philosophy as he believes existence precedes essence (in contrast to the cogito of Descartes, ""I think, therefore I am""). Where he differs from philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre is his optimism as he reserves a place for God in our daily life (immanent as opposed to transcendent). Like William James, Huxley believes direct spiritual experience trumps religious dogma and spiritual formulas as he encourages readers to discard fixed patterns of thought and action throughout the book.The Selected Writings: The Minimum Working Hypothesis, Seven Meditations, Religion and Temperament, Who are We?, The Philosophy of the Saints, Religion and Time, Some Reflections on Time, On a Sentence from Shakespeare, Man and Reality, Reflections on Progress, Further Reflections on Progress, Substitutes for Liberation, Reflections on the Lord's Prayer I, II, III, Distractions I, II, Idolatry, Action and Contemplation, Knowledge and Understanding, The Sixth Patriarch, Notes on Zen, The ""Inanimate"" is Alive, Readings in Mysticism, Symbol and Immediate Experience, Shakespeare and Religion, The Yellow Mustard, and Lines.Buy this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R173UEAQMOJ0SU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062236814#wasThisHelpful","R173UEAQMOJ0SU","A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"** Trigger warning for rape.**Ive been a fan of Kate Hardings ever since her days blogging at Shakespeares Sister (now Shakesville). I think I first caught wind of her latest project, ASKING FOR IT: THE ALARMING RISE OF RAPE CULTURE -- AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT, more than a year ago, and have spent the interim occasionally checking the books Amazon listing, where the publication date seemed to creep further and further away. And its no wonder: every month brings with it a new development in the national conversation about rape and rape culture.As Harding explains in the Authors Note:""When I sold the proposal for this book in 2012, I foolishly agreed to finish the manuscript in six months, because my agent, editor, and I agreed that rape culture was having a moment, as it were. News of the Steubenville, Ohio, gang rape case was picking up steam, and the memory of Missouri Representative Todd Akins legitimate rape gaffe was fresh in all our minds. Sexual violence was suddenly a popular topic, but  based on national conversations about rape in the 1970s and 1990s that started strong and dissipated quickly  we feared that if we waited too long, this book might be released to a public that was already over it.""The bad news is that it took me way longer than six months to finish the manuscript. The good news  amazingly, wonderful, really sort of mind-blowing news actually  is that years later, Americans are still walking seriously about rape and rape culture.""ASKING FOR IT is a welcome addition to the conversation: smart, witty, and surprisingly enjoyable. Well, not enjoyable, exactly  thats not quite right  but Hardings sometimes-snarky tone and penchant for calling bulls*** as needed make for a slightly less depressing read.And theres so much to feel disheartened about. Normally this is where, in a nonfiction book review, I might insert choice excerpts to represent the overall content and tone of the book. In this case: statistics concerning the prevalence of rape (at some point in their lives 1 in 5 women and 1 in 71 men will be raped; 98% of offenders are men; 64% of rapes are never reported, while only 12% lead to arrest); an especially egregious case of victim-blaming (the eleven-year-old Jane Doe from Cleveland, Texas, who was gang-raped and then likened by a defense attorney to a spider, luring his client the fly to certain doom); anti-rape campaigns gone horribly wrong (a 2006 ditty from the British Home Office features a prison rape joke!); or scientific studies of law enforcement officers acceptance of rape culture myths (in one study, 28.8% of participants estimated that 50% or more of rape allegations were false  with some respondents putting the figure at 100%).But I dont really want to do that here. Even choosing the examples cited above proved an exercise in indecision.My reluctance isnt just because the books filled to bursting with surprising (or not, unless youre an off-the-grid hermit) facts and eminently-quotable passages. Rather, the whole is so much greater than the sum of its parts, and Id be doing it  and you  a disservice by pretending otherwise. In ASKING FOR IT, Harding masterfully dissects and interrogates rape culture, critiquing its various components and manifestations, sometimes even identifying unexpected connections. For example, abortion, online trolling, Gamergate, and revenge porn might not seem (at least to the casual observer) to have much  if anything  to do with sexual assault. Yet Harding shows how anti-abortion activists and politicians  and rapists themselves  use reproductive rights as a cudgel to control women and their bodies. Likewise, those who harass women from the comfort and anonymity of the internet often invoke the threat of rape to silence women, removing them  and their voices  from the public sphere.Though I no longer read feminist blogs with the same religious fervor as my early days on the net (I slowly cycled from anger to depression to burnout), I still keep up with the news on social media, and I like to think Im fairly well-informed with it comes to womens issues like rape. (Scare quotes because labeling rape a womens problem a) places the onus on women to stop it and b) helps to remove men from the conversation, when they should be at the epicenter, as Harding astutely notes. The way rape is reported, youd think its a perpetratorless crime!) And while I did indeed recognize a number of cases cited by Harding  Steubenville, Bill Cosby, Emma Sulkowicz, Roman Polanski, Julian Assange*, the Central Park Five  a rather surprising minority proved news to me. (How did I manage to miss the whole Ben Roethlisberger catastrof***?) Likewise, while weve all heard the statistics about rape, the psychological/sociological research presented here is as informative as it is chilling.I also appreciate the light Harding shines on potential solutions, as promised in the second half of the books subtitle: What We Can Do about It. Among these are successful education campaigns, undertaken by organizations, yet Harding also emphasizes the many ways that individuals can have an impact in their own lives, from taking to social media to shame companies, institutions, and artists into doing better, to challenging rape culture within your own social circles. (Dudes, were looking at you.)For younger readers, or those new to the topic, ASKING FOR IT is an accessible introduction to rape culture. In particular, I think it could be an excellent resource for parents whod like to broach the subject with their teens, or for intro-level college courses (womens studies, psychology, criminology). Academics and journalists may also find something new and stimulating here; like I said, Harding makes some exciting connections and observations. If nothing else, it may challenge you to see one or more aspects of rape culture from a different angle.Naturally, there are a few areas I wish Harding has spent more (or some) time on. While Harding approaches the topic with an intersectional focus  teasing out the ways that race, class, sexual orientation, sexual identity, and disability interact with misogyny vis--vis rape culture (for the accused as well as victims)  a discussion of the unique challenges faced by, say, trans women would have been welcome. Likewise, a dedicated section on campus rape by college athletes could have helped tease out the many threads that make up the vom-worthy tapestry that is rape culture, sitting as it does on the nexus of campus rape and celebrity. (Its worth noting that journalist Andrea Grimes announced a book deal to address this very topic last August.) And while revenge porn and upskirt photos are mentioned in passing, both are forms of sexual assault that are slowly being recognized as the serious violations that they are (18 states now have laws on the books re: revenge porn)  making them ripe for discussion.* I cannot thank Harding enough for the (relatively) lengthy look at the Assange case. Liberal dudebros, cmon! If the CIA really wanted to lock him up, why fabricate charges for the most under-reported, under-prosecuted, under-punished crime of, like, ever? Better to frame him for embezzling donations or a killing a pedestrian in a hit-and-run. Refusing to stop once a consensual sexual encounter became non-consensual? Yeesh. Most people dont even consider that rape.

"The Ivation Universal Smartphone Camera Lens Kit is a neat little accessory kit for your smartphone.  It comes with a lens clip, three lenses, three lens caps, and a microfiber bag to carry it all.  The lens clip is pretty adjustable and I was able to attach it to three different phones, a Samsung Galaxy Note 4, an iPhone 5C, and a Nexus 5.  It can be a little tricky to get the clip stable, but once you find the right spot, it feels really secure.The kit comes with a large telephoto lens, and smaller macro and fish-eye lenses, and I tried each one with each of my phones.  They screw onto the clip, so you can switch lenses pretty quickly without removing the clip from the phone.  I had really good success with the macro and fish-eye lens, but the results with the telephoto lens were pretty spotty.  While images were zoomed in, its hard to keep the phone steady enough to take a good picture.  Images come out fuzzy because its also hard to focus.  I had no issues with the macro and fish-eye lenses.Overall, I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  The ability to put these lenses on any phone I have was really cool.  I liked the results from two of the lenses a lot, and while the results of the telephoto lens were spotty, it was still neat to have.

"Originally published in 1988 and revised in 2003, the third edition of Bryan Petersons LEARNING TO SEE CREATIVELY is all-new, completely rewritten and re-illustrated, with a brand new section on Photoshop. This is my first Peterson book but, judging from some of the other reviews, he seems to be a well-known and respected photography author and instructor.And its easy to see why: LEARNING TO SEE CREATIVELY is accessible and well-written, with a positive, can-do attitude and plenty of helpful illustrations and activities to help get those creative juices flowing. Peterson frequently includes photos of the same subject, taken from multiple angles and perspectives and with different composition and framing, to give the reader an idea of what works  and what works better. (His eight-photo spread of the Dutch windmill is my favorite use of this technique.) Theres a decided emphasis on personal vision with creative exercises to help you find your own.The books divided into five sections, which you can either browse or read straight through. Expanding Your Vision challenges the reader to think about what you see  vs. what your camera sees. Theres also an excellent primer on choosing the right camera lens for the job. The Elements of Design introduces us to line, shape, form, texture, pattern, and color, exploring how they work in harmony  and how we can best coax them into working for us. Composition covers everything from the basics (horizontal vs. vertical orientation; the rule of thirds; contrast) to more advanced topics (working your subject; breaking the rules). Last but not least are the chapters on The Magic of Light (direction, color, overcast and rainy days) and Photoshop.Peterson includes a fair amount of technical detail, including information on the camera and settings used to take each picture. While the more advanced stuff made my beginners head spin, I wouldnt steer newbies clear of this book: the many lovely photos offer readers new and exciting ways of approaching photography. From portraits to landscapes to abstract macro artwork and tourist attractions that have been done to death, examples run the gamut and provide a wealth of inspiration.Professionals might find some of Petersons views controversial (hes pro-staging and pro-Photoshop  as long as it doesnt make you lazy IRL), but being a beginner, I didnt really see the big deal. Live and let live. Unless youre a photojournalist, then staging becomes a little more problematic, methinks.My only caveat: if you like what you see re: Photoshop, dont begin and end with the last chapter.

Not to the tune of being able to reenact entire scenes from THE TOMB OF LIGEIA or keeping a raven as a pet; but as in the first (and only!) gift my father every personally picked out for me was a leather-bound collection of Poes complete works (Im vegan now, but I keep it around for sentimental reasons) and I might, one day, name one of my rescue dogs Annabel Lee. Its fair to say that Im interested, but not obsessed.So when I spotted NEVERMORE! in Library Things July batch, it was Poes name that grabbed by attention  but Margaret Atwoods that really sealed the deal. If Im a bit of a Poe fangirl, then Im freaking Annie Wilkes when it comes to Atwood. I exaggerate, but not by much.Edited by Nancy Kilpatrick and Caro Soles, NEVERMORE!: TALES OF MURDER, MYSTERY & THE MACABRE features twenty-two stories that are inspired by Poe; contain elements from Poes oeuvre; and/or are retellings of his stories. Some are more modern takes on Poe, while others employ similar language and have the same weirdly sinister vibe. If youre a hardcore Poe fan, probably youll get more out of the stories than the casual or non-fan; theres a lot of name-dropping, as well as references to real, historical events from Poes life. However, I wouldnt limit the audience just to those familiar with Poe; many of the stories are solid enough to stand on their own. Bonus points: Each story is prefaced with a brief introduction by the author(s), for added context.And fellow Margaret Atwood fans? Definitely give it a spin, if only for The Eye of Heaven  written by a sixteen-year-old Margaret Atwood (!). Naturally shes humble about her contribution (The Eye of Heaven might not be very good, though its good enough for a sixteen-year-old) but its among my favorites. I would pay to read her MadLibs, though, so grain of salt.As with many anthologies, its a bit of a mixed bag; there are some truly wonderful stories here, a few I didnt really care for, and a large chunk that fall somewhere in the middle. (I tried to avoid any major spoilers in the story summaries, but please skip them if youd rather read the collection with virgin eyes.)A Rather Scholarly View of Edgar Allen Poe, Genre-Crosser by Uwe Sommerlad  The title pretty much says it all. DNF, but mostly because I wasnt in the mood to read a non-fiction essay about Poe. Just give me the stories please!The Gold Bug Conundrum by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro  A wealthy video game developer buys a dilapidated estate on a Caribbean Island located in the Bermuda Triangle, as its rumored to be the inspiration for Edgar Allen Poes The Gold Bug. That, and hidden pirate treasure! Needless to say, the transaction doesnt end well. 2/5 stars. The beginning reads like an HGTV script, and the climax is rather underwhelming.Street of the Dead House by Robert Lopresti  When hunters murder his mom, the young orangutan Jupiter goes to live with the Professor, who meddles with his brain (presumably, to make him smarter) and teaches him to sign. A visiting sailor from France, taken with the friendly primate, kills the Professor and kidnaps Jupiter, hoping to sell him to a zoo in Paris. When Jupiter refuses to cooperate, the two hatch a plan to steal an elderly ladys gold so that Jupiter can pay his fare back to Borneo. 5/5 stars. Jupiter gives me all the feels, you guys.Naomi by Christopher Rice  The narrators niece, a young trans woman, committed suicide after the bullying at school became too much to bear. Yet her ringtone  a bouncy pop number that triggered the worst of the abuse  lives on, driving her tormentors to take their own lives as well. 5/5 stars.Finding Ulalume by Lisa Morton  The narrators sister Anna went missing in Weir Forest when they were just twelve and thirteen years old. Decades have passed, and the narrator  now a search and rescue volunteer  has been summoned to the forest to find a missing team of surveyors. 4/5 stars.Obsession with the Bloodstained Door by Rick Chiantaretto  As a child, the narrator becomes lost in a sinister, mysterious mansion; in his many years of wandering, hes only encountered one locked door that he cannot breach. It becomes his obsession. 3/5 stars.The Lighthouse by Barbara Fradkin  Its 1942 and World War II rages on. 18-year-old Sammy, an aspiring writer, is sent to help his uncle maintain the lighthouse on Quirpon Island (Newfoundland). One foggy night, Uncle Nat goes missing  and a strange soldier (a Nazi deserter?) washes up on the shore. Is this a case of life mimicking art? The story features a frustratingly abrupt ending, just like the original. 4/5 stars.The Masques of Amanda Llado by Thomas S. Roche  A disgruntled music critic lures his ex-boss  a postmodern frat boy from a failed tech startup  to his basement warehouse with the promise of a rare Amanda Llado album. Needless to say, none of us will miss the dudebro. 5/5 stars.Atargatis by Robert Bose  Stars great-grandfather passes away, leaving her a locket that bears the face of a mermaid  and contains a mysterious key. His last word to her? Atargatis. 5/5 stars.The Ravens of Consequence by Carol Weekes and Michael Kelly  An old hermit is plagued by memories of a family he never had. Or did he? 4/5 stars.Annabel Lee by Nancy Holder  A retelling of Annabel Lee from Annabels perspective, this story also incorporates some elements from Poes other works. 5/5 stars.Dinner with Mamalou by J. Madison Davis  The CEO of the Makadam Energy (evil megacorp incarnate!) agrees to a sit-down dinner with Mrs. Bertrand, aka Mamalou, the matriarch of the backwater town she calls home. On the menu: a discussion of the six deaths in St. Germain Parish since the company began fracking there. Also: revenge! 3/5 stars. The villains are a little too cartoonish for me.The Deave Lane by Michael Jecks  An archaeologists worst nightmare comes true when shes called to investigate a body found buried in the mors  and stumbles right into the midst of a pagan death cult. 3/5 stars.133 by Richard Christian Matheson  The Resurrectionists Guide to the Death Penalty. 3/5 stars.Afterlife by William F. Nolan, Jason V. Brock, and Sunni K. Brock  Explores the idea that Poe could become trapped in the physical space of his own letters  specifically, those thought to be forged by Rufus Griswold and burned by Charles Leland. 3/5 stars.The Drowning City by Loren Rhoads  How to outwit a siren using modern technology. The futuristic look at Venice is both lovely and heartbreaking. 3/5 stars.The Orange Cat by Kelley Armstrong  An abused cat refuses to cast his one good eye away from his cruel owner  even after hes been euthanized and had his bashed in as part of a double murder. Gabriel Walsh (of Armstrongs Cainsville series) is on the case. 4/5 stars.The Inheritance by Jane Petersen Burfield  Annabel the raven exacts her revenge on the boys responsible for her death  from beyond the grave. 3/5 stars.Sympathetic Impulses by David McDonald  In trying to uncover how a captured spy withstands torture, an Inquisitor unwittingly becomes the means by which he does so. 3/5 stars.Asylum by Colleen Anderson  A vamp with a taste for the crazies happens upon an asylum thats been taken over by the lunatics. 3/5 stars.The Return of Berenice by Tanith Lee  A retelling of Berenice in which the titular bride is actually a vampire  and Egaeus has condemned his cousin to a fate worse than (un)death by stealing her most valuable asset. 3/5 stars.The Eye of Heaven by Margaret Atwood  A young man is haunted by the eyes of those hes killed  fishes and family members alike. 5/5 stars.

"** Trigger warning for violence. **Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,Old time is still a-flying;And this same flower that smiles todayTomorrow will be dying.###We were music. We were jazz. We were alive.###Like her mother Alice and her Granny Letty before her, Ivy Rowan can see Uninvited Guests. Ghosts, harbinger spirits who only appear to Ivy to herald a death. Instead of offering her comfort, the ghosts of her beloved ancestors inspire nothing but fear and dread in Ivys bleeding heart. Every time they visit her, someone dies.The year is 1918. As the twin horrors of World War I and the Spanish Influenza rip across the globe, leaving millions of corpses in their wake  many of them the young and the healthy; those who should have their whole lives ahead of them  the ghosts seem to come at Ivy in droves. Death is a constant.Theres her younger brother Billy, who was killed in the Battle of Saint-Michiel just a month ago. Eddie Dover, target of so many teenage crushes, also felled in battle. And Albrecht Schendel  the German businessman her father Frank and youngest brother Peter beat to death in cold blood.Fueled by whiskey and grief  not to mention toxic levels of American patriotism  the pair broke into his furniture store late at night, vandalized and otherwise trashed the place, tortured poor Albrecht, and ultimately garroted him to death. They blamed his people  Germany, the country he fled  for Billys death. Wishing to avoid an incident like that in Collinsville, the police and media covered up their involvement, instead claiming that a pair of traveling vagrants (conveniently long gone) was to blame.Though Ivy never got on well with her abusive and alcoholic father, this latest injustice is the last straw, the one that finally drives the twenty-five-year-old recluse/spinster to leave her familys farm on the outskirts of town. She rents a room with May Dover  Eddies widow  and is unwittingly recruited into helping two Red Cross volunteers transport less desirable influenza patients (read: immigrants of Polish, Russian, and Romanian descent, as well as African-Americans) across the south side of town.Desperate to repent for the sins of her father and brother, she strikes up a tentative relationship with the brother of the murdered German, Daniel Schendel. Together they create an Eden of sorts in the upper quarters of Liberty Brothers Furniture, an escape from the death and disease of the outside world. However, Daniels harboring an important secret  one that threatens to upend Ivys fragile happiness for good.So this is my first Cat Winters novel, though IN THE SHADOW OF BLACKBIRDS and THE CURE FOR DREAMING are both on my TBR/wishlist. They both just got bumped a little higher up, let me tell you.THE UNINVITED is a thing of beauty; a lovely and masterful mashup of multiple genres: historical fiction, romance, ghost story. The prose is charming and nicely complemented by the poetry of Emily Dickinson  of which Ivy, a fellow home-bound young woman, is a fan. The pacing is steady, though the first and final acts of the book have rather distinct vibes. The supernatural element of the plot doesnt really manifest until the last act, and ghosts remain mostly absent until the ~40% mark. This kept me on my toes and guessing  and ultimately, the story was not at all what I expected (in the best way possible!).For me, the unlikely romance between Ivy and Daniel really stole the show. Its beginning is a little creepy, but the relationship slowly blossoms into something beautiful and enchanting  but also terribly complicated. On the surface, theres the fact that Ivys own family murdered Daniels brother. Though her sensitive heart is wracked with grief, Daniel forgives her. Or rather, he never has to, not quite, since she shouldnt be made to pay for the mistakes of others  just as Daniel himself shouldnt be treated like an enemy combatant just for the country of his birth.No stranger to assuming the burdens of others  Wendy Darling stayed on at her familys farm so that she might protect her younger siblings from her fathers wrath, for example  Ivys companionship with Daniel also threatens to put her in the crossfire of the the American Protective League, personified here by Billys childhood friend Lucas. The APL was a big brother-type organization made up of private citizens who worked with federal agents to root out those with suspected pro-German and socialist loyalties. Bullies and specks who target others to feel more significant, to paraphrase Daniel.Many of the organizations and events that form the more hateful backdrop of THE UNINVITED are pulled from the pages of history. Fort Oglethorpe really was an internment camp in Georgia; Robert Paul Prager was a German-born coal miner in Collinsville, Illinois, who was killed by a lynch mob in 1918; Alien Registration Cards were a thing; and WWI saw bans, both official and de facto, on German language, music, foods, etc. In a trend still seen today (freedom fries, anyone?), sauerkraut was renamed liberty cabbage, and hamburgers became liberty steaks. Buchanans ban on performing Beethoven? Totally plausible.In addition to the anti-German sentiment that permeated American society during WWI, Winters also explores the race, class, and ethnic dimensions of the 1918 influenza epidemic. When she encounters a Red Cross transport vehicle stalled on the railroad tracks separating south Buchanan from the more prosperous parts of the city, Ivy jumps in to help and ends up being recruited as a volunteer. Polish immigrant Nela and black (Negro) teenager Addie are going door-to-door in search of influenza victims stuck in their homes in Southside Buchanan. Instead of taking them to Polish Hall  an under-equipped, understaffed holding place for poor, first-generation immigrant and African-American influenza victims  they instead transport them to Nelas house for more intimate care.Winters makes clear that theres a stark racial, ethnic, and class divide evident in the care different patients received; for example, Ivy notes with horror the personal house calls she received from her own physician when she was struck with the flu several weeks previous. Meanwhile, one lone doctor is ministering to hundreds of patients at Polish Hall, assisted only by twelve-year-old Girl Scouts.One of the patients they rescue from Polish Hall is Benjie, a young black man whose father was the only doctor in Southside  until he volunteered to serve in the war. Insult, meet injury.I also adore the emphasis on music; its potential to unite, transform, and transcend. The dances at the Masonic Lodge offer a respite from the despair and suffering. There, an integrated jazz bands lets loose every night. When Ivy asks if Daniel  a guitarist  would be welcome to play with them, the pianist notes with a grin that their drummer, Ernest Ford, is half black, half German  and one hundred percent American jazz. Herself a piano teacher, she and Daniel discover a common bond in their love of music.I read a lot of Holocaust literature, but novels set in WWI are a little harder to come by. Likewise, while many American can tell you about the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, I never even considered that a similar fate might have befell German-Americans several decades prior. (Though I cant say it comes as a surprise. Again to quote Daniel: America has no right sailing to foreign lands in the name of protecting freedom  not when were steeped in the mire of violent inequity here at home.) THE UNINVITED does what the very best historical fiction manages to do: inspired me to learn more about the events touched upon in the story.Id say the same of the 1918 Influenza, but it was already a topic of great interest to me. Along with the authors stellar rep, it was the Spanish Flu angle that really grabbed my attention and made me want to pick up this book.I have so many more thoughts (AND FEELINGS!) about THE UNINVITED, I could go on for hours. But I wont do that to you!Instead, I will recommend THE UNINVITED to: fans of historical fiction; those obsessed with epidemics, both contemporary and historical; those who love a good supernatural romance  sexy more than scary; readers who like a moderate dose of SJ with their entertainment. And everyone/anyone who craves a twisty turny, skillfully written ghost story.** Full disclosure: I received a free electronic ARC for review through Edelweiss. **","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROWISQEPUCHCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQROY40#wasThisHelpful","ROWISQEPUCHCQ","AISSRJ7E2L375","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AISSRJ7E2L375?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** Trigger warning for sexual assault. The individual story summaries contain general plot details and/or vague spoilers. If youre rather approach the collection with unsullied eyes, skip these. **Millie liked sleeping with the air on her skin, even though it was dangerous out of doors. It felt more dangerous indoors, what with everyone growing up.(The Easthound)Who knows what a sea cucumber thinks of the conditions of its particular stretch of ocean floor?(Message in a Bottle)Confession time: This is my very first time reading Nalo Hopkinson, despite the fact that Ive collected several of her novels over the years. (So many books, so little time!) Given how much I enjoyed FALLING IN LOVE WITH HOMINIDS, I aim to rectify this ASAP.FALLING IN LOVE WITH HOMINIDS is Hopkinsons second collection of short fiction, published some fourteen years after SKIN FOLK. Shes also edited/contributed to four others: WHISPERS FROM THE COTTON TREE ROOT: CARIBBEAN FABULIST FICTION (2000); MOJO: CONJURE STORIES (2003); SO LONG BEEN DREAMING: POSTCOLONIAL SCIENCE FICTION & FANTASY (2004); and TESSERACTS NINE: NEW CANADIAN SPECULATIVE FICTION (2005). Born in Jamaica and raised in a middle/creative class literary environment, Hopkinson moved to Toronto at the age of sixteen and currently lives in Riverside, California. Her work often draws on Caribbean history and language, and exhibits wonderful diversity: gender, race, sexuality, nationality, you name it.These hallmarks are on full display in FALLING IN LOVE WITH HOMINIDS, which features eighteen new and previously published tales. An eclectic mix of fantasy, science fiction, magical realism, fairy tale retellings, and the outright absurd, the stories found here are both highly entertaining and marvelously profound. The protagonists grapple with a variety of issues, from the mundane to the otherworldly: navigating the perilous landscape of adolescence; the politics of black hair; sexual abuse and assault; racism, misogyny, and homophobia; grief and loss; what it means to be human (and whether this status can even be relegated to humans); and the possibilities of alien visitation and botanic sentience.Ever since starting the Dive Into Diversity reading challenge this year, Ive made it a point to take notes on diverse characters in my reads. After the first three stories in FALLING IN LOVE WITH HOMINIDS, I nearly gave up  diversity is the rule here, not the exception, as is so often the case. Only three stories dont feature a character who is explicitly non-white, LGBTQ, disabled, etc.; and in these cases, the cast is rather small, and race isnt mentioned at all.The other fifteen stories showcase casts that are as diverse as the plots are imaginative; characters who are black, Native American (Rosebud Sioux, to be exact), Indian, Latino, Armenian (maybe), and biracial; multiple gay and lesbian protagonists, some in committed relationships, others not  one gay man even recently out of the closet, after a decades-long marriage that resulted in children; interracial relationships and blended families; fat women and seemingly disabled children. In a refreshing change of page, its white, heterosexual characters who are the rarity.As is the case with most anthologies, I enjoyed some stories more than others. Even so, there isnt a single dud here: every story is enjoyable enough, though its true that some will stick with me much longer than others.** begin spoilers **The Easthound  In Millie and Jollys world, adolescence is a time fraught with danger and despair  for its when kids mature that they begin to sprout. Like their parents (all dead now) at the outset of the pandemic, teenagers transform into monsters seemingly overnight: rapidly growing, ravenous cannibal creatures that are a strange mix of those two horror movie staples, zombies and werewolves. Though they burn out quickly  done in by their taxing metabolism  usually they survive just long enough to crack open the skulls (or chests, or abdominal cavities) of their friends and loved ones. For this reason, most warrens of children exile their more mature members. When Millie wakes one morning to find what passes for Jollys bed empty, she goes out in search of her twin. Wonderfully creepy, and an apt metaphor for the teenage years. 5/5 stars.Soul Case  This historically-inspired fantasy (Hopkinson first devised this story while writing her upcoming novel BLACKHEART MAN, about a maroon community of escaped slaves set several hundred years in the future) features a magical battle between the Garfun village and their more well-armed invaders. The three Knowledgables are able to thwart the attack, but not without great cost to one of the witches  who, before the day is done, will sacrifice herself to save her community from karmic retribution. 5/5 stars (and BLACKHEART MAN cannot get here soon enough!).Message in a Bottle  In an attempt to protect the significant treasures of the past, future humans send genetically modified human clones back in time to pose as children and act as curators of a sort. Due to their unusual features, these time travelers are mistaken for disabled, contemporary humans (Delayed Growth Syndrome, or DGS kids) and are often marginalized: not only do they look odd, they act a little off too. Thats because theyre really adults, outfitted with the memories and knowledge of their Originals. Gregs niece Kamla is one such future anthropologist: and its a piece in his exhibit that shes sworn to protect. With ruminations on philosophy, art, and the very nature of what it means to be human, this is a weighty read  but a fun one, too! The animal lover in me especially appreciated Kamlas take on sea cucumbers and molluscs. 5/5 stars, and then some.The Smile on the Face  Rooted (see what I did there?) in the story of Margaret of Antioch, teenager Gilla channels the spirit of the half-dead cherry tree in her front yard to fend off a sexual assault. Theres so, so much to love about this story.The ancient tree began talking to Gilla when she hit puberty and started to fill out; her large breasts and butt frequently make her the target of unwanted male attention, while her ample belly and unruly hair prove additional sources of stress. (In one especially memorable exchange, Gilla begs her mom  a Professor of African and Middle Eastern Studies  for micro-braids: You want hair that lies down and plays dead, and you want to pay a lot of money for it, and you want to do it every six weeks.)Naturally the class predator Roger begins his campaign against Gilla by spreading rumors and slut-shaming before graduating to sexual assault and attempted rape  during a game of Postman, no less. When Gilla publicly accuses him of rape, nearly everyone rushes to her defense  save for Gossip Girl Clarissa, to whom Gilla makes this promise: if something bad ever happens to you and nobody will believe your side of the story, you can talk to me. Because I know what its like. Young women supporting other young women? Love. 5/5 stars.Left Foot, Right  In the tradition of fairy tale heroines who always seem to suffer some form of foot trouble, Jenna continues to limp around town in one battered pump weeks after the death of her sister, Zuleika  to whom the shoes originally belonged. (The girls were fighting over the footwear when their car swerved off the road and into a river. I can relate, in a way; decades after the fact, my right hand still bears a scar from when my younger sister Meesh cut me with my own cheap plastic ballet slipper.) Every week Jenna revisits the site of the accident, tossing a brand-new pair of pumps into the water as an offering. But only when Jenna confronts the second life lost that day can she and her sister finally move on. I love reimagined fairy tales, and this ones no exception. 5/5 stars.Old Habits  A spirit remains tethered to the place its body died  and in Old Habits, that place is the mall. Every day the ghosts are forced to relive their deaths. Not that they mind, or at least not as much as youd think; for these morbid reruns are their only chance to experience the trappings of corporeal existence. This storys great on its own  the narrators death scene is an exercise in tragicomedy  but its Black Anchor Ohsweygians demise that really struck a chord with me. (A homeless woman killed by an overzealous mall cop  how timely.) 5/5 stars.Emily Breakfast  When one of their three fire-breathing chickens (Chickens are descended from dragons, you idiot.) goes missing, its up to Cranston and Sir Maracles flying cat, Rose of Sharon, to hunt down the kidnapper and bring Emily Breakfast home. I loved the unusual menagerie of animals, but the overall tone is a little too cutesy-fantastical for my taste. At least Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner are rescue chickens though? 3/5 stars.Herbal  After an elephant rampages through her apartment, Jenny finds that she misses the big guy. Fun and weirdly absurd (floating pachyderms!), but a little on the short side. 3/5 stars.A Young Candy Daughter  You think being a parent is hard? Try raising a young God (a black girl named LaShawna ftw!), learning how to do good in the world. Think: that one episode of The X-Files where Mulder tries to craft the perfect wish. 5/5 stars.A Raggy Dog, a Shaggy Dog  Tammy Griggs is a fat (Lots of surface for my tattoos.) botanist who discovers that one of her orchids has hijacked a rat, modifying its anatomy to transform it into the ultimate urban pollinator  so naturally, she decides to use this new species to find a date of her own. Its a win-win! Well, except for the poor robo-rat. 4/5 stars, mostly because the rodents broke my heart. Rats and mice rock, okay.Shift  Hopkinson describes this as a paradigm shift on THE TEMPEST. I havent read the source material, but no matter: I enjoyed Shift just the same. Caliban fled from his mother Sycorax, whos confined to the sea. Immediately upon washing ashore, he meets his new girlfriend, an unnamed white woman who wears her golden hear in plaits and (he thinks) has a thing for black men (much like Miranda). But his sister Ariel is in hot pursuit, determined to deliver Mothers favorite child back to her. Caliban, who transforms into the man (or boy, in moms case) the women in his life picture him to be. When confronted by Sycorax and Ariel, the new woman unexpectedly challenges Caliban: Who do you think you are? 5/5 stars.Delicious Monster  After a life spent living in the closet, Carlos has finally found happiness. The bad news? Its with a God who must soon depart, in order to fulfill an ancient promise between two families. A rumination on parents and children, and the passing of torches. 4/5 stars.Snow Day  Ships from another world appear in the midst of a Toronto winter and ask the Earths animals  human and non  to make a choice: are you an Adventurer or a Beautiful Loser? Hopkinsons submission to the Canada Reads Project, this short story incorporates the titles of that years five shortlisted novels: BEAUTIFUL LOSERS by Leonard Cohen; NO CRYSTAL STAIR by Mairuth Sarsfield; ROCKBOUND by Frank Parker Day; VOLKSWAGON BLUES by Jacques Pulin; and  my favorite  Margaret Atwoods ORYX AND CRAKE. Oh, hell yeah. I used oryx and crake in a sentence. I cheered. 4/5 stars, mostly because I wanted more.Flying Lessons  Learning to leave your body during sexual abuseI think? Its a short and obscure one. 4/5 stars.Whose Upward Flight I Love  In which the park service wrestles with trees fighting to break free of the ground to which theyve been tethered and return to their homeland. I think this is a metaphor for romantic relationships, but damned if I know. 3/5 stars.Blushing  This retelling of the Bluebeard folktale sees the nobleman marrying a woman who, much to his surprise and delight, is as depraved as he. The twist really caught me by surprise. 4/5 stars.Ours Is the Prettiest  This short story is Hopkinsons contribution to the shared-world anthology Bordertown, recently revived by Ellen Kushner and Holly Black (submission solicited by same). This is the first Ive heard of it, so I was a little in the dark. Though the characters and their backstories eluded me, I still found the tale enjoyable enough and (mostly) easy to follow. It takes place on Jouvert, the annual parade that kicks off the week-long Jamboree. Damiana is trying to keep Beti away from Gladstone, her paramour of several weeks whos prone to fits of jealousy and violence, and is currently in a fit because she spotted Beti talking to another woman. But its not Gladstone Betis worried about  not when shes being pursued by her brother from the Other Side. 4/5 stars.Men Sell Not Such in Any Town  In which the rich want nothing more than to want more, and are willing to pay handsomely for the privilege. Masochism, delivered by robots. 3/5 stars.** end spoilers **I struggled for the better part of a week with the overall rating for this anthology. Normally, I try to average out each individual story rating; given the number of threes here, Id normally give FALLING IN LOVE WITH HOMINIDS four stars overall. But the best stories are so damn shiny that I just couldnt bring myself to do it! Message in a Bottle, The Smile on the Face, and A Young Candy Daughter are all so lovely and memorable and downright trenchant that they could carry the collection on their own. If they had to, which they dont.Final verdict: 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5 where necessary.** Full disclosure: I received a free electronic ARC for review through NetGalley. **","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WQ2YNIFNYW1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W0LR0H8#wasThisHelpful","R2WQ2YNIFNYW1G","AISSRJ7E2L375","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AISSRJ7E2L375?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** Trigger warning for rape and other forms of violence. **The abandoned field on the Jenkins property was licked to death by fire about two years before the Black-Eyed Susans were dumped there. A reckless match tossed by a lost car on a lonely dirt road cost a destitute old farmer his entire wheat crop and set the stage for the thousands and thousands of yellow flowers that covered the field like a giant, rumpled quilt.The fire also carved out our grave, an uneven, loping ditch. Black-eyed Susans sprung up and decorated it brazenly long before we arrived. The Susans are a greedy plant, often the first to thrive in scorched, devastated earth. Pretty, but competitive, like cheerleaders. They like to crowd out the others.One lit match, one careless toss, and our nicknames were embedded in serial killer lore forever.Sixteen-year-old Tessie Cartwright went out for a run one night and woke up in a grave. One minute, she was at Walgreens, buying a box of tampons and a Snickers bar for Roosevelt, the homeless man she passes every Wednesday on her running route; the next, she was barely clinging to life at the bottom of a ditch in a field of Black-eyed Susans. From the moment she was discovered, Tessie and the three bodies lying next to her  two skeletons and a fresh corpse  would forever be known as the Susans. Strangers in life, but sisters in death.Though Tessie has no recollection of the assault  indeed, cannot even hope to identify her attacker, having lost her sight (hysterical blindness) after waking in the hospital bed, only to see a get well card sent by the killer (maybe)  District Attorney Al Vega still calls her to testify. Its her testimony, along with junk science and a racist justice system (a contradiction in terms), that lands Terrell Darcy Goodwin on Death Row.Now its 18 years later, and Goodwin has just weeks to live. Plagued by doubts of Goodwins guilt, haunted by the Susans in her head, and stalked by someone (the killer?) who keeps planting Black-eyed Susans in the places important to Tessie/Tessa (a handy device used to distinguish the child from the adult), she enlists the help of Goodwins lawyer, William James Hastings III. His late colleague, Angela Rothschild, was a wealthy crusader who spent the second half of her life freeing prisoners wrongly convicted in Texas. Angie had been trying to persuade Tessa to become involved Goodwins case for years, but shed always refused, citing her daughter Charlies welfare as her primary concern. Angie respected her wishes, but with Angies death comes a fresh wave of guilt: at failing her mother, failing the Susans, and now failing Angie and Terrell.As Tessa reluctantly revisits her troubled past, she finds that it never really left her after all.The title does not lie. BLACK-EYED SUSANS is indeed a novel fraught with suspense. There are plenty of twists and turns and red herrings to keep you guessing; more than once, I thought I knew who the real killer was, only to be led down a different path several chapters later.This is a story told in three parts, with chapters alternating between then and now: first, Tessie (in the year following the attack) and Tessa (present-day); then the countdown to Goodwins execution (where testimony from the 1995 trial is interspersed with contemporary events and discoveries); and finally, Tessa (the adult) and Lydia (the teenager; Lydia was Tessies best friend and confidant). I love this narrative structure; the present-day story line often sheds light on the flashbacks, and vice versa, making for an enjoyable and captivating reading experience. Nearly every chapter ends on a cliffhanger, demanding that you read just one more chapter before bed. Before you know it, its 3AM and youre bleary-eyed with fatigue.Heaberlin also does a masterful job birthing her characters and then allowing them room to grow. While clearly the same person, Tessie and Tessa each have their own unique vibe. Equal parts murder mystery, social critique, and psychological thriller, BLACK-EYED SUSANS skillfully examines the havoc that trauma can wreak on a teenage mind  both immediately following the event, and even decades later. While firmly rooted in reality (e.g., the forensic science), Heaberlin throws in the odd supernatural element (that admittedly feels out of place, at least initially) to make us question Tessas sanity. The Susans arent dead, but have taken up residence is Tessie/Tessas head  starting with the first moment she met Merry (the most recent victim), still very much alive at the time.Bill, Angie, Jo, Lucas, Charlie, and Effie (short for Euphemia) are all a pleasure to get to know as well (even if, in Angies case, its posthumously). The relationship between Tessa and Bill, while predictable, is still a pleasure to watch; and its nice that she and Lucas (her baby daddy) can maintain an amicable, even cooperative and healthy, relationship.Another thing I adore is Heaberlins use of pop culture markers to delineate the different time frames and give the overall story a sense of place and space: The O.J. Simpson trial, The Colbert Report, Stephen King, historic revitalization projects, pig tunnels running under Fort Worth. The leaps and bounds in technology that developed between 1995 and 2013. (Im roughly the same age as Tessa, so our experiences in this regard are similar.) I could especially identify with Lydia, Tessies dark and macabre friend, what with her love of Edgar Allen Poe and fascination with Jack the Ripper. (Among my middle school book reports was a piece on PET SEMATARY; and for a college media studies course, I inexplicably chose to do my presentation on ice pick lobotomies. Because GIRL, INTERRUPTED?)This is why it hit me especially hard when their friendship began to unravel. That, and there are so few positive depictions of healthy, functional female friendships that its painful to lose oneeven if you never quite had it to begin with.I also appreciate that Heaberlin doesnt feel it necessary to revisit the Susans assaults and murders in graphic and gruesome detail. They were murdered, most likely also raped, but we dont need to revel in the particulars in order to feel sympathy for them, or outrage on their behalf.As for the ending? Not my favorite. When the real killer is finally unmasked, the big reveal feels a little too coincidental. Unrealistic. Almost as though Heaberlin chose the most unlikely suspect just so she could jump out of the tool shed and scream GOTCHA SUCKERS!. Up until this point, I was ready and eager to give BLACK-EYED SUSANS a full five stars.Even so, it remains an enjoyable read: spooky and sinister, with just the right mix of horror and suspense, cultural commentary and social justice bent. Id most definitely devour it again if given a do-over.** Full disclosure: I received a free electronic ARC for review through NetGalley. **","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2186FSBQUG8QN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P5557PI#wasThisHelpful","R2186FSBQUG8QN","AISSRJ7E2L375","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AISSRJ7E2L375?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** Trigger warning for rape and violence, including illicit human experimentation. Also, this review contains a plot summary with minor spoilers. **The question sounded strange in the present tense. I used to think that orphaned was something Id been as a child and since outgrown. It occurred to me, though, that was exactly how Id been feeling all summer.I guess anyone alone in the worlds an orphan, I said.###The year is 1918, and four-year-old Rachel Rabinowitz has just landed in the Infant Home, an orphanage for Jewish kids under the age of six in New York City. After her lying, cheating, rapist father accidentally kills her mother* and then runs from the police, Rachel and her brother Sam are effectively orphaned, taken in by the Jewish Childrens Agency. Two years her senior, Sam is sent to the Orphaned Hebrews Home.The children are considered lucky, in a sense: funded by wealthy patrons, the Infant Home and Orphaned Hebrews Home are well-regarded. Whereas gentile kids in their position  and there are many, left penniless, homeless, and/or without a family to call their own by the twin terrors of the so-called Spanish Influenza and World War I  would be left to fend for themselves, Rachel and Sam get a roof over their heads, beds to call their own, three square meals a day  even an education.Of course, none of this can make up for the pain of separation. By the time a sympathetic receptionist locates a foster home that will take both siblings, Rachel has contracted measles and is in quarantine. And, just like that, their moment has passed: it will be two years before Rachel sees her brother again. By storys end, it still remains to be seen whether the two will ever be able to bridge the chasm created their relationship.The doctors at the Infant Home  Dr. Hess and Dr. Solomon  dont see their charges as patients so much as study material. In the orphanage, environmental factors like exercise, diet, and exposure to sunlight are easily controlled; and theres no need to bother with pesky niceties like consent where orphans are concerned. Besides, these children are parasites, surviving  no, thriving!  on the largess of donors. They owe society a debt, and at the Infant Home they will repay it with their very bodies. Or at least thats the reasoning Dr. Solomon will lay on Rachel many decades after the fact. But Im getting ahead of myself.While recovering from a host of illnesses, Rachel comes to the attention of Dr. Mildred Solomon, a female doctor in the time when such things were still a rarity  back in the good ole days, before women could even vote. Eager, ambitious, and with everything to prove, Dr. Solomon recruits Rachel as patient #8 in her inaugural study, where shes subjected to high doses of radiation to destroy her (healthy) tonsils in lieu of a surgical tonsillectomy. Like many of the other subjects, Rachel develops alopecia: she loses all her hair. Permanently.By the time she ages out of the Infant Home and rejoins Sam in the Orphaned Hebrews Home, Rachels memories of the x-ray treatments  as shes come to know them  have mostly faded. Once she settles in, her life assumes a sort of quiet, comforting monotony, governed by bells, bullies, and older student monitors (not all of them mutually exclusive). The years tick by. Sam pays a girl from his year to protect Rachel; she and Naomi eventually develop a friendship, and then something more. When Rachels arch-rival and resident Mean Girl Amelia orchestrates her sexual assault, Sam seeks revenge on her behalf  and is beaten in front of the school by Superintendent Grossman, whose own son Marc is to blame. Tired of the Homes rigid structure and unfair rules, Sam runs away, west to Colorado  and Rachel follows, unwilling to let go of what little family she has left.Fast-foward several decades. Its the 1950s, and Rachel is nearing 40. Now a nurse, Rachel works at the Old Hebrews Home, caring for dying patients on the dreaded fifth floor. Sapped by the sweltering summer weather and further deflated by her lovers absence, Rachels already in a precarious state of mind when a Mildred Solomon is assigned to the room of the recently-departed Mr. Mendelshon. Something in the womans face jogs Rachels memory, and before you can say count backwards from ten, Rachels in a free-fall down the proverbial rabbit hole.Reading about Dr. Solomons radiation experiments, filed away for posterity in ancient medical journals, suddenly it all makes sense: Her alopecia, and the lifelong self-esteem issues it caused. Her rift with Sam. The inappropriate attentions visited upon her by lecherous, predatory men  Marc Grossman only being the first of many. But most of all, the tender, acorn-sized lump in her breast. Dr. Solomon is to blame. Dr. Solomon was always to blame. The source of all of Rachels suffering is lying  helpless, addicted to morphine, and dying a painful death of bone cancer  right there in her bed. For the first time in her life, it is Rachel who has all the power.ORPHAN NUMBER EIGHT is an odd creature: equal parts historical fiction, coming out/coming of age story, and psychological thriller. The chapters flit between two periods in Rachels life: her childhood and middle adulthood; the former is told in third-person past tense, the other in first-person past tense. This has an interesting effect, distancing us somewhat from young Rachel and drawing us closer to 1950s Rachel. However, as the story progresses and we learn how Rachel advanced from Point A to Point B, the two Rachels coalesce, become one. Suddenly its not so hard to see how such a traumatic childhood formed this very broken, very damaged  but still fundamentally good  adult sitting in front of us, laying her soul bare.To be honest, the first chapter had me thinking that this might be a DNF. Its surprisingly boring, which feels weird to say considering it ends in a violent murder. But theres a tedious amount of talk about buttons leading up to it, okay? Needless to say, Im glad I stuck with it (not that Id ever give up on a book that quickly, mind you), because ORPHAN NUMBER EIGHT is an engrossing read: at turns horrifying, tragic, and heartwarming.Here are just a few of the things I loved about it. (I know this review is already long enough, but humor me while I gush!)  The unexpected LGBTQ spin. As if Rachels adolescence isnt fraught with enough minefields, she has to navigate her budding sexuality with little or no guidance. Rachels a lesbian, back in the days before such things were discussed openly; passionate female friendships were whispered about as unnatural or unhealthy. Her relationship with Naomi is lovely, and you kind of want to smack Rachel upside the head when it looks as though shes messed it up forever.Nor are Rachel and Noami the only two gay youths in the book. While working at a tuberculosis clinic in Colorado, Rachel befriends a dying girl named Mary. She was in love with a girl named Sheila, who was forbidden to see Mary when her mother discovered their letters. After Mary passes away, Rachel inherits her steamer trunk  love letters and all  and its only by reading Sheilas correspondence that Rachel begins to envision something more, something lasting, with Naomi.As an adult, her partnership with her unnamed lover is a great source of stress to Rachel. Or rather, the need to hide it, to keep it secret and not to assign it the importance it deserves, is. Rachel recounts the sympathetic looks she gets from the other nurses as they discuss their husbands and boyfriends, unable as she is to join in. And as the dread of surgery looms large, the unfairness of having to say that her lover is her sister so that she may be admitted to the recovery room further eats away at her. At best, homosexuals are a source of pity, as is the case with the gay man in her neighbor Molly Lippmans Coney Island Amateur Psychoanalytic Society (poor boy).With its alternating between different time periods, ORPHAN NUMBER EIGHT opens a window onto the different challenges faced by gay and lesbian folks throughout the first half of the 1900s.  Dr. Mildred Solomon, feminist pioneer? Make no mistake: Dr. Solomon is an odious person. She dehumanizes and objectifies her pint-sized subjects, violates the trust of children placed in her care, and lets her ambition outrank her patients well-being. Even when confronted by one of her ex-subjects, now suffering from cancer possibly caused by her fruitless experiments, Dr. Solomon is unrepentant. Its likely that Dr. Solomons bone cancer is also thanks to excessive radiation  caused by administering all those x-rays  a point she harps on time and again. Yet she fails to see the fundamental difference: Dr. Solomon consented to performing the experiments, while her participants had no choice.Even so, much like Rachels coming out story, the early scenes (and recollections of) of a very female Dr. Solomon practicing medicine in a decidedly masculine world are as revealing as they are infuriating. The nurses mistake her for one of them; question her orders more frequently than those given by the equally sadistic Dr. Hess; and Dr. Solomon is constantly forced to toe an invisible line: act too severe, and shell be punished for being too feminine; perform femininity too well, and the men will dismiss her as silly and frivolous. Nearly a century later, some of these things have changed; but its defeating to observe that which hasnt.Perhaps most egregious of all, in her dying days, Dr. Solomon has been stripped of the title she worked so hard to achieve: her chart reads simply Mildred Solomon. The nurses dont believe that shes actually a doctor until Rachel confirms it.Of course, none of this excuses Dr. Solomons transgressions as she would have Rachel believe: belonging to an oppressed class doesnt give you license to oppress others.  The parallels between Dr. Solomon and later Nazi scientists. Though Dr. Solomon balks at the comparison, adult Rachel notes the (very ironic) similarities between the way Drs. Solomon and Hess treated the kids at the Infant Home, and Nazi experiments on Jewish captives. Rachels physical similarity to a death camp survivor  noted by Sam, who fought in WWII and helped to liberate one such camp  is only the most superficial of them. The doctors routinely dehumanize and objectify their patients, referring to them as material, not people; things with numbers, not children with names. They are neglected save for experimentation; their emotional and intellectual development deemed unimportant. Even as an adult, Dr. Solomon refers to Rachel simply as Eight.  The delicious ironies. Theres a wonderful little passage wherein patient Mildred Solomon complains about a doctors threat to force-feed her, should she refuse to eat on her own  which gives Rachel flashbacks to when Dr. Solomon forcibly fed an uncooperative Rachel a barium milkshake prior to a treatment. See also: Nazi scientists above.  The doublespeak. Like a page out of the Bush-Cheney playbook.  Rape culture 101. From the very first chapter, with the rape that doesnt yet have a name, rape culture lurks in the shadows of ORPHAN NUMBER EIGHT. Its well-known around the Home that Marc Grossman is a serial predator, for example; but rather than acknowledge that his son has a problem  and sacrifice him for the good of his one thousand other charges  Superintendent Grossman goes after Sam instead. Indeed, given the structure of the Home  older students are promoted to monitors and given the power to boss, bully, intimidate, and even physically punish younger kids for the slightest transgression  its surprising that we dont see more instances of sexual abuse: like many rigid institutions, it seems almost designed to facilitate such abuses!And then theres Rachels Uncle Max, wholl only let the fifteen-year-old stay with him if she agrees to marry him. With his rabbis blessing! Again, make no mistake: blackmailing someone into marrying you = rape.Over time, Rachel seems to recognize that shes a magnet for the unwanted advances of men, especially older men and predators. This mirrors statistics on rape; a 1999 study, for example, found that women who had been raped were seven times more likely to be raped again. Predators know to target the vulnerable and marginalized: for Rachel, these vulnerabilities include being poor, being an orphan, being a runaway, potentially becoming homeless, and all-around low self-esteem due to her alopecia and deviant sexuality.Even as they take her assault seriously, some of the adults reactions to the Marc Grossman incident are an exercise in rape culture: is that all? (There was no penis-vagina contact, just unwanted touching.) At one point, Rachel questions whether shes even pretty enough to be raped. Sadly, this is still used as an insult, some 100 years later. (Youre so ugly you wish someone would rape you is a common refrain of trolls.)  New York City through the ages. Though the kids rarely leave the two city blocks that encompass the Orphaned Hebrews Home and their middle school, adult Rachel takes us on a tour through NYC, from the Lower Eastside and the famed Goldman Shirtwaist Factory, to the beaches of Coney Island.  The ending. Though I had my fingers double-crossed for revenge, what ultimately transpires in that hospice room proved much more nuanced and potentially satisfying. Still, it hurt to see Rachels potential catharsis thwarted at every turn.  Theres even a reference section  perfect for the history buffs in the audience. The story was inspired in part by the authors grandfather, who grew up in the Hebrew Orphan Asylum of New York; his mother worked there as a Reception House counselor.Read it if: Youre a sucker for historical fiction; youre yearning for an edge-of-your-seat read; you have a sick fascination with the seedy side of science; you want another volume to add to your #WeNeedDiverseBooks TBR pile.* In his defense, the murder was accidental/in self-defense. However, make no mistake: the sexual encounter we see between Harry and Visha the morning of the murder is indeed rape: Visha says no, but he penetrates her anyway. While she eventually acquiesces, theres no such thing as retroactive consent. Additionally, he physically restrains her at two different points during the encounter. That this transpired 70+ years before marital rape was recognized as a crime doesnt make it any less wrong.** Full disclosure: I received a free electronic ARC for review through Edelweiss.**","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CNKPMR36FB8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVLI552#wasThisHelpful","R3CNKPMR36FB8Y","AISSRJ7E2L375","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AISSRJ7E2L375?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** Trigger warning for sexual assault. **Anna Franklin has never really fit in. A native of Sunnyvale, California, Anna was perhaps the least sunny kid in her subdivision. Socially awkward and unsure, she usually watched from the sidelines while the neighborhood children played tag. Her parents meant well, but failed to pay Anna enough attention, absorbed as they were  are  in their own interests: she, a pianist; he, an amateur scientist.When Anna turns sixteen, things go from bad to worse as shes caught in the bleak, gloomy grip of depression  or melancholia, in Annas parlance. Nothing can seem to shake its hold on her: not a psychiatrist (who Anna dislikes), not drugs (which Anna tosses), not her parents well-intentioned encouragements. Until, one night  in an effort to rekindle mother-daughter rituals of old  Annas mom institutes mandatory bedtime reading. Her first choice? THE BIBLE. Not for any religious purposes, mind you  Annas parents are both atheists  but because its the basis for so much subsequent literature.Yet something (read: the promise of death, violence, and retribution) in REVELATIONS speaks to Anna. She discovers that she is passionately in love with death. Anna begins to have dreams  and then waking visions  of a red heifer. Annas overnight religious mania coincides with the arrival of the Goldschmidts, a weird family that seems mostly disengaged from the world (or at least Annas small slice of it). When Lars invites Anna to his church, she finds a ready and receptive outlet for her newly discovered fundamentalist fervor.The Franklins guarded optimism about Annas recovery turns to frustration and anger as she preaches fire and brimstone at them, letting her grades slip and eschewing college so that she can join her Church and help prepare for  and even possibly hasten  the coming Tribulations and End of Days. But when death touches Anna in the most unexpected and intimate of ways, it more than quenches her thirst for it. With the first domino poised to fall, Anna must figure out how to save the world in lieu of destroying it.COMING OF AGE AT THE END OF DAYS is an odd little book. Mostly lacking in action, its really more of a character study: of a teenager on the cusp of adulthood, searching for purpose and meaning in a mostly dreary and mundane life. Annas religious conversion  similar in many ways to her fathers penchant for earthquakes  gives her all of this, and more: a way to not just persevere, but to shine. Through her visions and her involvement in Fred Wilsons quest to breed a red heifer  one of just many steps on the path to the End of Days  Anna has a chance to be a hero. (In the eyes of a chosen few, anyhow.) Who among us hasnt daydreamed of just that?Yet in Annas science teacher, Clara Thadeous (Ms. Tedious), we see what often becomes of these childish dreams, what happens when they are thwarted. Teenage angst turned to adult discontent.And her lover, Jim Fulson, offers a glimpse of what Anna might have become, had she not found an outlet for her ambition: intractable depression, multiple suicide attempts, moving back into your parents rec room, and becoming the neighborhood recluse, a topic of whispers and gossip.The third person/past tense narration is weirdly dispassionate and detached. This put me off initially, but I soon found that it complemented Annas melancholia nicely. Once she found god, the tone felt strangely incongruous, but not always in a bad way; I felt like it helped underscore the intensity of Annas religious fervor.LaPlante did a wonderful job of portraying Anna and Jims depression. As someone whos struggled with depression my entire life, I found myself nodding time and again. Especially heartbreaking are Annas parents futile attempts to help her. I didnt give it much thought when I was younger, but now  and especially when I read books featuring teenagers with depressive and/or anxiety disorders similar to my own  I consider how my illness must have affected my parents. I felt my heart crack a little upon this exchange between Anna and her mom: Oh AnnieDo you see any way out of this?Im still not 100% sure how I feel about the entirety of the book, though. This is my first Alice LaPlante book, and it definitely doesnt fit into her usual psychological thriller niche. Its a slow, understated book, and probably not for everyone. It took me a while to get into it, and then LaPlante lost me again when the grown-ups decided to take the kids on a road trip. Sure, I guess it works for the allegory of the story, but its hardly the most realistic plot twist.Also, the ending is downright anticlimactic (doubly so given that a natural disaster is involved); definitely not the payoff I was hoping for/expecting given the slow buildup.3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 where necessary (though I could just as easily go with 3 stars). COMING OF AGE AT THE END OF DAYS isnt entirely to my taste, but its not bad, either. Id recommend this to those interested in books about religion, particularly fringe religions/cults, and with a YA angle.** Full disclosure: I received a free electronic ARC for review through NetGalley. **","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17SDXG071K1BS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PSSG2CE#wasThisHelpful","R17SDXG071K1BS","AISSRJ7E2L375","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AISSRJ7E2L375?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I love the taste of green tea  whether in tea, cupcake, or truffle form  I very rarely splurge on drinking-grade or ceremonial matcha powder. Whereas cooking matcha has a slightly bitter taste, ceremonial matcha is sweeter, with a vibrant green color, and a fresh, grassy scent. The powder is also finer, designed as it is to blend smoothly with water. Its no wonder then that ceremonial matcha is a little pricier than its culinary grade cousin.Midori Spring Organic Ceremonial Matcha (Ceremonial Gold Class) comes packaged in an attractive tin with a pull top. Ive tried some other brands that are packed in paper bags, and the tin container definitely has an advantage when it comes to convenience: its a much cleaner and more reliable way to store a fine, loose powder like matcha. On the downside, Amazon  which fulfilled the order  saw fit to ship the tin in a bubble envelope. Unsurprisingly, the tin was dented in transit, and it punched a sizeable hole in the envelope. Had this been a gift, I would have requested a replacement. (As it stands, I have more tins than I know what to do with already.)Midori Springs matcha has a bright green color, as culinary matcha should. It mixes fairly easily with water, although if you let the tea sit too long, particles will settle at the bottom of the cup. The tin has brewing instructions, which I appreciate; many brands just leave you to guess the matcha-to-water ratio.  (For the record, Midori Spring recommends  to  teaspoons of matcha per 60 to 80 milliliters / 2 to 2.7 ounces of water.) The tea has a refreshing, slightly grassy taste. I enjoy mine with a little sugar or agave nectar, but its sweet enough to take plain.** Full disclosure: I received a free product in exchange for an honest review. **","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CTPGBOYEELDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TSSDLGK#wasThisHelpful","R2CTPGBOYEELDY","AISSRJ7E2L375","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AISSRJ7E2L375?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"(Full disclosure: I received a free copy of this book for review through Blogging for Books.)The third book in Lisa Erspamers letter series (previous titles include A LETTER TO MY DOG and A LETTER TO MY CAT), A LETTER TO MY MOM is a sweet and touching (and timely, with Mothers Day just around the corner!) collection of letters from children to their mothers.What first struck me about the collection is its diversity. There are a fair number of celebrity pairings, yes, but also quite a few letters written by regular folks too. There are letters from children as well as adults; groups of siblings as well as single letter-writers; women and men, girls and boys; adopted as well as biological children; letters addressed to elderly parents as well as middle-aged parents; even a handful written to mothers who have since passed on.Happily, theres also a fair amount of racial diversity; while many of the faces are white, there are also Korean, Latina, African-American, Chinese, Indian, Jewish, and Taiwanese mothers and daughters. Some of the most touching letters are from second-generation American immigrants whose mothers left their homelands to pursue the American Dream and give their kids a better life. Trish Broome  the product of a now-failed marriage between a Korean mother and American GI father who met during the Vietnam War  writes of the many sacrifices her mother, Bok Ja Smith, made for her family:My back, which rests comfortably against an office chair every day, has never felt over 60 years of hard labor like yours. It didnt have to stand tall as customers walked through a flea market store, or bend over machines in factories. It hasnt endured years of carrying laundry baskets or helping children move boxes to and from college.It does, however, have a Korean tiger tattoo on it that represents strength, and it represents you.Among the celebrity contributors  Kristen Chenoweth, Cat Cora, Sarah Ferguson, Josh Groban, Mariel Hemingway, Ali Landry, Monica Lewinsky, Lisa Ling, Dr. Phil, Robin Meade, Kelly Osbourne, Melissa Rivers, Molly Sims, Shania Twain, will.i.am, and Ginger Zee  is Jennifer Arnold, one half of TLCs The Little Couple. When she failed to grow and thrive in infancy, her mother was erroneously accused of starving her. She writes of how her mother became her champion and advocate, traveling the country to obtain medical treatment, staying by her bedside summer after summer, as her vacations were dominated by painful surgeries.Many of the more exceptional letters come from regular people. Theres Patricia Brooks, who rescued her girls from their physically and sexually abusive stepfather; they fled from their home in the dead of the night, carrying little more than the clothes on their backs. They were fortunate enough to land the last spot in a pilot program that provided temporary housing for women and children on one floor of the President Hotel in Manhattan. (Today, they might have been able to bring Tinkerbell the cat too, as more and more womens shelters recognize the link between domestic violence and animal abuse, and honor the human-animal bond in their work.)Sonia Kangs parents were an interracial couple struggling against bigotry and hatred in the aftermath of Loving vs. Virginia; as a child, their biracial daughter grappled with the feeling of not-belonging to either world: When I called crying saying Im not Black enough or Latina enough, you comforted me from miles away and you told me that I was enough. And I believed you.While theres no shortage of tearjerkers here, some of the letters are absolutely agonizing. Lisa Hirschs letter is to her mom Ruth Elian, who suffers from Alzheimers and only occasionally recognizes her. And Susan Nirah Jaffee remembers helping her mother transition during her last month on Earth; what she thought might be a form of reverse labor became a rebirth for Jaffee, as the experience granted her a new appreciation for life, in all its abbreviated beauty: Every minute I spent with you, right through the very moment you crossed over, I grew  not in cells and tissues and organs, but in character and spirit and purpose. Although your body was winding down, your soul was blossoming.So many of these moms are pioneers, trailblazers, and superheroes. To at least one person, anyway.Yet its all too easy to idolize certain maternal characteristics while stripping away all else that makes moms human; putting mothers on a pedestal and romanticizing a thankless job while continuing, as a society, to devalue it.A LETTER TO MY MOM challenges this cultural tendency; along with largely favorable (yet humanizing) letters are the few odd negatives. Suze Ormans letter to her mother Ann, for example, damn near broke my heart. Orman reports that, after she came out, her mom stopped saying the three little words every kid needs to hear  I love you  even as she appeared outwardly to be okay with Ormans sexual orientation. And then theres the letter from Tejal Patel, which hints at emotional and physical abuse.Aesthetically, the book is lovely, with glossy, colorful pages and tons of snapshots of the mothers  both solo, and in candid moments with their children. Theres even a page, styled like stationary, for you to pen a letter to your own mom should you wish.Naturally, this would be a wonderful gift for moms  for Mothers Day, of course, but also birthdays, Christmas, even Valentines Day. Or just because.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AE4ABJFH6TYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804139679#wasThisHelpful","R1AE4ABJFH6TYP","AISSRJ7E2L375","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AISSRJ7E2L375?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Full disclosure: I received a free product in exchange for an honest review.)I make many of my own household cleaners; often I find that the DIY versions are cheaper than the commercially available, green/vegan alternatives. Plus it offers me more control over what goes in  and I can mix up the scent depending on my current mood, to boot.With its energizing, invigorating scent, Morning Peps peppermint essential oil makes a wonderful addition to an all-purpose cleaner  just mix one part white vinegar with one part water and the desired amount of essential oil. For a full cup of cleaner, less than a dozen drops will do the trick, so the 4 fl. oz. should last for quite some time.Peppermint also works great in homemade toothpaste or as a deodorizer. When used in a diffuser, it makes a wonderful, non-medicated decongestant.Morning Peps peppermint oil is seriously strong, so just dabll do ya, whether its for household cleaning, massage, or a refreshing bath.

"(Full disclosure: I received a free product in exchange for an honest review.)I usually go for hypoallergenic laundry detergents, on account of my sensitive skin. Since this means no added scents, I often trade a pleasant smell for happier, more comfortable skin. Luckily, lavender doesnt irritate my skin - and you can easily add it to your laundry to give it a cozy, comforting smell!For a super-lavendery scent, just apply a few drops to a washcloth and toss it in the dryer along with your clothes; for a more pronounced scent, do it towards the middle or end of the cycle vs. the beginning.Along with vinegar, lavender also fights grease, stains and odor, so you can also add it right to your wash. Mix six drops of lavender with a cup of white vinegar and use as a liquid fabric softener during your wash cycle.Additionally, I make many of my own cleaning products and an all-purpose cleaner infused with lavender oil makes the bathroom smell like a spa! To use, just mix one part water with one part vinegar and add the lavender a drop at a time until its scented to your liking. About a dozen drops will do you, so a 4 fl. oz. bottle should last for quite some time.Morning Pep bottles its essential oils in amber glass, to better keep out the sun.

"(Full disclosure: I received a free product in exchange for an honest review.)Ive been using Brainwavz brand headphones for a while now, and am always struck by their construction, performance, and durability. Like all Brainwavs headphones, the M1 model comes with a range of different tips (S-Series foam tips; silicone ear tips in small, medium, and large; and silicone bi-flange tips), as well as a shirt clip and an attractive, black and red, hard carrying case. Ive found the cases surprisingly useful  not only are they great for travel, but when used for everyday storage, they keep my headphones organized and tangle-free.As for overall design, my favorite Brainwavz headphones have flat cords (similar in shape to a tape measure) for a truly tangle-free experience. The M1s have a silver-plated braided cable  more resistant to tangling than a traditional cord, but not quite as good as the flat design. They loop over the ear and can take a little getting used to; while those with larger ears might appreciate the flexibility, I prefer a more rigid (and stable) earpiece.I mostly use these with my iPod, usually while listening to audiobooks (currently up: Tana Frenchs THE SECRET PLACE). The sound is crisp, clear, and balanced. My favored alternative rock and folk rock sound wonderful too.These ear phones are low profile, with a sleek black and silver color scheme. You might not even notice someone wearing them on the street.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GARQ3258HGHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IK2EAW#wasThisHelpful","R2GARQ3258HGHN","AISSRJ7E2L375","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AISSRJ7E2L375?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Full disclosure: I received a free product in exchange for an honest review. This review is for the PINK PET BRUSH, not the Blue Grooming Tool Set.)I have five rescue dogs and also foster, so Ive owned my share of grooming supplies over the years. Since my dogs are all short- to medium-haired (rat terrier/fox terrier/Jack Russell terrier mixes), I usually stick to combs over brushes (shaking some of the loose fur off with my hands before I start); this is my first time using a rake.  In fact, prior to writing this review, Id never heard of a Furminator, but the Flatworld Rake looks to be a more affordable version of it.The first thing I noticed about the rake is how short the teeth are  less than half as long as those on my current comb. Thus, the brush fills with hair much more quickly, necessitating in more frequent stops. (Not a big deal, unless your dog hates to be brushed and tries to use the distraction for escape. Jayne, Im looking at you!) However, the rake does an excellent job of gathering shed and loose hair. All in all, it seems to remove a greater volume of fur than a traditional comb.I even noticed an improvement on Mags and Finnick, who have very short hair and dont shed a whole lot. Whereas I brush the other dogs once or twice a week (even more during peak shedding season), I usually skip those two altogether; there just doesnt seem to be a point, unless theyre obviously dirty or have gotten something stuck on their fur. So imagine my surprise when I tested the Flatworld rake on Mags and actually came away with a small hairball! (For her part, Mags was less than amused.)Ill probably work the Flatworld rake into my regular routine going forward, perhaps starting with it and ending with a comb. The design isnt terribly flashy and the package is written in broken English, but my dogs dont care and neither do I. The package seems to indicate that it comes in different sizes (50, 66, and 100mm), but I cant seem to find any others online.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NQILAY98DYM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V37IPVK#wasThisHelpful","R1NQILAY98DYM3","AISSRJ7E2L375","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AISSRJ7E2L375?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Full disclosure: I received a free copy of this book for review through Blogging for Books.)GO AHEAD & LIKE IT is not at all what I expected. Granted, based on the books vague and weirdly broad Amazon description, its difficult to pin down precisely; in one breath, it purports to be a scrapbook, art book, self-help book, how-to guide, etc., etc., etc. So perhaps its unfair to dislike it for failing to meet my already hazy expectations. But. When the description says that it features writing prompts, I dont think it unreasonable to assume that the book will also include blank space for me to work on said prompts. Not so much.GO AHEAD & LIKE IT isnt an interactive journal or workbook, with space for the reader to formulate her own lists, but rather an instructional guide, the bulk of which highlights Suskins own lists, photographs, and ephemera. The end result feels remarkably self-indulgent: Suskin fans aside, who wants to shell out seventeen bucks to read an assortment of a strangers random lists?What we have here is a case of good idea, poor execution: this book would have been 100% better had Suskin complemented her writing tips with one or two of her own lists (and perhaps a plethora of artwork with liberal white space), and then given her readers ample space to record their own. Theres one blank list at the very back of the book, but thats it.To add insult to injury, Suskin includes in her lists things which I find morally repugnant: hunting, fishing, and fetishizing the bodies of dead animals. One list sports this cryptic entry: disorders. I can only hope the author isnt referring to physical and/or mental disorders (the romanticization of which is entirely uncool).After skimming through GO AHEAD & LIKE IT, my knee-jerk reaction was to give it one star. But, upon a full read-through, I have to admit that some of Suskins advice is rather intriguing and evocative. Just not to the tune of $16.99. Wait for it to go on deep discount, or else just save yourself the time and Google gratitude lists.Buy it if: You want a Post-Secret style art book.Skip it if: Youre hoping for an interactive journal or workbook thats all about *you*.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JX06GVEMGYJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607748770#wasThisHelpful","R1JX06GVEMGYJD","AISSRJ7E2L375","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AISSRJ7E2L375?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My hope is that we can navigate through this world and our lives with the grace and integrity of those who need our protection. May we have the sense of humor and liveliness of the goats; may we have the maternal instincts and protective nature of the hens and the sassiness of the roosters. May we have the gentleness and strength of the cattle, and the wisdom, humility, and serenity of the donkeys. May we appreciate the need for community as do the sheep and choose our companions as carefully as do the rabbits. May we have the faithfulness and commitment to family as the geese, and adaptability and affability of the ducks. May we have the intelligence, loyalty, and affection of the pigs and the inquisitiveness, sensitivity, and playfulness of the turkeys.My hope is that we learn from the animals what it is we need to become better people.With no fewer than four cookbooks under her belt  THE 30-DAY VEGAN CHALLENGE, THE VEGAN TABLE, COLOR ME VEGAN, and THE JOY OF VEGAN BAKING, which is destined to become a classic  many of you may know Colleen Patrick-Goudreau as an accomplished vegan chef. But shes also got a masters degree in English Literature, which she puts to use as a writer and public speaker, educating the public about compassionate living and animal rights. Her exploration of the intersections between human and animal exploitation, both on the Food for Thought podcast and various short videos released on YouTube, are among my favorites.In VEGANS DAILY COMPANION, the self-described Joyful Vegan brings all her talents and avenues of interest together to create a book as unique as it is informative. Part cookbook, part self-help book, part pop culture guide, VEGANS DAILY COMPANION offers 365 days of inspiration, knowledge, and celebration to vegans, both new and experienced. From Monday through Sunday (with the weekends sharing a recipe), each day youll find a short discussion or series of tips, each tailored to a specific theme:Monday / For the Love of Food  A celebration of familiar as well as new foods to spark enthusiasm for eating healthfully.Each Monday, Patrick-Goudreau delves deep to reveal things you may not know about your favorite foods  and introduce you to some foods you might have written off completely. For example, Day 99 includes some handy tips for cooking beans from scratch (salt and acidic ingredients should be added last, since they hinder the cooking of the beans). And Day 57 gives you a handy chart for cooking grains.Also, arugula is another name for rocket! All these years tagging rocket pizzas on f*** yeah vegan pizza, and I had no idea![Insert the more you know and shooting star gif here.]Sometimes the featured food ties into a recipe featured on an adjacent weekend; more often times not. Either way, this intermediate cook found many of the tips quite handy.Tuesday / Compassionate Communication  Techniques and tactics for speaking on behalf of veganism effectively and compassionately.Similar to Joan Dunayers ANIMAL EQUALITY: LANGUAGE AND LIBERATION (call it the Cliffs Notes), Compassionate Communication explores the roots of popular terminology, offering alternatives to those promote animal exploitation, whether intentionally or not. While its time to ditch animal-unfriendly phrases like dont look a gift horse in the mouth, let the cat out of the bag, and fat pig (in what is perhaps my favorite quote in the book, Patrick-Goudreau counters this insult thusly: Theyre not fat pigs; were mad scientists.), you might be surprised, as was I, at the seemingly harmful sayings that are either sympathetic to animal suffering (an albatross around ones neck), or have nothing at all to do with nonhuman animals (more than one way to skin a cat).Compassionate Communication also offers answers to the many inane questions vegans will inevitably face (If we stop eating animals, wont cows take over the world?; What about the bugs killed in crop production?; Why do you want plants to suffer?), as well as tips for responding to them honestly, with grace and humor.Wednesday / Optimum Health for Body, Mind, and Spirit  Care and maintenance for becoming and remaining a joyful vegan.Wednesday is a bit of a mixed bag, spanning nutrition, burnout, and self-care. I especially love Patrick-Goudreaus tips for creating a gratitude list, finding peace in nature and solitude, and visiting animal sanctuaries as a sort of holy place.Thursday / Animals in the Arts: Literature and Film  Inspiration across the ages that reflects our consciousness of and relationship with nonhuman animals.Here youll find a remarkably diverse and extensive look at animal-friendly films, novels, poetry, and art. While I recognized a few titles (PLAGUE DOGS chief among them), Patrick-Goudreau grew my reading list and Netflix queue in leaps and bounds. Books and films run the gamut, from poets William Cowper and Walt Whitman, to author-activist (and mother of Mary Shelley, also featured here) Mary Wollstonecraft Goodwin, to the 1977 student film KILLER OF SHEEP  and of course that one episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE (To Serve Man).Items high up on my radar include: Shad Clarks short story Little Boy Pig, currently free for download on Amazon; a 1973 French science fiction film called THE SAVAGE PLANET; James Agees A Mothers Tale; the Italian film UMBERTO D.; and Hayao Miyazakis PRINCESS MONONOKE.However, be warned: since many of these works address cruelty towards animals, things can get rather depressing at times.Friday / Stories of Hope, Rescue, and Transformation  Heartening stories of people who have become awakened and animals who have found sanctuary.Stories celebrates the deliverance of animals  both humans and non. Regular folks  like Itai in Tel Aviv, or Linda in San Fracisco  share their journeys to veganism in short essay format. Likewise, those who have cared for rescued animals  turkeys, burros, pigs, and chimpanzees  give voice to their exploitation, liberation, and (hopefully) eventual transformation. No doubt youll recognize many of the sanctuaries and rescue groups that helped with this project: Animal Place, Rolling Dog Ranch, Farm Sanctuary, Animals Asia, Cleveland Armory Black Beauty Ranch, Performing Animal Welfare Society, and the Sanaga-Yong Chimpanzee Rescue Center, to name a few.The personal submissions introduce an interesting element to Vegans Daily Companion, since the authors are occasionally guilty of partaking in behaviors that the author herself warns against. For instance, one contributor uses the word nag as a pejorative; a nag, of course, is one who complains a lot or makes excessive demands. A nag is also an old, inferior, or worthless horse.So, yeah. Perhaps the personal essays could have been vetted a little better? Or maybe Im just biased, since Id rather read about a cow over a person any day of the week. (I kid, but not really.)Saturday + Sunday / Healthful Recipes  Favorite recipes to use as activism and nourishment.Saturday and Sunday share an entry, which is a recipe. Many are reprints from Patrick-Goudreaus previous cookbooks  THE VEGAN TABLE, COLOR ME VEGAN, and THE JOY OF VEGAN BAKIN  so if you already own one or all three, you might be a little disappointed. But there are also a few friend/follower contributions in the mix, including a Lentil Bolognese dish I just loved.So far Ive also tried the Cream of Mushroom Soup, courtesy of Compassionate Cooks member Melissa Phillips.This was my first time drinking mushrooms in a semi-liquid form, and I was not entirely fond of the experience. My husband was a big fan though.The recipes are all over the place: salads, entrees, desserts, snacks, and breakfasts  all get a little face time.I kind of like that Saturday and Sunday share a recipe; if you read this book chronologically and in time, two days should give you plenty of time to shop for and master a recipe. And if you commit to working through the entirety of VEGANS DAILY COMPANION  recipes included, no matter what they may be  the project just might challenge you to try new foods and dishes that you might not otherwise.(Me? Im too impatient to read a page a day. I usually read a week or two per sitting.)On the downside, I kind of wish there was a dedicated recipe index for easy skimming. Recipes are listed by title and ingredients in the main index, but one big, separate list would be even handier.Overall, I quite enjoyed VEGANS DAILY COMPANION. While I could do without some of the New Age woo-woo (manifesting  thats similar to The Secret, right?), Patrick-Goudreau thankfully keeps it to a minimum. As a longtime vegan, I still learned quite a bit  especially when it comes to tips and tricks for preparing various foods. I especially enjoyed Patrick-Goudreaus knowledge of popular culture, and the many lovely animal rescue stories.Id say that VEGANS DAILY COMPANION would make the perfect gift for a vegan friend whos feeling down or at risk of experiencing burnout, except that its not entirely free of scenes of animal cruelty and abuse. The Animals in the Arts section in particular comes with a trigger warning. That said, its still a wonderful inspirational/how-to guide for newbie and old timer vegans alike.Buy it with: THE DAILY VEGAN: A GUIDED JOURNAL, adapted from VEGANS DAILY COMPANION, and/or one of the authors vegan cookbooks, for a shiny little gift set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HMGLJB90S8M7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592536794#wasThisHelpful","R2HMGLJB90S8M7","AISSRJ7E2L375","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AISSRJ7E2L375?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Full disclosure: I received a free copy of this book for review from the publisher. Trigger warning for rape and violence.)Somehow this ruthless city is home to my sister. Where for me, it will never, ever be more than a cage.If no ones out there, then whats keeping us in?Sisters Skyler and Phoenix Miller were born and raised in Manhattan; from the wild forests of Central Park to the gleaming glass apartments in Battery Park, the island is the only home theyve ever known. But their home is also their prison. Along with several hundred fellow survivors, Sky and Phee are prisoners of war: World War III, in which the Red Allies (China, North Korea, and Russia) simultaneously attacked New York City, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and San Francisco, with the ultimate goal of conquering the United States. That was more than sixteen years ago, in March of 2016, and still the war rages on.When Manhattan was first attacked, a lucky few survivors found safety in the subway tunnels  including their mother, Sarah. But as the months dragged on and supplies dwindled, many of the refugees were forced to the surface, to beg the Red Allies for mercy. Though most of the men were shot on sight, the women and children were imprisoned in cages once meant for lions and tigers: the Central Park Zoo, now transformed into an internment camp.Eventually a leader emerged in the form of Rolladin, who persuaded their captors to move them to the relative comfort of the Carlyle Hotel. As the war dragged on and the soldiers combed the wreckage of NYC for holdouts  tunnel feeders and raiders  the POW camp grew. Eventually, when the Red Allies withdrew to follow the war west, Rolladin and her whorelords  warlords recruited from the prison population  were left in charge, to manage this oasis in the middle of a war zone. While no doubt an improvement over enemy occupation, Rolladin is an unyielding and oftentimes cruel warden, seemingly drunk on power. And yet she has a strange and inexplicable affinity for the Miller family.The story is told from the alternating perspectives of Sky and Phee: Sky, the older, more delicate and bookish sister, who dreams of worlds far away; and Phee, an impulsive, tough-as-nails scrapper who cannot imagine living anywhere else. When the Camps relative calm is disrupted by the arrival of four mysterious strangers, the sisters must work together to uncover the truth about the islands past, present, and future  a truth thats tangled up in their mothers past, which she keeps so closely guarded. (Luckily, Sky discovers and steals her journal, so were blessed with Sarahs voice as well!)But thats only the first half of the story. Their journey carries them all over the island; theyre pursued on the surface by Rolladin and her warlords, and hunted through the tunnels by cannibals gone mad with hunger and darkness; crushed under one dictators thumb, only to find themselves in the clutches of a creepy cult leader. Just when they  and we  think it cant get any worse, it does. Its a wild ride with a true Godzilla vs. Mothra ending. (As in SPN episode 4.10:DEAN: I got to hand it to you, Sammy. Bringing them all together all at once  angels and demons. It was a damn good plan.SAM: Yeah, well, when you got Godzilla and Mothra on youre a**, best to get out of their way and let them fight.)CITY OF SAVAGES has more of a YA feel than I expected (given the brutal title and description), but thats not a bad thing. I loved the sibling rivalry between Sky and Phee, two very different young women who share an unbreakable bond despite their dissimilarities; as the oldest of four kids, I can definitely relate. Delicate, inquisitive, and classically beautiful, in the world Before, Sky might have been a model or a writer  whereas Phee, with her big mouth and bigger fists, was all but made for this new, savage world. The juxtaposition of these opposing traits  old vs. new, then vs. now  in siblings so close theyre practically two halves of a whole is intriguing; I cant help but wonder where each girl might be had WWIII somehow been avoided.But. Once Kelly adds Ryder to the equation, things get a little annoying. Its not so much the sisters competing over a guy that bothers me  but when youre prioritizing romance over escape from a psychopath who murders and rapes in the name of G-O-D, then yeah. Thats a little over the top ridiculous.Though there doesnt seem to be much racial diversity in CITY OF SAVAGES, theres a marvelous plot line wherein the girls mom, Sarah, falls in love with her husbands sister, Mary. The two were taking Sky to the zoo when the war broke out; subsequently, they were trapped underground for seven months, during which time Mary cared for this little family. While she never knew her father, Sky is outraged on his behalf upon reading about the affair in Sarahs journal; Phee, on the other hand, adopts a more pragmatic approach  basically, its not cheating if you think hes dead. This might be the only time I took Phees side in the whole book.(To quote one of my status updates: Phees a bit of a s***, isnt she? Older sister talking.)Kellys world building is wonderful as well: from the farms in Central Park to the tiny wilderness that blossoms along the Hudson River to the use of the zoo as an internment camp/prison, she paints a world rich and vivid with detail. While I was able to correctly guess at some of the plot twists (Sarah + Mary; The Standard), others came as a complete shock (the exact nature of the relationship between Rolladin and the Millers; I thought that Phee might be Rolladins daughter, perhaps with Tom).Some of the language rubbed me the wrong way, though. For example, the word bully pops up with weird frequency, usually to describe behavior thats far beyond bullying: rape, torture, war crimes.And the story wraps up with a page from Sarahs journal, now in Sky and Phees possession licitly: I will give them a chance at a real life in this city thats been raped and left for dead. Nope. No. No thank you. Just no.A city is an insentient object  a collection of bricks and concrete and cable wires and trees  and as such cannot be raped. Its citizens can be raped, sure; and many of them were, including Sarah. (Many, but not all, which also disqualifies the use of city as shorthand for every person therein.) But lets not minimize their experiences by misusing the term in such a way that promotes rape culture, okay?Things that are rape: Rape.Things that are not rape: War. Bombing. Internment. Cannibalism. Murder. Logging. Habitat loss. Pollution. Taxes. Losing in a video game. Getting an F on a test. Someone bogarting your weed. You get the idea.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SIWM8URAB8ZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=148141030X#wasThisHelpful","R3SIWM8URAB8ZN","AISSRJ7E2L375","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AISSRJ7E2L375?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Full disclosure: I received a free product in exchange for an honest review.)This set of cat tunnels by PetMagasin contains two collapsible tunnels. While both are 10 in diameter, ones about twice as long as the other: 35 versus 18. They ship flat, crushed into a pancake-like shape. The longer of the two pops right into shape as you unfasten the three clips holding it down (the tension is surprisingly high, so be on your toes!); the smaller tunnel requires a little pulling and primping.Both are super-lightweight and easy to store, and make a fun crinkling sound when your cat bats, swats, or moves around in it. Several times I heard a commotion from the next room and assumed that Lemmy had someone managed to get a hold of a plastic bag  the sound is very similar.  Each tunnel has a cat toy dangling in the opening, and the longer tunnel has a little peep hole situated in the middle.My cat took to them immediately, showing a clear preference for the longer tunnel. Hes not terribly large  thirteen pounds, tops  and theres plenty of extra room for him to move around. I think that some of my smaller dogs could even fit inside if they wanted to, but so far theyve only proven mildly curious.  Lemmy makes a game out of hiding  behind the couch, under his lounge, around corners  and swiping at the dogs as they pass by. Hes already figured out that the tunnels are excellent for this, at least until everyone else catches on.The colors are bright and bold and reminiscent of a carnival tent, which is kind of fun. They also stand readily on their ends, which makes cleaning around them a snap. And while its a little too soon to tell for sure  peak shedding season is still a few months away  the material doesnt seem to attract and hold fur too readily.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDLV19NNFAPS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2G83K0#wasThisHelpful","RDLV19NNFAPS3","AISSRJ7E2L375","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AISSRJ7E2L375?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Full disclosure: I received a free electronic ARC for review through NetGalley. Trigger warning for rape and violence.)I was sixteen years old, and there was something gone wrong with me. I was sixteen, and I hadnt grown right, and all my friends were no longer my friends, and instead I had people I bit and who bit back. I had a beautiful, sad father and an angry drunken man who saw me as the reincarnation of a perverse angel. There was a pretty young woman with an affection for my father who picked out jewelry for me because my mother was a fantasy told to me in a good-night stories. I was sixteen, and my name was light, and my body had been bloodied and torn and repaired. I did well in school. I drew maps. I wondered what my life would become  I tried to picture it. I was sixteen, and I was an animal. I was the wrong kind of animal.Today, Lumen Ann Fowler is a kind and devoted wife and stay-at-home mom. She brings her husband lunch at school, oversees her sons play groups, attends community improvement meetings. She goes by the name of Ann Borden (maiden name Ann Fowler). Though shes tried to leave her past in the past, she still feels the pull of a full moon, and the siren call of a dark, deserted night. On these sleepless nights, she writes: a memoir, addressed to no one and everyone, about when she ran wild  sort of  through the streets of Polikwakanda.Whether due to pollution, the unique positioning of the moon, or a punishment handed down by Satan himself, Pale Miranda is home to a strange and sinister custom: For one year (give or take), starting at puberty, the kids breach  they run wild under the full moon. They fight, they f***, they raise hell. Adults and children stay inside for their own safety; residents of surrounding towns know to steer clear of this cursed town. Breaching is a dirty and dangerous custom  yet an essential one, for only when kids breach do they grow into healthy and well-adjusted adults.Young Lumen Fowler  conscientious student, loyal friend, daddys girl  is convinced that she will never breach. Her late mother didnt, you see, and surely these things are carried in the blood? For a long while, Lumens underdeveloped body seems to be cooperating, both to her and her fathers relief. But as she watches all of her classmates breach, one by one, only to be left behind and set apart, Lumen tires of being the good girl: innocent, childlike, virginal.When she finally breaches at sixteen, its both a relief and a curse: even as she embraces the animal inside her, Lumens solitude and self-loathing continue to isolate her from her peers; meanwhile, her baser instincts threaten to consume her. As she researches the phenomenon of breaching and delves into her mothers mythos, Lumens world threatens to split apart.Every male author who laments that women are too strange and unknowable  too alien  to write convincingly needs to read WHEN WE WERE ANIMALS. Like yesterday. This is how its done, people.Gaylord has written one of the most unusual and compelling coming-of-age stories Ive ever had the pleasure of reading (plus its an interesting spin on the werewolf genre). Lumen is a complex, engaging, and conflicted protagonist; her adolescent angst (minus all the sanctioned violence) is something that many girls and women, myself included, can identify with. The self-loathing and shame especially hit home. I also had (have, present tense) a strained relationship with my father (though it began well before my teen years); Gaylords portrayal of a single father trying to raise a teen girl alone is poignant and spot-on, and gave rise to some of the most heartrending passages in the book. To wit:I thought he would tell me he loved me, but I hadnt heard that from him in a long time. When I was a little girl, he would say it routinely. He seemed compelled to say it. But the declaration had gone the way of tall tale and myth.As though the love between a father and daughter were only a childish thing. As though womanhood made obscene that which had previously been precious and perfect.And so did we all fall  and in such a way were a million Edens lost.I get more than a little choked up every time I read that.I hesitate to say much more, both because I dont want to spoil the story  and also, Im still not 100% sure what I just read. Especially disturbing is the narrators marriage of sex and violence, love and hate, depravity and purity; then again, I think were meant to be discomforted by Lumen, just as she seems to be afraid and agitated by herself  her physical body, her innermost thoughts and desires, the very essence of who she is, or thinks she is, or fears herself to be.WHEN WE WERE ANIMALS is all but screaming for a feminist analysis; even as we see Lumen forgiving Peter for a near-rape (which never comes to pass because Lumen is too good to rape), we also have wonderful gems like this, which cut right to the heart of the virgin-whore complex: My virginity, my saintliness, like the new snow you hate yourself for tromping on. And: Im like the thing you worship. The thing you put on a shelf and dust every week. Dont take Lumen down from her shelf  youre liable to get your fingerprints all over her.Or how society places the onus on its girls to make sure boys dont take things too far: I was the good girl. The girl being groped and salivated upon in the den of her own home was the good girl. You were safe with her, because she didnt allow anything to get out of control.Its a wonderful, disquieting, sometimes vulgar exploration of adolescence and sexuality; the hazards of living on the margins; relationships between fathers and daughters, educators and students, young men and young women, friends and peers; the insularity of small rural communities; humankinds relationship with nature; and the monsters we face in the dark  including the darkness that dwells within us.WHEN WE WERE ANIMALS is also surprisingly, delightfully nerdy, what with its scholar-mapmaker-junior researcher narrator and her geologist father (an engineering geologist  a person who knew how to harmonize man and nature.). As animalistic as she may be, Lumen loves learning  and she puts her thirst for knowledge to use at every turn. (Yeah, Blackhat Roy and all those f****** books fractured my heart just a bit.)Also  and last does not equal least  Gaylord possesses an uncanny knack for foreshadowing, particularly at the eleventh hour. On more than one occasion I caught a hint mere sentences before its meaning was revealed. Now thats how you keep your readers on their toes, okay. Ditto: the ending, which I didnt see coming.

"I tried this backpack for two weeks in order to test out its two main use cases -- as a brief case and as a travel case.  This is one nice piece of baggage.  It is stylish and functional.  But its not the only piece you will need.  Rather it is a part of a portfolio of luggage.  Here is what I mean.The backpack is intelligently laid out for work use. It has a great place to store a PC and special sleeve that is ideal for a tablet/iPad.  The front pockets are great for holding pens and other materials.  It fits well under an airline seat.  The design includes a back zipper giving easy access to both the computer storage area and the main storage area.  When there is nothing in the main storage area, the bag feels large.  It collapses easily and does not keep its shape.  It is a little too big for everyday use when there is nothing in the open pack storage part of pack.The backpack's real strength is as a backpack, more than a substitute for a brief case.  The storage area is large, well lined and easy to access with a heavy duty zipper that goes across the top and down the side.  The roll-top increases its flexibility and style.  The storage capacity is big enough to hold what is needed for an overnight trip, a little tight if you pack a pair of shoes.  This is not a field pack, there are no places for water bottles and attachments that are normally found in a back pack.So this fits somewhere in the middle.  Recommended if you work takes you on overnight trips and you are looking to collapse your luggage into a single bag.  That is where the real strengths seem to be.  So travel effortlessly in style with the Alpha Bravo","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO454FUJZ60MM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XC6K03Q#wasThisHelpful","RO454FUJZ60MM","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The boogie board is one of the best writing experiences on an electrical device that I have had in a long time.  I wish my tablet wrote this well.  However, the fact that I cannot save or send that writing anywhere is a limitation.  If you are looking for an electronic scratch pad that you will use one at a time then this is good.  However if you want to keep a running list of things where they go in and go out, then the boogie board has limitations.It is lightweight, great price point, well designed and even comes with magnates to put it onto the 'fridge or other metal service.  I recommend looking at the scraps of paper and lists you keep now.  If you find yourself transfering lists onto clean sheets of paper, then the boogie board may be a good solution.  If you are scratching, adding, managing multiple notes and post its, then the boogie board will probably not fit your style.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6VIARW10GCOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010HWCEFY#wasThisHelpful","R6VIARW10GCOV","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Being a large guy finding good casual clothes is challenging.  The Oxford NY Henley seems like it will fit the bill both literally and figuratively.  Overall its OK, by that I mean that its a casual shirt, but it is not near as nice or as well fitting as offerings from the traditional retailers like Eddie Bauer or LL Bean.Overall the XX-Large size is for people who are large around the middle not necessarily tall, more like Barney Rubble than Fred Flintstone.  So if you are taller than 6 food I would pass on the shirt.  The material, while attractive, is surprisingly thin and light passes easily through the weave so I imagine it will not be durable or provide even minor warmth normally associated with a Waffle pull over.  These may be ok in smaller sizes but for a big and tall size they telegraph that this is a shirt I may be able to wear once or twice before it becomes too stretched out or simply loses its shape.The Henley pattern is common enough and the style is classic, my suggestion is to look for this type of shirt where they provide sizes that include big and tall.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS7FZQM7A0QJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXIS3NK#wasThisHelpful","RS7FZQM7A0QJJ","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been looking for an effective stylus ever since I purchased my first iPad mainly for note taking and to replace a paper notebook. This is the best of the different products I have tried to date, but its still not there.  First the good points about the product.Form factor -- closest to a pen or pencil which makes it easy to use.  Other blue tooth stylus's were thicker more like a sharpie marker than a real pen.  The USB charger in the end is a plus as is the cap on the stylus making it easier toLine drawing -- good with a fine tip point and pressure sensitivity.Battery life appears goodNow for some of the challenges:Works with a limited number of applications, so if you are already taking notes or drawings in some areas you will not have blue tooth connectivity.The latency and drawing separation issues remain, no one has solved this one yet, but it makes writing with a stylus not as effective as pen and paper.If you already draw with a stylus and are looking for one that is more like a pencil or pen, then this is a good choice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH047NZMO9W7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012IAQIU0#wasThisHelpful","RH047NZMO9W7","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Perfect for the office, dinners and anywhere where you want to look more together than casual.  The bracelets are good weight with attractive rose gold color.  These are things you can wear independently of the watch.  Unfortunately the same does not apply to the watch.  It is rather plain outside of the face and not well suited to wearing alone.Overall a great gift, nice but not too pricey and sure to make a positive impression.

"We are not college students, but this caddie has helped organize and improve the functionality of the space under our bathroom sink.  Its recommended if you have a sink area filled with different sized bottles, tools and other items that quickly become a tumbling mess whenever you go to get something.  The caddie is flexible enough to hold bottles and items of multiple shapes and sizes, yet strong enough to hold its own against heavier items stored under the sink.  They all become accessible with a single handle and are easy to put away as well.Overall if you have a mess under the balthroom or even kitchen sink, then this can help.

"OK I have a big foot and ordered the size 49 shoe.  We just came back from a week of bike touring riding about 50 miles a day and touring museums, etc along the way.

The bottom is solid, with rubber sole treads that work well for gripping a pedal -- i did not get clips at this time.  They were also reasonably comfortable and provided good footing when walking.The soles are solid, as one would expect.

"Great for tailgating, small apartments or taking to the beach.  The grill is a little on the heavy side, but definitely portable thanks to a sturdy handle and locking design. This is more of a griddle, or frying surface than a grill per se. The fuel heats a solid surface rather than having flames lick up through traditional grill, so no 'smores or that flame blackened cooking you might be used to.  It features the Foreman tilt that draws grease away form the cooking surface.The overall design is innovative and attractive.  The bright red cover is not easy to miss and the fold out supports create sides that help protect your food from the wind and the weather. Set up and break down are a little complicated and takes some time to get used to.  The two front red circles are the key as they serve as both the stand and the locking mechanism.  The quality of the materials, thin in nature to save weight, make this a little tougher than they need to be.  The gas attachment easily connects with the overall grill surface but again needs to be accounted for when using.  It would have been nice if it came with a case or way to store a fuel cylinder, the gas attachment and the grease catch. It is messy when you use it outdoors so be sure to bring paper towels as you will want to clean up the cooking surface in particular before folding the grill back up.  Then there is the issue of where to store a hot grill as it cools down.  This is not a problem at a picnic so much as I can see it at a tailgate where people want to eat and then go into a game.Overall, a solid and good product one that we see using more as an apartment balcony grill that we can store easily.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TPV1HRRCPIOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUUVQ#wasThisHelpful","R1TPV1HRRCPIOB","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jade Dragon Mountain represents a transformation of a traditional political thriller into a new domain -- rural china.  The result is an interesting book that is very enjoyable and engaging to read.  It is one thing to write a political/crime/thriller set in the old west where we have familiarity with the genre, clothing and culture from movies and other sources.The book's political/crime structure provides a level of plot familiarity that allows the reader to concentrate on the descriptions of imperial china.  Elsa Hart provides a right details and character development to help the reader see things differently and accelerate their imagination.  This is a particular accomplishment given that most readers will have a limited understanding of rural china at imperial times.  She has accomplished this without resorting to jingoistic stereotypes or simplifications.Hart handles the complexity of imperial china from the Jesuits, to foreign travelers, to cultural issues at the time into creating a great read.  You will not become an expert on imperial China, but you will walk away learning something.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35DOW55P0ZYRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250072328#wasThisHelpful","R35DOW55P0ZYRR","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very nice piece, pretty, dainty and ornate design.  It shows very well online giving you the impression that it is a larger piece and the heart is made of thicker material.  Both are not the case.  This piece is very small, more appropriate for a pre-teen than someone older.  The metal is paper thin, more of a stamping than a crafted piece.  The chain is among the most dainty and frail in my spouse's collection. Its so thin that it will easily bend, more like disposable jewelery than the nice necklace.If you are looking for a piece to give a child, something that is ok to have for a while but may break, become lost or bent, then this is a perfectly acceptable gift.  Our daughter would have cherished this when she was 8 or 9 years old, wore it and then kept it in her jewelery box.

"My recommendation is to pass on this book as its largely filled with hype and discussions that were more appropriate in 2005 rather than 2015.  The themes of digital and disruption have moved well beyond the assertions discussed in this book.  There are much better and more relevant books to invest your time with.If you are interested in reading about the deeper economic and structural impact of digital I suggest reading The Second Machine Age.  A more academic understanding of disruption can be found in Big Bang Disruption.  Treatments of digital in a particular industry, The Digital Doctor in healthcare is a good example.  New ways to think about the digital economy -- Zero-to-One.The topics of the chapters appear great: transformation, trust, transparency, innovation, experience, etc, but there treatment is rather shallow and oriented more like a motivational talk rather than practitioner learning and advice.

"McKinsey seeks to pull together all of the forces that seek to pull apart business strategies.  The result is a surprisingly flat description that rehashes past McKinsey research reports than offer a new way to look at the world and the relevance of strategic choices and investments.  The four trends are below:Trend 1: The locus of economic activity is shifting to emerging markets like China, India, Asia and AfricaTrend 2: Technology's impact on the economy is acceleratingTrend 3: Demographics, the aging of the population is shifting demandsTrend 4: Connectedness as trade, capital, people and information flow across national boardersEach trend is treated in a formulaic way, following a standard structure with slavish adherence.  You can extract the books outline which should give you and idea of the limitations of the book's story telling or information value.Overall, this book is filled with factoids and other little nuggets, many previously published by McKinsey's Global Institute.  So if you are looking for new insight, you will not find it here.  The discussions of each trend are interesting in their own ways, but the prose is rather bland and expository rather than telling an engaging story that drives understanding or action.The book's prescriptions are surprisingly simple -- mostly around do better -- rather thank do things differently.Overall not recommended if you are looking for new ideas.  It may be helpful for others to re-enforce their strategic decisions, particularly if those decisions are not too radical.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22S7ZVKLWKFMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1610395794#wasThisHelpful","R22S7ZVKLWKFMA","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Leading Digital represents the culmination of a multi-year study of digital technologies impact on the organization.  This makes Leading Digital different, in the sense that other books on the subject either concentrate on technology hype, product innovation or disruption.  By focusing on the organizational impact of digital, Westerman, Bonnet and McAfee, create a simple, clear and compelling framework for categorizing companies and their attitudes toward digital technology.Characterizing an entire company as either a Beginner, Conservative, Fashionista or Digital Master provides an executive short hand that appears highly effective on the surface, but quickly leads one to ask, ok but what do I do?  The advices provided in the book borders not the self evident, i.e.:  beginners are slow to adapt and have the basic digital capabilities while fashionistas are buying every new digital bauble.That is one of the points holding this book back from a five star review, is that it presumes a monolytic attitude toward digital in order to simplify its messages.  This treatment is appropriate for a book intended to drive client conversations for a consulting company.The books chapters encompass the range of organizational and leadership topics related to digital transformation.  The section titles reflect this:Part 1 - building digital capabilities covers the customer experience, their link to core operations (aka legacy) and the business model.Part 2 -- focuses internally on the vision, organizational engagement, governance and technology leadership.Part 3 -- concentrates on digital transformation from strategic framing through mobilization and sustaining a change program.Taken at this level, the book is rather complete in its topical treatment but the book treats each of these topics somewhat superficially.  The case studies read like a who's who of digital transformation but they are mostly stories of success, descriptions of what worked and not a deeper examination of challenges with strategies to over come them.  Reading the case studies, of which there are many and a good thing, provides little meat for the reader to chew on.The case studies, clear and simple framework and clearly written prose are among the strengths of this book.  Among its challenges are the observation that many organizations have already moved beyond an organizational characterization into transformative action so the advice is a little dated in places.  It was revolutionary when these materials first came out almost two years ago.  The clarity of the frameworks also tends toward clear but overly simply advice and actions.  Take the 12 steps to being a digital master:Build AwarenessDefine Your Starting PointCreate a Shared VisionTranslate Your Vision into ActionBuild your GovernanceFund the TransformationSignal your AmbitionsEarn the Right to EngageSet New Behaviors and Evolve CultureBuild Foundation SkillsAlign Incentives and RewardsMeasure, Monitor and IterateThese 12 points apply to any transformation not just digital.  You could say the same for implementing ERP, post merger integration or any other significant change.  This undercuts an understanding of digital's potential and its disruptive impact.  These technologies are fundamentally different than the IT technologies that came before, but its hard to tell that from this book or from the approaches it suggests.Readers who have digital scars will benefit from the reminders that this book provides.  People new to digital can easily be lulled into a false sense of security or alarm as it seems so much like what has come before or that we all must become digital masters tomorrow.  Knowing that difference and the nuance it contains is the reason for the length of this review.  By focusing on the organization, Westerman, Bonnet and McAfee have created something very accessible, but they have also accepted some limitations on explaining the reality of digital transformation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DVN4ILT94Q9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NE6MG0Y#wasThisHelpful","R1DVN4ILT94Q9W","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Corkscrews are one of those things that you use just enough to make their design and functionality matter but not often enough to invest in a new product.  The rabbit wing corkscrew works just as you would expect, but the ergonomics and operation is much smoother, better looking and all around easier.First the corkscrew simply fits over the top of the bottle, with the broad black plastic bottom providing an easy and secure grip.  There is no more fumbling trying to hold open the corkscrew, stabilize the bottle and then drive the screw into the cork.Second the short 'wings' and wide horizontal screw top make it easy to uncork the wine, again with significantly less fumbling and pressure.Finally the compact size makes it easy to store, find in your drawer and use.  If you have ever had to hunt for the older style corkscrew you know what I mean.  The design is such that you could leave it out in the open as an accessory rather than a utensil.Overall, a great device, one that easily replaced my old all metal rabbit wing corkscrew and yes I am drinking more wine now because its easy to open.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A0YBP0ITESXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOPV2I2#wasThisHelpful","R1A0YBP0ITESXT","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the twist medallion as a spur of the moment gift.  I have been rather pleased.  Its a great accessory for business casual and casual wear.The medallion is of the right size to be attractive without being overbearing.  The twist helps the medallion sit flat on the chest giving it a definite front and back side.The one drawback is the 18"" chain.  It is too short and the clasp is rather difficult to use.Other than that, its a great chain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GGN15G8C6KMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LGQ70IM#wasThisHelpful","R2GGN15G8C6KMW","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is difficult to write a less than glowing review for any book.  But I found this book did not meet its marketing and expectations. Hailed as an international thriller in the Stieg Larsson tradition, it seemed like a book worth digging right into.  The Swimmer has many similarities to the Larsson book, both authors are swedish, both involve a complicated plot, a female protagonist and a decidedly non-American style of writing.  But these similarities are superficial as I found The Swimmer to be driven by a ponderous pace, a heavy focus on descriptive prose with product placement and predicable plot.  Those factors form the basis for this review.The basic plot revolves around the inter-actions of five actors who are involved in a struggle for evidence of atrocities that are part of the gulf war and attempts to keep that evidence secret.  The main character Klara is the common connection to the other four.  Child, friend, lover, etc.  It takes Zander half of the book to set up the relationships and interactions before the real plot moves forward.The book is predictable in the sense that the America Baddies are really bad, the european heroes are intelligent, honorable and dedicated to seeing the truth revealed.  The book is not an international tour deforce so much as a tour around Sweden, Brussels, Paris, Amsterdam with glimpses into the middle east.  These locations do not drive the plot as much as they could have.  Likewise the description of the products used by the characters seem more akin to paid for placements in a movie rather than giving meaning toThis is Zander's first published novel and that shows in places with standard plot twists, descriptions and predictable actions.  The result is a book that you have to push through rather than being pulled along by its pace.  Zander makes extensive use of description, internal monologue and flashbacks to set up a situation and plot that is more complex than it needs to be.  He uses each of these techniques a little too much.  The timeline changes from chapter to chapter, requiring the reader to constantly check the date when reading each chapter.I do not hate this book, but I do not like it either, particularly when it is held up as the next major type of thriller.  I am sure it is already optioned and will show up in theaters some day soon.Overall, the book is not bad, but its no where good enough to say that Zander is in line to be the next Larsson, just yet.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E7122D7C1I4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062337246#wasThisHelpful","R3E7122D7C1I4X","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Feeling warm, clammy or think that you have a fever?  Too often you just grin and bear it, after all its inconvenient to retrieve a traditional thermometer, put it in your mouth and then wait for the results.  The Braun Ear Thermometer solves all of that.  Non invasive, accurate and easy to use; the combination makes for a most valuable addition to your medicine cabinet.  If you have small children, then this is a must have particularly as school and the flu seasons kick in.The device is roughly the size of an electric shaver.  It fits easily into your hand.  It is easy to store and therefore easy to find.  For those with a shallow medicine cabinet then you may need to store it elsewhere.  The device fits well in a kitchen drawer making it readily accessible throughout your busy day.So if you have ever wondered if you had a fever or needed to know if others have a fever, then this is a recommended addition to your home medicine chest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRIXBK7MX0UQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MUK6M82#wasThisHelpful","RRIXBK7MX0UQ0","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a Norelco razor a long time ago and was curious to see how they have improved.  They are signficantly improved and delvier a close and consistent shave.  The re-designed the shaving head which makes it much more flexible, easier to manuever around your face and providing a smoother cut.  The variable razor speeds deliver different types of shaves.The razor charges quickly and holds a charge effectively.  The cleaning systems that comes with the razor is innovative but it takes up considerable space in the bathroom.  Those with limited space on their sink or vanity should recognize that the real estate.  This is one reason for a four star review.The shaver delivers a high quality shave, particulalry good for an electric razor.  It is comparable to shaving with a blade.  I found the best results shaving with my face dry before getting into the shower as that provides an even shave as I missed less spots than using a disposable razor in the shower.Recommended for those looking to upgade their electric shave.

"This is classic William Gibson, rich in its depiction of the near future.  Dialog driven, Gibson injects the reader directly into the action with little scaffolding or explanation that can be disconcerting, particularly to people who are not used to reading this type of book.  I can tell you that its well worth the effort as the characters reveal themselves rather than begin told about them.By just jumping in, it takes some time to get a feel for the book.  Things clear up around page 83 as you build context around the characters and the settings.  Without giving too much away, The Peripheral is a story of multiple worlds, situations and timelines creating a rich background and exploration of very interesting ideas concerning the near future.Not quite as dark as Gibson's other works but not a light work either.  Few authors can inform the reader about a possible future via character dialog rather than long descriptive prose.  Gibson is a master at this and The Peripheral reflects that mastery.It is a tough read at the start, but well worth the investment.  Something that needs to be read, every word as they all have meaning and its easy to miss something.  So don't plan to skim it, sample it or read a few pages then put it down for a week.  Take some time and enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MAXPAWLABKH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399158448#wasThisHelpful","R3MAXPAWLABKH3","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The title Connected by Design gives the impression of being Design Thinking.  That is misleading. Design is really not the focus of this book.  Rather the book concentrates on describing and advocating for a specific context they call  Functional Integration.This is a two star book for the following reasons:-> This is not a design book-> It is a commercial for the authors company and the authors branded idea, Functional Integration rather than an exploration of the  challenges and initiatives leaders are taking in the face of changing conditions-> The books examples are over reliant on Apple iPod and Nike+ which are good examples, but there is more to business and being like these companies.-> Limited support for B2B implications as it concentrates on B2C and consumer digital related businesses.  This book says little if your not Google, Apple, Nike, etc.-> The book is filled with assertions by the authors rather than analysis to build the readers knowledge and ability to act.There are some good ideas in this book, but they are few and far between given the amount of time the authors spend touting Functional Integration and their company.  You will need to read between the commercial messages to pick up some new ideas on horizontal vs. vertical integration, views on digital marketing, etc.DETAILED REVIEWThe authors define Functional Integration as a distinctive online platform that functions both as a hub for a brands digital services and as an invaluable portal to the brands e-commerce offerings.  The result, according to the authors, relies on the interdependent dimensions of functionality and integration within ecosystems in order to deliver growth and profits. (page 6)  The description is full of aspiration but the book is limited on explanation -- hence the two star reviewThe bulk of the book concentrates on describing Functional Integration resulting in a book that is more of a commercial for R/GA rather than an exploration of the issues and challenges facing organizations.  The remaining chapters of the book focus on one of the following principles of Functional Integration Utility is relevance Context is king Synergy captures customers Reimagine value creation Redesign value delivery Redirect toward value capture Lead like the world depends on itThese are fine principles, but the book treats these with assertions around their company and what they have done rather than building the reader's awareness and abilities.  The result is rehashing observations and arguments about how marketing and consumers have changed, with limited new light shed on the issues, for example the discussion equating personalization with experience.Strengths:The discussion of horizontal vs. vertical integration is helpful in understanding the different moves and motivations of players in the digital world.  Functional integration seeks to be the space between the two.The book uses case examples as illustrations of the ideas but not as studies regarding how leaders faced issues and challenges.Challenges:The commercial and self promotional aspects of the book get in the way of the books ideas as the reader is led to believe that Functional Integration is the only answer and R/GA the only partner undercuts the ideas in the book.The case studies are limited to companies with particular branded/stacked ecosystems like Nike+, Apple, Google, etc.  The book does include the McCormick as a case study, but the discussion is speculative and projects how McCormick with spices will need to do the same thing as Apple or Nike.The book's structure needs section breaks to help the reader digest the author's arguments","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MBHZDC4487HW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118858204#wasThisHelpful","R3MBHZDC4487HW","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Rise of the DEO provides a description of leadership in the design age.  It concentrates on laying out all of the positive aspects of leadership with little to no consideration of the realities and compromises reality requires.  It is an example of the type of book that everyone will agree with, publicly state that they aspire to be and then go about their normal business.  That is why its just an OK book or three stars.How to become a DEO is the one thing missing from this book. Its also the reason I bought the book and dedicated time to read it.Please read on before you condemn this review as being from a reactionary, non-innovative or someone who just does not get it.  Devotees of design, who accept the principles with little debate, will find this book foundational.  Slight skeptics on the other hand will agree that the points the authors make are interesting but they will take the descriptions with a grain of salt and suspect.Maria Giudice and Christopher Ireland provide a compressive description of a to-be vision for design principles as a model for leadership.  The aspiration is a good one, but in execution the DEO book fails to create a blueprint for future leaders.  This happens when the book concentrates on delineating a list of design principles and then describing how they apply to leadership.  The result is a list of characteristics that are all encompassing to a degree that makes it difficult to see how to become  this type of leader.  The characteristics make up the chapters of the book and include:Personal leadership characteristics -- the ""ME"" as the authors call them:- Change Agent- Risk Taker- System Thinker- Intuitive- Socially Intelligent- GSD-- Getting 'stuff' doneGroup leadership characteristics -- the ""WE""- Co-creation- Networks and Communities- Crafting Culture- Care and Feeding- Place MattersLeadership for action -- the ""DO""- Positive Passion- Expertise- Problem Solving- Permission to Fail- Playful Work- Iterate and EvolveLeadership from the inside -- the ""BE"" aspect- Integrity- Humility- Generosity- OriginalityTaking together these 22 characteristics define a rare individual indeed a cross between a number of famous people -- just take your pick.  That is where the book delivers and declines to take the next step -- how do you become this type of leader.  The authors include a series of Profiles who they consider DEO's which is a great part of the book.  Unfortunately much of these write ups talk about the people themselves, their experiences and innate traits which give the reader the idea that DEO's are born rather than being made.StrengthsComprehensive in its description and discussion of the manifestation of design traits in leadershipGraphic illustrations of its concepts and points as well as the paths of the profiled leadersChallengesThe book is written to a design oriented audience, people who already 'get it' so to speak, but that is not the audience who needs to understand and practice these principles.While the book features several profiles, they do not contain profiles of people who lead in more traditional organizations.  This gives the impression that DEO's can only be found in those type of companies rather than in more traditional companies.  That means that DEO traits do not matter to all of those people working in 'traditional' companies.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROJC13VI5BF93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0321934393#wasThisHelpful","ROJC13VI5BF93","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being innovative and established are often assumed to be mutually exclusive.  According to conventional wisdom big companies cannot create new ideas and generate new businesses as readily as their small start-ups. This leads to books written about how big companies can act small.  While that generates a lot of jargon, it results in little actionable insight.That is where this book comes in.  Hill, Brandeau, Truelove and Lineback have created a book that clearly illustrates how large organizations can be more innovative in ways that work with their size and scale rather than against it.  This subject alone makes this an important book, their treatment of the subject differentiates this book and makes it an important management resource for every organization.The authors identify three critical aspects required for innovation: Collaboration, discovery-driven learning and integrative decision making.  These aspects sound conventional and they are, but the authors build on these ideas to bring out the nuance and necessity of thinking differently about innovation.  These differences and the contradiction they have with legacy business cultures bring out what it takes to lead innovation.  They include:Collaboration requires 'creative abrasion' looks at the tension inherent with innovation.  The authors discuss this process where potential solutions are created, explored and modified through debate and discourse.  Corporate culture, norms and behaviors are fundamentally non-confontational and often passive aggressive which needs to change by leading through accepting the creative abrasion associated with new ideas.  This is the focus of Chapter 6 of the book.Learning and discovery processes lead to 'creative agility' through a process based on pursuing new ideas quickly and proactively through multiple experiments, reflecting and analyzing on the outcomes of these experience and adjusting subsequent actions and choices based on what they learned.  This is the focus on Chapter 7 of the book.Integrative decision making requires 'creative resolution' covers the observation regarding the combinatorial aspects of innovation and the need to make the integrative decisions necessary to realize innovative results.  Chapter 8 of the book discusses the governance and organizational structures that balanced patience vs urgency and bottom up initiatives vs. top-down direction.These three areas reflect the fundamental approaches organizations can add to become more innovative.  While these approaches make sense, community and purpose are the lynchpins that hold this together.  The book devotes a portion on these two points that take the broad based issue of innovation and make it actionable.  The book's prose is occasionally academic and stilted in places, particularly when it is discussing ideas around leadership.Overall, a strong book, written from a business perspective that provides tools for executives.  The book features a number of case study companies including Pixar, HCL, Volkswagen, eBay, Google, Pfizer among others.  The cases facilitate telling the story and illustrating the ideas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ET5LHZU10M3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JNYCOXA#wasThisHelpful","R3ET5LHZU10M3N","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Design thinking is one of the those things that define the future of management and business and therefore it is critical to understand and apply.  This book starts out doing perhaps the best job of explaining Design Thinking in a clear and understandable way.  That makes the first first 15 pages among the best I have read on the subject.The books idea to illustrate the application of design thinking in a varied set of situations is also excellent.  Unfortunately this is where the book bogs down as the cases focus more of explaining what people people did in narrative form rather than showing how design thinking helped solve the problem.  This leads to case chapters which make up the majority of the book that are illustrative and a bit heavy without being incisive.This makes Solving Problems with Design Thinking more of a secondary book to read rather than the place to start to understanding design thinking.  I would recommend Change by Design: How Design Thinking Transforms Organizations and Inspires Innovationby Tim Brown as a good place to start.  Also Service Design: From Insight to Implementation by Andy Polaine, Lavrans Lvlie and Ben Reason is another book that is a great place to start.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S1F7EKEQA5A6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0231163568#wasThisHelpful","R1S1F7EKEQA5A6","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Power packs are an essential element for anyone traveling with a tablet/iPad etc. The Belkin Power Pack is an able addition to my briefcase.  The product is good, but there are some things that hold it back from being a four or five star rating.  First the good points:  its size works well and does not take up a ton of real-estate in my brief case -- unlike some other batteries that are bulky.  It is well made and the rounded edges help keep the battery from snagging on the other things in my briefcase.  The battery does not come with an outlet plug charger, meaning that there is one less thing you need to carry, particularly if you have a USB/outlet for charging.Now the less than great things.  The battery reserve is relatively weak, a fully charged battery has recharged my iPad to only about 50% over night.  The main thing is that the pack is fundamentally not user friendly.  Here is an example -- there are two USB ports labeled by the voltage 2.5 and 1.0 without any guide as to which device goes where.  This is a simple thing that could have been addressed with just some silk screening to say Tablet and Smart Phone.If you looking for a new battery backup for your tablet and phone then this is as good as any.

"The Mongoliads first three books were great taking us into a world and a perspective that few could.  The main story ended leaving two subplots unresolved.  This book resolves one of them in terms of telling the tale of the Shield Brethren.  It is a good story filled with detailed descriptions of the Western Martial Arts  also known as how medieval knights fought in armor with swords and other weapons.The book moves its characters rapidly west as the come back from their task in the Mongol capital.  While there is much action and movement in the story, there is little in the way of character development or real story telling.  This is a weakness of the book as there are many opportunities for the characters to reflect and interact in the plot line, they just never seem to include that in the story.  This is unusual for a story started by the original authors who worked to develop richer characters.Recommended if you liked the Mongoliad books, but be aware that this book is more about plot resolution than storytelling.  If you have not read the prior books, then I would strongly suggest starting at the beginning.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROXYAR10QKHRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477848215#wasThisHelpful","ROXYAR10QKHRR","ASGN5WD3DI451","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASGN5WD3DI451?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sounds very good and seems solidly built, as far as one can tell those things.  My only issue is the feel of the footswitch - it's a very hard click, and it pops when it's engaged, which often happens if a pedal is true bypass.  This pedal has plenty of delay time, and it's a great size for squeezing more onto your pedalboard.No issues, sounds great.  The repeats have a nice, grainy, analog feel to them.  I don't know if it's true analog, but it sounds like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKAMUGMTZAQM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GRRN2RI#wasThisHelpful","RKAMUGMTZAQM5","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though this book is now old, in the overall scheme of things that have happened since 9/11, it's still a good read which provides a valuable and interesting perspective on the history of the Middle East and the US response to 9/11 in the region.  The author doesn't purport to adhere to any particular ideology, so I don't know that I could call this anything but neutral - of course depending on your particular political leanings, your mileage may vary.Dyer's style is very readable, he relays facts and information with little clutter and avoids the dry, bland textbook style of so many political and/or history books.  This is a pretty easy book to get through, but it still provides so much information in a very accessible manner.  Even though at the time of its writing the US invasion of Iraq was pending, I would still say that most of this book is still relevant.  I learned a lot about the Middle East and the growth of fundamentalism.I will also add that in the introduction Dyer essentially predicts the Arab Spring and the 2008 worldwide recession (more or less), which is pretty incredible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQUQ4612OKS0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0771029772#wasThisHelpful","RQUQ4612OKS0U","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit that I went into this not being a huge G&O fan.  After having watched a few episodes, I think the writing on this show is decent and the main characters are generally likeable, but to me they're trying way too hard to be ""quirky"".I also find that their unison-singing gets on my nerves.  But mainly the thing I can't get behind is their songs.  I just don't think they're funny.  They tend to start to sound samey to me (the unison singing thing again), and the draw seems to be how many words they can cram into each song without regard for melody.  So, for me they don't work as songs, and they don't work as humor.OF course not everyone will feel this way.  Your mileage may vary.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OXX5RNHHDVGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4F9TSI#wasThisHelpful","R3OXX5RNHHDVGQ","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have a 13 lb. Havanese.  We live on a relatively quiet circle with a view to the main road maybe 150 yards away.  Our dog tends to bark at any car or person he sees.  We don't want him to not bark at all, but we also don't want him disrupting our lives (and those of our neighbors) by constantly barking.  Ah, the conundrums of dog ownership.In looking at bark collars on Amazon, it became clear that there are two kinds - those with a remote and those which activate on their own.  I didn't want to worry about fumbling for a remote, plus batteries for two devices, so I started looking at the automatic collars.  The next thing you'll notice is that many of the products look exactly the same, but are branded differently and sold at different price points.  To me, this means that they are probably all made in the same factory and then purchased and sold by the various brands.  Who knows, many of the brands may be the same company.Anyway, we've been using this for almost three weeks now, and the difference is very noticeable.  The collar is supposed to give three warning beeps before giving a shock - and the shock will only happen if those three warning beeps happen within 30 seconds.  Something like that.From what I've observed, this is more or less accurate.  If he barks a series of quick barks, that will count as ONE, however, which I think makes sense.  Quieter ""woofs"" or growls will not activate the collar.  I'm fine with all of this.  Most of the time now, our dog barks once or twice and then stops, switching to quieter growls.  We then comfort and encourage him while he settles down.  I've only seen him get shocked once.We only put this on him during the day when we're home.  He has a little table by a window that he sits on so that he can look outside (he's too short to see out, otherwise), and that's become his favorite spot.  Most of the time he's fine, but now when he chooses to bark, it ends fairly quickly, rather than us having to deal with him barking incessantly for a few minutes at a time.We're still on the original battery after three weeks.  One more thing - the collar has activated twice while he was playing and shaking one of his toys with his head.  We just adjusted the sensitivity down a notch, and it's been fine since.For the price this thing can't be beat.  Quality seems to be fine so far.  The collar strap itself came with plenty of extra length.  Once we decided to keep the collar I cut probably 10 inches off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O8GEUU4R2F2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LVUPQLG#wasThisHelpful","R1O8GEUU4R2F2B","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've read Chandler's Marlowe novels and are looking for more, then this will fill that need.  I love Chandler.  He was an excellent writer who only gets less regard from the literary types because of the genre he worked in.  He had a gift for setting moods and setting scenes and adding details that feel natural and flesh out the picture in your mind.I also find that he keeps his stories fresh.  While they all do fit into the private detective genre, they feel different enough from each other that they don't start to feel samey at all - to me anyway.This is a quality book, and a real wrist-breaker at 1100+ pages.  Be advised that it has the stories from ""Trouble is My Business"", as well as ""The Lady in the Lake"" (all excellent), but otherwise I don't have any of the others in my other Chandler volumes.Great stuff.  If you love Chandler you'll love this.  I find that he scratches that itch for me much better than other famous authors of the same genre.  Probably because he was my first detective writer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OUVMY5YEYJON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375415009#wasThisHelpful","R2OUVMY5YEYJON","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall I think the quality of this popcorn is very good.  The kernels are large and the bag isn't dominated by broken pieces, as some packaged popcorn seems (we got a gift basket recently with some kettlecorn from another gourmet company, and the bag was mostly just tiny, crumbled pieces).  A friend gave me this bag  (too spicy for them) and while I like it, I would never pay this price for popcorn, no matter how good it is.  That's my only issue, really.If you love popcorn more than I do, I think this brand seems to deliver top quality, so that's something to consider.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYVRWE849T3UM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DF05X7W#wasThisHelpful","RYVRWE849T3UM","A22Z554ZQ8NFPC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22Z554ZQ8NFPC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
