"THREE DAYS TO DEAD's deck is stacked with tons of paranormal content, a funky 'work backwards' story telling style, and a tough as nails protagonist. I loved Evy; this girl has been lived through pretty much every crappy scenario you can dream up, and then some, yet she keeps her eye on the prize. Meding's DREG CITY world is vast, and exciting without being overpowering, and the urgency of Stone's situation comes through loud & clear thanks to the author writing the heroine's flashbacks in the present tense. I was iffy on the narrator for the better part of this audiobook, but I enjoyed it enough to continue listening to the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10SKUEQ5BCKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053O21U0#wasThisHelpful","R10SKUEQ5BCKX","AMCZLPIRP0QTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMCZLPIRP0QTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ALPHA GIRL series, and I have had our ups & downs; I was worried that this magic driven installment might feel out of place amidst Aileen Erin’s werewolves, and that postponing Tessa & Dastien’s full moon ceremony (again) in favour of giving a secondary character their HEA was a mistake. BRUJA proved me wrong on both counts. Lucas single-handedly solved my first concern, and Claudia did the rest.I liked that the author waited a bit before hightailing it to Peru. She set the stage for the why of De Santos’ trip with a brief recap, and some new information which did wonders for my opinion of this book’s protagonist because she didn’t blindly accept Muraco’s wild goose chase of a quest. The story did lack Peruvian authenticity though, so the setting change was barely noticeable unfortunately.Claudia has been a useful ally in the witches vs. werewolves war, and after three volumes as a sidekick it was time for her to step outside of her comfort zone. I enjoyed witnessing her transformation from one of Luciana’s minions to future leader of the rebel coven. Her internal monologue exhibited the most growth, but by the conclusion of this tale it was apparent that Claudia was no longer a protégé.There seemed to be a bit of a love triangle emerging until Erin finished painting her ugly picture of Matt, De Santos’ betrothed, after that unpleasantness he was hastily taken off the menu. The heroine’s connection with Mr. July was impossible to miss, as were the not so subtle furry bits. The outcome was easy to predict, although admittedly the shortage of romantic drama only made the plot stronger.BRUJA was a quaint witch-y dalliance, but I’m ready for more werewolves!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8BTBD1KSFHQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NX52A0C#wasThisHelpful","R8BTBD1KSFHQ2","AMCZLPIRP0QTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMCZLPIRP0QTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I stumbled upon this novel while visiting a blog, and I have 0 willpower vis-à-vis wolves, so the LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD retelling aspect intrigued me, and honestly, who could say no to that cover!? Rosamund Hodge dazzled me with her creativity, writing, and whimsy, although I did find the story rather busy because as a stand-alone a lot needed to be packed into one volume. I could have done without the love triangle, and the Devourer’s defeat at the hands of a knitting needle set a new record for the lamest killing tool in all of Fantasy.The author’s world-building and lore were the highlights of CRIMSON BOUND. I enjoyed untangling the unknowns of Rachelle’s universe, and what it meant to be a woodwife, bloodbound and forestborn. There were flashbacks of how Zisa & Tyr held the Great Forest at bay the first time as well as several different versions of their legendary triumph which is where the riddle of Joyeuse & Durendal—the two swords capable of slaying the Big Bad Wolf—originated. It was quite exquisite how all of the fragments came together, and many of the characters had poker faces that would fool their own mothers.The Rachelle / Erec / Armand romance was completely unnecessary, and gave me the impression that it was included simply because a book can’t truly be considered Young Adult without a triangle which is so not true by the way. The heroine seemingly realized that she loved two guys overnight, and both were kooky choices. I liked d’Anjou & Vareilles as individuals, but as suitors neither really lit my fire. One was evil while as the other was a saint which made the options too radical for my tastes; I’m a boy next door kind of girl, however perhaps fans of the good/bad trope will be ok with it.The threads coalesced nicely as the story came to a close, and there were plenty of surprises that made me say “Ooh!” The barriers that Rachelle had to surmount were varied, and came from within as well as without. After the protagonist’s two part stand-off with the lindenworm; I was salivating in anticipation of the bloodshed that would surely ensue when she faced the Devourer. I’ll admit that it was clever, although after a novel-long search for a sword, I would have preferred an epic battle that ended with decapitation or evisceration as opposed to the tidy reality of Hodge’s conclusion. It was too easy.CRIMSON BOUND had big teeth, but its bite was a kinda weak; recommended with reservations. ~ 3.5 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DZY77H92V0TZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006222476X#wasThisHelpful","R1DZY77H92V0TZ","AMCZLPIRP0QTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMCZLPIRP0QTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second time in as many years that I’ve had to bid adieu to one of Jenn Bennett’s series, and I really hate goodbyes. GRAVE PHANTOMS had a different vibe to it than the two previous installments because the final Magnusson sibling is younger, female, and the romance had a friends turned lovers spin to it. The plot wasn’t quite as strong as books 1 & 2 with somewhat choppy writing, and a discernible separation between Astrid & Bo’s relationship, and the ghost yacht story line rather than a blended narrative.To an outsider, the Roaring Twenties era appears to be a fun adventure, that is if you’re a white American, however for people like Yeung, it’s anything but. I liked how the author succeeded in capturing the prejudice of this period, and how it added a level of taboo-ness to the love story. Witnessing the general population’s treatment of Bo, and immigrants as a whole, through his eyes as well as via Astrid, someone who cares deeply for him, was humanizing, and I thought that the two characters’ reactions were very genuine.I loved how madly independent both of the protagonists were; Miss Magnusson with her refusal to live in her brothers’ shadow, and Yeung’s unwillingness to accept hand-outs. It was great seeing these two finally take steps towards achieving their happily-ever-after, and strangely it wasn’t their moving reunion that caused me to reach for a tissue, although that too was a close call. Instead, it was Bo’s heart-to-heart with Winter; his second-in-command envisioned the worst when he declared his intentions, but family by choice is no small thing.The artefact decoding facet of this tale was in a lot of ways similar to GRIM SHADOWS; however it wasn’t quite as detailed as Lowe’s novel, or as entertaining. Pirates aboard a ghost yacht sound exciting, and yet the parts didn’t fit as cleanly together as they could have which made Bennett’s last hurrah rather tame in comparison to ROARING TWENTIES # 1 & 2. I wish that the epilogue had been slightly longer, and had encompassed all of the Magnusson clan to a larger extent as opposed to being mostly about Astrid & Bo.GRAVE PHANTOMS was a fitting conclusion to this trilogy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KEHFH106NGS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425280764#wasThisHelpful","R2KEHFH106NGS5","AMCZLPIRP0QTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMCZLPIRP0QTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was drawn to the demon summoning aspect of this series because of its uniqueness within the Paranormal genre, and I also never miss an installment of Diana Rowland's WHITE TRASH ZOMBIES, so I knew that I'd make my way to KARA GILLIAN eventually. This story was way more serious than my previous experiences with this author's writing, but it was extra sexy as well which helped to even it out. At this point in time, I'm picking Ryan over Rhyzkahl, although neither has proven themselves yet, therefore things could go either way on the romance front. I liked Liv Anderson's narration, and have already purchased the second audiobook.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FJR6M61546E0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CXYBE4M#wasThisHelpful","R2FJR6M61546E0","AMCZLPIRP0QTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMCZLPIRP0QTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"IMMUNE was, well, a bit of a mess. After a respectable series debut, Shannon Mayer trades in her Urban Fantasy hat for a Paranormal Romance one which resulted in a pretty drastic u-turn that I didn’t particularly care for. Rylee/O’Shea’s relationship skipped every step in-between “hi, how are ya” and “I love you”, and you don’t get much more instant than that. But, then Liam isn’t in book 3 AT ALL if the blurb is to be believed, not to mention that the author is also going in questionable directions with a few of her characters. I just don’t know.Adamson’s snarky tough girl attitude has started to surface which was exactly what I was hoping for. It’s too bad that it didn’t carry over to her dialogue with O’Shea; whether I continue this series or not will most likely come down to if Mayer decides to focus primarily on Rylee’s angsty romance with the FBI Agent, or on her cutthroat Tracker side. I’m all for option 2 in case I haven’t made that clear yet. Adamson was also very reckless in this novel which put my ‘established heroine’ remark from my PRICELESS review into doubt.I hate Milly, I really do. Every protagonist needs a BFF / sidekick / ally, so I don’t get why the author destroyed their friendship in the first installment, and then continued to kick it while it was down in this one. It’s going to take A LOT for me to care about the witch. Why make that much work for yourself? Unless she’s disposable… I wasn’t ecstatic about what happened to O’Shea towards the end of this story either. It was yet another extreme approach to something that should have developed over multiple books, or not at all for that matter.The best parts of this novel were the interactions between O’Shea & Alex; they are fighting for dominance within Rylee’s ‘pack’—one is human, and doesn’t have two clues about the on-going power struggle, and the other is a submissive werewolf who doesn’t have an Alpha bone in his body. It made for some entertaining mix-ups! The Kindle edition came with a cool character reference feature that was useful in identifying who’s who, and the plot itself was ok too with its triple threat. It’s unfortunate that it was overshadowed by main couple drama, and unstable secondaries.IMMUNE was a far cry from book 1. It all comes down to RAISING INNOCENCE. ~3.5 Stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OVDH43BKAOS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPD5BY6#wasThisHelpful","R2OVDH43BKAOS0","AMCZLPIRP0QTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMCZLPIRP0QTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"COLD BURN OF MAGIC’s heroine is a younger, more reckless, less tested version of Gin Blanco, so right away I felt at home in Jennifer Estep’s BLACK BLADE series. Lila Merriweather has two Talents, one of which she keeps on the DL and she has sworn to avenge her mom’s murder—ring any bells? That mostly sums up the correlations between this world, and ELEMENTAL ASSASSIN; as a body guard the protagonist protects rather than kills, although sometimes the latter happens as a result of the former, her back story is an open book, and the antagonist is immediately apparent. This novel blended the top elements from this author’s Young Adult & Urban Fantasy titles into a smashing debut.As much as I love meeting new characters, and immersing myself in an original plot, world-building still trumps all. First installments are usually where the bulk of a series’ foundation is located, and this book was no different. Estep left me giddy with delight as I wormed my way through her symbology, magicks, and monsters. Getting a feel for the Families, especially the Draconis & the Sinclairs was a close second with the romance trailing as a distant third, but that wasn’t unexpected, and quite frankly I prefer it that way.In Urban Fantasy, whether we’re talking adult or YA, it’s pivotal that the lead be easy to connect with, and Lila filled that requirement well. A lot of info gets thrown readers’ way with regards to her past, current motivations, and future goals, but as important as all that info is, she was also incredibly likeable which ensured that she was fleshed out in all of the right places. Her POV had a degree of maturity to it that Estep’s MYTHOS ACADEMY novels lacked to a certain extent, so it only took me a split second to decide that BLACK BLADE was going on my keeper shelf.In addition to an inviting universe, and an agreeable heroine, this author’s food fetish was ever-present, as was her knack for creating standout secondary characters. Mo reminded me of Fletcher, but with his own unique personality twists, and Devon didn’t exactly cause me to insta-drool, although he’s off to a pretty good start as far as love interests go. I need more deets before I can pass judgment on Felix as BFF material, and Claudia could go either way at this point. The clear winner was Oscar: the honeybeer guzzling, redneck, cowboy, pixie. Hehe! Need I say more?Jennifer Estep knows what her readers want, and delivers it with COLD BURN OF MAGIC. Brilliant!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EM600DHCUPOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4ASUO2#wasThisHelpful","R3EM600DHCUPOO","AMCZLPIRP0QTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMCZLPIRP0QTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been enjoying this series thus far, but this installment really brought it! The porn star murder mystery had barrel-of-laughs written all over it, doubly so with Harry Dresden on the case. BLOOD RITES put a lot of the characters' roles into perspective; Murphy tries being a vigilante on for size, Ebenezar is not what he seems, and Thomas—I did NOT see that one coming. This book was a turning point for THE DRESDEN FILES, and... PUPPIES!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QVK4U13B1690/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003CN7DQ6#wasThisHelpful","R1QVK4U13B1690","AMCZLPIRP0QTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMCZLPIRP0QTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After listening to this installment, I now realize why the last few titles have made me cranky. It’s because I’ve been waiting for Garreth’s story since book 1, and the delay finally caught up with me. This series came highly recommended on account of its “sexy Scottish werewolves”, but they’ve been mostly MIA since WICKED DEEDS ON A WINTER’S NIGHT, so the younger MacRieve’s romance was long overdue. All is right with the world again.In PLEASURE OF A DARK PRINCE readers get answers to many long running questions which was perfect timing as far as I was concerned because it revived my interest in the IMMORTALS AFTER DARK series. This book covers from pre-A HUNGER LIKE NO OTHER, to Garreth’s year long pursuit of Lucia, so it was an excellent overview of where Kresley Cole has been, and her intended direction going forward, although I’m quite positive that Nix will have the last word.Valkyries and I haven’t exactly seen eye-to-eye in the past; however I’m slowly coming around to this author’s version. Lucia stood out because of her born-again-virginity—the celibate immortal queen should be discarded from IAD’s deck, just saying—and her reputation as The Archer. Garreth was awesome, and I loved the advice that his brother and Bowen kept giving him. They’ve both claimed their mates which gave them unique (amusing) perspectives.Just when I thought that I had gotten my legs back under me (Robert Petkoff’s narration will do that to you), he goes and whips out a… Texan accent! Oh, and don’t forget that his brogue was also widespread with MacRieve as the male protagonist. This installment reminded me of the earlier IAD audiobooks, the ones that I chain listened to in under a month, so I’m taking it as a sign that a second likewise spree might be around the corner.PLEASURE OF A DARK PRINCE was the werewolf that I was looking for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UTLG5G8QUDV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHTV5NO#wasThisHelpful","R2UTLG5G8QUDV2","AMCZLPIRP0QTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMCZLPIRP0QTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Chick with a sword on the cover. 'A werewolf sidekick. 'A $0.99 price tag. 'By a Canadian author—SOLD. One of my favourite Urban Fantasy series was discovered the same way, so I decided to go for it. PRICELESS did not disappoint with its colourful secondary characters, unique slant on the typical P.I. spiel, and a heroine with boatloads of untapped gifts. I enjoyed my first trip down Shannon Mayer’s (rabbit hole) mine shaft, and I will for sure be one-clicking IMMUNE in the near future (YAY! It’s on sale too).This novel had several paranormal elements that I’ve seen before such as the Tracker talent, and an Arcane division within the FBI angle, along with a few new-to-me spins including creative shifter limitations, and Rylee’s Immune ability. The author straight away sets to work weaving together an attractive tale of supes, magical rules, and plot threads. This was definitely a lively book, but the heavy influx of information, and extensive cast debuts were a good fit for the pacing, and added to this story’s curve appeal.Rylee was my kind of heroine, in that she already has a knack for blades, hockey player fight moves, and has been developing her powers for several years. I love a burgeoning protagonist, but sometimes it’s a relief to walk into a series with a lead that’s already got their sh*t together. No doubt, Adamson still has much to learn, however she has a sturdy foundation to build upon, so it will be interesting to see how her personality, and skill level evolves from here. I’m hoping that Mayer will rev up the humour as the installments get further along too.Every strong female protagonist needs an able-bodied man to back her up, and although O’Shea didn’t immediately fit those shoes, his character growth began shortly after his first entrance, and didn’t let-up until the cliff hanger ending. He has charm; I’ll give him that, with his excited grins over finding himself knee deep in otherworldly chaos, and his foresight to practice swordsmanship. Alex was a hit with his Golden Retriever-esque qualities, and flair for lightening up even the most deadly situation. Adversely, Milly has some atoning to do.PRICELESS was (hopefully) the start of a beautiful RYLEE ADAMSON relationship.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AWFCUAT8DIDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A6CNV08#wasThisHelpful","R2AWFCUAT8DIDW","AMCZLPIRP0QTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMCZLPIRP0QTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was informed by many a reader that this series found its legs in book 3, and there was even an intro from Jim Butcher to that effect. It's true! I loved this one to pieces! Many of the secondary characters came out of the woodwork in a big way, and a few new ones were added to the cast as well. I enjoyed the humour a lot more this time around, the multiple plot threads kept me engaged, and the main story arc is just getting started. Harry really defined himself as a protagonist in this installment by making some tough calls, demonstrating that he can throw down in a pinch, and his relationship with Susan takes several unexpected turns. James Marster's narration has been steadily improving with each novel, and I look forward to tagging along with him, Butcher & Dresden for SUMMER KNIGHT.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QMN7YAPJGNEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CSL0CK#wasThisHelpful","R3QMN7YAPJGNEF","AMCZLPIRP0QTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMCZLPIRP0QTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a long-standing fan of Rachel Vincent's SHIFTERS series, I was through the roof with enthusiasm when I discovered this spin-off five years later. I recommend reading the prequel / bridge novella, HUNT, prior to this one because it sets the tone for LION'S SHARE, and its events are referenced throughout this story. As fired up as I was about WILDCATS book 1, the author's switch from Urban Fantasy to New Adult Paranormal Romance did worry me, and my trepidations turned out to not be entirely false because I did in fact have issues with the heroine's foolhardiness, Jace's backsliding, the questionable set-up for subsequent installments, and... RANT TIME!The world-building and recap aspects fell a bit short in my opinion; fortunately I already had all of the essentials given my existing familiarity with the other novels, however if you opted to skip the five originals you might be left scratching your head for a bit. Same thing goes for the reappearance of a handful of the previous series' characters; without former knowledge, you may find yourself wondering who some of them are, and won't be immediately starstruck by Jace Hammond. Neither were a problem for me, yet I felt that it was worth the mention for newcomers who are considering using this title as a primer to Vincent's SHIFTERS.I gave Abby way more chances than I would have a normal heroine given her age, and everything that she's been through in her short life. Her secret and refusal to confide in anyone including readers drove me up the wall, and made following her POV a hair pulling experience. I think a little extra insight would have helped make her more likable, and by the time the big reveal rolled around I'd already reached a similar conclusion, so the twist wasn't an uber shocker anyway, and the trade-off was an obnoxious female protagonist. The author chose an extreme approach instead of a happy middle which permanently damaged Abby's character in my eyes. I mean, after all of the lengths she goes to in order to protect Robyn, only to hand her over to the very people she was hiding her from after a rushed explanation, and then hightail it to the free zone. She undermined all of her earlier actions in one fell swoop.My first thought when I saw this book's blurb was that it was about time that Jace got his HEA. He's been Alpha for 4 1/2 years now, held his territory against numerous threats, and earned the respect of his enforcers. Based on this, I expected a man, but what I got was a child. You'd think that he'd want to avoid a Faythe-type repeat at all costs, yet his resistance caved faster than a house of cards; all of his discipline and hard work went the way of the dodo because of a red-haired tabby. I was annoyed by how quickly he lost control of the situation, and quite frankly he deserved every bit of the council's harsh sentence. This novel destroyed my previously high view of Hammond and did little to convince me of WILDCATS' shelf life.I can't help but wonder how the author is going to make a romance series out of strays given the rarity of female cats. And, after this, I'm not sure that I care. To paraphrase Rachel Vincent: ""nothing that felt this good could ever be wrong..."" (Loc 1896) except where LION'S SHARE was concerned.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BQMDXQHWMW6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SG7NSTO#wasThisHelpful","R1BQMDXQHWMW6P","AMCZLPIRP0QTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMCZLPIRP0QTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been procrastinating listening to this audiobook since November, but when Valentine's Day rolled around I decided that I was due for a guilty pleasure kind of title, and nothing fit the bill quite like Gideon & Ava Cross. I was also excited that this series FINALLY added a second narrator. As much as I've been enjoying Jill Redfield's performance, certain characters need that extra edge that only a male voice can bring, and I was hoping that Jeremy York would be up to the task. I wish that they'd read ALL of their respective personage's dialogues rather than just their specific chapters, but that's a common complaint of mine with dual readings. However, other than that, I had no issues with either of the narrators. My problems were with the lack of advancement on any front. Gideon & Ava are still struggling with the exact same obstacles only different versions of them, the story arc didn't really go anywhere, and the ending left me feeling like the next novel was going to be more of the same.

"I was psyched to be back in the SHIFTERS universe after such a prolonged break. I didn't remember much about Abby's character, but the Faythe & Jace bits were like getting a hug from an old friend. The protagonist's emotion fueled responses to a threatening situation led to some rash decisions which left me screaming at my eReader. Yes, Rachel Vincent managed to get that kind of reaction out of me in only 30-ish pages! I kept expecting Wade to be like Miss Sanders; however it took Faythe five books to become the beloved heroine that she is today, so I'm more than willing to keep an open mind with regards to her potential as the lead in the first installment of this author's WILDCATS spin-off series.

"Kristen Callihan has been 5-for-5 with her DARKEST LONDON series, and I’ve been looking forward to Adam’s story most of all, so when the mailman delivered SOULBOUND the pressure was on. This installment brought with it plenty of new revelations with regards to the Fae, the King of the GIM’s curse, and we finally discover what was plaguing Archer in FIRELIGHT. The writing was as strong as ever, and the author made me weep with her romantic elements, but this book had a degree of predictability to it that the others didn’t which is why Callihan’s perfect rating streak must end here.This world is peppered with paranormal excellence from the mythology to the plethora of otherworldly characters; however only the Ghosts In The Machine have captured my interest to the point of obsession. Spooks are common enough in this genre, but this author’s approach is exceptional, bar none. Adam’s nature has been one of this series’ most closely guarded secrets, and is so intricately linked to the Fae that an examination of one will spoil the other, and both get cracked wide open in this novel, thus expect a deluge of answers, just not from me. Ha!As astounding as all of this book’s epiphanies were, they paled in comparison to the atypical conclusion. Callihan didn’t simply choose the path less traveled, she forged her own, and in doing so completely changed the definition of happily-ever-after. A common complaint of mine where ghost romances are concerned is that there aren’t any easy solutions to unite the couple, and the obvious fix is the one that no reader wants to face. I loved the direction that Adam & Eliza’s story took, although it was partially to blame for this installment’s foreseeable chain of events.Two of DARKEST LONDON’s previously featured heroines are GIM, so a coup on their King meant that this novel’s plot arc was widespread which had its benefits because the better part of this series’ characters got a word or two in. The mystery behind book 1 was solved at long last, and will in all probability carry over to the next title if Sin has anything to do with it, although I wouldn’t mind terribly if Lucien’s tale took precedence, especially after his recent admission. I guess the point I’m trying to make is that wherever this author goes from here, I will follow.SOULBOUND will make you believe in the impossible, there is love after death. 4.5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FBBY7AMTOLKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVK30TC#wasThisHelpful","R3FBBY7AMTOLKT","AMCZLPIRP0QTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMCZLPIRP0QTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The full length books are all about the vampires while as the shorts focus more on Neill's shifters which is the only reason why I read 'em cuz I'm not normally keen on novellas. Whenever Urban Fantasy protagonists take five, you know that something is going to go horribly awry—case in point. This was a cute story about family feuds à la supe with a romantic resolution that was over a century in the making. It didn't really contribute much to the series in terms of plot arc; however readers do get a dose of this author's mountain lions, and learn a bit about what life is like for vampires that live outside of the Houses (i.e. Clans). The Orangesplosion won't win any awards, but I never miss an opportunity to hang with Merit & Ethan, and neither should you if you're pro CHICAGOLAND VAMPIRES. ~ 3.5 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SAEJS1D1BPTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUMIPY8#wasThisHelpful","R1SAEJS1D1BPTX","AMCZLPIRP0QTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMCZLPIRP0QTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story got off to a shaky start, and was largely reminiscent of my college years what with a guy picking a pretty girl up in a bar, luring her back to his place to discuss ‘business’, and then they bump uglies shortly thereafter. It’s a novella, so the author needed to efficiently establish a rapport between the two characters; however Cait & Owen’s connection came off as more one night stand-ish as opposed to ETERNAL MATES. That only lasted a couple of chapters though, and then the plot took over for the better.After this series’ three book long feline shifters centric sprint, I was interested in seeing how Felicity Heaton’s hellcats would distinguish themselves from the pride. That question was soon answered with two tails, a few very special breed quirks, and some hell fire in all the right places. Cait was a fascinating character who speedily won me over to her plight with good old fashioned girl power, and her sword wielding, and decapitation skills appealed to the Urban Fantasy reader in me.Owen was the first mortal hero to make an appearance in the ETERNAL MATES universe which was a nice change of pace; his infamous rep as a hunter gave him sizeable street cred, and that secret of his that’s referenced in the blurb was pretty darned bitchin’. I enjoyed witnessing him work his magic on Cait’s job from vetting sources, to his vast supernatural database, and hunch regarding Marrius’ real motives, although I was disappointed when he started using his little head more than his big one.This story didn’t set out in the direction that I had envisaged, and in turn ended up going above and beyond the ‘get this wackadoo off my tail’ schtick. I eventually bought into Owen & Cait’s relationship after the initial frat boy hook-up wore off, and the sex hit the spot just so long as I didn’t think too hard about how it came to be. The glance at Heaton’s dragons revved me up for the next novel, and I liked that the conclusion made partners out of this duo in more ways than one. Couples that kill together stay together!BITTEN BY A HELLCAT wasn’t purrfect, but sometimes a belly rub is all you need. ~3.5 Stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S0QITUQAEYDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOS5Y0G#wasThisHelpful","R3S0QITUQAEYDE","AMCZLPIRP0QTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMCZLPIRP0QTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We haven't gotten to see much of Alpha Elena, so it was great witnessing her knee deep in her newish role dealing with Pack politics, and the challenges that come with being not only the sole female werewolf, but also one in a leadership position. Kate frustrated me at times with her rebellious attitude, and independent streak; I had to keep reminding myself that she's only eight, and that her behaviour was age appropriate, and entirely understandable given present circumstances. All of my favourite furry Otherworld characters were out in full force, including the latest additions to the North American Pack as well as the current candidates. The twists involving the twins were totally squee-worthy, and this series' Big Bad tables a proposition that will leave me on edge until the next short is announced.

"An eye-opener into what the Otherworld would have been like had the supes made their existence known to humans. Like most Dystopians, Armstrong's post-apocalyptic universe isn't a pretty one; Rayne & Braeden hatch a plan to escape the fortress only readers aren't privy to it until events are already in motion. I enjoyed how dark this short was and that for once the ""devil you know"" motto didn't hold true.

"This wasn't your typical Ilona Andrews audiobook in that the magic system existed on a much smaller scale with it being confined to inns, but that's not to say that the world-building was by any means limited. In fact, if anything, it was larger than any of this author duo's other titles because the INNKEEPER CHRONICLES was closer to being Science Fiction than it was Urban Fantasy given that the characters originate from multiple planets. The wheel wasn't reinvented with regards to the typical paranormal beasties such as vampires & werewolves, although they did have several distinguishing traits that set them apart from other novels in this genre. Much to my dismay, a love triangle seems to be developing; however if any team is capable of making it work, it's Ilona & Gordon. The humor and writing were aces, no surprises there, and Renée Raudman's narration gave the story that extra somethin'-somethin' that keeps me choosing audio over eBook every time this trio releases something new.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LR9QXFPTD4IH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IT2MNS8#wasThisHelpful","R1LR9QXFPTD4IH","AMCZLPIRP0QTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMCZLPIRP0QTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have had this for less than a week, so if things change I will update this review at that time.Connection to my wi-fi was a challenge.  It uses ""Blink"" which essentially has your phone flash a light quickly to ""program"" the device so it taps into your home Wi-Fi--this is NOT recommended for people with epileptic issues.  My android cell phone just flat didn't work.  The directions recommend using apple products, of which I had none.  I then downloaded the app into my Kindle fire (more out of desperation than anything else) and placed my fire about 1.5"" above the little light sensor (bottom left) and it took the first time.  Go figure.  BTW, the darker the environment, the better it works.  The directions say you can take the man part of the controller box off (not mounted to the wall) and inside the house to a dark room if you need to.Once ""installed"" I then used the app to identify and program my various sprinklers.  There were several options--type of sprinkler (""shooter"" or ""sprayer""); type of dirt/clay; type of vegetation (grass, bushes, etc.), type of slope.  You can name the zones something like ""front left"" instead of ""Zone 1"", which is helpful.  I found the default times double that of what I am currently using, so I cut them back to what I am currently using.  The device claims to compensate for these variables (I have clay soil), so for example it will adjust the watering cycle for more efficient watering of the clay--a burst, then rest, then a burst, etc.  Time will tell if these are the correct settings, but so far my yard is looking pretty good!The fact that it knows where I live (by zip code) and I picked up the external water sensor means no more watering in the rain!

I pull it out as far as I need then work away.  When I move and it starts getting heavy, then I stop and pull a bunch of the hose to my work area and continue.  I have used it to spray weed-killer on my yard; pressure wash my house and several other home owner chores.

"These hold my lenses very nicely.  My largest lens is a 300mm, which fit nicely in the 3rd largest pouch.  I ended up not needing the largest pouch.  My hip pack has places for water bottles, or I might use it for one--shoot, I still may as it is somewhat insulated! I attached these to my hip pack for easy access while walking around (strapping through the belt loop).  The only one I had difficulties with was the smallest one.  The area to run the strap through was less than 1"", due to stabilization stitching about 1"" from each end of the pouch.  Fortunately, my hip pack had a narrow strap to secure the water bottles, so I was able to use that for it (otherwise it would NOT go through the waist strap as the others did).  I was somewhat panicking until I figured this out.  The 2nd largest was close, but with some wiggling, it made it.  The 3rd, not a problem--plenty of clearance.I found the easiest way to include the lens hood was to insert it in sideways.  Once past the opening, then rotate it around flat so it ""cups"" the lens.

"I purchased this with a four pack of neoprene pouches for my camera lenses.  Mainly because my shoulder bag was getting hard on my shoulder for my longer hikes when I wanted to bring my camera.  I was using something similar that didn't have water-bottle capability.  This pack has 3 compartments--the first plenty large for wallet, cell phone, keys, sun screen, etc. that I normally would have in my purse.  The middle compartment is large enough for extra batteries, a few lenses and other odds and ends I generally carry in my camera bag.  The third, outer (smallest) compartment is very flat and works well for the camera cable to computer, and a couple of other thin things (I just like to keep stuff together--really stupid to drag this junk around for longer hikes).  The two water container areas are roomy, and could double as a lens holder while switching lenses.  They also have straps so you can really secure your bottles!  This pack secures nicely to my hips, however the belt is over a foot too long (I will eventually cut this down and hem it)--but this is great for you that are a bit more generous in the hips!  It is lightly padded around the waist.  My initial wear-around-the-house test for about 15 minutes (fully loaded) was successful, I barely noticed it.  Longer hikes, with more stuff and you may want to pad it up more.  I think the weight of the lenses in front did somewhat off set the weight of the stuff over my hind end.  The biggest advantage of this system, is everything is carried on my waist, leaving my arms free to fiddle with my camera and help with my balance on steeper trails.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YIFBYB8B1N55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BJU3NE#wasThisHelpful","R1YIFBYB8B1N55","AKCDHGUSKVJ72","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKCDHGUSKVJ72?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to put in my regular purse.  I am not sure if it's a system or not, it has some snaps near the top that make it look like it might be.  I thought it would help keep things organized.  It does, but there is no structure to it.  The sides (especially the long ones) just kind of flop down.  I can find my chap stick and other small items tucked into the pockets by flipping the sides over until I locate them.  If the sides were as rigid as the picture seems to show, I'd be extremely happy with this.

"Extra long and strong design with a cutout for the drain.  Make sure you align it with the back end of the tub before walking on it or the drain will be obscured- there is less leeway than with cheaper models, but then more protection. Good for parents of young children who want to maximize cushioning, for the elderly and for anyone else!  Translucent with large suction cups, holds fast. Machine washable and allergen free. Wash it frequently to avoid mold, as for all bath mats (even those with the chemically suspect mildew proof additives.)

"Maria was perhaps the most compelling character on Sesame Street, a thoughtful, loving and street smart character who played the role for 44 years. It was not easy for Sonia Manzaro who plaed Maria to grow up, become an actor and a writer who was able to audition for the role and inhabit it with her experience.  Sonia Manzaro grew up in a poor Puerto Rican family with an alcoholic father who became abusive when drunk.  Her mother told horror tales of her life in Puerto Rico so Sonia felt relief at growing up in the Bronx.  She overlooked many of the tribulations, but decided early on that she wanted to be an actor from an early age and prevailed against discouragement.The early part of the book captures the details of growing up poor and Puerto Rican in the Bronx in a loving but dysfunctional family.  It shows how a poor start in educational quality hampers her in later years as she works on obtaining the skills and contacts needed to become a good actor. She eventually prevails but you can see why she started with a rocky foundation.  Well written and insightful, but I was a bit disappointed that the book ended with her audition for Sesame Street,  . I hope a sequel is in the making because I'd like to see how her life affected the role she plaed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MVWUDIP3H3VX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545621844#wasThisHelpful","R3MVWUDIP3H3VX","A100ZQDV7L8PVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100ZQDV7L8PVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Isabelle and Giselle were born with hands held and their fingers had to be untwined.  It was much harder for teenaged Giselle to untwine herself from her dead sister.

"The Twin Star space heater is small but powerful.  I don't think it will heat up a 400 sq ft room but it does a decent job on my 250 sq ft treatment room.  It has a fan-only function which is good for hot days in the transitional seasons.  It does NOT tilt as described, but it is small and lightweight enough to move the entire unit into the direction you want it.  There is an automatic shutoff if it turns over to prevent fires which I find useful because this last cold winter my cat sat in front of our space heater and sometimes knocked it over.It may be the automatic shut-off which is responsible for  the major problem with the unit.  When it reaches the desired heat the unit irrevocably turns off.  It may need a reset- unplugging the unit and letting it cool off works and there is a reset button on the bottom. The workaround is to set the thermostat on less than maximum heat and to set the unit on something that permits air circulation under the unit- a wire shelf for instance.  I had a similar problem with my laptop so bought press-on furniture glides to act as legs. That might not be enough for an appliance designed to provide heat but the principle is the same.  Otherwise I like the unit.One word about the color:  it is very intense green, might do best in a 60s modern decor. My room is done in lime and hunter green and it stands out.

"Most of us are deficient in magnesium, a necessary mineral used in some 350 biologlcal reactions.  Between the mid 1970s when the USDA put out its book, The Nutritional Content of Food and the separate update reports it issued in the mid 1990s, the magnesium content fell by a third and it is estimated that industrial farming which strip mines the soil has reduced it to less than 50% today.Between 68-80% of Americans are deficient in magnesium. Low magnesium is associated with low Vitamin D as magnesium is necessary for its transport molecules/  Supplementing with calcium can deplete magnesium and magnesium can be used instead of calcium (usually common in the diet) for osteoporosis.  Deficiency is associated with depression, constipation, diabetes, muscle spasms and insomnia.. I like the time release feature which eliminates loose stools from magnesium consumption. However many people need the laxative effect, so choose accordingly and don't be afraid to mix and match, especially because magnesium is poorly absorbed.

"Vita Sackville West was one of the more interesting women of her generation, as much for her non-monogamous bisexual lifestyle as for her considerable writing.  Dennison has done considerable research on her sexual life but gives short shrift to her literary output.  Sackville West did not consider herself a great writer - she reserved that for her lover Virginia Wolf - but she was a good writer and influential for her time.  The book is lively and well-written but Sackville-West comes across as reduced to a rather intriguing soap opera character.

"Large enough to be a people blanket for bug-free concerts in the park, this blanket is tightly bound with a proprietary permethrin formula to fabric.  The permethrin is a man-made compound identical to that found in chrysanthemums and has been used in a variety of products for human children and pets since 1977. Permethrin was tested on head lice for pregnant women in the 1970s and 4% creams which could be absorbed through the skin were found to be safe.  I believe it is safer than topical DEET, and certainly Lyme disease from the ticks it repels (not to mention mosquitoes, ants, flies, fleas, chiggers and midges and whatever they might transmit.) Permethrin oil is not safe for cats or cold blooded animals so keep your cats, snakes and lizards off of it. I tend to doubt that the embedded and bonded permethrin is actually dangerous to cats, (unless, possibly you soaked the blanket in oil and made the cat lick it,) My cat evinced not the least bit of interest in it although she is fond of small blankets,  Protection lasts through 50 washings which is the life of the fabric and has been found effective after 10 years storage. Dry cleaning would reduce the life of the protection, although that isn't the way most would treat it. This kind of fabric is also made into repellent garments for hikers.The picture looks like it is thick and padded,  It is not,  The fabric is thin microfiber and probably not water proof, but otherwise would work as a picnic blanket or something to store in your bug out bag,  There is no odor,  The color could be seen for some distance so it could double as a safety blanket for hikers","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROVCF1M9BR78U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T06QQSU#wasThisHelpful","ROVCF1M9BR78U","A100ZQDV7L8PVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100ZQDV7L8PVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Several years ago I read The Radioactive Boy Scout,( http://www.amazon.com/The-Radioactive-Boy-Scout-Backyard/dp/037550351X) about David Hahn, a boy who was so fascinated by atomic energy that he developed a reactor in his backyard shed and contaminated his neighborhood.  Young Taylor Wilson read that book too and decided to become the responsible radioactive boy scout.  His parents and grandmother who were less informed on nuclear energy found knowledgeable adults to mentor him, school him in safety (or to confirm that he was taking proper precautions to keep himself  and his environment safe) and provided internet and a garage to work in. By age 11 he had made yellowcake. The death of his grandmother whose cancer had been treated by nuclear medicine impelled him to invent a small reactor which could provide on-site isotopes to make the treatment window of a volatile substance longer.  For school vacations his parents brought him to old uranium mines in Nevada, to used nuclear equipment stores and to Oak Ridge, Tennessee where he made appointments with high level scientists who had no idea he was only 11, and brought him to industry suppliers where he got reduced price high level vacuum pumps and other technical equipment.  With a move to Nevada where the Davidson school for gifted children hooked him up with the University of Nevada at Reno's physics department which provided him with lab space and mentorship.  He developed a working fusion reactor, a ""star in a jar"" by age 14.  Since then he has worked with the Department of Homeland Security to develop low cost nuclear material detection devices and he has developed prototype designs for small nuclear fission reactors that will run on spent fuel rods (a disposal problem turned into an opportunity) and will only need new fuel every 30 years.The book is as much about how to raise and educate a gifted kid as it is an extraordinary biography. Most gifted kids lose interest- they are given more things to do since they work faster but not more challenging work, Many drop out or fail to develop their gifts in a way that can benefit society.  Taylor was lucky to have parents who got out of his way when he wanted to learn obsessively about nuclear energy and provided him the support and mentoring needed at great cost to themselves.  But while he thrived in a school made up of gifted kids and knowledgeable adults, his no less gifted but shy brother needed the social stability of their Arkansas hometown to thrive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R361E35IKUASTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544085116#wasThisHelpful","R361E35IKUASTI","A100ZQDV7L8PVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100ZQDV7L8PVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ramineh Andalibian's memoir tells of the loss of what appeared an idyllic existence in pre-Revolutionary Iran, the disillusionment of revolutionary change, the costs of secrecy and the high costs of immigration on family life.  Vivid and compellingly written, Ramirah comes from a conservative family who ran a successful hotel near a pilgrimage hotel, with no music, no alcohol and no dancing.  During the conflict two thugs who rape  an older woman are stashed in the largely empty hotel until functioning courts of law can be re-established.  They feign repentance which appeals to her religious Baba, but  instead implicate her 16 year old brother in a murder for which he is clandestinely executed by the new revolutionary justice system.  This is not conveyed to his brothers and sisters who are told he is studying abroad but has a corrosive effect on family well-being.  Immigration comes with significant separation, suffering and financial loss.  It upsets the self-image of every child where turbulent adolescence and apparent assaults on traditional Persian Muslim values threaten to break the strong family ties.  Well-written and compelling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O2YF5J8RFLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426214790#wasThisHelpful","R1O2YF5J8RFLE","A100ZQDV7L8PVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100ZQDV7L8PVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My wife and I had already purchased both the Dreambaby Gate and the Lascal KiddyGuard Accent gate and needed a 3rd gate for the top of the stairs.My experience with the Accent model (it's a lower end version of the Lascal gate) was that it was not substantially better than the Dreambaby gate to justify the much higher price, but my wife preferred its operation so we got the wider Lascal Avant and I installed it at the top of the stairs.Installation wise, the Avant gate is just as much of a headache to install as the smaller Accent gate.  The locking strip is a continuous piece of plastic that needs to be anchored firmly to a wall or other object.  Lascal offers bannister installation kits but they are truly horrible (will need to review those separately) so most customers are probably going to have to figure out their own workaround.For me, my wife did not want to tear moulding off of the bannister and screw the locking strip in so I needed another solution.  I bought a 1"" square dowel rod from a hardware store and cut it down to the same height as the locking strip and then screwed the locking strip onto the dowel rod.  Next I used a dremel to cut away material so that the dowel rod could go directly onto the bannister around the moulding trim.  Final step was to drill holes in the dowel rod and use heavy gauge wire ties to wrap the whole thing around the bannister.  It's not super attractive but it does work.For the gate side I mounted the bottom clip to the base board moulding as low as I could towards the floor (pushing down on carpet while doing it).  I then cut a section from a 1x2 plank, anchored that into the wall and then screwed the gate with top bracket into it.All in all installing these is more of a pain than it should be.  Apparently the Lascal is a European product and they don't have problems with decorative moulding, base boards, skirting on bannisters, etc.  If they want to sell the product in the U.S. market they should modify their product to make installation easier for the typical homeowner here.As to the gate itself, it operates like the shorter Accent gate with a key difference.  The Avant gate makes use of a ""timer"" for the gate unlock/retract knob that allows much easier one hand operation.  You twist the knob and have a corresponding amount of time to move the gate around... when the timer expires the gate is locked.I do think that the visual indication they have (a tiny red circle that pops up slightly when the gate is unlocked) is not clear enough and could be improved so it was even more obvious if the gate is locked or not.Because of the timer function it is much easier to operate the gate one handed, and that is what bumps it up for me from 3 to 4 stars.  It is still worth pointing out that the gate doesn't pose much of a barrier to anything (or any little people) trying to get UNDER the gate as, even when installed as low as possible a small child or pet can slip underneath it.The rule of thumb for making sure barriers are sized properly for crawling infants is whether or not a softball can fit through and that's not a problem for the underside of this gate... which is probably why all of the advertisements for it show older children being contained by this gate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RADNYPSMO3R9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007D1NTN4#wasThisHelpful","RADNYPSMO3R9Y","AEOCEVUWO5B7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEOCEVUWO5B7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I recently purchased the Dreambaby retractable gate as well as the Lascal Accent gate and I will attempt to compare the two.Dreambaby gate is easier to install than the Lascal gate since the locking strip on the Lascal gate is a continuous piece of plastic where-as the Dreambaby gate comes with templates and just uses a couple of hooks to retain the gate when you put it into use.Dreambaby gate also is easier for me personally to operate than the Lascal Accent since it has a cutaway for your hand which makes operating it from either side of the barrier pretty simple.Now as to the negatives on the Dreambaby Gate, there are several.  The most serious one to me is that it is easy to deploy the gate and not have it fully engaged.  I always have to check after putting the gate out that it has really started retracting and that the gate is going to do its job.Another drawback is that the knob that you rotate to engage or disengage the gate is kind of flimsy and there's no positive feedback that lets you know you've engaged the gate release.  Sometimes I will twist the knob and realize it's not engaged and have to do it one or two more times.  This is annoying.Another disadvantage is that it is a very basic looking gate.  There is no cartridge that retains the gate reel so it's just out in the open ready for something to bump into it and damage it when the gate is not being used.The biggest problem though that affects all of the retractable gates (Lascal included) is that even if you mount this flush with the floor/carpet there's a good 3-4 inches of room underneath the gate for an object to move through.  Absolutely an intrepid youngster (especially small baby or toddler) could figure out how to crawl under the gate, defeating it.I would strongly recommend that if someone uses one of these in an area such as at the top of the stairs (we put this gate at the top of our basement steps) don't leave the child completely unattended with just this gate in place.... especially not if you haven't seen what they will try to do while exploring what is possible with the gate.I view this gate as simply a barrier in case my son is playing around and gets into the area with the stairs to avoid any instantaneous mishaps.  I would not leave him at the top of the stairs with this gate unattended especially since I know he could fit under the ""gate"" if he really wanted to.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34EA25PMP79R1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002R2BFVM#wasThisHelpful","R34EA25PMP79R1","AEOCEVUWO5B7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEOCEVUWO5B7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have seen some mixed reviews of this set, but wanted to comment as I have now built two sets of shelves with two different kits.  One kit came as part of a workbench set and sat neglected for almost a year before I finally put it together.When I looked at the kit the biggest thing that I didn't like was the cheap screws it came with.  I spent about $8 at the local hardware big-box store on a box of 100 torx construction screws that included a couple of bits.I was then able to assemble this shelf set, including cutting in about one hour.  I did not follow the directions.  In a nutshell what I did was assemble the top level of the shelves (and using the better quality fasteners I was able to use my Makita driver to just drive the screws directly with no pre-drilling), then flip it over, place the four support beams, then slide the other shelves on, flip the whole thing around, get everything leveled and then do the final fastening.Final tip is that when cutting the final pieces for the middle shelves you want to try to cut them so that they are tight.  You should need to gently tap them in with a mallet.  I also recommend for maximum stability to anchor this to a wall.  It is pretty easy to do with about $5 of corner braces from your local big box store.In my case I liked the results I got with the first one enough to buy a 2nd one for another shelving need in my basement.  The mistake I made with shelf number 2 is that I assembled it using the included fasteners, which are junk. I ended up splitting some wood by not pre-drilling the holes and the time it takes to pre-drill everything is a huge waste of time vs just shelling out a few bucks for quality construction screws that require no pre-drillling.  If they included decent self-tapping screws and some corner braces at the same or slightly higher price this would get 5 stars from me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K8NWJP4J1RTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030T1BGK#wasThisHelpful","R1K8NWJP4J1RTO","AEOCEVUWO5B7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEOCEVUWO5B7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have not used the crimping die but have gotten great results with the sizing die and the loading die.  I have loaded up about 500 rounds of 300 BLK in a variety of cartridge configurations with this die with no surprises.  It is also handy for removing the primers from spent cartridge cases using the resizing die, just make sure to give the cartridges a bit of lube first so they don't stick and possibly damage the resizing die.This really offers a good value, good enough that I bought a spare to throw in my ""just in case"" box of reloading equipment in case a part from this set eventually got damaged and I needed a replacement.

"I was pretty excited to try this out after having read a lot of reviews on grill cleaning products.  When the product arrived I was a bit alarmed to see that they very boldly say on the box that this is only recommended for ""newer"" grill grates that are less than one year old.  This is pretty disappointing.  How many people feel they need to go and purchase an expensive grill cleaning kit for their grates after just a year of use?  The typical person will be buying this to keep grates that are a few years old and now need some extra attention.In any event I followed the directions and loaded the kit up with the grates (stainless steel) from my huge Weber Summit grill as well as some of the dirtier flavorizer bars (the bars that go over the burners).I rotated everything around so all of it got washed throughout the day in the solution.While the bag is pretty tough, the grates still managed to poke holes in a couple of spots which left me with a bit of a mess to clean up when it was time to remove the grates.  The cleaning material is not toxic so there is no reason you can't do this part over your lawn, etc.When I removed the grates some areas were pretty clean and I was a bit wowed.  Other areas were still quite dirty and even after heavy scrubbing with a wire brush I could not get them completely clean.The flavorizer bars were pretty much wasted with this kit as it did nearly nothing for them.All in all I don't feel that this did a much better job than I could have gotten by putting the grates in a trash bag and throwing a gallon or two of a citrus based degreaser in for several hours.  The biggest beef I have is that there is not nearly enough solution provided in this very expensive kit to clean the grates on a larger sized grill like my Summit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R90MGWJUOMY39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Z8WKNU#wasThisHelpful","R90MGWJUOMY39","AEOCEVUWO5B7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEOCEVUWO5B7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I actually picked this pack up at an Arc'teryx outlet store in Castle Rock Colorado.  I had been looking for the very well reviewed Arc'teryx Altra 65 which they did not carry, but they did have the Altra 50 pack and for an incredible price (about $140 plus tax).I did a quick test fit of the pack in the store and then purchased it with the intention of giving it a full rundown at home.... I'm glad I did the home rundown before removing the tags from the pack as I ultimately returned it.First off, construction quality of this pack appears to be quite good.  The stitching and material construction, as well as materials selected appears to be every bit as good as one would expect from an Arcteryx product.The pack has a pretty innovative feature in which the pack is a top loader but the contents of the main compartment can be accessed from one of two side zippers which means that if you load your pack smartly you can access smaller individual items without having to root through the contents of your pack.  This feature as well as the construction quality is what kept this bag from being a one star product.The shoulder straps and hip belt of this pack are the biggest disappointments.  The shoulder straps are very narrow and lack adjustability... they also have minimal padding.  Totally unacceptable in a pack that should be able to comfortably tote 25-40 lb loads.  Similarly the hip belt is narrow and not adjustable and also quite thin.  I was disappointed (and had not noticed in the store) to discover at home that the hip belt has no pockets.  Instead the pack has a couple of wingman pockets on the sides that are extremely difficult to access while wearing the pack.I loaded the pack with the roughly 20 lbs of gear I would take for a 2-3 night trip and found that I could not get the pack as comfortable as even a 3 year old REI brand pack (which ironically had better shoulder straps and hip belt than this brand new high end Arcteryx pack).  It also doesn't help that the pack lacks a dedicated storage system for a sleeping bag.  You can either wedge your sleeping bag in between the adjustable straps between the pack brain and the pack body or else just stuff it into the main compartment.  Disappointing for a nearly $300 MSRP pack.  The pack does make use of the high end composite C2 construction for the back material (vs a traditional semi-rigid frame) but without the high quality shoulder straps and pivoting hip belt to support it the C2 becomes more of a weight saver and marketing feature... it is definitely not a back saver because it does not make moderate weight loads comfortable to carry when it is mated to a low end shoulder/hip belt setup.The final straw and ultimate deal breaker for me with this pack is that the water reservoir pocket, while thoughtfully located to allow refilling without opening the main pack body was undersized.  I was unsuccessful at stuffing a 3 liter water bladder into the compartment although a 2 liter would fit fine.  There is also no dedicated hydration port for the water tube, instead there are two zippers for the compartment so that the user can zip them and guide the water tube into the desired position... that's not a bad idea but zippers inevitably move around and open up, so this hiker thinks a dedicated hydration port would have been an improvement.All in all this is a fair pack that primarily owes its fame to being very lightweight at only about 3.5 lbs.  However, the new Osprey Atmos AG packs are only marginally heavier, have a much better suspension and load bearing system and offer some really innovative features such as a dedicated sleeping bag compartment, trekking pole shoulder strap clips, etc.The Arcteryx pack just can't cut it against the competition in this segment.  Instead of taking the hugely successful Altra 65 and downsizing it slightly and offering it for a slightly lower price, Arcteryx have made a budget pack that bears none of the Altra 65 revolutionary features, slapped a $289 MSRP on it and hope that their brand name and the light weight of the pack will be enough to sell it to consumers.If you want a light weight pack with minimal organizational capabilities, do yourself a favor and get a better designed 35 liter pack.  If you really need the space of a 50 liter pack for multi night hikes then do some research and get one of the several other brand packs out there that offer way more bang for the buck than this pack.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NPT10XOB0U11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZP2OM2#wasThisHelpful","R2NPT10XOB0U11","AEOCEVUWO5B7P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEOCEVUWO5B7P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After my last purchase, I was invited to choose and review this free package of BulkSupplements Pure Vitamin A Palmitate Powder (50 grams).This is a quote from the Vitamin C Foundation""Vitamin A -Party line is 10,000 IU/day. Here's how they got this: people were given A in large quantities for long periods, like a year or more. It was found that some few people showed overdose symptoms at 100,000 IU/day, while others showed no such at 100,000,000 IU/day. So, they arbitrarily divided the lowest exposure by ten, so that nobody could possibly show overdose symptoms. This was at the time of the ""minimum daily requirement""; it gradually became ""daily recommendation"" and has now inexplicably become the maximum dose. I read today in ""Scientific American"" no less, that ""Vitamin A in doses over 10,000 IU/day is dangerous"". This is entirely hogwash, neglecting both the overall amounts and the individual variation established in the original determinations, known factors requiring more (necessity to use night vision a lot, bright light, fluorescent light, TV/monitor exposure, and disease states). Remember being locked in a dark room for measles, so you didn't go blind? That's because measles completely destroys A, to the point of destroying the optic nerve or retina (can't remember which)- something like 100,000 IU/day of A will prevent that AND get rid of the measles in very short order.Among other things, A is essential to the proper maturation of epithelial cells - that's the skin and mucous membranes which line your insides, including the little pipes that make up your kidneys. Without A, they grow too fast, but don't mature; they then flake off, plugging up the pipes. They also don't produce mucous correctly, and thereby fail to prevent bacteria from getting into the membranes. That's how you get colds and such, including virtually all infections. Further, the flaked off cells act as food for bacteria, creating a nice incubator for evil things.Many eye problems are a result of A deficiencyM&M take 30,000-50,000 IU/day; I did too, for a long time, but was still showing deficiency symptoms (ALL my life!). When I found out what was the ""basis"" for the recommendations, I started increasing my intake. I took 80,000/day for several months until everything cleared up, then went back down to 40,000 - not enough, so I went to 70,000 - OK; then back to 50,000 = not enough, so back to 70,000; will try 60,000 sometime.A is commonly sold in 10,000 IU caps since that's the ""maximum"" permitted by law. It generally comes with 400 IU of vit D, see below.

"I run five 50-second sprints everyday over a rough dirt track timing myself with a stopwatch and so far my knees and ankles are in great shape. I bought this Glucosamine HCL to keep those knees and ankles healthy. Several years ago while jogging, my knees made a lot of noise -  painlessly popping and banging around - not anymore, however. One finger of my left hand had pretty bad arthritis. Now it is OK. I do want to stay healthy. Also, my low back nowadays hurts a little all the time - even while laying in bed. If the glucosamine can help this I will be truly grateful.The Examine website says, ""Glucosamine sulfate salts are the best way to supplement glucosamine, with glucosamine sulfate as a close second. Glucosamine hydrochloride is ineffective. N-Acetylglucosamine is not glucosamine and should be considered a different supplement."" Later on they say, ""No significant benefits [are] seen on lower back pain; all benefits associated with glucosamine are related to the knee.""GreenMedInfo, quoted later in this review, says from within a double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical trial that, ""Glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine HCL are equally effective in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.""So, I am a little worried. Next time I might buy the BulkSupplements D-Glucosamine Sulfate Potassium Powder, instead. The price is the same. Still, I expect the glucosamine HCL I have on hand to keep my knees in shape for the next six months or so.The following is a list of clinical trials, most double-blinded and placebo-controlled, recorded at the National Medical Library, MEDLINE, as abstracted by GreenMedInfo for glucosamine:1. Glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine HCL are equally effective in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.2. Use of glucosamine reduces the risk of lung cancer risk.3. A combination of glucosamine sulfate, sodium hyaluronate, chondroitin sulfate, quercetin and rutin improve symptoms of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome.4. A combination of glucosamine, chondroitin and quercetin significantly improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.5. Glucosamine extracted from shrimp does not demonstrate allergenicity in those allergic to shrimp.6. Glucosamine improves symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.7. Glucosamine shows great therapeutic potential in the treatment of degenerative osteoarthritis.8. Glucosamine sulfate significantly decreases the need for total knee replacement.9. Glycosaminoglycans like glucosamine may contribute to improving conditions like ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and interstitial cystitis.10. Glucosamine abrogates the acute phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.11. Glucosamine exerts a neuroprotective effect via suppression of inflammation in rat brain ischemia/reperfusion injury.12. Glucosamine shows promise in treating inflammatory bowel diseases like colitis.13. Glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate has therapeutic activity in dogs with osteoarthritis.14. Chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine sulfate are potent inhibitors of HIV.15. Elderberry, Chondroitin, Glucosamine Sulfate and Olive Leaf have been found to block HIV replication.16.

"I have been taking one 12 mg softgel of this Nutrex astaxanthin for a year now. Eight months before that I was taking two or three 4 mg softgels of the Nutrigold brand. I am happy to only have to take a single softgel and the price/mg is much better than any other brand. I am healthy in every way - good joints (although arthritic several years ago), very good eyes and brain, and very good athletic ability - so I cannot tell if astaxanthin is the reason for this - although it certainly must help. I take plenty of other supplements, as well. The only things I am really sure of being due to the astaxanthin is the bright red-tan color of my skin and its absolutely bullet-proof resistance to sunburn.Stacks Updated 10/28/15:The morning pre-workout stack (mostly BulkSupplements products at a daily cost of $ $1.12 that I drink thirty minutes before running five 50-second sprints is as follows:1.

"I have been taking half a tablet of this Jarrows Methyl-B12 (500 mcg) for a couple of years now. I take it first thing in the morning and it seems to wake me up. The pills are good tasting and I don't mind that it takes a while for them to dissolve in my mouth. (The good taste even provides a sort of motivation to get up in the morning.) The xylitol carrier, I know, is good for the teeth, so I don't have to brush first thing in the morning. The bacteria in the mouth try to digest the xylitol, a sugar alcohol, but cannot succeed. They keep trying to digest it but end up burning themselves out and dying, instead. Also, when exercising, running sprints in the morning, I know that I am protected against the increased risk of infection, colds, and tooth decay, if I happen to breathe through my mouth and get a dry throat. I do make a concerted effort to breathe through my nose at all times even during the most extreme sprints. If I don't, I find myself mouth-breathing during other times of the day, as well. No way am I going to start such a bad habit.

"The BulkSupplements website says that this ascorbic acid is exclusively L-ascorbic acid, is Non-GMO, has absolutely no additives, and is certified US Pharmaceutical grade (indicating a very high level of purity). These statements, plus the fact that the price is very reasonable gives me reason to buy it and rate it five stars. I consider this pure ascorbic acid a ""find"" and I am very happy with it.The ascorbic acid is probably made in China. The ""Non-GMO"" is a hint as China has little GMO corn. (In just the last few days, Chinese government officials were caught digging up and stealing hybrid corn seeds from a US seed development facility.) Nevertheless, the Chinese are fully capable of doing everything it takes to inexpensively manufacture very high purity ascorbic acid. Yes, the Chinese have extreme environmental pollution including the use of banned agricultural chemicals and a cultural tendency to adulterate food products, but BulkSupplements can just tell their Chinese suppliers, ""If your shipping container full of product does not pass our US-based purity tests, you do not get paid."" The BulkSupplements ""manufacturing"" facility in Nevada, I think, only does testing, final packaging, and order delivery.Bottom line: If this l-ascorbic acid passes US-based purity tests well enough to be certified US pharmaceutical grade, then it does not matter where it was grown, processed and purified.Incidentally, it is very easy to purify ""single-species"" substances like l-ascorbic acid by a process called recrystallization. Ascorbic acid is created by the conversion of glucose, which comes from cooking cornstarch. The raw l-ascorbic acid solution is slowly cooled so that crystals start to form. The lattice surface of each growing crystal rejects molecule by molecule anything that is not l-ascorbic acid. Only l-ascorbic acid molecules are shaped right to fit into the growing crystal lattice. Then, the liquid filtrate containing all the impurities is discarded and the process repeated a few times to get extremely high purity. Whatever poisons, adulterants, lead, mercury, arsenic, herbicides, et cetera, remaining in the final USP-grade ascorbic acid are now completely insignificant. Most BulkSupplements products are ""single-species"" substances and this is their secret to being able to provide very pure powders at very low cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KCW7NH8KQZ8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AYIM9Y8#wasThisHelpful","R1KCW7NH8KQZ8N","A1HD3HWDFP7YBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HD3HWDFP7YBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After my last purchase, BulkSupplements invited me to choose and review this free sample of BulkSupplements Pure Vitamin E Powder (100 grams)If you go directly to the Bulksupplements website you will find that this vitamin E is not only natural and contains d-alpha tocopherol, but also contains all eight isomers of the vitamin E family: Alpha, beta, delta, gamma tocopherols, and alpha, beta, delta, gamma tocotrienols.I am very happy to have found this vitamin E. A full spectrum natural vitamin E in a fully mixable powder form at a very inexpensive price is truly a find. This product rates five stars in my book, as do every one of the BulkSupplement products I have reviewed.The only complaint I have about this product, in fact, of all the BulkSupplements products listed on Amazon, is that the product descriptions and the labels are sometimes inadequate. This vitamin E product description is especially bad because at no point on Amazon does it say the vitamin E is natural. (The BulkSupplements website DOES say the vitamin E is natural.) I figured vitamin E this inexpensive had to be the synthetic ""dl"" variety and for months I didn't want it. (A notorious study reported a few years ago by Consumer's Report Magazine said that vitamin E, normally an antioxidant, turned pro-oxidant at large doses and caused cancer. Later, it was revealed that the vitamin E in the study was the synthetic ""dl"" variety and that the test subjects were all smokers. Subsequent examination showed that natural vitamin E, d-alpha tocopherol, never causes cancer. However, most antioxidants, including natural vitamin E, at a large enough overdose can turn pro-oxidant reducing the body's total antioxidant store.)Even the Bulksupplements website concerning the label is a little confusing. The thing to do, I think, is to ignore the ""700 IU"" -- apparently it is just a name (an obsolete name). The conversions are as follows:One serving = 351 mg = 1/8 teaspoon = 246 IU = 820% daily value.(Current FDA daily value is 30 IU.)You can take this serving up to twice a day.From the label:""Other Ingredients:constarch""Free of: sugar, soy, dairy, yeast, gluten, corn and additives.""Is ""constarch"" corn? I would say that BulkSupplements could probably use an editor for their labels (and their Amazon descriptions, too).Most of the BulkSupplements products don't have any additives at all, which is great. I suppose the starch was added (on purpose) to make the vitamin E dry-powder-mixable in a stack, which is how I use it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UKXOANB6BIYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EV0YOMA#wasThisHelpful","R1UKXOANB6BIYI","A1HD3HWDFP7YBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HD3HWDFP7YBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update 4/15/14: Report on the effects of doubling my dosage of DMAE-bitartrate from 700 mg to 1400 mg per day.I bought DMAE Bitartrate three months ago in January and started using 700 mg per day to lighten dark spots on my skin. Since getting no results, I decided last week to double the oral dose of DMAE to 1400 mg per day and apply face cream, as well, (with 3% DMAE added) to my face, hands, and arms. (Since DMAE-bitartrate is only 37% DMAE, it is necessary to add 8% (not 3%) DMAE-bitartrate to the face cream. For a 12-ounce bottle of face cream, this amounts to three level tablespoons of DMAE-bitartrate.) Following is a list of the improvements due to the DMAE supplementation:1. Many websites list the benefits of DMAE (just google dmae dosage), and I reference the hyperhealth website here:""DMAE removes all ... Lipofuscin (a pigment that accumulates in tandem with the progression of the Aging Process) from the ...Heart Muscle, ...Brain, ...Neurons ...and the Skin.""This is encouraging, but have to wait and see.2. ""DMAE reduces the amount of Sleep required by approximately one hour per night (this effect occurs after six weeks of continuous DMAE use).""Yes! My need to sleep has reduced from eight to seven hours a night. What a welcome benefit.3. ""DMAE causes Dreams to become more lucid (vivid).""I am having tremendously vivid and sometimes nightmarish dreams, but I like them. The vividness and awareness during dreams (of what others are communicating and what they really mean, for example) is even greater than that during waking. A scene of the horizon had extreme detail, color, and focus, and I noticed (in the dream) that I didn't have to wear glasses.4. ""DMAE may improve Athletic Performance (by improving the body's production of Energy).""""... people using DMAE subjectively report increases in their levels of Energy.""""DMAE alleviates Fatigue.""""DMAE increases Alertness, ...Attention Span, ...Assertiveness, ...Concentration, [and] ...Willpower.""I run five 50-second sprints in the mornings timing myself with a watch. These sprints bumped up from three times a week to seven times a week when I started DMAE several months ago. But, I noticed that my times were about two seconds better when I took a nootropic stack (with caffeine)compared to when I did not. In the last week, however, doubling the DMAE, the times, without caffeine, have improved by two seconds. I notice the improvement is strictly due to what I am paying attention to while running. The best performance is when I am asking myself over and over, ""Am I running swiftly? Am I in the swiftness groove?"" (It is not the questions that are important - it is the response - the answers provided by paying attention to the running and trying harder.) Also, I find myself asking or telling myself that I am not afraid - not afraid of unbearable exhaustion or falling down or passing out. Therefore, pour on the coal and go for it even more, (even if you do pass out).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M6GUYLWJOFRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYD7MEQ#wasThisHelpful","R1M6GUYLWJOFRK","A1HD3HWDFP7YBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HD3HWDFP7YBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The following is a list of some of the clinical trials testing the many diverse benefits of curcumin from the National Medical Library MEDLINE as abstracted by GreenMedInfo:I intend to boil this powdered turmeric in water so to improve its absorbability from 1% to 12%.1.

"After my last purchase, I was invited to choose and review this free package of BulkSupplements Pure Hyaluronic Acid (Na Hyaluronate) Powder (10 grams).I selected this product because I would very much like to reduce the osteoarthritis in my lower back. Also, I already have on hand DMAE (from BulkSupplements) and vitamin C (pure crystals) so I can make up the solution suggested by other reviewers on this site. (My skin could stand some tightening. When I was younger, I could grab a handful of skin on my neck and pull it way out.) I had earlier purchased pine bark extract and astaxanthin to successfully improve the quality and appearance of my skin. Also, have frequent low-grade headaches that may be caused by prostaglandin E2 (inflammatory hormone) production, which hyaluronic acid may reduce.The following is a list of some of the clinical trials testing the benefits of hyaluronic acid from the National Medical Library MEDLINE as abstracted by GreenMedInfo:1.

"After my last purchase, I was invited to choose and review a free sample of  BulkSupplements Pure Biotin 1% (Vitamin B7) Powder (100 grams).Update 5/30/14: Biotin can be depleted using alpha lipoic acid (ALA) and pantothenic acid (vitamin B-5). I think this happened to me. I had read ""The Four-hour Body,"" by Timothy Ferriss, who had said you can't overdose on ALA and had recommended 1200 mg per day. For the last three years I have been taking 1200 mg ALA every day.In just the last few days I have read that ALA, B-5, and biotin share the same multivitamin transporter (the MTV transporter) to get these nutrients out of the blood and into the cells. These nutrients compete for uptake into the cells and biotin is usually the loser.The makers of ""Juvenon,"" a mitochondrial energy boosting supplement containing ALA and acetyl-l-carnitine have done research on this problem as it appears that their Juvenon has caused substantial biotin deficiencies in some of their clients (facial rash, loss of the sense of taste, hair, skin, and nails problems). They found that 5,000 or 10,000 (or more) mcg biotin solved the problems. They said that those with serious deficiencies (one out of a thousand clients) probably had some sort of functional deficiency perhaps in the MTV transporter.I bought the BulkSupplements Biotin several months ago and started taking 3,000 mcg per day. Immediately, my hair became much bushier and I had to get a haircut about twice as often. In fact, earlier, I had noticed that my hair and especially my nails were not as healthy as they should have been. I had even purchased silica and a bunch of other supplements but no help.I had been taking a multivitamin, hadn't I? How could I be short of biotin? I checked the bottles of the different multivitamins I had been taking. The most expensive had only 50% of the RDI/DV (Recommended Daily Intake/Daily Value) of 300 mcg per day. Most of the bottles only had 17% of the RDI. The cheapest bottle, the one that I was using most of the time, had zilch, absolutely no biotin at all.The best recommendation I can find is to supplement (RS) ALA with biotin at a 100:1 ratio. This means if taking 500 mg (RS) ALA or 250 mg of (R-fraction) ALA, then need to take 5 mg biotin. At present, I am taking a daily dose of 250 mg (R-fraction) ALA and 5.192 mg biotin (519.2 mg, 0.098 teaspoon, BulkSupplements Biotin 1%).Additional note: There are four so-called ""mitochondrial targeting nutrients,""1. Biotin2. (R-fraction) ALA3. Acetyl-l-carnitine4. Niacin, along with all the other B-vitamins, especially vitamin B-5These mitochondrial targeting nutrients can:1. Enhance mitochondrial energy producing functions2. Reduce oxidative damage in the mitochondria3. Inhibit elevation of apoptosis factors4. Improve immune function.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R298UBXTB9RPI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GK7A3N6#wasThisHelpful","R298UBXTB9RPI7","A1HD3HWDFP7YBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HD3HWDFP7YBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Who needs time-released arginine and ornithine when you can have citrulline? So this time I bought the (2:1) ratio -- more citrulline, less malate. The GreenMedInfo clinical trials do not differentiate between the two types of citrulline, so I am running the same list of benefits for the (2:1) that I collected for the (1:1).The following is a list of clinical trials testing the many diverse benefits of citrulline from the National Medical Library MEDLINE as abstracted by GreenMedInfo:1. Administration of L-arginine and citrulline to patients improve the condition of heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction.2. Citrulline and spirulina may have a therapeutic role in the management of sickle cell disease.3. Citrulline malate enhances athletic anaerobic performance and relieves muscle soreness.4. Improvement of ventricular function in systolic heart failure patients with oral L-citrulline supplementation.5. Oral L-citrulline supplementation attenuates blood pressure response to cold pressor test in young men.6. Oral L-citrulline supplementation improves erection hardness in men with mild erectile dysfunction.7. Short-term l-citrulline supplementation may functionally improve arterial stiffness, independent of blood pressure, in humans.8. The administration of L-arginine and citrulline has a beneficial effect on endothelial function in the treatment of heart failure.9. Watermelon juices (and/or L-citrulline) help to reduce the recovery heart rate and the muscle soreness after 24 h.10. Citrulline increases protein synthesis and protein content in the muscle in old malnourished rats.11. Citrulline malate has a beneficial effect on skeletal muscle function in the endotoxemic rat.12. Citrulline/malate promotes aerobic energy production in human exercising muscle.13. L-Citrulline ameliorates chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in newborn piglets.14. Watermelon pomace (rich in citrulline) significantly ameliorates the metabolic syndrome in diabetic fatty rats.15. Citrulline improves nitric oxide synthesis and improves cardiovascular function in a sustainable way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HC063BJ9TYA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYDJU50#wasThisHelpful","R2HC063BJ9TYA8","A1HD3HWDFP7YBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HD3HWDFP7YBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dr. Mercola on his website has made the following comments on the use of l-glutamine:""The only safe situation for glutamine use is in the vigorous athlete. Glutamine is used as a muscle fuel, so that vigorous exercise will consume most of the glutamine before it can accumulate in the brain. I would still avoid long-term use in high doses. I would caution readers to avoid excess glutamine ....""Dr. Phil Campbell (with Dr. Mercola on his website) recommends taking two grams l-glutamine before running HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training, five 50-second all-out sprints). He says high intensity exercise can deplete the body of glutamine taking up to a week to get back to normal, thereby compromising the immune system in the interval.One time I took the morning stack, which contains two grams l-glutamine but I was not able to get started on the five 50-second sprints. About two hours later, A huge pressure built up in my head indicating a monosodium-glutamate-like headache coming on. I did a ton of push-ups, sit-ups, et cetera, and the headache never came on, although the pressure stayed the rest of the day. So, if I take the stack, I have to run the five sprints.Stacks Updated 10/28/15:The morning pre-workout stack (mostly BulkSupplements products at a daily cost of $ $1.12 that I drink thirty minutes before running five 50-second sprints is as follows:1.

"Almost perfect.This is my second Kindle.  About three months ago, I bought a Kindle reader.  I was very pleased with it despite my preference for paper media.  At some point, I wanted a little bit more versatility.  I wanted the ability to check email and watch videos on my tablet.  So, I placed an order for this model.I ordered the Poetic hardback case at the same time that I ordered the Kindle Fire.  Both arrived on the same day.  As usual, Amazon shipment was fast and efficient, and it beat the time estimate.The screen resolution on the Kindle Fire is beautiful.  I enjoyed watching television shows via HBO Now.  The speakers on the back are powerful enough for most listening situations, however, I was able to improve on the sound quality by using a pair of bluetooth headphones.  Yes, the screen is small.  However, you do have to make a trade-off between mobility and screen size.  This tablet was never meant to replace your television or your computer monitor for watching videos.  This one is for use during those times when you do not have access to a larger monitor.  You can download the videos to the device, so you can watch even when away from WiFi.  You can also get a 4G version, but mine is only WiFi.The Silk browser works fine.  I have not tried to browse Youtube with it, however.  I have not tested this browser to see how well it will play Youtube videos.  I was also unable to find a youtube app from the Amazon kindle app store.For general reading, I think I may have a slight preference for the matte screen of the regular Kindle reader.  However, that is just a preference as I like the reading material to look as close to paper as possible.  The color on the Kindle Fire is lovely.  So there is that to consider.  If I could only have one, it would be the Kindle Fire.The Email app is fine and works quite well.  I set up two email accounts.  One from hotmail and one from gmail.  Both inboxes are easy to use and to manage.  I have not felt the need to download another email app from the store.  The calendar syncs fast and the calender itself is useful to have.  Neither of these apps are feature loaded, but the basic necessities are there.This device is almost perfect.  The price is right, the screen is beautiful, and the unit feels sturdy.  The HBO Now app and service have allowed me to depend on this device solely to access content from HBO.  I no longer need my cable subscription.  I can also rent and purchase movies from Amazon, should I choose to do so.  I have a subscription to Netflix and Hulu but I have not looked for those apps for this device.Why is this device not perfect?  The lack of a second camera kept it from being perfect.  There is a front facing camera to facilitate video chat.  However, there is no camera in the back.  I believe that could be a deal-breaker for some people.  You know, those types who like to take a picture while pretending to read.  Picture this scenario, a Kindle owner is at the beach reading his book.  He sees something that he wants to take a picture of, in a subtle manner.  But, he can't, because there is only one camera.  To take the picture, he would have to face the tablet to the subject.  And that would ruin the stealth.  Of course, your humble reviewer does not engage in those types of stealth photography so the lack of a second camera was not a big deal to him when deciding which Kindle Fire unit to get.Highly recommended, but please note the lack of a rear facing camera.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GR7AI0IRG0PB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BWYQ9YE#wasThisHelpful","R1GR7AI0IRG0PB","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the story of the friendship between Adara and the ice dragon.  It is a tale of loneliness, friendship, bravery, and sacrifice.  And ultimately, it is about love.  Beyond being a terrific story in its own right, does it have any implications for the plot of A Song of Ice and Fire?  The million-dollar question is naturally, “can we use this story to predict what will happen in A Song of Ice and Fire?”  My answer to both questions is that this story has no connection to the  plot of ASOIAF and we cannot really use this to guess what Martin has in mind for the conclusion.However, it is interesting to see the same themes and the same ideas at work.  There is a little bit of Daenerys, Tyrion, Jon, and Arya in Adara.  All four characters have something in common with Adara.  Mother died during child birth.  A childhood filled with loneliness and isolation.  All five have had their lives turned upside down by war.  The Ice Dragon also share the same traits of bravery and loyalty with Drogon and Ghost.  The deep bond of friendship that can develop between different species is also a central part of the themes.Highly recommended.  I bought the Kindle version but perhaps if you wish to read this with your child, the print version would be best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HEKMWN8J2ODL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILXD9I8#wasThisHelpful","R2HEKMWN8J2ODL","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent product.Every ear cleaner that I have ever used on dogs have worked.  They all did a good job of cleaning dog ears.  However, most of them do not reduce the odor.  There are only two products that I have ever used that removed most ear odor.  One of them is only available for purchase through a veterinarian.  The second one is this Epi-Otic Advanced Ear Cleanser.My dog has long, floppy ears.  I clean his ears once per week, right before he takes a bath.  I take care to avoid getting water inside his ears.  Even so, his ears start getting that smell peculiar to dog ears.  His ears just produce a lot of debris.  The vets find nothing wrong with his ears during his regular check ups.  This product from Epi-Otic has done a very good job of reducing that odor.  It does not get eliminate it completely, but the difference at the end of the week is obvious.Dogs with standing ears, prick ears, do not seem to experience this condition.  It is usually dogs with long, floppy ears.  I suspect it is partly due to moisture and the oils naturally produced within the ear.  In any case, this product has done a very good job of reducing that odor.  It cleans the ears very well and does not bring discomfort to the dog.I put a little bit of the cleaner in a cotton ball and clean the ears.  Afterwards, I give the base of the ear a gentle massage, which my dog just seems to love.  The routine has been working well for five years, using a variety of ear cleaners.  I have used brands from Wal-Mart, Petco, and also brands sold only through veterinarians.  They all work well for cleaning the ear, but this one just has the added benefit of reducing the ear odor.Virbac Labs make good quality pet care products.  It's been a benefit to me, and to my wallet, that they can now be purchased from sources other than a licensed veterinarian's practice.  That was not the case twenty two years ago when I first used their flea control products.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16DSSD1B6H33F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00II6YM8Y#wasThisHelpful","R16DSSD1B6H33F","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent for cats, but there are better products for dogs.There is a very friendly feline that lives in the neighborhood.  Several people have claimed the cat, but she does not like to stay in one place.  I bought this because I noticed her scratching a lot.  I bought this for the cat.  It has been working very well.  Powder is a better method for cats who are scared of liquid spray bottles.  This cat hated getting wet.  So, powder was really the only option.My own dog is on a monthly heartworm preventive that also controls fleas.  For dogs, I think a combination product that takes care of fleas, intestinal worms, and prevents heartworms is the better choice.Highly recommended for cats who do not like getting sprayed with insecticide.  This is also a good choice for a small, indoor dog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRZ5D3LS91Z77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00106ZWJM#wasThisHelpful","RRZ5D3LS91Z77","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works great with Rosetta Stone!I bought this product to use with Rosetta Stone.  It works just as well as the original headset that came with the product.  I have had no problems and the installation was easy.  No additional software was needed to make the product work.Rosetta Stone will test the headset microphone each time you start the program.  It will ask you to count to five to test the microphone.  After that, the program will start on your next lesson.Is the Cyber Acoustics headset perfect?  No, it is not perfect.  There are more comfortable and more adjustable units out in the market.  But, they will be considerably more expensive.  I had a Logitech unit that was almost twice the price three years ago.  It was not used for Rosetta Stone, but rather for chat.  That unit was larger, the microphone boom/stalk was longer and sturdier.  But, like I said, it was more expensive at about $40.  After the ear padding on that unit eventually deteriorated, I was unable to find replacement pads.  I bought this inexpensive unit knowing that the ear pads will break down.  Skin oils will get on the unit.  Rather than buy a more expensive unit and then try to find replacement head pads for it, I thought it easier to just buy an inexpensive unit and replace it when the pads wear out.  This is a good unit for the price.  But, it is up to you whether you will think it's a good value or not.  One important justification for a more expensive and more luxurious unit is how often and for now long do you expect to use the product.  How much time are you going to spend wearing the unit.  Rosetta Stone is fairly intensive and you will be spending a lot of time wearing the headphones.  Perhaps you will be less price sensitive than I am and you would rightly decide to spend more money on a higher end unit.  One feature that I do not like about  this unit is the flexible microphone stalk.  It's basically a soft material that you can bend in every direction.  However, I suspect that you can only bend it a few times before it starts to fatigue like a soft length of wire.  I would have preferred a solid stalk.As always, consider your needs carefully and make your decision accordingly.  I see a lot of products getting negative reviews, and a lot of times, it is due to the consumer purchasing a product that did not meet their particular requirements.  If you are not price-sensitive and you anticipate spending a lot of time wearing the headphones, then certainly get a more expensive set.  You can never go wrong buying more quality than you need.Highly recommended for Rosetta Stone users who are price sensitive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TRQKAIK9LBYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00083Y0T6#wasThisHelpful","R3TRQKAIK9LBYV","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Provides a good explanation of shotgun chokes and what they do.  This book should be for those who have already learned how to shoot a shotgun and simply want to know more about how barrel constriction affect shot pattern.  Knowing your shotgun's shot spread for the given distance that you expect to shoot will make you move effective.  This is because there is a trade-off between increasing the spread, versus maintaining sufficient shot density.  Too little spread can result in a miss, but so can too much spread.  You can change the spread for a given distance by changing the amount of constriction, the choke.  Most shotguns today come with interchangeable chokes, from full to cylinder.  Understanding chokes can help you become a more effective shooter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F0340EAWSQ8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071BI2ME#wasThisHelpful","R2F0340EAWSQ8Q","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is David Sullivan the hillbilly version of Harry Potter?  No. David Sullivan was created in the mid-1980's, before Harry Potter came out.  David Sullivan is just your typical teenage hero in fantasy novels.I became a fan of the late Tom Dietz after reading ""Windmaster's Bane"" 27 years ago.  This is the third book in the ""David Sullivan"" series of novels that started with ""Windmaster's Bane"".The hero of the story is a teenaged boy named David Sullivan.  The story takes place in the state of Georgia, near the city of Gainesville.  While walking in the woods near the family farm, David Sullivan discovered the straight tracks, which are gateways to the world of the Fairie folk, the Sidhe.  David was born with the ability to see these tracks.Ever since that discovery, David has been living in two worlds.  The human world, and the world of the Sidhe.  Helped along by his great-uncle, Dale Sullivan, and his high school friends, David's life just became one adventure after another since that day he discovered that another world existed apart from his own.In ""Darkthunder's Way"", the Sidhe asked for David's help.  War is brewing in fairie land and only David and his brave friends have a chance to stop it.  With his trusted friends at his side, David once more enters the world of the Sidhe to start another adventure.The David Sullivan tales are suitable for readers of all ages.  These are short novels that make for good, lighthearted reading.Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L7JGGGNRP5RG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VPC7K6O#wasThisHelpful","R1L7JGGGNRP5RG","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Traditional design, but made with modern material.This tablecloth has a fancy scroll design that gives it a somewhat classic appearance.  It does look formal.  However, fear not.  It is made out of polyester.  That means it is resistant to wrinkles and it is also less likely to hold on to stains.My tablecloth ended up being too big for the biggest table that I could use it on.  There is a lot of extra material at the ends of the table and at some point, I may need to have it trimmed.  This specific unit is about ten feet long by five wide.  You can cover a 12 place dining table with it.  The color is off-white, or creme.  The scroll design, the silky appearance, and the creme color will make this a good match for your dining room set if they are made of dark wood.  The material is very light for its size due to the polyester construction.  It feels like silk to the touch.Water spills bead up on the surface, however, I suspect that it is not treated for stain resistance.  If stain resistance is important to you, you may be able to spray this material with a common fabric protector, like the ones made by 3M.  Read the directions on the product carefully, however, as you want to make sure it will not harm your tablecloth.  Treating the material with a stain protector may be worthwhile since this tablecloth may not fit inside a regular size, top-loading washing machine.  Like I said, it is ten feet long.

"Provides adequate security for low-threat areas.  What I mean by this is that the product will provide enough protection for your bicycle in areas where the potential thief is likely to be unprepared.  For example, if you ride your bike to school, the most likely thief is another student.  That person is unlikely to carry the tools needed to cut the cable or to pick the lock.  But, this lock is not adequate for use in high crime areas where the thief is most likely carrying bolt cutters and lock picks.Any pair of bolt cutters will make short work of the cable.  The lock cylinder can also be picked by anyone with training.  For high threat areas, use a solid U-shaped lock, with a tubular lock cylinder.  A solid U-lock will be harder to cut.  A regular hardware store hacksaw will have trouble cutting through a solid U-lock.  And, a tubular lock will require a set of expensive and special tools in order to pick.Bear the level of threat in mind, and spend accordingly.  This is a very inexpensive lock that will be more than suitable for your child's bicycle at the elementary/middle school bike rack.  You probably will not send your kid to school on a $2,000 mountain bike, right?  I would not hesitate to use this product to protect a $300-$600 bike that is used in a low crime area.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W3HI6RW2VR2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBBVVM2#wasThisHelpful","R3W3HI6RW2VR2C","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A fun and economical way to learn to play guitar.I have known people back in college who taught themselves how to play the guitar.  I have also known people who have paid money for guitar lessons and still never got to the point where they could play.  I am not knowledgeable enough about music to say whether anyone can learn through this game or not.  Let me just say that as a complete newbie, I am struggling.  Yes, I am learning very slowly, but there is progress.  The process is very hard on the finger tips for sure!  But the main idea is to not only learn, but to also enjoy the game.  I have a feeling that the reason a lot of people are unhappy with the game is that they are expecting to learn quickly.In any case, please buy this game but keep your expectations reasonable.  No game, no instructor, can give you the gift of being able to play.  It is a combination of your abilities and how much you put into it.  Those also play a role in how quickly, and how well, you will be able to  play.I bought the whole kit for the PS4.  It performs flawlessly, the guitar works great, and the cable is included.  The kit will save you money, since the guitar alone is about $169 or so, here on Amazon.  If you want the game and do not already own a guitar, buy the kit.  If you already have a guitar, just buy the game and cable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QI4A0Y690JXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPG4MUU#wasThisHelpful","R1QI4A0Y690JXI","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Playing this game is the closest thing to living in Westeros!Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live in the world of George Martin's ""Game of Thrones"" world?  Short of a time machine, this game is the next best option.Many book readers and TV watchers would like to imagine themselves living in the world that George Martin created.  The man has created a world that is so rich, so dramatic, and so full of life that I know a fan or two who spend more time in it than they do in the real world.  It is a very immersive world.  However, reading about it and watching the show are both passive activities.  If you would like more interaction and a more immersive experience, buy this game.This is an action-adventure game.  You play as a member of House Forrester, a northern family who have been bannermen to Winterfell for over a thousand years.  The story takes place during the War of the Five Kings.  House Forrester was drawn into the conflict when Robb Stark called in his banners and marched them down south to fight the Lannisters.The game is all about political intrigue and some action.  The choices that you make drive the story and the action.  The atmosphere is pretty tense.  You worry for the safety of your character.  The fear that you felt for the safety of your favorite character while reading the books is taken to a much higher level here.  You are in control of your character, and your actions and choices can either bring them to safety or get them killed.  You start off as Gared Tuttle, a squire in service to Lord Gregor Forrester, head of House Forrester.  You are part of the Northern host that is camped outside The Twins, Edmure Tully and Roslyn Frey are about to be married.  The fighting men around you are in a good mood, enjoying Lord Walder Frey's generous provisions of food and alcohol.  While on a chance errand, you notice something peculiar.  The Frey soldiers are all armed and do not seem to be enjoying the free-flowing supply of wine.  What do you do?  Your actions and choices drive the story.I bought the PS4 version.

"This is an old-fashioned adventure story.  It tells of the African expeditions of two Englishmen who set out to discover the source of the Nile River.  This is the story of Richard Burton and John Speke.  Friends, comrades, rivals, and competitors.  Trials and danger encountered within the wilds of Africa formed their friendship, but politics put them on opposite sides and forced their friendship apart.A lot has already been written about this movie.  It gets a recommendation from me.  Let me just add some facts that have not been mentioned.  This is one of Iain Glen's earlier movie roles.  He plays Lt. John Speke, a career officer in the British military.  Patrick Bergin is Richard Burton, the well-known explorer, swordsman, and author.  Fiona Shaw plays the fiance of Burton.  Note that this is perhaps the only movie in which you get to see Fiona Shaw naked.

"This is the must-have consumer product of the holiday season.  If you don't have it, you gotta get it.Another fantastic console from Sony.  Here we are, the 4th generation of the glorious Playstation.  And it is better than ever.  Playstation Now, Sony's cloud-based gaming service is currently on BETA, but so far, it looks good to me.  Games run fine as long as your internet connection is fast enough.  In most case, your typical broadband would be sufficient.  I have not experienced any issues, and I live in a small town where internet service is lagging behind in terms of speed.The console runs much cooler than the PS3.  Its smaller size also mean that you have more options of where to put it.  However, I would still make sure that it gets sufficient ventilation and air circulation.There is really not much more to say about the console.  Yes, it is powerful.  Yes, the graphics are terrific.  Yes, the Playstation desktop, dashboard, or main menu, whatever you choose to call it, is intuitive.  Certainly much preferred to the competition.  The controller charges fast and holds its charge fairly well.  Ergonomics are fine, but in a way, I prefer the previous generation controller.You should absolutely subscribe to Playstation Plus.  Definitely worth it as there are freebies included.  By the way, I am also a subscriber on XBox Gold.PS4 or XBox One?  Choose based on exclusives.  If you do not have any attachments to the exclusives, pick the PS4.  The Playstation Now service is looking better and better every week.  My only complaint is that we do not yet have access to the awesome library of PS One and PS2 games.  Now, this is not something that would be difficult for Sony to do.  They have some of the best engineering minds and the most experienced developers on the planet.  If they want to make it happen, it will happen.  The indisputable advantage that the Playstation has over its competition is that it has the biggest library of legacy games, going back four generations.  I do not want to get into a long discussion of the importance of backwards compatibility.  Been there, done that with the PS3.  However, the ability to be able to continue to play those older PS1 and PS2 games add value to the console.  It also means that any game made for any Playstation system will never be obsolete.  That adds value to a customer's game library.  I would feel better when I have to pay full-price for games if I knew that I will always be able to play them even when the PS10 comes along!!!  Compatibility via the Cloud is probably how this will be handled.  It will eventually happen, I am just hoping that it will happen sooner, rather than later. I have discussed this topic with other gamers and the reason may be is that Sony has not yet decided on the pricing for those legacy games.  Playstation NOW is still on BETA, but it actually runs just fine as it is.  I suspect it may be the pricing scheme that has not been decided yet.Just last night I played ""Iron from Ice"", an episodic adventure game based on George Martin's ""A Game of Thrones"".  The game played flawlessly.  There is something for everybody.  And there is more to come when Sony finally makes available PS1 and PS2 games on Playstation Now.  I checked the list of games last night and they even have ""El Shaddai"" on there.  That game was not a big seller.  If they have that available, think of what they will have in the future.  Can you imagine being able to replay classics such as ""The Legend of Dragoon"", ""Final Fantasy X"", and Xenogears on your PS4!  I hope it happens soon.There is a lot of excitement surrounding this console. It does have a headstart in cloud-based gaming with Playstation NOW and we all know that it can only get better.  The consoles are selling out very fast.  As soon as you have an opportunity to make a purchase, I recommend that you do so.  I suspect that supplies are going to be running low as the holiday season progresses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EOIP3B65242V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGA9WK2#wasThisHelpful","R3EOIP3B65242V","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is Nastassja Kinski at the top of her game!I first became a fan of Nastassja Kinski after watching ""Tess of the D'Urbervilles"".  Not only was she a very convincing, natural actress, but she was beautiful.  It really is too bad that her career took a downturn in the mid 1980s.  An actress of her talents should have won an Oscar or two by now.This is a supernatural horror movie, make no mistake.  Blood and gore are aplenty.  However, it is also a movie about sexual awakening.  Before you jump to conclusions, this is not one of those typical 1980s sexual awakening kind of movie.  It is nothing like ""Sixteen Candles"" or ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"".  This is also not a bloody slasher like the Friday the 13th franchise.  The closest similarity that I can think of is ""The Howling"".  This, in my opinion, is in the same category, as that movie.The movie takes place in New Orleans.  Irena Gallier has reached young womanhood and has come to the city to live with her brother, Paul.  Their parents died when both were young.  Irena grew up in an orphanage.  It has been many years since she has seen her brother, who has made a comfortable life for himself in New Orleans.Unusual for a woman of about 18 years of age, Irena is a virgin.  Unaware of her family's secret, she falls in love with a zoo curator.  Her brother explains to her that they are a race of humans who transforms into panthers whenever they have sex with a regular human.  The only way to revert back into human form is to kill.  Paul also tells her that their parents were brother and sister.  The only way to avoid shape-shifting into a panther while having sex is to make sure the partner is also a ""cat people"".  He tells her that she will end up killing her future lover.  Irena refuses to accept this and resist Paul's sexual advances.  As her sexuality awakens, her primal nature starts to slowly come out.I do not want to spoil the rest of this excellent movie for you.  Let me just say that the acting performances are superb.  Do yourself a favor and add this cult classic to your collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O2F7PFTWG11P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000069HZO#wasThisHelpful","R2O2F7PFTWG11P","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a decent apocalyptic themed movie.I have been a fan of the genre, ever since I saw ""The Omen"" back in 1976.  If you like these types of movies, you should also check out ""Revelations"".  This movie, ""The Seventh Sign"" is not as good, in my opinion as The Omen, Omen II, Omen III:Final Conflict, and Revelations.  However, it is well-made and the acting performances were very good.  Perhaps one of the most solid performances from Demi Moore in her career.  Michael Biehn and Jurgen Prochnow also lend their talents here.The end of the world is coming, according to the signs.  River water turning to blood, ice in the desert, and the moon changing colors are all signs that the end is near for mankind.  The premise here is that the supply of souls in heaven has run out, and when the first soul-less baby is born, the destruction of mankind will be irreversibly set in motion.The story takes place in Venice, CA.  Of all places for mankind to prevent the apocalypse it had to be here, right?  Well, you have to be willing to buy into it, naturally.  An exotic setting, perhaps somewhere in old world Europe or the Middle East would have been my preference, but California is what we have.  Abby and Russell Quinn play a young couple who is trying to have a child.  Their first attempt ended in stillbirth.  One day, a stranger claiming to be a linguist arrives in town and asks to rent the couple's garage loft.  Not long after, a mysterious priest starts meddling in the couple's affairs, doing everything in his power to ensure that Russell's client (he is a lawyer) faces execution for his crimes.This is a pretty good movie.

"Gets the job done!I have been a user of electric toothbrushes for the past 18 years.  I started out with Interplak and used that for almost two years, until the battery corroded.  I replaced that first electric with another from the same brand.  Eventually, the Sonicare came out and I switched to that brand.  That Sonicare lasted a very long time.  Sometime around late 2005, I bought my first Oral-B.  The Oral-B was one of their mid-end models and it also lasted a number of years.  The nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries were still working fine, but the charging base got damaged during a move.  I replaced that one with a cheap model, also an Oral-B.  This cheap model will only hold its charge for about 3 brushing sessions before you notice a significant performance decrease and the unit would need to be fully recharged.  As they say, you do get what you pay for.  There are times when you travel and have to take the brush with you.  It  would be nice to have something that will hold a longer charge.  So, I bought this one.  This one is much better than the previous Oral-B.  It uses the same model of brush head but this model cleans more aggressively than the previous one.  So, here we are, my sixth electric toothbrush in 18-19 years of use.  Of the six models, I would say that the only ones that I did not like were the low-end Oral-B and the first Interplak.  All the rest were good at what they were supposed to do.  You do not need to spend 100+ dollars on a top-model like the Sonicare to get good results.  I have found that the key to getting good performance is to replace the brush head often.  Get the name brand brush head if you can.  The brush heads on the Sonicare tend to last longer than the ones on the Oral-B, but they are also typically more expensive.  It is your choice.I can easily recommend this model, the Oral-B Precision 1000, to anybody who wants to use an electric toothbrush.  Spending more money will not necessarily clean your teeth better, in my experience.  What you give up is more features, like UV sterilizing and perhaps additional cleaning modes (like a gentle cycle on your washing machine, some brushes have a mode for delicate users).  My advice when it comes to electric toothbrushes is to avoid the low-end and the high-end.  somewhere in the middle is the sweet spot.  Get a model that uses the same brush heads as the higher-end models and you will get the same cleaning performance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V6BMS1BG1XML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UKM9CO#wasThisHelpful","R3V6BMS1BG1XML","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"World History 101 for ""A Song of Ice and Fire"".Yes, if such a college course exists, this would be the required textbook.  This book is the written history of the known lands that are the settings for George R R Martin's epic ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" (ASOIAF).  This is another must-have reference item for the ASOIAF scholar.  While not a necessity, its contents can only serve to enrich the reading experience for you when ""The Winds of Winter"" comes out.  The more back story you know, the more realistic and the more immersive the reading experience will become.  Say you have read all of the books up to this point, including this one.  And then the next novel comes out and you read it in the quiet comfort of your favorite room.  All that back story can only help you immerse yourself in the story.  In short, what I am saying is that these supplemental materials are not necessary to enjoy the main novels, however, spending time (and money) reading the back stories will definitely make the journey more engaging for you.  Highly recommended.The history lesson starts at a time period of what is known as the Dawn Age.  Primitive humans lived on the large continent of Essos.  Westeros, at this time, did not have human populations.  Rather, its inhabitants were human-like beings, the giants and the forest-dwelling Children.  A very barbaric, primitive people called the First Men migrated to Westeros from Essos, crossing a narrow land bridge in what is now known as the Step Stones.  Conflict with the Children followed, and lasted for thousands of years.  At some point, the two sides worked out a deal for peace and they coexisted for many centuries.  A more advanced people, the Andals followed, bringing weapons of iron with them.  Meanwhile, in the East, the empire of Valyria slowly rises from the foot of fourteen active volcanoes.  These people would later take technology, magic, science, and warfare to levels of sophistication that were previously unknown.  One powerful Valyrian noble family, the Targaryens, survived the cataclysm that destroyed the great city and made their way to Westeros.  Using the power of their mighty dragons, the Targaryens conquered Westeros and ended the perpetual wars between the kingdoms which comprised the continent.  The Targaryens built great cities, and brought sophisticated knowledge with them from Valyria.The history then details the reign of some of the more notable Targaryen monarchs, ending with King Aerys II.  Aerys is the father of Princess Daenerys, one of the main characters in the current story.  Although, he was actually already dead by the time of her birth, Aerys is  mentioned frequently in the novels.  We also learn more about some of the other major characters in the story, particularly Ser Barristan, Lord Tywin, and Ned Stark.The lesson also takes us to lands that have not been discussed in the novels.  We go East, to the Free Cities, all the way to Asshai. Yi Ti is given a reasonable amount of space.  Volantis and Braavos are discussed in detail.Very interesting, and yet, the scholar needs to bear in mind that some of the material need to be treated with a healthy dose of doubt.  In typical George Martin fashion, bias and other factors affect the history that was recorded.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UFNDJPP64Y2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553805444#wasThisHelpful","R3UFNDJPP64Y2C","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is this the best filter carbon available in the aquarium hobby?This could very well be the best filter carbon available to the hobbyist.  The other contender is the Hydrocarbon (Two Little Fishies) brand.  Both are excellent and will do a great job of keeping your aquarium water clear.  The water will always smell fresh and the water will remain clear with regular use of carbon.The key to the effective use of carbon in your filter is to replace it frequently.  You will also want to make sure that you are passing the water through a fine mechanical filter before it goes through the carbon layer.  That way, your carbon will last longer instead of clogging prematurely.  Use only a moderate quantity, but replace frequently.The quantity of carbon that you can use will depend on your filtration system.  Small, box filters will not hold very much carbon.  And the carbon in those systems tend to exhaust (clog) very quickly because the mechanical filter is not every thorough.  Particulates exhaust the carbon prematurely.  Canister filters are your best choice for chemical filtration.  But you can get good results using a HOB box filter if you pay attention to the mechanical filter ahead of the carbon media.I keep mopani wood in the tank for decoration.  This wood releases tannins in the water.  Within a short period of time, this will turn your water yellow.  If you have enough mopani wood in the tank, the water may even turn brown.  The more dense the wood, the longer it will continue to release tannins.  A good quality carbon, like Matrix, can keep your water from turning yellow.  How often the carbon will be exhausted will depend on the factors already mentioned above.  Seachem Matrix and Hydrocarbon are the brands that have been the most effective for me.  The Black Diamond (Marineland) brand also works fine, and it is quite a bit cheaper than the Seachem brand.  The pre-packaged carbon for the Aquaclear filters and the Fluval C series filters work fine, but they exhaust very rapidly.  Even when compared to the same quantity as Seachem Matrix.  In a 20-gallon planted tank, with one medium-sized mopani wood, 1/3 cup of either Seachem Matrix or Two Littles Fishies' Hydrocarbon will keep the water fresh, and clear.  Combined with weekly water changes of 30% to 50%, the water never has a chance to turn yellow.  I replace the carbon in this tank every third or fourth water change.  Basically, that means once every 3 weeks.  Sometimes the interval stretches to 4 weeks.  This tank has a lot of floating plants.  Without the carbon, the water would turn noticeably yellow in a short amount of time.Seachem Matrix or Two Little Fishies' Hydrocarbon?Either one will do an excellent job of keeping your water smelling fresh and crystal clear.  The Hydrocarbon is granular, and the sizes are naturally irregular.  The uniform size and shape of the Matrix is said to aid water flow, but I have not noticed any difference in flow.  Neither one has affected the ph in my tanks.  Neither one has caused an algae bloom.  So far, all they have contributed are positives.  The Seachem Matrix is easier to find in retail stores compared to Hydrocarbon.  As it comes out of the container, Matrix has less dust than Hydrocarbon.  If you are going to use a filter bag, keep in mind that the holes might allow the Matrix to pass through.  To use Matrix, you need a filter media bag that have small holes.  The Matrix has a diameter of approximately 1 mm. You will need a fine media bag to hold this carbon.  The Hydrocarbon will work with any filter media bag.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PO73K07KOKQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000255S00#wasThisHelpful","R1PO73K07KOKQO","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Patience is a virtue when it comes to getting rid of ich.There are stronger medications out there that will get rid of ectoparasites.

Mind you, I can only make this claim based on the plant species in my tank.  Rid-Ich seems to be a fairly gentle treatment that has not had noticeable side-effects in my tanks.  I do not have any scale-less fishes in the tank.  These are said to be sensitive to the active ingredients.Should you raise the water temperature to speed up the lifecycle of the parasite?  That would depend on your fish.  Some species do not like high water temperatures.  Most tropicals should be fine with 77-80 degrees.  At this temperature range, the parasite should complete its life cycle within 7-10 days.  This is important because the parasite is only vulnerable to the medication during certain stages in its life.  You can dose the tank every 24 hours, for 8 days.  Feed sparingly during this time.  You do not want to decrease the water quality during the treatment period by overfeeding.  You can do water changes during the treatment period if necessary, but please keep in mind that doing so will cause temperature fluctuations.  Dose for the actual quantity of water in the tank, as close as you can.  Do not use carbon filtration during the treatment period, as it can remove the medication from the water.  Observe your fish carefully during the treatment period.  The instructions say that you can decrease the time intervals down to 12 hours if the fish show no signs of improvement.  Ich is present in the tank, so even if only one fish is showing the symptops, you still need to dose the entire tank.  Be consistent and be patient during the treatment.At the end of the treatment period, perform your normal water change.  Clean out the filter, replace the filter media, and add fresh carbon.  Slowly decrease the water temperature, if your fish require it.  Observe the fish carefully for the first few days.  If you see signs of the disease again, it means that you have not eradicated the parasite.  You will need to start over.Rid-Ich will not work for leeches, tapeworms, and internal parasites.  For worms and leeches, you can use praziquantel or copper.  I would rate Kordon's Rid-Ich as equally effective as Seachem's Paraguard for ich.  Both are gentle medications for the treatment of ich.  This is not a complicated medication to use.  Raising the water temperature is not even required, although it can accelerate the life cycle of the parasite, thereby shortening treatment duration.  However, should you not wish to raise the temperature, you can still treat ich, it will just take longer.  Do an internet search for ich and its lifecycle.  You should not have any trouble finding a chart that shows how long the lifecycle takes for a given temperature.  Use that to help determine your treatment duration.  You can add an extra day or two, just to be safe.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5DE27J1WX305/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BS98IEC#wasThisHelpful","R5DE27J1WX305","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Makes the impossible, possible!  Ok, that was a huge exaggeration.  How about this instead:  Seachem Neutral Regulator makes it convenient for those who live in hard-water areas to keep soft-water tropicals.Yes, you can soften the water using reverse osmosis filtration and ion exchange resins.  However, you will still need to adjust the water and make sure that it has enough buffering capacity to maintain a stable ph.  Seachem's Neutral Regulator can soften hard water, if you add enough of it.  However, the best approach for those who live in areas where the water is very, very hard 300+ ppm) is to use a combination of methods.  First, soften the tap water by mixing with R/O water, deionized water, or clean rain water.  Get it soft enough so that you will not have to add a lot of Neutral Regulator.  The advantages to this combination method is that you will not have to add as much of the product, which may help avoid getting cloudy water.  You will also limit the amount of phosphate that you are adding to the tank.  As has been mentioned, this product is a phosphate-based buffer.If you visit online forums dedicated to the hobby, some wise sage will always chime in and say, ""don't fight your water, keep fishes that will thrive in your tap water"".  I agree.  Very sound advice.  If you live in an area where the water is hard and alkaline, you are setting yourself up for a lot of expense and a lot of work if you decide to keep soft-water fishes like Discus, Rams, and Cardinal Tetras.  However, if you accept  your hard, alkaline tap water and instead decide to keep African Rift Lake Cichlids and Livebearers, you will have a much easier time, as far as water chemistry is concerned.  The problem is, I am not interested in keeping African Rift Lake cichlids.  The fishes that I wish to keep originated from soft, somewhat acidic environments.  Therefore, I have accepted the fact that I will have to fight my hard, alkaline tap water every week in order to maintain the types of fishes that I prefer to keep.  You see, if your tap water is very hard and very alkaline, it will resist adjustment.  In other words, you will just have to be as stubborn as your tap water if you decide that you want to keep soft-water fishes.The method you should use will naturally depend on just how hard your tap water is.  You will also need to know how much buffering capacity it has, the KH.  Usually, the higher the general hardness (GH), the higher the carbonate hardness (KH).  So, let us say that you have decided to fight your tap water.  The first task then is to do some measuring.  Get yourself a test kit and measure the GH, KH, and PH of your tap water.  Knowing these measurements will tell you not only how much work you will have to do, but also the best way to go about it.If your tap water is very hard, over 250ppm, then you will have to add a lot of this product just to get it down to neutral.  Before the water's ph will budge, the buffering capacity will have to be overwhelmed by the phospate.  So, the harder the water is, the more phosphate you will have to add to overcome the resistance.  You might be thinking of going natural and adding peat granules to your filter, to help remove some of the KH.  That will work if the water is only slightly hard, or moderately hard.  But when the water is very hard, you will have to resort to non-natural means to lower hardness and ph.  That means mixing your tap water with softened water, by one of the following ways:  reverse osmosis filtration, ion exchange, and collecting rain water.My suggestion, if this is possible for you, is to collect rain water.  Much cheaper than reverse osmosis and ion exchange.  You can always filter the rain water through carbon if you are afraid of contaminants.  In this way, you will avoid the water waste that is the side effect of using a reverse osmosis filtration system.  And, you will avoid adding sodium to your tank, a side effect of using a typical home water softening system.  Some fish would not mind a little sodium, some do not like it.  If you do not mind the added expense, you can use potassium instead of sodium (salt) to recharge your water softening system.  That would be a better way, for the fish.  After you have gotten the GH down to about 150ppm, then you can use the Seachem Neutral Regulator.  By this time, KH would also have been lowered, so you will only need to use a little bit of the product.While we are on this topic, let us talk about phosphate.  Will phosphate lead to an increase in algae?  Possibly, but let us look at this situation another way.  Do you have algae now?  If the answer is no, then perhaps you will not want to add any phosphate to your tank.  But the likely answer is yes, you do have algae now.  Your water is hard and alkaline.  If you keep plants and have strong lighting, you will most likely have algae.  But phosphate levels are not the only reasons why a fish tank will get algae.  Algae needs very little, in the way of nutrients, to thrive.  Adding more phosphates will not necessarily increase your algae.  By softening the water and decreasing the ph, your plants are likely to thrive.  Most plants prefer slightly soft, neutral water.  By helping your plants grow faster, you might make it harder for algae to compete for nutrients.I have a 20 gallon long, with ram cichlids.  This is a planted tank, with strong lighting.  I use a combination of deionized water and Seachem Neutral Regulator to bring the water down to a reasonable hardness (approx. 100).  This is still somewhat hard, but much better than the 400+ppm that comes out of the tap.  The neutral regulator can maintain ph at 7.0.  Were I interested in breeding the rams, I will have to add more deionized water to the mixture and add a product to lower the ph.  In other words, instead of using the current ratio of DI water to tap water, I will have to increase the portion of DI water.  The use of the neutral regulator has not increased the growth of algae.  I had algae before, and I still get algae now.  It was never out of control before, and it is not out of control now.  The use of floating plants, weekly water changes, frequent replacement of the filter media, and modest feedings keep algae under control.  The plants are able to thrive.  Algae only grows on the glass and the one ceramic ornament in the tank.  Regular use of Flourish Excel helps the plants thrive, but also helps keeps the algae under control.  What I am saying is that the worry that Seachem Neutral Regulator will cause an algae explosion in a tank that was in balance to begin with may not be warranted.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KENUOSWOQZGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000255P9E#wasThisHelpful","R3KENUOSWOQZGR","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This grill cooks food nicely.  Even though it is an electric grill, the results will be far superior to what you can get out of an electric hot plate.  And while it may not deliver the same taste as a charcoal grill, I do not think you will be dissapointed with the results.Let me admit right now that your steaks will taste better on a charcoal grill.  However, for those who cannot grill with an open fire, this is your best option.  Depending on where you live, you may not be allowed to use a charcoal grill or a gas grill.  Electric will be your only choice.  If you have to go electric, then I highly recommend this.  I have tried grilling with the hot plate types, like the Foreman grills.  While they do cook food faster, they also do not taste as good as the meats cooked on the Char-Broil.I have grilled a lot of steaks and pork chops on this grill, as well as vegetables like zucchini, bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, and squash.  If you grill a lot of high fat foods, you can still get a little bit of flare up, but they only lasts for a short time.  You can compensate for the slight less taste, due to it being an electric, by being creative with your marinade and by basting the meat right before you remove it from the grill.  You can also add wood chips, but I have not tried that.Electrics have a lot of advantages.  You will never have to go out and buy charcoal and starter fluid.  Nor will you have to go out and buy gas.  This makes it convenient for those spontaneous moments when you get the urge to grill something for dinner.  However, please keep in mind this grill is only for outdoor use.  It is not like a hot plate that you can use indoors.  This one will produce a lot of smoke.  And, like I said, you still get the occasional flare up.  And because it is an electric, it should last for many years with very little maintenance.  Unlike a gas grill, this one only needs to be cleaned.  No parts to replace.  Clean out the drip tray from the bottom and clean the grate.  That is all the maintenance it will need.  If you are lazy on maintenance, a gas grill is not for you.  An electric version, like this one, would make better sense for you.The grill grate is hard to clean.  But then again, have you ever had a grill grate that is easy to clean?  Yes, if you clean it immediately after cooking, it will be much easier.  But really, who actually does that?  I mean, most people would want to dive into their steak before it gets cold, right?If you cannot grill with an open flame, this is your best choice.

"Sexual gratification, without the commitment, appears to be the lead character's mission.  As the plot unfolds, you realize that there is more to Hemel than something as simple as that.Let's talk about the censored version first.  The censored version is what you get if you bought the streaming media from Amazon.  However, if you buy the DVD, as I did, you will not have to worry about censored content.  This review is about the DVD, the uncensored movie.The movie follows the life of a young lady who pursues sexual gratification for its own sake.  She is not interested in forming relationships with her bed partners.  There is nothing inherently wrong with this, as quite a lot of men do the same thing and are viewed differently under traditional values.  What is fascinating about her is the relationship that she has with her father.  The movie is Dutch, with English subtitles.  However, you do get enough understanding of the story to know that she is in love with her father.  Not necessarily in a sexual way, but definitely is possessive.The reason for the casual sexual encounters is simply to fulfill her needs.  But clearly her heart is not in it, only her genitalia.  In other words, the encounters are simply for sex.  At some point in the story, it becomes clear that the father will be committing to a relationship with his girlfriend.  At that point, Hemel is emotionally upset.  Even to the point of contemplating jumping off the roof of a building.The star of the movie is the beautiful Dutch actress, Hannah Hoekstra.  I reviewed another one of her movies, ""App"", earlier this year.  While I enjoyed ""App"" more than I did this one, ""Hemel"" is still a fascinating movie to watch.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BAZ2JQR8K7MQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AYGVCCK#wasThisHelpful","R2BAZ2JQR8K7MQ","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unplug that mouse from your computer, replace it with this Logitech joystick, download the software from IMG, and you are good to go.Yes, you can replace your computer mouse with a joystick.  But you need to get the software to make it work.  There are free software that you can download, but I chose to purchase mine from a company called IMG (Innovation Management Group).  This Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick and the ""Joystick-to-Mouse"" software from IMG work perfectly together.I got the idea to do this because an acquaintance of mine suffers from arthritis.  The nature of her work include a lot of data entry,as well as document processing.  She has tried ""ergonomic"" mice, but have not gotten relief.  We bought this Logitech joystick, bought the software, and installed on her workstation.  It has worked wonders for her, but the adjustment is taking a lot of time.  Moving that cursor with a joystick is not as precise for her as with her mice.  It is taking time, but she is slowly adjusting.  I am giving her a break because she is not a video game player.  The idea fascinated me and prompted me to buy the same model of Joystick from Amazon for my own use.  I also purchased the same software, from IMG.  And, I am enjoying the change.What do I like about using a joystick, in place of a mouse?  Well, it is cool.  Very cool to have a joystick on your desk.  I have also programmed a lot of functions on the buttons and controls of the ""stick"".  All those buttons, 12 in all, can be put to good use.If you have arthritis, this might be worth a try for you.  If you suffer from some kind of physical disability that make the use of a mouse difficult, this could be the ticket.  If you want to be cool, so cool that you use a joystick instead of a mouse, this is it.  The secret here is that excellent software from IMG.  You can call them at 1-800-889-0987, or visit their website at www.joystick-to-mouse.com.My advice to you is to pick a good quality joystick, like this Logitech.  You do not have to spend a lot of money.  You're not buying this to battle an enemy MIG fighter on your monitor!  But you do want good quality.  You will be using this constantly, so precision, quality, and durability are important.And, if you do play games on your comptuter that uses a joystick, this is a good way to learn precision.  As you use the joystick daily, your precision and control will develop nicely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JEIN36AVUQER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009OY9U#wasThisHelpful","R3JEIN36AVUQER","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mouthwash, for dogs and cats.This is not as effective as brushing your pet's teeth, but it may be a sensible alternative if your dog will not tolerate brushing.  This water additive works like mouthwash.  Basically, you add a measured amount to your pet's bowl each time you add water.  When the pet drinks, Dental Fresh acts like a mouthwash.Dental Fresh does a very good job of keeping tartar under control.  Yes, tartar will still form, but not as fast.  You should use this product all of the time.  A side benefit is that it will keep the water in the bowl fresh.  If you have a messy dog that drops food particles in his water, then you will still need to change the water out daily.  Dental Fresh can extend the water's freshness if your dog is not too messy in his dining habits.Cats tend to be picky about their water.  I have known cat owners who say that their cats do not like anything added to their water.  Dental Fresh smells faintly like chlorine.  Perhaps some cats will be turned off by that.  In this case, use a product that is added to the food, instead of the water.  Food can hide the smell of the chemical.  There is a brand called ""Petsafe Indigo Dental Sauce"" that works really well.  I reviewed one earlier this week, for Amazon.  That should be your choice, if your dog or cat refuses to drink water that was treated with ""Dental Fresh"".

To use this, please follow the directions on the container.  Using too much may cause a stomach upset.While this product is effective and easy to use,  my preference is to use a water additive.  A water additive not only will help keep your pet's teeth clean, but it will also keep his water bowl clean.  A product like Dental Fresh, added to the water bowl, keeps the water clean while keeping your dog's breath fresh.  However, some dogs are very sensitive to the taste and the smell of their drinking water.  They may not drink, or rather drink sparingly, if they can taste ""doggie mouthwash"" in their water bowl.  Yes, they may avoid the water bowl and drink from the toilet bowl instead!  Which is the last thing you want.  In that case, use a product like PetSafe Indigo Dental Sauce instead.

"It is hard to review a book that is designed to help the reader ""self-improve"", become more effective, and happier.  Ultimately, the true test of the material is to evaluate its effects on the reader's life.  That's not really practical, since influences outside the book, reader compliance with the advice, and time make such an evaluation almost impossible.  As far as book reviews, it would not be a long enough period, the review period, to evaluate at how effective the material is at changing the reader's life.  However, we can take a look at some of the core principles in the book.Here, to manifest, means to make happen.  To have an idea, to have a goal, a desired outcome, and turn that into reality.  The book takes a spiritual approach to helping the audience achieve, or manifest, their desired outcomes.  However, if you can see beyond the spiritual, which is probably not the intention of the authors, there are some very practical ideas here.  I will cover one of those ideas.  The idea that the way we react, the way we respond to situations can either help us ""manifest"" or prevent us.  Our past experiences have created in us an automatic response, knee-jerk if you will, that sometimes can sabotage our efforts to manifest our goals and desires.  One of the first things that the authors do is to help you relieve yourself of that burden, and instead learn to reflect and respond in ways that will help you, rather than hinder you, in manifesting your desires.  In other words, to get that weight off your back, so that you can find a better response, a more appropriate response to the situations that you may face.Another principle discussed here is to find what it is that you truly want.  To peel away expectations and practical concerns to discover what it is that you really want.  Your life mission, your soul's mission, that is.  Knowing that will then help you take steps to try to achieve that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HYNN9CQ6EDL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401941826#wasThisHelpful","R3HYNN9CQ6EDL4","A304GUEPCPYM3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A304GUEPCPYM3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Historical fantasy?  Is that the best way to describe what this tv movie is about?  In any case, this is an adaption of Kate Mosse's book of the same name.  It is a medieval fantasy, with a twist.  It is a story of two women, separated by time.  Alais, living in southern France over 800 years ago, becomes the guardian of the Grail.  Meanwhile, in the present day, Alice Turner is a teacher on holiday in the same location.  Alice is a volunteer at an archaeological site near the walled city of Carcassone.  The story centers on the Grail, all wrapped up within the bigger story of what happened to the Cathars as they were purged from the city.  In the present day, two powerful factions are on a race to find the Grail.The movie seamlessly switch from one time period to another, giving the impression that the events are all occurring simultaneously, rather than separated by 800 years.  The production quality is very high.  And the acting from the major characters are all great, coming from a terrific young cast.Jessica Brown-Findlay plays Alais, while Vanessa Kirby plays Alice.  John Hurt, Tom Felton, Katie McGrath, and Sebastian Stan play major roles.  John Lynch, Emun Elliott, and Tony Curran round out the excellent cast.The plot unfolds slowly at first.  This may bore some viewers.  However, your patience will be rewarded with some good action scenes.  The fight choreography in the movie was of good quality.  Both Ms. Brown-Findlay and Ms. McGrath have nude scenes.  And the castle town of Carcassone is quite a sight to behold, even on film.Will Alice Turner discover the secrets of the Grail, as well as its current location, before it falls in the wrong hands?  One faction wants to harness its power for wealth and profits.

"This is more of a solid 3.5 but I am giving it a four because I do think Rothschild attempts and mostly succeeds at telling a story that is original and engaging.However it does have flaws.First I felt it dragged a bit.  The author really does a great job to get the book going.  The narrative parts by the painting at first seemed to try a bit too hard.  But after a few chapters it ends up working as it weaves in with all the various points of view we are given.  And those various points of view present another problem.  One they don't help in tightening the story.  Two, some are mere glimpses and I think the author could have winnowed a few out and simply used a longer point of view of lesser characters.  Three, this may sound odd, but the lesser characters turn out to be more engaging and interesting and move the story better than the main character.  And since the main character gets more and longer sections, the compare works against the book as a whole for me.While Annie comes alive when she is devoted to her food, the book ultimately is about art.  And here, she seems petulant, too nebulous and too often uninteresting.  In fact there are times the author has her act in ways that seem almost completely disjointed by what is happening.  She is abrupt and even irrational.  She never seems to be fully fleshed as a person and instead becomes an odd reaction (odd in that she moves the plot but does not do so in a reason that seemed plausible to me -- she reacts to one person as odd or comes off as strangely judgemental and works off that when there seems to be no reason for her to do so).In fact by the end, the main character was the most annoying thing about the book.  The rest works wonderfully.  But it is hard to overlook the flawed presentation of Annie.  And taking a stab at why.  For me it felt that Annie is simply there to set things up.  And because she is so flat for me, this drags the book out.  Makes it seem over long.  To try and explain with a bit of clarity, I will give an example -- not a quote, but the sense of how I felt this played out.  Annie would engage with an art expert.  Annie is not an art expert.  She is adrift and rather meandering.  But this picture has brought her into this world.  Aimless the character still gives me the sense of impatience.  Of being put upon.  And reacts in terse and almost scornful ways to people that are simply trying to help her.  And despite being a novice to the art world, again and again, the author shows this character engaged through her cooking with art.  So it made no sense.  But her attitude helps drag things out.  Keep her from taking the next step.Last, I felt that there were interesting elements that came together, but in the end the various threads were just a bit too thick on their own.  The provenance of the painting got in the way of finding out the provenance of the painting.  Rebecca on her own would have been an interesting story.  Annie, written with a bit more nuance and complexity, discovering the history of the painting on her own would have been interesting.  As it was though they were written as too large on their own to share the stage successfully as it were.  Instead of  weaving together they tangled.Still, this was a book I read start to finish and had nothing else distract me or lure me away.  I really liked some of the characters and their disparate stories that slowly came together.

"As a compendium of beekeeping as recorded in Ancient Egypt this gets four stars.  But as a read?  It is just too dry.  And that is sad since the author's interest and expertise come through here and there.  Amid what is nothing more, too often, of list after list of tomb inscriptions and records, there is some wonderful writing by Kritsky that underscores the enthusiasm that prompted such a book.  But for me it was mere sentences.  Maybe a paragraph at most.  And then the return to rote citation.  And that is a disappointment.  Particularly at a time when the importance of bees and their place in the environment still gets ignored at our peril.  Getting a glimpse of how long and how important bees have been in one of the oldest and most enduring civilizations that impacted the rest of the world and its growth was fantastic.  Unfortunately I just feel we barely get even a  glimpse through an expert's eyes. Maybe a hint instead; it almost felt more like I was reading a great book's bibliography and notes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EPO923019RPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146Y9TE8#wasThisHelpful","R1EPO923019RPR","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I feel a bit too 'meh' on this one.  Do we really need another book to plumb the fictional depths of how WWI changed so much for so many?  Maybe.  This wasn't the one for me though.  It seemed way too been there and done that.  And what made this worse instead of mitigating it, was that Clark has a nice way with words.  To put it simply.  Her descriptions and sense of setting in the time are wonderful.  But instead of making this a better read, it underscores, for me, how flat everything else is.There is almost a paint by the numbers approach.  Great house, female characters who struggle with the limitations of the time and culture, change, looming war, change, looming doom, change.The one factor that might have saved this was a set of compelling and engaging characters.  They didn't have to be likable, just interesting.  And here I found another letdown.  Flat and unappealing in part and simply trite in the other.This isn't a horrible book.  And if I wanted to simply settle down into yet another book for the sake of familiar I might have been inclined to give it a higher rating.  However this is not a period that I think deserves workable and yet pedestrian approaches.  It needs something brilliant to set it apart and make it worthwhile.  And sadly I did not find that here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWNXORQSPCQ2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544129997#wasThisHelpful","RWNXORQSPCQ2J","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to like this.  As anyone who has gone through terminal illness in the family, there is one part identification warring perhaps with the personal ""ownership"" each of us has.  Making us irrationally possessive of the experiences and insights.  Basically it is coping and grief.  Don't believe me?  Bring up whatever terminal illness experience you have to someone and I guarantee you will get one or more back.  Unasked.  Which I just did in a kind of round about way.So I do think in some cases if identification isn't immediate or overwhelming, it is easy to get a little irate at times. It is easy to let little things bother you.  The same could be said when the tone and style is such/And that is the case here.  I truly appreciate the candor the author explores.  I just wish he and his editor have worked a bit on the sincerity.  In no way am I saying he never felt the things he is describing.  Sometimes funny sometimes profound and mostly poignant.  But he just tries too hard in his writing for me.  Way too hard.  It is overly glib in a manner when he clearly is trying to illustrate the whole ""before"" aspect.  And how shocking and funny and edgy and outrageous and irreverent he and his family were.  It comes off to me a bit of a, dare I say, humblebrag?  It is like ""look at how awful this series of events we were handed and yet isn't it outrageous how we were still able to be such outrageous people who didn't do the ""normal"" thing and just be outrageous?!?!?Again I get it,  I have giggled in funeral homes and while absently rubbing the fine but startling copious amounts of hair off my arms post-chemo told a telemarketer over the phone that unless she had a cure for my illness that had me bent over a toilet for hours, I wasn't interested.  And if she didn't believe me I would put the phone on speaker next time I was in the same situation in a few minutes.  Thing is i do understand I am looking into his situation.  His grief.  His coping.  And there were plenty of moments  when I did smile and relate and be incredibly overwhelmed at my safe remove that whatever tragedy I have experienced, even if I felt it equal, was not the same.But I felt all the good was too over shadowed by what I felt was the deliberate attempt to tell the story in a certain way.  A way I felt deprived the story of the authenticity that could have come through the whole book.  Instead the arc felt scripted.  The arc from over privileged and obtuse self-involved family who relies on the underlying truth of loving family being conveniently camouflaged by wry and witty and slightly bitter facade.  To get pulled back and the true depths explored.  Yes it was real.  But it still felt like a bad holiday movie coming to a theater near you.Again though.  I am not discounting the experiences given here.  Simply the style in which they were presented to me as a reader.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21HWCZC0597OJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VE4Y2IC#wasThisHelpful","R21HWCZC0597OJ","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a bit disappointed in this.  I did not want a thoroughly modernized take on the story of David, but I was hoping for something a bit richer.  Something that made him the main character of a novel rather than an almost detached recounting of his story as I remember it from the Bible.David seems too removed with another as a narrator.  He ends up lacking the complexity that is arguably one of the most interesting in the Bible.  David was the epitome of the warrior king who basically saves his own culture and expands it.  War was such a defining point of his life; playing the role of shaping his character and shaping his relationships.  The flip side being how a man of culture he turns out to be win war is no longer the main role he pursues.And yet that all falls a bit flat with the remove that the author employs.  Lots of tell and not much show is almost criminal in such a book.  Delving into the nature of a man who perseveres over many chances of betrayal only to commit his own later on in the name of love is a fascinating dichotomy that should encourage an author to peel back the layers and even indulge a bit in fictional exercise.  But I felt that not only did that not happen, but Brooks is deliberate in that regard.  Making for a dull main subject and a slow story in what is actually a rather short novel","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11NTLR46M50PZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02CHS#wasThisHelpful","R11NTLR46M50PZ","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What makes for hilarity is to tap into the most absurd of the everyday.  And this is captured so well in this collection of Reza Faramand's book here.  I laughed out loud plenty of times in a short read.  It is pictures after all...but not all pictures.  There is a great section with the author that is just as funny and sharp.But this is the type of book that if it does not make you laugh, even silently, there is something wrong.  With it.  You are fine.  I'm sure....really I am.With an almost bitter insight that can be scathing, the everyday is turned on its head and given a good shaking.  Just in case I was not clear enough bitter and scathing are definitely in my wheelhouse.This is a book you will read more than once.  Plus if you own it you can leave it out for others to see and check out.  And either share in its wit or provide you with plenty of superior feeling scorn at the other person's lack.  Either because you hated it and can feel smug seeing them enjoy it.  Or vice versa.

"This is not some brilliant book that will redefine its genre.  And I find that the prose can sometimes be a little too affected.  The dialogue trying a bit too hard to be wry and witty.That said, this is a fun book.  It is also a book that I felt needed the first one under the belt to enjoy.  Steinmetz takes his creation and characters and expands immensely.  With a pace that is driving and absorbing at the same time.  Detail does not get in the way of the story itself and the plot is nicely padded out by the author's imaginative elements.I do find that overall the storytelling is rather linear and singular.  One event piles on top of the other in a sequence that can seem, well, too much of a sequence.  Except that I do not mean this to be a criticism.  This is simply that type of book for me.  And it seemed deliberate and written in a way that brings out the positive aspects of that type of story.  It provides a wonderfully realized setting and world and yet also keeps a pace that is nicely compelling.  Motivations are kept simplistic and well defined in a way.  Somehow this manages to be a nicely complex tale and yet doesn't get in its own way by being too convoluted.  I guess Steinmetz is more of an author that builds on his previous elements more than say, another author who tries to weave elements together in the moment but leaves much of the thread yet unresolved.  Either done well, work to produce good solid greatly entertaining fiction. And that is definitely the case here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39KCU9QEBR0O7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3OVU3Q#wasThisHelpful","R39KCU9QEBR0O7","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was severely underwhelmed.  And then disappointed.  I so wanted this to be my fall book.  The one I huddle down for a weekend, eat food right out the container while devouring this and then wondering how long I have been sitting in that position.Instead?  Instead after a hundred pages or so the book becomes plodding.  And I know some of that is on me.  I'm not rooting for Strike and robin to get together.  Sad to say I'm not a teenager anymore.  I can see a male and a female related to one another get to know one another and not immediately start writing their names together in my Trapper Keeper.  I was hoping Rowling was now smart and experienced enough to realize how dull and trite and simply boring having the whole ""will they won't they' aspect take such center stage. Then again I remember how cloying and incredibly bad her writing was in the Harry Potter books as she wallowed in wish fulfillment school girl romantic fantasies.  And I realized it could get worse.  in fact with her twist on the matter I suspect it will.  Get very very worse.Another thing that stood out and basically hit me over the head as to how plodding and bloated and directionless this was, was when she dragged out yet another character drenched in Rowling's gleeful self-absorbed accent beleaguered dialogue.  I suspect many love this.  I find it silly and over affected.  Telling a story should be first and foremost.  This silly amount of gee gaw on her part goes to an extreme in this entry.  I know she has done it in the past two books and Harry Potter had its hare.  But anything that is deliberately obstructionist seems to go against simple story telling rules.  It adds nothing for me.  And if she dropped it and spent some time on an actual compelling plot in this one, I would have been thrilled.Because that was a huge problem for me here.  The book's plot was incredibly thin.  In good part because it centered more on Strike and Robin.  In the crime way.  It was too involving at this point and combined with their personal humdrum but overly detailed personal lives stole the heart and soul out of it for me.  Why she also thought it was cute to drag out the suspects as she did is beyond me.  Past page 400 and I just wanted it over.  I did not care who did it.  I did not care if Robin or Strike was in danger.  I did not care.  To find myself thinking that in a Rowling/Galbraith book only third entry in the series and I find that almost heartbreaking when I think how much I loved the first two.And then the harebrained idea of writing the criminal's pov?  In such a trite way?  Trying to imbue tension suspense with such heavy handed brutality that is almost inhumanely rote in her telling?  For me it did not make me want him to be caught.  To get his comeuppance.  All I could think was psst.  hey Jennifer?  Or is it Jenny?  Put down the flat gratuitous violence and just write some great story why don't you?  Shock doesn't work in this kind of book.Did anyone who likes to get a little sloshed (safely of course) think about taking a shot every time the villain is almost seen but something catches Robin or Strike's eye?  Are dead or in an alcohol induced coma yet?And this is not a spoiler.  Not even for the events in this book let alone any next.  But all I can say is Matthew might as well start wearing red shirts.  Nothing but red shirts.  I hope I am wrong.  Not because i like the character of Matthew.  I don't.  In fact I find Robin's relationship with him completely implausible at this point.  And Rowling shows how little she has not grown in the fact that she cannot for the life of her add any nuance or facet that would suggest he is nothing but a flat trope to the series and will add nothing but being the main obstacle to yet 'well they won't they'  more silliness.  Because a main male character and a main female character have to get together.  Or at least have that be one of the main constant themes.  Because that has always worked so well for any series in pop culture.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C6LK8IPXNT1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316349933#wasThisHelpful","R2C6LK8IPXNT1T","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On first read I thought this was a bit like the Russian nesting dolls.  A thought that as soon as I had it was trite and a bit too easy (and not just considering the title and the intertwined stories).So rewind (slight nod to the cover image).  Instead it is like a set of Legos.  not kidding.  And not trying to be glib or clever.  But rather there is a wonderful sense of these stories interlocking.  And building something.  Laying a foundation for the next story to expand and enrich and touch on in some way.  Sometimes predictable (and yet rewarding) and sometimes surprising.  And even surprising in that what weaves through I found surprising.  Making me ask and wonder why such was a surprise.Marra has a wonderful stlye but I do think it is somewhat unique.  I will say that anyone who sets this aside after only one story/segment is cheating himself.  That is not to say that every reader should love this or even like it.  But the effort (and for me it was a clear execution) of Marra in crafting this whole book would be missed and the reading experience wasted.  There is a small quiet precision to each story that makes the whole a wonderful read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25LH66H9EWPQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKO3UOM#wasThisHelpful","R25LH66H9EWPQ2","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Three stars may seem like I don't like this.  Or I don't like it enough.That would be wrong.  But also might be my fault if I don't succeed in explaining myself.  Or even if I do!Hurley has always been a tough read for me.  Both her science fiction trilogy (and the short works associated with that) and this ongoing series) bear a style that simply is more work for me than I care to take on most days.  Some days I do.  Which is why I want to say that I don't dislike this series.  Or rather this book.  But simply that try as I might I find the style is a detraction not a plus.And yet here, even more than her previous works, the aspect of Hurley I like is front and center.  She has created a world (more than one but here I mean the plane of setting if you will) that is frightening.  Rich.  Surprising.  Exotically intriguing. Complex.  All things I love.  Yet in her hands it is not only a set of compelling elements, it also seems to get in the way sometimes.  To the point I have to struggle to stay engaged.  There is just something here that does not grab hold of me without something else a few pages later losing me.In the end I finished and was glad I did.  Hurley's plots and ideas are unique and intriguing.  Her prose though is dense and while it does not meander, I do think it twists on itself in ways I just do not care for.  Kay Kenyon's series The Entire and the Rose (I hope I got that right) started the same way and I ended up loving it.  I just think this is one of those works that I keep trying to connect with and keep missing by a small and frustrating margin.  Great enough to want the next work in hopes it does.  Selfish enough to dread pushing myself to reading another big novel and feeling the same level of slight disappointment I felt finishing this.It is definitely one of those books where I strongly feel the number of stars is solely a matter of my taste and less some other reviews where I felt my taste was a broader and more general regard.  Not (or not as much for me) for me does not mean it isn't for a different and quite well be broader audience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E85RQR89COVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3OVU7W#wasThisHelpful","R3E85RQR89COVX","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm bumping this up a star (or a half star I guess) because I am a David Wong fan.  Not out of charity but because as a fan I think the book delivers most of what I want from David Wong.  His wit and funny slant on things.  His pop culture references that are sometimes almost lovingly awkward.  And often as not darkly funny.  His love of action scenes that translates into wacky and yet thrilling moments I found myself emerging almost dazed pages later.So David Wong gave me many elements of what I want from a David Wong book.However I will say that this is not the tight and gripping read his other two books were for me.  In between those great moments are not almost just as great moments.  I felt that it did not have the smooth background richness the other two books did.  The simple patter between characters never comes alive either.  So it felt more like a great fan fiction of a David Wong feeling book almost.  Or maybe the early rawer work that gets dusted off and published after an author becomes established.Overall i liked the book.  Overall though I felt there was something missing.  More than just the flow of the other two novels, more than just the smaller but just as important connective elements Wong has shown in the past.  But perhaps the deeper and more complete sense of what and where the author wants to take the reader.  John Dies At the End was such a departure for me and it never let up.  Instead the intensity of the read grew right to the end.  In This Book is Full of Spiders... I had a book that was building off the first.  And it had a smoother storytelling effort than John...This seems more like going back to the drawing board.  Yet it lacks the explosive verve of John... and it never gains the height of storytelling the two books achieve in terms of setting.I'm glad a I read it. Wong does things I see others try and just not quite pull off.  He still manages that here if in a more tepid fashion.  I just want the third book to John Dies... Not just because I feel slightly let down by this, but because it also strongly reminds me of what Wong CAN do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39VPNEVVHSWZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V37BC60#wasThisHelpful","R39VPNEVVHSWZK","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an extreme case of an imagination running full throttle.  And in some regards it produces some wonderfully realized aspects of storytelling.  In others it produces some over affected and slightly over indulgent exercises in style over substance.I am not keen on works that I feel let the style get in the way of telling a story.  So some of the oblique aspects in telling the story here simply did not work for me.  I hate to use the words gimmicks, but they did seem to be that.  As in look at what I can do/am doing that never really, when completely pared down, added to the story itself or felt intrinsic in any way.  While the story itself ended up being quite engaging.  And despite a slight feeling that some of the characters' eccentricities were a bit heavy handed, overall I was entertained and drawn in by them.But in the end I felt that the determination by the author to produce something different got in the way of delivering something as good as it could be.  I felt there was too much sacrifice on the part of simply fleshing out a good strong narrative that flowed and communicated clearly to me, the reader.There are those that will go into more detail about what the book is about.  I won't because I feel the blurb sums it up pretty much and too much more exposition gets into some spoiler-ish territory.  This is a book that if the style of it is something you immediately find appealing, you will want to explore the story on your own with the slight but telling twists and the author's verve in crafting and delivering his characters and their plot.It took a little too much effort in the end to finish a book I was really hoping would be better.  I was kind of hoping this would be the next step in story telling that Nick Bantock's Griffin and Sabine books were.  Using some clever and witty visual elements mixed with straight old old fashioned prose.  It almost was.  But one got in the way of the other.  I'm just not quite sure which I would have preferred in the end.  Which isn't the slam it might seem.  But it also isn't the verdict an author who wants to take up permanent space on my book shelves wants to hear.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18SWTI34XBN6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3RA6Y2#wasThisHelpful","R18SWTI34XBN6T","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Interesting and yet a bit dry.  Not too long ago I read a book about the go-between's for Hitler.  A look at the various members of royalty and nobility who used their familial ties to the royal house of Great Britain to try and sway politics and make inroads into British involvement in mainland Europe's affairs.  So it was with some interest I delved into this.For those who know at most how WWI was the war between cousins (prosaically speaking), this is a nice overview of just how German the British royal family is.  Well was.  Well still is if you are looking at the DNA that makes up Britain's greatest tourist attraction (among other things less glib of course).  Palmer breaks down generation after generation of marriages with the various German houses that span petty princedoms and sweeping empires.It does get a bit too dry and the prose falters slightly.  I think part of the flaw for me was that it was treading too familiar ground in a way that was not fresh or engaging simply because it was telling me what I already knew.  For those less knowledgeable I think it might be more engaging.The other problem I had was that it seemed a large part of the book unnecessarily dwells on the relationships that precede the Hanoverians.  Yes, I do think some background is needed.  But there are some odd skips even as I felt it dwelt too long on the period of the Stuarts.  While it may outrage many, the thing is is that during the time the lines between the houses of Nassau and Oldenburg from their German counterparts was not as defined.  In some ways they were almost as ""German"" in regard to how they were intermarried into the Stuart dynasty.  By this I mean the overall theme of the Anglo-German royal connection.  Of course in many regards they weren't.  But I felt the author overlooked a small but key point in the introducing chapters dealing with the Stuarts that carried over into the Hanoverians.  and how the Dutch and Danish ties reflected the overall dynastic knot that became 17th, 18th and 19th century Western Europe then going into the 20th century and two world wars.But overall a decent read and a nice overlook of royal marriages and a ruling house's familial culture.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R9GR1VTPBF5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016YHM56Y#wasThisHelpful","R1R9GR1VTPBF5W","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Strong solid look at Hannibal which I found engaging and well written.Bradford is not unbiased in how he looks at Hannibal.  There is both a strong current of looking at Hannibal through the Romans' eyes.  I.e. the winners. but he also goes in the opposite direction at times which feels slightly forced and yet at the same time provides a nice balance.As a devotee of Republican Rome, this is not a huge leap from classical sources many such as myself will find already familiar.  However it provides a wonderfully tight readable narrative for those looking to expand their general knowledge beyond elephants over the Alps.  Giving a broader sense of what the world looked like at the time, how this man fit in that world and how he changed it.

"To borrow slightly from others, I found this both an event and a read.  An event in that it is almost mind boggling all the disparate story lines and approaches there are to the DC overall myth/legend/universe.  To be frank I'm not sure I know enough of it to actually appreciate how much this collection spans.Story wise I was even confused at certain points.  So I can't give it all the analysis perhaps it deserves.What I did like, and I think in such a vast work, there is something for every DC universe fan, was the background and reference work.  Not just as an expository element but simply as a look into the creative process of the whole thing.  Revealing a wonderful gamut of style and story building process.  And, for me, a nice touch of humor as it worked in the ideas of comics into a comic.I also really liked the different approaches to story that also paid homage to different eras and different takes on stories that have remained the same and yet always tried to deliver a fresh slant in so many ways.My favorite art was definitely Jim Lee's segment.  His use of lines is always so nicely real and yet wonderfully accentuated to convey the wonder of it all for me.  And he did not disappoint.  But there are many other pieces of art that either bring the overall story to vivid life or carefully explore a trope tied to past eras or certain explorations of the DC universe.  For fans deeply immersed in the DC culture, I'm not sure where this fits.  But for me, and I think fans in general of DC, this is a treasure trove that I think might surprise on some point but will deliver in the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OH10R1ALX6XU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0159C1Z1Q#wasThisHelpful","R3OH10R1ALX6XU","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was introduced to David Rakoff via his appearances on the Daily Show.  His dry morbid wit and look at life was hilarious engaging and sometimes a bit disturbing.  Disturbing in the way he find the surface humor immediately but it might take a second to capture the underlying bitterness.  What made his wit and humor work so well, is that underneath much of the apparent bitterness was a sense of humor that was often surprisingly warm.Here is a wonderful collection of his work that is a must for fans.  It is also a nicely disparate array of his talent that readers new to Rakoff will likely find something to enjoy and appreciate and savor.  I had read his last work which is odd and brilliant.  Short succinct it begs re-reading.  Much of the other work here is the same.  But wonderfully different.  Rakoff always has a distinct biting voice that somehow tricks me with a seemingly lazy facade.  It sneaks up on you, I think and lingers.For a life cut too short, this is a wonderful gift to fans and a gem waiting to be discovered by a new audience for something that can deliver both a bite and a stroke along the cheek.  Often at the same time.  Life is richer with Rakoff even if he often seems to tear it apart.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36LB2CH5TPFA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U4UXRYW#wasThisHelpful","R36LB2CH5TPFA7","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I vary on Mitchell.  Black Swan Green is still my favorite of his works.  And Cloud Atlas my least.  So that gives everyone else a starting point I guess for where to file this.Slade House is not Mitchell at his best.  But it is still a fine work that in many ways is very much a David Mitchell novel. There is plenty of weirdness.  Both of the slightly off kilter kind that fits in with a wonderfully creepy ghost story/haunted house novel and of the outright weird but completely rational approach Mitchell employs to define and explain other worldly nature of his tale.Short, gripping, the tale spreads out over a span of years with varying points of view that connect through the titular eerie abode.Mitchell delivers each segment of the story in a way that even as certain elements are predictable they are no less affecting.  This is a perfectly timed release for the season that almost demands grim chill weather if not after dark reading.  Mix in the atmospheric clatter of leaves in a strong sudden wind and you have just the right mix of reading experience to creep yourself out and deliver something layered and complex beyond just scaring yourself silly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDVUSDGJOU942/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3RILQW#wasThisHelpful","RDVUSDGJOU942","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this book in small bites.  I found if I read more than one segment/chapter back to back, I found it too preachy and lost momentum.I should say that Theroux has always been slightly too weighty in prose.  Many (or even most) readers find his descriptive powers to be amazing and his works must reads.  I have to say up front that is not the case for me.  My tastes, good or ill, run otherwise.  Here, as in hin other works, I just find his prose lacks a crisp clarity.  Yes it can be powerfully descriptive.  But at the heart perhaps it taps into insecurities and issues that I should be paying hundreds an hour to unlock.  Or in simpler terms I just feel that I am reading the words of someone who thinks and wants everyone else realize, is the smartest person in the room.  I am too strong a believer, right or wrong, that books should be a form of communication.  And here I feel that Theroux often seeks to write to a singular audience.  Instead of trying to convey his ideas to a wide one, there is almost a style that speaks towards a clique if you will.  Those conversations you hear that exclude anyone but a subset of people in that group.  In some ways the oblique style of structure and use of certain words is the literary equivalent of sitting on the edge of a conversation that taps into nothing but common ties for a few.Not sure if that makes sense to anyone but myself, but I prefer books that might challenge me but not in a way I feel wants me to fail.  Or feel like I just can't quite keep up.I also did not care for some of the heavy handed too singular views on the whole idea of fixing problems closer to home.  There seemed too much emphasis on giving money to ""there"" instead of ""here"" that didn't address the fact that if you look close enough you realize amid the waste and greed and corruption, there is more than plenty in a capitalistic world economy for both 'here' and 'there'.  Many of Theroux' observations I found myself agreeing with and then following with a ""but...."".  Which was frustrating as it went along since some of it was so strongly a black and white issue in his regard but not be me.So why four stars?  Because it does capture a moment that lingers despite the irrationality of the matter.  Because it captures again and again a segment of life and society that is either romanticized or simply ignored.  And it all has ties and binds to the rest of us that I think we simply do not get in a way.  It takes someone to explore it and do so as both an outsider and someone who gets his foot in the door so speak.  It takes time and consideration.  And while I don't always care for the manner of delivery, I do greatly appreciate here, Theroux' consideration on the matter.  It is thoughtful and deliberate and I never feel like it is not explored with the care and a certain respectful elegance that never loses sight of what it means socially and culturally for the subject matter and the subtle but complete way it speaks to all of us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BFA924KUDUB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QPHKR0K#wasThisHelpful","R2BFA924KUDUB0","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those probing looks at a current matter (or recent matter) that leave me almost stunned that I live in the 21st century.  At the heart of the matters of politics, faith and culture (and gender too) is that such inhumanity still arises and does so in a fast and wide spread affecting manner.  Warrick captures what should terrify (without panicking or lashing out thoughtlessly) us about ISIS even as in Black Flags, we get an already Gordian Knot of misinformation and knee jerk grandstanding on the organization and the overall matter.  Which is probably why I use the word terrify.  Warrick doesn't just delve into the whys and wherefores of who and how and what ISIS is.  But does so in a way that shows some of the clear factors in their rise.Warrick balances well most of the factors within the geographical culture as well as the outside impositions.  Whatever agenda is behind the book, it does not interfere with ( rather dense at the start) the concise and quickly gripping account of how and what this organization came to be.  It also captures the nebulous ""lightning in a jar"" sequence of events and moves that make ISIS so successful now and yet underscore how nebulous in turn their power might be.  And as Warrick seems to perfectly understand, as bad as ISIS is, in five or ten years what will fill a void ISIS creates if they are removed?  Or simply become mitigated by their own extremities?  Warrick hits the target here for me because the area itself is not something we can flip a switch and make better.  Because better is hampered in so many ways by our own mindsets and culturally formed ideas.  With an upcoming election that will likely hit on this in some way as a trigger point, Warrick's study becomes all the more compelling since it makes an effort, and mostly succeeds, at pulling back the rhetorical rock and seeing what scurries out of the light.  Something I think politicians either won't or simply can't do.  Even as they try to use the matter for their own self-interest.What makes this such an engaging read, for me, was that even when I did not agree with a few points that Warrick makes, the assertions are not a black and white matter.  And that is captured perfectly here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O3AK6E9B10HH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RRT346E#wasThisHelpful","R1O3AK6E9B10HH","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Higgins delivers a solid read that has a few flaws but much to otherwise recommend it.What it has working for it is a seamless match of science fiction and mystery.  The plot is engaging and the science I found plausible and did not drag the plot down at all.  I say this with a bumper sticker on my car that reads ""All the Science I know, I learned from the Big Bang Theory'.  Okay that is a lie.  But it gives anyone who cares a sense of where I am on science in science fiction.  An author would have to go really far to disrupt what I believe could be possible in a fictional framework if he or she abides by the parameters set in the book.  So for those with a much stronger scientific background and a need for plausibility, I am afraid I can't help you.  For me it works.  The rules are made, make sense as presented and don't vary in some sort of attempt to save a plot hole.The mystery is less strong, but I found that did not matter much.  It still kept up its end so to speak if it let is end dip a little.What I found could be off-putting is that the style of writing seems to be a bit flat and even bland at times.  For a short novel, I found the pace to lack a stronger level of engagement.  There lacks the driving suspense that would have made this a top notch thriller.  Still I am definitely going to check out the next book to see where the author goes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6EDTBBDYAO70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04IRHM#wasThisHelpful","R6EDTBBDYAO70","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a huge Atwood fan.  That probably makes me a bit of an odd reviewer of this in some ways.  As always with any Atwood I have read, it immediately grabs just a few pages in at most and then putters.  Emotionally.  Grim, bleak and threatening (this is not ALL Atwood novels I have read, just most), it seems almost too deliberate and flattens any suspense.  It is like going into a teen horror movie and trying to pick which character to be emotionally invested in.  Turning out, none being your best bet.Atwood is a stellar writer.  And this is how and why she is able to draw me in and cause such an affect right away.  And she does that here.  What is even more interesting is somehow I don't like Stan or Charmaine.  I don't dislike them.  But I just find them disquieting and Atwood somehow takes this bleeding heart and in a chapter makes Stan and Charmaine those ""other people"".  People you immediately see as being much less fortunate.  People in need but not needing.  The people who might drop money in a hat or jar for but want to move on immediately.Because what Atwood captures so vividly and yet in a quiet nuanced manner, is the deeply affecting sense that so many of us have.  That misfortune is contagious.  That it sucks in people who try to alleviate it.  This is a myth.  But it is so compelling and Atwood simply gets it here.And in typical Atwood fashion there are moments that, while not laugh out loud funny, are still worth a silent chuckle and plenty of appreciation of the plausibly absurd.  Her deft ability runs through the whole novel, if in a more than Atwood usual manner for the most part.I did not enjoy this book.  But I was entertained and it made me think a bit further past my usual boundaries.  It was a book, so it didn't change my life or give me heavy deep thoughts to last me the rest of my days, mind you.  But it engaged on many levels during my reading.  Atwood is quite good at that.  It also was a depressing and slightly laboring read plot wise.  The characters do become ones I could empathize with and care for.  But overall it was a very interesting take on a theme that has and probably will get a considerable fictional look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20R4LEF4NJA2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RRT33EC#wasThisHelpful","R20R4LEF4NJA2N","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Collaborations can be tricky.  I just read a wonderful one in fantasy and it was seamless and smooth.  Here it is a little rougher.  I feel, rightly or wrongly, where the two different authors are.  It is two authors I felt that wrote this as opposed to the better and more enjoyable read of two authors coming together and somehow making a book seem like it was written by a single writer.  Or a third writer  if you will -- the two styles and voices combining into a seamless single, third, writer.That does not make this a bad book in any way.  The singular strengths of the two do work well together.  But I did feel a slight pull in one direction that did not merge completely into one voice.  On the one hand you have some really engaging intrigue that compels and delivers some wonderful tension and suspense.  I found myself wanting to know all the whos/whats/whys of the main plot and I felt that the story does a great job of keeping it not just interesting but also highly plausible.  And it is the plausibility that is both a strength and a weakness.  Shoring up that suspension bridge of disbelief rather nicely is some science that simply becomes a bit too miring and even pedantic.  It is nice in some ways that the detail is there because it avoids the fault of many books that simply serves up the plot and expect the reader to swallow whole everything.  Its' ""Just So"".  This type of writing only works for me if everything else is simply perfect.  A rare thing.  So I am glad we get so many of the things that serve to underpin the structure of the setting and much of the plot.  But here is where the separation makes itself known the most.  We get some serious info dumping.  And it broke the pace just a bit.  In one author's hands I might have had a more enjoyable transition and melding.  But in a single author's hands I might have also not gotten the expertise and style the other brings.Overall I enjoyed this book.  I thought the characters were nicely crafted and the plot itself was sharp and tense and for the most part compelling.  I thought the detail and what it added to the plot and the ideas it provided to convey a setting both familiar and just slightly different from our own to provide an engaging contrast extremely well done.  It just had a few rough spots here and there as it all tried to come together.  On the highway of reading, no construction issues that force a delay but some less than perfect spots of construction that might prompt a reduction in speed once or twice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KHX9LUVY027D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00USMCJX6#wasThisHelpful","R3KHX9LUVY027D","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some very interesting ideas get mashed in with some incredibly trite and overly predictable elements. Then get divided into two.  Each becomes a story --- a culture in trees, with way too many of the predictable elements; the other being an advanced spacefaring story.  And then the author brings them together in a rough meld that then plays on even more overly predictable elements.Sadly this just never engaged as fully as I wanted or even expected.  Again some interesting ideas get buried among some plot elements I just think have been done to death already and Moffitt does not put enough effort into making them his own or even integral to the two plots that eventually become one.  Decent prose just never brings it up to a level that would make this a book I would brag about reading (as in 'I just read this great book).  I think if anyone is a fan of the author or simply looking for a workable if not inspiring science fiction read that doesn't demand much of the reader in basically the same way it doesn't deliver as much.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KVMT1I4MCTYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VL0WCQ8#wasThisHelpful","R1KVMT1I4MCTYT","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like Sarah Monette's writing.  I like Elizabeth Bear's writing.  Both have produced books I've greatly appreciated and both have produced books I've had to work at and ended being a bit underwhelmed by.  But as a team, I have loved all three of the Iskryne books.  I cringed a bit at the graphic nature of the male-wolf bond and how it translated over into the human aspect of sexuality.  But it was also as realistic as it was graphic and, while I could see how it rubbed some people the wrong way, it never fell into some kind of exploitative exercise.  Something I cannot say the same for in even much tamer depictions.The second book took the strong characterization and plotting and expanded it a bit into larger and more complex world building and allowing the plot to expand as well.Here we get the fruition of that in an even broader, but no less complex and detailed story.  Complete with wonderfully varied new characters that play off the expansion as we are given even greater views of the world and its events.Bear and Monette play off each and greatly enhance the aspects of their writing that I enjoy in each.  Bear does great immersions of characters in their world.  Her worlds ring with a nice exoticism as well as a great sense of permanence -- she does what great world builders do, they not only bring it alive in the moment but add the sense of deep history and culture that never bog down in info dumping but simply are there as part of the characters and the plot.  Monette's strength seems more character oriented.  Both are also good at what the other seems to excel at.  But here it is a nice process of polishing only the finest of facets as they meld and merge effortlessly, the collaboration is a smooth and engrossing read that feels exactly as it should.  Two extremely great authors on their own managed to combine and create a third writer in a sense.This is a book that definitely depends on the previous two volumes in my eyes.  Maybe because I am drawing so much from them as I read this.  But maybe with new narrators and characters a novice could jump right in and enjoy this.  I suggest you read the first two prior to delving into this. But I do strongly suggest you get to this as soon as you can!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HMRYJEJ4BMHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V34YHQ0#wasThisHelpful","R2HMRYJEJ4BMHI","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ostlund delivers a strong thoughtful debut novel that provides many personal glimpses amid a large general notion of what it feels like to be one of the disconnected.  It is hardly a new idea to explore in fiction.  Feeling out of sync with the rest of the society around us is an idea most of us can identify with even if it is something we can't even admit to ourselves.But what makes Ostlund'a approach so worthwhile is that she takes some extreme specifics in her cast of the socially disenfranchised, takes them almost to the point of being absurd.  And instead keeps them perfect as ""small moment' characters.  Individuals who deliver some of the tropes that feed a stereotype -- gay, overweight, etc -- and yet stay wonderfully unique and yet still delivering their ideas and personalities in a way that I think will speak to many readers.What Ostlund captures so well, is mostly in her main character Aaron.  She makes him sympathetic without being pathetic.  She makes him flawed without being scorn worthy.  And even as she explores his past and his present, the author makes sure to provide insight into Aaron that is incredibly realistic; his decisions are perfect explored as not just means for Aaron to take what he believes to be the best for himself, but as the means to move past moments, long and short, that seem a trap for Aaron.  No matter how foolish the decisions seem, Ostlund does a masterful job of making the character incredibly believable as he makes them.  Never falling into the trap of moving Aaron around a board of events the author feels is the main element of the story.  Aaron is the story.  And he and his supporting cast make for a rich and fulfilling read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UDC1F3DAM1O8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WX0Y#wasThisHelpful","R2UDC1F3DAM1O8","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember Mary McGrory getting mentioned in a few college journalism courses.  But she was sadly overlooked in my opinion after reading this great biography.  It also underscores how much she and others have been overlooked for some of their more attention grabbing associates who used television as their career path.  It also hammers home a bias against many of those same people.  In many ways, Mary's story is the story of modern journalism.  One that I feel no longer exists.  But time to slide the soapbox away and simply mention what I liked about this great book.First is the style.  Norris does a great job of not just delivering a rousing and compelling read, a biography that juggles telling Mary's story as well as delving into the fascinating events and people around her.Second is the detail.  Spanning so much could be an overwhelming read.  Yet Norris keeps things in the right perspective, paying the right amount of attention to events that are pretty widely known, and pulling back the curtains on the finer points I never expected.  And keeping Mary right in the center.  Not only where she was professionally, but where a book that rightly illustrates how pivotal a position Mary not only enjoyed but also by her own efforts and skill, achieved.Whether you want insight in Mary, her role as a female journalism in a male world, or just want a good read that captures so many historical moments with a fresh insight that also feels informative.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QJRPL86PZYDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY3ZOF0#wasThisHelpful","R1QJRPL86PZYDN","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Megan Chance mixes and melds a few of the popular trends in the new YA market of a certain type.  A young woman discovers herself and explores conflicts and confusions along the way.  This is of course a broad trend that covers everything from The Hunger Games to, well, this.  It is broad and seems to contain a multitude.What makes this stand on its own is Chance's eye to description, and appreciation, for her setting.  Venice is captured extremely well, likely appealing to both the reader who has a familiarity as well as the arm chair traveler.  Chance makes sure to balance her setting with actual action.  While her ability to set the scene is her strongest, she does do a more than adequate job of making sure the story itself moves.What I did not care for was the lead character.  I found her too credible.  To deliberate in not asking some of the most obvious ""right' questions in the moment.  Yes, in some cases that would mean a much shorter book.  But in some ways, the weakness of the narrator dragged the book out and made it too frustrating in terms of plausibility instead of heightened suspense.In the end, I did not think the negatives outweighed the positives, but put in pretty much in the middle of the pack.  For those looking for a something of a slightly different approach to the usual YA fare, this might punch that ticket.  If anything you will get a nice glimpse of the author's view of Venice.  Which is pretty darn nice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUWDP2ASXESYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOV0TZ2#wasThisHelpful","RUWDP2ASXESYO","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had a spotty history with Groff.  I loved Monsters of Templeton.  Didn't care for Arcadia.  And of course, felt about half of her story collection was good and the rest mediocre or just disliked them.  So it was interesting to take on her new work and see how it fell.Like Monsters... this starts off with an almost disparate set of set ups despite them revolving around the married couple of Mathilde and Lotto.  Disparate because I felt there are a series of feints, if you will about where the book and its characters are going.  And disparate because certain narrative conventions are ever so slightly twisted.  And yet Groff manages to do with slight series of shifts in where the book is going without it feeling like a manipulative set up for some kind of stunning twist.This is both a plus and a negative.  A plus because it calls back to the style I ended up loving in Monsters.  Nuance was the key there as Groff explored ways to pay homage and still twist certain tropes and subvert certain subgenres; and yet for me ended re-inventing them both.Here is the same idea at the heart, but for the negative, I think she takes too long to get to where she finally wants to go with the story.  Also there is a different set of ideas she goes after and I don't think the notion of marriage and her main characters fit in that type of approach.However what saves this is her characters.  Lotto and Mathilde are wonderfully crafted.  They bring the glamour and Groff uses them to bring the book alive in the second half in a way that brings together certain ideas that seem to have stalled in the first half.  Groff manages to create a book that's first half works as a hindsight as the second picks up, shifts direction slightly and picks up the pace.  But by the end, I appreciated that the almost odd pacing in the first half set up so much that then took off in the second.  While about fifty pages in I thought I was going to tap out on the book, I was not just glad to keep going but I actually liked the little bit of work I had to put into it.  In fact if I had to gamble I think Groff almost challenges her readers to commit.  A nice conceit on my part in a book about a marriage and the individuals that struggle to define it even as they each try to define themselves and each other.  Their efforts, in Groff's hands, is a fascinating novel that raises plenty of questions in ways unexpected.  The answers depend on the reader I suspect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QC85FPA3BXE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI0B5VW#wasThisHelpful","R1QC85FPA3BXE3","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While somewhat predictable and treading some rather familiar ground, Of Sorrow and Such is a wonderfully written complex short tale that has an almost perfect mix of plot and character.  In Slatter's hand, there is just the right amount of world building that uses a somewhat (to this reader) fictional society that lets her provide the right amount of atmosphere without sacrificing other elements of the story.  It is a bit simplistic but it works so well since it has a nice rich take on the vague but identifiable aspects of where the story takes place.  We have the village that embodies aspects that could take place in a period of a couple of hundred years in our own western society.  But it does not really matter since Slattery uses it in just the right amount.In her hands we also get some rather typical tropes.  Witchcraft and persecution.  Villagers superstitious and hypocritical and yet dependent on the main characters skills and talents.  But the story telling is tight and has a nice amount of suspense.  Both complete in and of itsself, but also providing enough glimpses into the setting overall that made me hope for more set in this world if not exploring the further adventures of some of the characters.Tor.com has managed to provide some rather stellar short works that manage to give plenty of story in a short form and introduce some rather talented authors that in terms of time and money has proven to greatly appreciated by this reader.

Reiss' The Sunset Mantle, Slattery's work here shows great things can come in small packages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA2FBUJ4CW5JZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDVL10W#wasThisHelpful","RA2FBUJ4CW5JZ","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Though not without some flaws, Snyder presents a strong and compelling look at how the Holocaust was enabled.  With a different approach, Snyder explores what statehood meant going into Nazi expansion and occupation.I do think some of the analysis followed Snyder's premise a bit too closely at times; some of the compares did not look at Hitler and the Nazis ethnic views as much as needed.  He does a good job of exploring the issue, but I think he ends up leaning towards the matters that support his thesis.But as a study of some of the issues that focus on the reaction of the states themselves which either enabled or staggered or simply halted the Holocaust's agenda, this stands quite strongly by itself.  An important work on an issue that not only defined a generation but also permeates how we as a world wide society move through conflict and still perceive matters of ethnicity and even faith.  History, no matter how horrific, is something we simply refuse not to repeat, in both small and large ways.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJD5V6ZH1HGRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04OVQI#wasThisHelpful","RJD5V6ZH1HGRI","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Boyd pursues a particular storytelling style here that just never comes together for me as a compelling read.  The memoir approach is a bit too removed and Amory's voice is a bit too detached and ends up being flat.  She lacks nuance and everything ends up being too predictable.  Not that this type of book needs a shock or twist, but she never seems to be an individual but rather a generic everywoman in how she deals with life and what it throws at her.  Added to that, her life seems a bit of a checklist of events that seem a bit trite at times; likely due to Amory being rather trite in how she acts and reacts in the context of those events.Readable, and even pleasant, it is still a book I don't find memorable and hardly Boyd at his best.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29GJ8SPKUHXWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPIQ2QY#wasThisHelpful","R29GJ8SPKUHXWD","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A fun and interesting continuation in this shared world series.  I think I preferred Gladstone's first episode over this.  But I still enjoyed this for what it is; a nice tight little story that I think will appeal to fans of urban fantasy.A reader plunging in might find it a bit sparse as it builds on Episode 1.  I do think it could stand alone as it provides all the details that the story is built on.  But episode I provides a bit more depth and it also provides an interesting compare to how two authors approach a similar theme.  I found Gladstone a bit more up front  And tighter.  Slattery seems more intent on providing a style and atmosphere that definitely is his own(I base this on having read Slattery's other works).  I thought there was a slight vagueness that was deliberate and rather different than Gladstone's Episode 1.  This is not a negative so much as a shift in style I found less to my taste than Episode 1.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E0IH5GCZN4YQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01549CQWQ#wasThisHelpful","R3E0IH5GCZN4YQ","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice strong entry to a serial type shared world.Up front I should say that I have not had much luck with Max Gladstone.  I was not impressed with his opening novel in his ongoing series.  Not enough to continue with it.  And I have read at least one of his stand alone shorter works (I believe on Tor.com) and found it similar in quality in terms of his style to my taste.  Just not a right fit.  So I was surprised at how much I enjoyed his set up here.This is very much both a work that establishes the premise and character of a cop drawn into a secret society that protects the unknowing world (for the most part) of magic books that can unleash devastating horrors.  This has been done before, but it is a clean tight and nice story that provides plenty of punch even as it paves the way for the shared entries that follow.It not only removed any doubts to the series started here, but also gives me the impetus to make sure to give Gladstone a second chance elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F7ON4IOBM4IO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LJZROO#wasThisHelpful","R2F7ON4IOBM4IO","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I greatly enjoyed this.  Curry provides a time and setting that feels authentic and is always engaging.  She captures the atmosphere in a way that I found rich and nicely detailed.  She sets a state that doesn't get cluttered with overly pedantic bits of information and yet it is evocative to the point that I was completely immersed.Curry also delivers a solid cast of characters that not only reflect China of this period in a brutal but intriguing manner, but also are written in a way that capture the sense of looking in on the Western World.  Curry writes with a thoughtful quietness that can seem a little slow at times but for me it carries the story style-wise.  The plot twists and turns slightly but in ways that were engrossing and in the end her characters never seemed to waver in in terms of motivation or how they become defined.  For historical fiction, this is a nice strong entry that covers a time and place that usually explored and with a quality that raises it above most novels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BBHOITHNYGJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02CMS#wasThisHelpful","R3BBHOITHNYGJG","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this somewhat engaging at the start.  However it also was burdened by relying a bit heavily on too many tropes within the theme of  good guy stuck in a bad position of his own making.  When the action started to drag, all this smaller flaws became larger and played off one another.  Highlighting each and raising the focus of what made this a bit too mediocre.I think had Holm committed to making his main character a bit more gray in morality and a bit more ruthless that provided a bit of motivation as to why a 'good guy' has no problem killing other people no matter how bad.  It seemed glib and a bit too thin that pulling a trigger can be so 'good'  for one man.  The level of mitigation employed just did not work and made the story a bit too flat in what could have been a more interesting, but probably less commercial read that ends up feeling like the tossed aside script for an actioner starring Jason Stratham or Karl Urban.  Going straight to On-Demand.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HIEDY9RLQPI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RTY0GD6#wasThisHelpful","R1HIEDY9RLQPI7","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was wavering on whether this really deserved four stars or should fall back to three.  I was feeling generous I guess.  but I did find this a wonderfully approachable book and a fast engrossing read.  Quick but not slight or thin in story or character.The reason I was thinking three, is that I felt on some level the author abandons the premise that grabs hold.  The high school angle does get full resolution in some ways, but I felt there was a bit of a cheat at the end.  Slight spoiler-ish comment on that at the end that doesn't give away actual details but a general feel so be warned.Another thing I was kind of disappointed in was that the author felt the need to have a secondary, but deeper dysfunction that I actually found too trite and too labored.  The whole secret guilt reveal lacked the punch I strongly felt the author wanted.  Maybe that makes me cold hearted, but I felt that the relationship with her daughter and her daughter's issues as a parallel to the main character's story was much more interesting.  Also I felt an almost odd disconnect when the author introduces an array of new characters that seem trite at first as the oddball cast and yet ever so briefly captured my interest and then seemed suddenly abandoned.  Yes they exit in a logical way, but it just seemed an odd focus to provide and then do so little with them.  'I am Spartacus' (this is to avoid spoilers but to provide reference once read) seemed a rich vein to explore that gets shoved aside quicker than needed.Overall Dicks writes a great set of characters and a decent story.  Some things could have come together better for me.  Some things needn't have occurred at all and others broadened.  Still it was a smooth and compelling read for the most part and had the right amount of humor that wasn't forced or heavy handed to balance the other emotions out.******SPOILER-ISH REACTION******Do go further unless you want to have a general idea greater than you already doNote to author, there are villains in high school that never get past that.  It is essentially why Facebook is a business and not dwindled away like the oughts pet rocks.  I was underwhelmed by the pull back from certain aspects of the bullying and mean girl behavior that the author employs to give an ending that is almost too pat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CAO8RMI88ISU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UG4V4KU#wasThisHelpful","R3CAO8RMI88ISU","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought this was a cute book to some extent.  But it was too affected in that regard to be as enjoyable as I thought it should.  I found the narration a bit too slight and any character complexity was sacrificed for the quirky tone that author seemed to find fascinating.  Robbing the book of any significant substance.  Instead I felt like I was being told how to react to certain moments in a way that I just never felt.  The joke where you can see the punchline well ahead of its delivery, robbing the moment of its needed surprise for fun and entertainment.  It just tried way too hard and never seemed to even try to develop the slightest nuance which would have balanced the over-affected quirky style.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GIWJFGQMKNBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6YR0KI#wasThisHelpful","R3GIWJFGQMKNBS","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First a slight confession.  I love dumplings.  I adore them.  I could fall asleep in a bed of them after taking an ambien so I would wake up to a full stomach and clean set of sheets.Second a slighter larger confession.  I have not made my own wrappers from this book yet.  I've gone the easy route of the nice solid stack from my local Asian market.  But I will.  I do plan on it.  Some day.Lao provides a wonderful primer on the matter that goes well beyond dumplings.  I love the set up in the book that provides wonderful visuals in how to go about setting up a dumpling friendly kitchen.  The listing of tools and ingredient as well as pictures to make sure there is no mistake (I actually greatly appreciate that the author makes no bones about communicating what he knows -- as opposed to any assumptions of what he thinks I should already know -- here it works wonderfully) in what I need to have ready should I want to make any of the delights he provides recipes and careful detailed instructions for.I love the combination of familiar flavors placed in a dumpling.  the Chicken and Thai basil was a huge hit.  As was the Lamb and Cumin, the spicy Beef and Shiso and the chicken saag.Fun sauces that mean you can break out a bag of your favorite already made frozen dumplings and still feel like you did your own bit.  There is even a great chart that explores combining dumplings with sauces that just typing about it makes my stomach growl.Lao goes the full soup to nuts approach with this, so not just the familiar dumplings and their immediate cousin, the bun.  He also tackles noodles and salads and of course the aforementioned soups.  There are drinks and desserts that were also a nice twist on some familiar concepts that I still haven't tried (I'm still working up to my own dough here and haven't even considered moving up to making my own noodles).This is a great book for those wanting to expand their love of the dumpling to more than ordering them from the take out menu.  Whether you want to simply trigger your appetite, expand your frozen dumpling repertoire to including some fresh and interesting new dipping sauces, take the leap to filling, folding and cooking your own, all the way to doing everything yourself, this is the book for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T1V12B7DBMUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013PDP0F8#wasThisHelpful","R1T1V12B7DBMUM","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to like this.  I do like fantasy and I actually can enjoy some of the more old fashioned approaches.  I'm hardly averse to adherence to tried and true tropes if combined with strong world building and good characterization.  And above all, a deft turn of telling a story.Sadly I found none of that here.  I did find some general story telling that I felt was been there done that.  Which again is not horrible in and of itself when told through a new and fresh imagination.But this imagination is cluttered to say the least.  The world building seems a mish mash of large ideas that never come together or are defined in a way that established the setting my mind was supposed to move through and absorbed.  Just too many concepts that never seem to be as clear or as evocative as I feel the authors were going for.The worst aspect of this though was the prose.  It was purple.  It was five adjectives in a sentence when one would do.  Many sentences seemed like the authors had lifted a bunch of the most esoteric words from a thesaurus listing  and slapped them together one after another.  Some of the usages seemed downright silly at times.  Simple sometimes is best when trying to tell a story.  Which is a basic form of communicating.  Why anyone would go out of their way to do so with as little clarity as they could was baffling to me.Last, I found that everything was too much of an extreme to find any form of investment.  The characters are too over the top in in what we are told but rarely shown.  And the showing, sadly, didn't help either.  Evil characters embody almost every single bad trait to the point of becoming caricatures.Just not a very good effort and as a first in a series, a bad bad sign of things to come.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HCOFJMNY67JC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOA8LFI#wasThisHelpful","R2HCOFJMNY67JC","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rushdie is one of those authors who has a rather particular style.  And it is definitely present in this latest offering (I'm not typing the title out it is simply too long, almost as long as what I just typed.....).I suspect that if you have read every single Rushdie novel and loved it, this will put you on the floor.  Or left smoking a cigarette in sated happiness.  But don't smoke.  it is nasty and disgusting and have you ever smelled what a smoker smells like?For new readers to Rushdie I'm guessing it will be a bit of a shock.  Either a joyous one of discovery or a kind of 'what is going on here' in terms of style.Anyway, I have had great luck with Rushdie and mediocre luck.  All with the same signature style.  So go figure.  Here I think my problem was that the scattered back and forth and all over approach to writing detracted instead of enhanced the ideas i found interesting and the significantly larger story of Geronimo.  While Dunia the ancestress figures across the novel just as large or maybe even larger, for me the story of her descendant seems to be the novel's heart.  And it gets shoved aside again and again in ways I found frustrating and even worse, boring.Granted, I knew rather quickly this was going to take a little more effort on my part as a read.  Rushdie is usually like that.  But sometimes a baby can find those dangling set of keys hours worth of fun.  And sometimes they are just a jangling annoyance.Not too much of the latter but still enough to make this a less than brilliant and enjoyable read for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12BPMU9GIU2QC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SPVZ9UM#wasThisHelpful","R12BPMU9GIU2QC","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great artwork is nicely coupled with a strong story that embodies a simple message wrapped in some rather complex ideas on that matter.  Oppression is at the root of this tale of the future distant enough to be set on colonial interplanetary societies.  Yet close enough in time to be immediately recognizable.  It is a nice mix of what is familiar in a sort of dystopian kind of way and what is identifiable as future-wish.The story is delivered nicely with the artwork, minimal and yet rich in detail.  Both serve the other nicely here and make for a smooth read that still is rich and complex enough to go back and visually take more in on a second serving.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SMR9ET572KQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632154080#wasThisHelpful","R2SMR9ET572KQI","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Follow up to Hearth's first Miss Dreamsville book, this is pretty much more of the same.  The story is different, but the tone and approach is in lock step with the previous book.  I do think this could be read without the first.  Hearth does a good job of centering her characters and establishing those that have returned in a way that defines them nicely and yet doesn't for the returning reader it doesn't get in the way.Do I like this type of book?  It is relatively harmless fun.  Slightly glib and just plain slight, it is still fun and Hearth captures her time and place in way that is probably her chief strength.  Sure there is heavy handed social commentary (pretty much what I agree with but it is a sort of revisionist approach -- her good characters are socially progressive beyond much of their own generation and self aware to the point that they could open a psychic hotline they are so ahead of their times in some regards).  And the bad characters embody pretty much all of the traits we can look back on and shudder.Hearth also likes to find redemption.  Which can be a little cloying, but it also speaks to the over nature of these books eking out the happiness that existed even in some rather horrible moments in time.  Which makes them a quick fun read.  It is all the sassy movies that combine the progressive alliances of oddball characters who triumph over brutish ignorance of some sort boiled down to a frothy feel good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TR0RP3R5JZYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42X470#wasThisHelpful","R2TR0RP3R5JZYY","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will say that this is not my favorite Holland historical fiction.  Here is a sort of detached approach that I sometimes find in her work.  In such cases, as here, I find the story is more about the characters as opposed to a more immersive style (that Holland can certainly employ) that makes you the reader with the characters as the story unfolds.  I hope that makes sense.However even in this removed style or approach, I find Holland is masterful at capturing a period and crafting a plot that seems incredibly authentic and accurate.  She captures the brutality of the times in way that proves compelling as action as well as providing a strong foundation for character motivation.Any Holland, I find worth the read.  Even one such as this that suffers in compare to, say Great Maria or Firedrake, is still pretty darn good historical fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PSJMQBO8INIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EIIFXI#wasThisHelpful","R3PSJMQBO8INIU","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bill Clegg employs a style that I found a little off putting at first.  As already noted, this is very much a tell and and not show type of story.  Which is not my favored form of narrative.  As this is a novel driven by the various characters' introspection, this is not as bad as it might seem.  However it still made for a slow read for me.What strength lies in this is Clegg's ability to delve into grief and how it can define someone and how that same someone can try and resist any such definition.  Here the slow almost meandering approach works well.  And it is the heart of the story itself.  So it is the style itself I guess I had problems with.  Completely subjective of course.  But it was enough to make me wonder, and wish, to read Clegg's ability to capture grief in this way but with a different narrative approach.  There were so many small moments that I, on one hand, was completely moved by and yet at the same time felt was deflated a bit emotionally by the manner in which it was delivered.I do think Clegg is a new voice that is almost startling in some of his skills in the area of completely tapping into the moment he sees and feels and conveys through his lead character.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWEXWHEK4DBKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WT2Q#wasThisHelpful","RWEXWHEK4DBKF","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Gregg is simply masterful in examining not just the similarities and differences but the reasons why such exist.  And the the possible reasons.  Which in such a work I find just as, if not more important.  Gregg's writing here was nicely balanced and made sure to avoid seeming any type of agenda as its cause.

"Once finished, I have to say that I found the title to be the funniest thing about the book.  By the blurb I was expecting (or at least hoping) for something hilarious.  And I really did not get that.  But I did get a story that was fun if not funny.  Amusing and oddly detailed in terms of a cast of characters that should not have worked and yet did.This is my first book by Dobyns so I had no idea what to expect.  But I was pleased with the end result.  There is a level of absurdity at play here that might frustrate or annoy other readers, but I found it added a nice level to the book and plot itself.  On a certain level the author is giving a wink and letting you in on the joke itself.  I think the form of narrative actually works in the story's favor in that regard.  The silliness is something shown off the bat as being a bit over the top and yet the whole paradigm of the story is that it is over the top.  Accept that and you are in for a ride that might not leave you with tears of laughter streaming down your face or a gut sore from guffaws, but it might leave a bemused and pleased smile on your face and an appreciation for a odd but tightly written fast paced novel that enjoys itself, it you will.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39NJPKFI40QSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02E1C#wasThisHelpful","R39NJPKFI40QSR","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fran Wilde delivers a nice rich story that opens a new fantasy world that begs for greater exploration.  World building can be the making or breaking of a novel for me.  Something like the one here is richly rewarding.  Wilde creates something here I found fresh and inventive  as well as extremely well described and employed.Wilde almost seems to go out of her way to incorporate her world in the story itself.  Managing to avoid infodumping and showing much of the world and motivations through the eyes of her main character, Kirit.  Kirit manages to strike the right balance.  She is an insider to her world in most ways and yet she still is able to serve as the narrative voice of discovery.  This lets Wilde deliver a stronger story that is not weighed down by forcing the reader to wade through the details of world building outside of a smooth narrative.And while I always appreciate an author that strongly follows the 'show; don't tell' rule of narration, I do think this pulls the book down a little bit at the start.  I had a rather small struggle to find the point I was completely engaged in the story.  And I think some of that was due to the immediacy of the author placing the reader into the action of the world as well as a few oddities in the world building itself.  There slight problems disappeared quickly or were addressed as the story went along.All in all I was really happy with this and immediately went to Beneath Ceaseless Skies to read the ancillary story set in the same world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16BVFDAXHF3F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDPZ58U#wasThisHelpful","R16BVFDAXHF3F4","A35OO2ZWN7ICD4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OO2ZWN7ICD4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Right off I can honestly say this is not a ""CRICKET"" hairbrush. I have been using a ""CRICKET"" for about twenty five years. I still had the same original brush until I misplaced it somewhere in my own house (old age?) I have two spares but thought after twenty five years maybe there might be a better brush out there. This isn't a better brush for me.Yes it would a easy 5 star if I had really thick hair or just thick hair in general, I don't. The bristles though thin are not very flexible. They do move if you push them back & forth with your hand or that thick hair. The handle I have to say is great. Thick with grooves in it for your hands to really hold it. A good shower brush if using one to brush your conditioners though. It's vented as well for faster hair drying if using a blow dryer.I tried using this one for almost two weeks and found it just to hard on my scalp. I do have very fine thin hair. I gave the two I purchased to my daughter in law. Her & my 8 year old granddaughter has crazy thick, long hair. They love them. They want to pick up a couple more ( stocking stuffers).

The photos I took were taken today just before this review, NOV. 7th, 2015. The leather even kept it's bright white color .I have a size 8"" wrist and there is plenty of room for a 9 - 9 1/2"" wrist easy , at least the white leather bracelet I received . The adjustable size all depends on the length of cording used for the bracelet.The width of this bracelet is  1/2"" in diameter. And the braiding of this bracelet is fairly tight. I probably wore 90% of the summer, most of the time simply forgetting it was even on.I'm going to keep my eyes open for more colors. 4 out of five simply because I would have liked to see the adjustable cord on this bracelet white like the bracelet itself.THANKS FOR READING, BYE.😄","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P6UNVRGZFW4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBBVQ0E#wasThisHelpful","R2P6UNVRGZFW4W","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They would be very impressive to anyone who would be lucky enough to receive one (or more).My husband has a beautiful case in room he keeps all his collectables.

"I reviewed this already, but I purchased this from another supplier.I have been using Therapy-G products for about 6 months or so. Though these products, the shampoo, the conditioner, this follicle stimulator & the hair volumizer are on the wow they are very costly side, I have noticed quite a change with my hair.First shampooing, leaving it in your hair for about 30 seconds to 2 minutes(all these are meant to be left on your scalp for a minimum of 30 seconds). Second this stimulator, spray on your scalp, massaging it in for a few seconds, leaving on your scalp for at least the 30 seconds. You will feel a pleasant tingle.Third, the conditioner, also leaving in for the same 30 seconds, at least. I always leave these products in for a comfortable 2 minutes or more.I stated in my first review for this stimulator,  if you have hair thinning or plenty of it on your hairbrush after brushing, try using this . If the other Therapy-G hair products are a bit to costly, this is what I would choose over the other's I use.10 to 12 pumps onto my scalp. I truly have seen very little if any hair in my shower drain or in my hairbrush.This stimulator is something I will always try be never be without.THANKS FOR READING, BYE.😄","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OQHRGSKCZVQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005514230#wasThisHelpful","R1OQHRGSKCZVQT","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wanted something different to wear. I can't wear chains around my neck , I have crazy sensitive skin, so all my necklaces have to be corded, but cords aren't always nice looking with every pendant. These pendants are perfect to be on cords.I really can't say whether they are real stones, but I can tell you that they truly are beautiful. The measurements are as stated. They did come with a 20"" very fine beaded chain. It seems pretty strong, though again I can't wear it.The stones are only glued on , so care is advised. Keeping them out of water, showers, swimming pools, any water really. I have no idea the type of glue that was used. One of my stones that was glued into the snake charm was very very crooked , I very carefully wiggled it apart. The dry glue was a thick filmy clear glue. I cleaned out the little channel where the stone sits under the head of the snake and used my wonder bond nail glue. This glue has never let me down.(I repaired the purple stone).These are beautiful pieces and for the $ , they would also make very nice , thoughtful & very inexpensive gifts.THANKS FOR READING, BYE💎","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VI0GD9LO7Y3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFP15EU#wasThisHelpful","R1VI0GD9LO7Y3Z","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first look at the set I received was they weren't really red, but more a bright orange red. All color aside I had these before & they are wonderful. This set is a bit thinner then the last set I had, but the quality is definitely still there.The last microwave I had was a commercial size, yet the glass plate in it was 12"". I now have a much smaller microwave with the same 12"" plate.They are so easy to clean, all silicone is. They really control messes & spills in your microwave.After some time they may become permanently discolored, my first set did , but that was after about several years of constant use. The second one in this set, I use when my 3 year old grandson is here. It makes an awesome placemat , it keeps his plates, bowls & cups from sliding around.it helps him to be a much neater eater🙋.The $ for both of these mats can't be beat.

"I am giving a solid 5 stars because it serves the need in which i wanted it for.I purchased a countertop icemaker, MAGIC CHEF, I LOVE IT. The issue is when I'm not making ice, and it is left plugged in, there is an indicator/power light on the ice maker reminding me it is still pugged in. Rather then plugging & unplugging the cord before & after each use, I simply plugged the ice maker into this outlet switch, flip the switch whenever I need to.It saves wear & tear on the outlet , wiggling the plug in & out because it fits so snug, plus it helps with that same wear & tear on my wrist.I already ordered a couple more just to keep in our ""electric"" drawer, it used to be my junk drawer.No you are not able to plug two into one outlet , it is to wide for that.

"I ordered one for my daughter in law's birthday. I don't know if it is actually silver or just silver coated, I can say though it's a really nice piece of inexpensive jewelry. I went and ordered 5 more for my granddaughters & a good friend for christmas.The 2 chains hooked together is about 19"". It did not come with an extension. The clasp is a lobster clasp.The chain is a fine, delicate looking chain, very pretty & feminine. The way the cross chain is through the infinity charm it most definitely will be worn like a choker .There is no connection to keep the infinity charm from moving up the chain or the cross from pulling down . The pieces aren't heavy , but gravity will play a role in wearing this necklace.I plan to stitch them together with some very fine thread making the necklace at it's longest for me.I would comfortably recommend this lovely necklace for anyone who has an affection for the infinity symbol or for the crucifix.This necklace is just a nice jesture to a friend or loved one.

"'Another great coloring book, I am always on the look out for coloring books for me. I find coloring calming , relaxing, it clears my head.Coloring Elmo, Dora the Explorer & disney princesses just don't do it.This book has 30 pages to bring these baby animsls to life. There are both domestic animals as well as wild ones. There are also factoids on the animals your coloring at the bottom the the page.Using markers or paints aren't suggested because these pages are double sided.

The pictures are very detailed, the lines in these books are also small & thin.

"I love butterflies, as much as I love cutting out snowfakes & coloring. Not being able to find my favorite coloring books ""Red farm studios "" I decided to try a few of these. I am really happy I did.The illustrations in these Dover coloring books meet my expectations.There are 45 different pages of these beautiful butterflies to choose from. The pages are double sided so paints or permanent markers will ruin the flip side. Also on the bottom of the picture to be colored, there are little factoids about the butterfly your bringing to life.On both inner front & back covers of this book are the photos of the pages in this book already colored , giving you the idea of how these fluttering beauty's should look.This coloring book does not have perforated pages, so care is to be taken when tearing them or cutying them out.4 out of 5 stars from me because the factoids should be on separate pages in the back of this book & these pages are double sided limiting you to crayons or pencils.

"These cases are beautiful.  They fit my samsung note 4 very snuggly but not to tight where it 's difficult to change them out.I purchased three of these cases.The backs of them came with a clear film on them during their shipment probably. *NOTE* I wasn't able to see this clear film,  I actually thought the cases themself were defective.  The back had wrinkles & creases in them. The film covered the backs so well I really couldn't  tell. After opening the other two I bought, I noticed the third case was completely smooth .Then I started to rub my finger along the edges of the case, lifting the film from the two cases.The designs on these cases are really nice looking. My issues are: (1) the stylus & the butterfly that came with these cases do not fit well in my phone at all. They fall right out , they simply do not  fit. (2)at the bottom of the cases where you plug your phone into for charging , the molded opening is very snug , just a bit tedious to plug in for charging.The beauty of these cases make my issues worth it. The case actually hugs slightly around the front corners of my phone protecting the corners where some cases don't. The inner side of this case is also lined very well with a textured soft feeling material so maybe getting the back design scratched or marred this case will more then likely protect your phone from a fall. *NOTE* the face of the phone may not be so lucky.

The third brush w/bristles is 5 1/4"" long , the bristlesare 1/16"" long.These three brushes I use for flowers, clouds, grass , these short bristles could paint many things on your nails. I paint birds, trees , leaves. These brushes are small yet big in punch. They hold nail polishes & acrylic paints very well, and are really easy to clean. I haven't lost any bristles from them either.They came with clear plastic open ended covers , but they don't stay on very well, unless firmly pushing them down onto the handles.

"These nail art decals are lovely. No they are not stickers. They are water decals. There are 23 flowers on each sheet. I have been doing my own fiberglass nails for a long time now. I usually use acrylic paints for my designs unless I come across gems like these.I have used water decals many times, they are rather easy to use. I take an old pill bottle cap, remove the cardboard from the inside of it (if any) cut the decal out , lay it in the cap with very warm water, or use something that will not be affected by the warm water, waxed Dixie cups are not ideal. The decal will separate from the paper on it's own after a minute or two. If it doesn't, using blunt tweezers lift it off & with those tweezers place the decal on your "" damp"" nail, position the decal where you want it, then carefully blot your nail & decal with moving the decal. This will become easier & easier every time you do your nails.Before you know it , piece of cake. Make sure there is no curling at the edges. Water decals generally do not curl, if that happens dampen the decal with a little water using the tip of your finger. Gently without moving the decal. It probably won't move, just take care. Waiting a few seconds apply two coats of your favorite top coat. Try from side to side, then cuticle area to tip of nail assuring it is covered around the entire edges.For a little twinkle, sparkle on your nails check out the OUT THE DOOR'S  NORTHERN LIGHTS.

"I love ladybugs. This is why I had to have this flag. The measurements are as stated, 28""×40"". Made of polyester which means easy to clean, I simply hose mine off before changing them out. They dry crazy fast.I change mine out every two weeks, I have two decorative flag poles on my front porch, which is in direct sunlight all day long. They do fade after awhile.This flag is super cute. Daisies are also my favorite flower. The ""welcome"" on this flag is only on one side. (Mine is ).Also it is a banner sewn on the ladybug flag at the top & bottom. The welcome is 5 3/4"" wide & is double stitched up, both sides. The entire flag is also double stitched as well.The colors on this flag are not as bright as pictured but are eye popping non the less. In the sleeve of the flag(for the pole) are the two nylon loops to hook the flag pole to. I have found too many times it can be somewhat hard to hook it. I always use a ziptie, run it through the loop, making hanging it so much easier. Bring the tie just past the outside of the sleeve put a strong crease in it after zipping the tie, cut off the excess, done.

That is because the outfits are interchangeable with other barbies.This doll can wear the mermaid outfit, the swimsuit, there are just so many different outfits.The photo shows a blonde barbie, the one I received has like a dark blonde, almost brown, pretty non the less.It is just a good first barbie for any little girl.👌THANKS FOR READING, BYE👍","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27SONDUISQ448/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FBW9CVU#wasThisHelpful","R27SONDUISQ448","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This nail stickers are beautiful. You get 24 sheets truly, I had a couple of doubles so my daughter in law now has some. The silver outline of these flowers are raised, you will feel it when applying them. The flower is just a very soft pretty pink, dainty & delicate looking.Don't let that fool you , these stickers, yeah they are stickers, not water decals. These are pliable, not really stiff,  but thicker then most nail stickers I have used in the past. My advise, apply them to a completely dry painted nail, if applying them to even the slightest tacky nail they probably will absorb the moisture from the polish , then curl at the edges. Also once on your painted nail , gently hold it down for several seconds just to make sure it doesn't curl.The curling sometimes does happen due to the thickness of the nail sticker or decals. After you waited that short time apply at least two coats of your favorite topcoat. My first coat goes from side to side, second coat from finger to tip. I have been doing my own fiberglass nails for a very long time. Buying nail stickers for myself & my granddaughter's, these are by far the nicest, prettiest stickers I have seen & purchased. Also just to let you know , there are between 22 & 30 flowers & petals on each sheet , depending on the flower design.There are lillies, roses mums, & others. They will keep you busy. I will be looking for some different colors & designs.👌THANKS FOR READING, BYE💅","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K35FGPOBTTIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R2TO8AK#wasThisHelpful","R1K35FGPOBTTIL","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This works wonders on bug bites, we have a pond in our yard, at night we do get the occasional mosquito bites, this really takes away the itch. Also I am always washing my hands , I use jergens oatmeal cream , but I rub this on my cuticles and no more dryness. I use cuticle oil regularly,  after using bleach or strong chemicals when cleaning bird cages, kennels and toilets, I find this lasts much longer then applying cuticle oil over & over.I also had a pretty bad paper cut , it helped with that sharp stinging irritation that comes with paper cuts.This is thicker being an ointment and the lavender oil in it makes it pleasant smelling.This is in a thick glass jar, not many products do, so a hard fall onto ceramic tile or concrete would break the jar. Though I did drop mine and it didn't break , but who can control gravity?I have this coming to my house on a regular basis through amazon.Yes I would recommend this to anyone with a problem where this has helped my family.👌THANKS FOR READING, BYE👍","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QP4SDABO4TC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S9QY5O#wasThisHelpful","R3QP4SDABO4TC0","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second set of these cooling racks. I make cupcakes for my grandkids, dozens & dozens of cookies during the holidays.But this time I plan to use them for other purposes. I am already using one in my livingroom, I know, the livingroom? Our cable box is on quite often and gets warm , not enough air circulation around it. Also our ROKU BOX tends to get warm, I simply put both boxes on this cooling rack, keeping the flip out risers ( legs?) folded in , it really helps . Two of these new ones will be used for that purpose in my son's room & family room.The first set I bought have been washed & washed, by hand & in the dishwasher, they still look great.No rust , no flaking or peeling, the folding risers still move very freely, no rusting there either.I also love how they stack on top of each other, saving counter space, especially during those holiday baking marathons. They can be just a little awkward to store because they don't lay flat, those damn risers again. You can store them, each one with risers folded only measure about 1"" high. Laying the folded rack in between the wires of the others it won't take up much space , about  3 1/2"" wide. If you really could use these racks , space won't be a concern. I just wish they made these even larger for my holiday cookies. 🍰THANKS FOR READING, BYE🍞","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33SA2QQFMEYDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5OKYS0#wasThisHelpful","R33SA2QQFMEYDJ","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased ""OLE ONE EYE"" ( that's what my 3 year old grandson calls him, from a dinosaur movie). He loves him. His measurements are as stated, he's big. His colors are done well. Other reviews said he is hollow , but about 1"" up the back of his tail there is a very small hole, probably for air to escape during the moulding process. There was some coarse angel hair like fiber coming out the hole , long continuous fiber. I cut it off as close to the hole as I could, and put a very small dot of clear silicone over the hole . It dried in no time .Now maybe it is hollow except for the tail, to keep it stiff so the dinosaur is able to stand with the help of the tail. Maybe the entire dinosaur is slightly filled, I'm not sure, just keep an eye on that hole if your little one's Dino has a hole somewhere. He is weighty but not to heavy, so even the youngest of toddlers can carry him & toss him around.We have a HOWARD MILLER presidential collection grandfather clock in our livingroom, Ole one eye gets tossed around without any worry for our clock.All grandparents would appreciate these toys. The photo looks as if maybe there are some sharp points or edges to him, that is not the case. Also with his rubbery feel to him, he is very easy to just wipe clesn. And I found when he arrived there was no odor on him like some plastic toys do.This T-REX is one of many of these very soft dinsaurs. I already ordered more.THANKS FOR READING, BYE🐊","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36WGW8XEDE40J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TNG96M#wasThisHelpful","R36WGW8XEDE40J","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"'She is adorable ! So soft & fluffy.Truly 14"" in length .The bottom of her feet & inner ears are pink & white plaid shown . She has a lovely soft pink ribbon around her neck. ** With all this being said, her eyes are not embroidered as stated **, they are little shiny black eyes you see on many stuffed animals, about 1/2"" round. I purposely pulled them really really hard , twisting them as well ,just to see how easy it would be for a baby or toddler to pull or even bite them off, I have to say, they are put on her pretty darn good.Her nose & her smily face (you can't see in the photo) is also embroidered on. Her filling is rather full but not stiff. **Also she does have very many small beads in her little rump**. I believe they are for sitting her up on a shelf on display her in a baby's or little girl's room.She does sit up nice and straight.This bear I purchased is for a baby shower gift.

"I purchased this ""GLCON"" bluetooth along with a ""allreli"" brand bluetooth, which I have already posted a review.I purchased them both at the same time.I have always used the ""BLUEANT"" voice command bluetooth, one lasted better then 5 years, the second one about a year.  I have dropped both of them and they broke in the exact same spot, prompting me to look at other brands.I looked at this one , as well as the $ and thought I would give it a try.My one and only complaint is , the silicone earpiece that comes with it , though I found it to be very comfortable,  the little loop that is at the end of the earpiece is thinner and not as stiff as I am used to having in my ear, giving me the feeling that it is going to fall out. This did come with two earpieces and two over the ear hooks , which I have never used. This one has not yet fallen out of my ear. Maybe it's just in my head that it feels thinner, even after shaking my head back & forth all around it didn't fall out.Yes the side of this bluetooth does have a large button, you are not able to see it in the photo and when it's in your hand . Holding the bluetooth in your hand, sideways you are barely able to see a very small gap at the end the the bluetooth where thev""Glcon"" logo is, that also lights up indicates the charging & charging complete. The lights are bright enough to see from across the room. Red means charging , green means completely charged.This is where you actually push the button , Like a diving board motion. The volume up & down buttons are on the side of this bluetooth on top or bottom depending on which ear you use it in.I received 4 ear hooks with this along with everything else stated in the product description.  It all came in a very nice hard case for traveling, I use it for my lip glosses & lipsticks.The power ON /OFF switch is on the inner part of the bluetooth ,  yes it is close to the earpiece.I find no trouble switching it on or off. I do have fiberglass nails, so I had my 7 year old granddaughter and my 3 year old grandson turning it on & off, they had no problem either.The voice is clear , easy to operate & I had no problem connecting it or the other one I purchsed to my samsung galaxy note 4.I don't use these for alot of music, but when I have it was just fine for me. Others may need something with more oomph.  The finish on it is a bright white with a very glossy shine to it .The underside has a shiny chrome finish to it. This bluetooth I find to suit my needs well, and anyone who needs just a simple easy to use attractive bluetooth, I recommend this ""GLCON"".THANKS FOR READING, BYE.😄","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25DTGEY2B5FDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K1308VC#wasThisHelpful","R25DTGEY2B5FDG","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchsed this when I gave my other safe edge can openers to family members. I really reseached the Zyliss brands and thought I'd give them a try. My other  ""safe"" can openers were the ""kuhn rikon"" & they worked well. This one is every bit as good , actually better.This can opener has a silicone handle to help with keeping control of the opening of thd can. After closing the handle together you simply twist the large silicone handle to open your cans.*NOTE* The twist handle is on top of the opener, if looking at your can , the twist handle is on top of the can , not on the side of the can opener like the traditional ones we all remember.Once opened the lid & the can are safe, not sharp at all. You are actually able to use the lid to snuggly re-cover the can. ( LEAVE THE LABEL ON, WASH THE LID & CAN STORE VALUBLES IN THEM😉. WHO STEALS CAN GOODS)!When first using this type of can opener it may be awkward, but only once or twice. After that you've mastered it.  👫kids are always wanting to help in the kitchen, they will not cut their little fingers & hands using this Zyliss can opener.👍THANKS FOR READING, BYE.😄","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PWT8HGM1RN6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9ZTKQG#wasThisHelpful","R1PWT8HGM1RN6K","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using the safe edge can openers for some time now. After giving the two, away to a family member, I checked into the ""Zyliss brand"".I purchased this one in red.when I open can goods that need to be this type of can opener is what I grab. Sour kraut in the can, there is so much juice in those cans. I try to drain it in a strainer but the kraut gets into the holes so bad it makes clearing those holes of the kraut gets to be tedious.I wipe the top of the can off, then simply open the can, leave the lid on the can , turn the can with the lid on and place the can unto the bottom of a large plastic drinking tumbler standing in the kitchen sink. Then just slowly start pushing down on the bottom of the can, draining the kraut juice out . ( this works for me).This can opener is easy to use , and not hard on my carpal tunnel hands. Thd red you see on the handles are silicone , so, your handd aren't slipping while using it, yet the silicone doesn't have that tacky feeling like some silicone does.On the top of the opener there is a little red slide locking latch. You slide it towards the handles to release them, when finished using it rinse it off if needed then squeeze the handles together , the latch will catch & stay, locking the handles together again.The twist handle on the opener is also silicone and large enough for anyone to use this . The elderly shouldn't any difficulty with this opener. If this helps st all while using using squeeze the handles together , the lock will catch so anyone using it doesn't have to strain by squeezing these handles, focusing more on the twist movement. When finished opening the can , simply place your thumb on the latch & slide it toward your hands.It truly is a simple , yet very practical design. ☺THANKS FOR READING, BYE.😄","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R43ZX2L5IXFOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9ZTLJ2#wasThisHelpful","R43ZX2L5IXFOS","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These came sooner then expected, and they are much lighter then my other propets.after wearing them for three or four days, I have to say they are much cooler, they fit very well on my feet.

"The carpal tunnel in my left hand was becoming unbearable, my son said I should try a brace or something support my wrist. This wrist wrap saved me. I wear a 8 - 8 1/2 inch wrist. This wrap fits me beautifully, with room to spare. From the palm of my hand to about  2 inches above my wrist in the wrap is a metal support in the natural shape of ones wrist & palm . It isn't adjustable or removeable. I did order the large/ extra large wrap. The opening for your thumb has plenty of room for the biggest of hands. The hole measures 2 1/2 inches long by 2 inches at the widest opening of the thumb hole. This hole is egg shaped if that helps. Once the wrap is on your wrist, on the back of your hand there is another metal support bar, so the movement of your wrist is very limited, really controlling your wrist at all times.This metal support measures 5 1/2 inches long by 1 3/4 inches wide, also not adjustable or  removable either. This wrap is spot clean or hand wash only. There are three straps to easily adjust the wrap, to the tightness move ability you choose.I am oredering another left hand wrap , as well as a right hand wrap. My right so far has not been nearly as painful. I don't wear it while cleaning, but driving , relaxing , watching tv and even sleeping I am wearing it. I also purchased a three pack of hand strengthening exercise balls. They have also helped alot. The brand is called FITBALL.

"I didn't take a second to read the dimensions of these candles when I ordered them, I ended up ordering two sets. When they arrived, needless to say I couldn't believe the size, they were going back. After three days went by, I was cleaning my kitchen where I have 2 sets of sconces on my walls. I never wanted to burn tealight candles or the bit larger votives. The two smaller of these three fit perfectly in my glass votive cups on my sconces.The two tallest ones are in my livingroom on a shelf I have mounted on the wall. The battery life seems to last FOREVER. Plus both sets came with 6 extra batteries . They only use one in each candle, so each candle comes with two extra batteries because each candle already has a battery in it. They take the large quarter size button cell batteries. LITHIUM CELL CR2450 3V. The candles are a cream color, but when lit they do look a deeper yellow as shown in the photo. The dimensions of these candles are as stated in the discrimination.  They are not wax, but a plastic. The timers on these work beautifully and are accurate coming on everyday at the same time, simply flip the power button from off to on, there is no timer switch . Turning the candle on is turning on the timer . 6 hours on, 18 hours off, easy. These are small, but could be used in bookcases, curio cabinets, childrens' bedrooms as nightlights, even a guest bathroom. You are now able to purchase a carvable foam resin pumpkin for halloween. These candles would be great in those jack-o-lanterns. Your imagination could go crazy.4 out of five stars from me only because there are so many creative uses for these little candles, I would love to see them in many more colors. Red for christmas & valentines day. Pink, lavender for spring & summer. But the lack of colors won't keep me from ordering more. I am going to try to paint one or two with some stained glass paint. These candles are not expensive, and stained glass paint is easy to use.THANKS FOR READING, BYE✌","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13E09GEI0PI2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N99QJF4#wasThisHelpful","R13E09GEI0PI2V","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is truly the first time in at least 10 years there is no hair in the bristles of my hairbrush. 🙇I have been using the Therapy-G treatment in my hair for three months now. I first saw it & ordered the treatment kit from a catalog I receive ""AS WE CHANGE"" .What do I have to lose, hair ? I felt a strong tingling through my scalp. The treatment has a soft minty scent. The first time after using it, my hair instantly had more body then I thought I would ever see again.The catalog price was WOW EXPENSIVE, but I did see results about a month after starting with much less hair in my shower drain & on my hairbrush. So I thought amazon sold Therapy-G, they sell everything else. They did and it was much more affordable.You first wash your hair with the shampoo, leave it on for 15 seconds according you the directions. I leave it on for about 2 minutes. Rinse it out well. Then you spray on the follicle stimulator, about 12/15 pumps as directed. I only spray on 8. Massaging it into my scalp. Leaving it on for another 2 minutes. Rinse out well. Then applying the conditioner , I leave it in for 2 minutes again. The bottle says only 30 seconds, rinse out well.Your scalp & hair will feel different, well mine did. There is also a hair volumer, I only use this if I am going out for the day. It comes in a spray pump bottle , I spray it into my hands then stroke it through my hair with my fingers.I am going to use these products for a year, really giving them and my hair time to do their thing.I went and got my haircut 3 days ago. She has been cutting my hair for about 7 or 8 years, she noticed a huge difference as well.You can only try it, maybe it will work for you, maybe not, but you'll never know unless you simply wash your hair.One small plus , I also noticed my eyebrows much thicker as well.THANKS FOR READING, BYE🙇","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10CXZ22L8WZ4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFW9BUW#wasThisHelpful","R10CXZ22L8WZ4H","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The price for these full well nail tips is truly a great value. I say full well because looking at the photo and the tips I received, they are full well tips. Half well tips are when the well of the tip that actually is sitting on & glued to your natural nail only covers the tip of your natural nail. Look at the photo, these tips cover much more of your natural nail plate, giving the name full well. Which I only use full well.My ring finger is a size 9 . When placing tips on, i would glue a size 5 or 4 tip on depending on the brand. I have used kiss long curved tips with a full well for more than 10 years now, and I will continue to. These tips I received are for the lovely ladies out there with much smaller fingers than mine. These tips are natural looking in color, they are strong, yet not thick at all. But my ring finger took a size 2 of these tips. My thumb is a 2 from the kiss brand, these , my thumb took (barely) the 0. I gave these tips to my daughter in law. She has very small hands.I believe the quality of these as well as the value is a 5 star easy, but as far as my ability to use these tips is 3 or below. I hope this helps the readers out there. If these tips fit me I would be making my switch from kiss to these. Now mind the readers I do not buy the extra wide tips, just the kiss brand tips that are hanging in the Walmart stores in the nail polish section. All the do it yourself gals with hands where your ring finger is at a 5, 6, even 7 could probably use these with no issues.  My daughter in law's wedding ring is a size 5 1/2.There are most definitely for the smaller hand gals. Again I feel these are a good artificial nail tip.

"I have such a pen obsession,  I love a weighted, chunky, medium ink pen. I was given an ink pen with a rubber tip for cell phone & tablet use. My first thought was HOW USEFUL. These pens however are not a weighty pen. Slim is exactly what they are, but I have to say they write beautifully. The ink flowsvout of these pens effertlessly. They twist open, so no ink caps to misplace. If looking at the photo, they twist open & close right at the middle of the pen at the small steel ring. They measure 5 1/2"" long when the ink tip is out. And slightly wider then 1/16"" at the top of the pen, then narrows down to the tip less then tthat 1/6 "" .The ink cartridge can easily be replaced by a refill at any office supply store ( OFFICEMAX or OFFICE DEPOT) or even at most WALMARTS. The colors shown in the photo are the same as what I received. They all came in an individual clear plastic sleeve.in a pretty sturdy cardboard box to keep them in until needed. The shirt or pocket clip that is at the top end is very tight to the pen. manipulation may be required until it loosens up .I can honestly say how nice the ink flows from these pens. The stylus convenience wt the other end to me is simply an added bonus.✒THANKS FOR READING, BYE✒","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GZNLLT0UZMFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6LB1R6#wasThisHelpful","R3GZNLLT0UZMFV","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great little flower stickers. Colors are brighter then pictured. There's 54 flowers total, 7 which have 3 flowers clustered together as one. There are 7 leaves, 2 different styles. They all have a slight glitter to them. The glitter is on well, I used a couple flowers today, the glitter didn't come off onto my fingertips or hands.  The sheet that these floflowers are on mewsures just over an inch square. They are very sticky , so using them is best when your nail polish is completely dry.

"The colors are as they appear, just what I was looking. The other cases I ordered, the colored cases were very faint, pale. These cases are made of a harder plastic, not very pliable,  yet easy to snap on & off your phone. The tops of these cases are clear, not white as they show. So if you have a black, or any other samsung note 4, the phone color will definitely make a big difference in they way this case will look on your phone.The waterdrop on these cases are not in the moulding air bubbles in the case, they are actually textured, you can feel them, raised on the case. They are not uncomfortable to the touch. With these cases also came a small stylus, it measures just over 1 1/4"" . It is attached to a cord measuring about 1 1/4"" long. The little plastic end fit snuggly into the ear plug of your phone. You'll also receive 2 screen protectors (I DON'T NEED TO USE THEM YET) & a cleaning cloth for the screen of your phone, mine measures 1 1/4"" square.These covers fit very well, where the phone buttons are, you are able to access them easy. These cases are not very thick or padded , so your phone could be damged if dropped pretty good. The corners of your phone are covered by these cases, but the top & bottom of the phone where you plug your charger in & where your headphones get plugged in is opened, those are completely opened. So if the phone fell on those two spots (not likely) the phone could get damaged.I really only bought these cases because they look so cool & unique. 4 out of 5 stars only because I would have liked to see the corners alittle more padded to protect the phone If dropped.☎THANKS FOR READING, BYE📞","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T2GWZBCIMESG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RQ5AFDY#wasThisHelpful","R1T2GWZBCIMESG","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I do my own fiberglass nails, have for 15 years, give or take. My way of using this is simple. For repairing a cracked , split , or broken nail , lightly buff the area , remove any polish, oil , anything on your nail to be repaired. Take a small, amount of nail resin or nail glue , brush on works best. While the glue is barely tacky, take a strip of this fiberglass & completely cover the section of nail, needing repaired.Tap the fiberglass down gently using an orange stick, cuticle pusher, whatever is handy.Remember whatever you choose to use will have to be wiped clean from the glue. Brush a thin layer of glue over the entire strip, over lapping onto your own nail. Avoid your skin & cuticle area. Now using resin activator spray the repaired area. Hold spray bottle about 6"" from your hand. Do this three times, really sealing in the fiberglass.This is what you would do if putting a full set of tips on as well, just covering your entire nails, putting a stress strip across the area where your natural nail meets the tip you applied.  Gently buff your entire nail, apply one more coat glue , spray, buff out the shine .Wipe nail, with alcohol or polish remover. Paint your nails , or not. The activator cures , hardens, and seals the fiberglass you put on your nail.Before my husband retired we laid brick for a living.I mixed the mortar , unloaded the brick, laid pavers .When used the correct way , this will stand the test of time .Yeah you still can break a nail , but this will really add durability & strength to them.Not many of us ladies lay brick and still have long nails . I did while using fiberglass nail wraps.I couldn't find  A.S.P.'s instruction videos for their products, if you really want to use fiberglass for your repairs or for applying tips, go to:BACKSCRATCHERS NAIL SYSTEM, they have videos for everything nail related. Their products as good as they are , I've used them, are very $$$. You can find fiberglass wraps in pre-cut strips as well, as silk wraps in pre-cut strips . The difference between fiberglass & silk is only the thickness & tightness the the fibers. The silk has a  tighter weave , yet thinner then the fiberglass, both equally strong, and both tacky on the back for keeping it in place while working with it. Please just keep in mind you have natural oils on your hands even when clean, so touch the side of the strips as little as possible , or it won't  work as well as it should.Sorry this review left you with so much to read, there are only my personal experiences with a product I have used & trusted for a long time now. 💅THANKS FOR READING, BYE💅","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY14I6CD7JZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064TPMIQ#wasThisHelpful","RY14I6CD7JZL","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had these brushes for quite some time now. I can honestly say how much I love them. Always my first concern with makeup brushes is how well they stand up to regular cleaning. Some alright, some not, bristles coming out before , during and after cleaning them. These hold up well. I have already cleaned them three times. The bristles held up well , kept their shape, and none came out . The way I clean them is I soak them in a clear glass, about 1 or 2 minutes, about  1/4"" past the bristles with the cleanser I use on my face. Swishing them around only a couple times,  removing them, running them under very warm water, rolling them back & forth in a clean towel then squeezing the bristles, fanning them out of excess water & letting them air dry, laying flat.These brushes are all full, size makeup brushes.The measurements on these brushes are (FOLLOW THE MEASUREMENTS WITH PHOTO PROVIDED);FOUNDATION BRUSH - 6 3/4"" LONGCREAM/LIQUID FOUND ATI ON BRUSH - 6 3/4"" LONGMINI KABUKI BRUSH - 2 1/2"" LONGBRONZER BRUSH - (FLAT TOP BRISTLES) - 4 1/4"" LONGBRUSH BRUSH - (ROUND TOP BRISTLES) - 4 1/4"" LONGEREYESHADOW BRUSH - 5"" LONGCONCEALER BRUSH - 6"" LONGANGLED EYESHADOW BRUSH- 6 1/4"" LONGMULTI-TASK BRUSH - 7 1/2""LONGEREYESHADOW SMUDGE BRUSH - 6 1/4""LONGEYELINER BRUSH - 5 3/4"" LONGThe handles on these great brushes are a bamboo wood.

"I have been having very bad sharp pains in my left wrist and thumb. My son said I probably have carpal tunnel like my mother had. She was a sseemstress, making wedding gowns , leather jackets, serious sewing. Thirteen sewing machines in her sewing room, all ready to go. She was in her later years wearing a wrist brace for carpal tunnel on both hands everyday.I don't sew, I cut out ornate snowflakes, i do my own fiberglass nails, and am a huge card sender, 100 + christmas cards every year, plus the other holidays. My hands are always busy. I have been using these balls for just 5 days now, and I can honestly say I can feel alittle difference in my left hand. There are 18 exercises for your hands that are on a chart you'll get with the balls. The chart measures 8""   20"" , very clear simple drawings. Glossy, thicker paper , but not poster board thick. While having my morning coffee, I do 5 sets of each illustrated exercises. I can't believe how much pain I had in my hand.At night in bed I repeat them again. After the 3rd night, I still felt the pain, just not as bad.These balls are  2"" in diameter,  green is soft, yellow is medium, red, which to me looks more like orange is firm. They all felt the same to me, until I started using them.I haven'-t worked my way up to the ""red"" ball yet. Green in the morning, yellow in the evening. The balls are not sticky or gummy to the touch. They had a slight odor when I first opened them, but it went away shortly after. My grandson misplaced my ""red"" ball today, my 4 out of 5 stars is maybe these balls could have came with a little pouch to store them in. But no biggie. I am going to order a set of these for a dear friend of mine, she has arthritis in both her hands.My son says if & when I no longer need them, we can always learn to juggle.👍THANKS FOR READING, BYE👌","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIYZ9RHUA48NT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LGWNRXS#wasThisHelpful","RIYZ9RHUA48NT","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have two of these cleavers. I love them. The blade is a stainless steel blade, which is also a product of germany, holding it at an angle you will read solingen germany-ice hardened steel.The cutting blade itself is approximately  4 1/2"" in length. The cuttingboard part of this cleaver is not removable,  and measures 4 1/2"" long × 1 1/4"" long. The entire length of this is 9 1/4"" long, the upper part of the handle is 3/4"" wide × 3 1/2"" long, this measurement is where your thumb rests on the handle. The area for your four fingers is just under 4"" in length. Both sides as you are able to see in the photo have a grey rubbing yet smooth finish so your hands won't slip while using this cleaver.At the very end of this cleaver there is a small red locking mechanism for unlocking the cleaver for use & locking it back up for safety & storage.It is very easy to clean. My favorite use for this knife is cutting carrots. With a knife you really feel the knife blade cutting through the carrot, this goes through it like butter. It also can very easily slice through the root end of an entire celery bunch.Then cutting off the tips. I mainly use mine for veggies & fruits , apples pears even grapes for salads. Lunch meats are another no problem food this cleaver goes through. Antipasti salads are made much quicker.This is just simply a handy kitchen gadget to have in your cooking space.🔪THANKS FOR READING, BYE🔪","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTGGGEKX535O4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BZVNH0#wasThisHelpful","RTGGGEKX535O4","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have four of these LED under cabinets lights. Two that are black & two white. The measurements stated are accurate. I use the black ones in my very large entertainment center/curio cabinets. They are well lit from the top , with glass shelves where I keep my seraphim angel collection and my Llano angels. So the two black lights sit in the bottom shelves in front (easy to, turn off & on) facing in different directions casting light throughout my cabinets. Because the lights swivel  360  and the round part of the light moves back & forth, with three LED lights in each head (12 total) I am able to direct the light just about anywhere.The other two I keep handy for wherever we may need extra light. Because the bottom is completely flat it can be useful anywhere. We changed our garbage disposal , it was really helpful under the sink. When our power went out , I placed one on our kitchen table . Being able to direct the lights where I needed them was great because our kitchen is odd shaped, but it did light our kitchen up. Yes they can suck the life out of the batteries so  just remember they're on . My grandson left one on when he stayed over. The batteries finally drained completely by day eleven , that was on normal . There is also a dim setting. When my son ordered these for me they were only $15.00 each .

"💅 I have been doing my own fiberglass nails now for more then 10 years. I usually use the a.s.p. resin , but I haven't ever been able to find it in brush on bottles. I have been using this for about 5 years , followed by the a.s.p. resin activator. Now this states GEL, but it isn't very thick like the gel for gel nail applications.  To use a resin it is always best to follow up with an activator. Holding the actitvator spray bottle about 6 ""  from your nail , or this resin along with any resin or nail glue will take some time to dry. Using the activator speeds up the dry time & hardens the resin you applied to your nails.🌟if you really prefer to use a thicker gel resin or glue try wonder bond , it to is a great product🌟.When taking the brush out of the bottle , it will have plenty of resin on the brush. So to remove some of  the resin from the bristles do not run the brush across the top of the bottle ( unless you keep pliers in your nail kit , resin will dry up inside the brush/cap). Instead, run the brush pull up on the inner side wall of this bottle . If you do get resin on the rim take a piece of paper towel not cotton ball or pad with acetone free polish remover and wipe a rim off while the resin is still wet. I also place this little shot glass so it doesn't tip over and because the shot glass has slanted inner walls , the resin bottle rests inside the glass at an angle.My best results with this product is to use 3 or 4 thin coats , rather then thicker layers.This way the layers will be more even, with less filing in the long run. After applying to your nail , very lightly tap the tip of your nail on a double folded piece of paper towel once or twice .This will prevent your nail tip from becoming thicker at the side ends of your nail. And the folded paper towel protects whatever table finish your working on. I use a yempered glass cutting board on my workspace. I only wish it came in a larger bottle.I hope this helps anyone reading , take your time , relax and just have fun , that's what acetone was made for .💅THANKS FOR READING, BYE💅I","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U0QGWEKJZ9SG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UBMC3O#wasThisHelpful","R1U0QGWEKJZ9SG","A2ZMH05LYXCVT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZMH05LYXCVT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The ""Good News""... 'This is a very well-built and small device actually having a personality like a cross between a pet-rock and a toy Chihuahua.God, is the Go Karma cute. I loved mine.It came in a small package with minimum packing and the smallest manual of any tech-product I've ever purchased.And now the ""Bad News""...'Go Karma relies on service coming from the Sprint cell phone company and if you do a Google search for ""Sprint Coverage Reviews"" you'll come across an article ""Sprint coverage is getting 'LESS HORRIBLE"" which pretty much means Sprint takes a back-seat to coverage by the big-two careers, and I'm fact Spint rides in the last train car of a very long train and on that last train car, Sprint is stuck in the toilet.Even though a coverage map showed I could get my Go Karma to work in a rural area here in Texas, it couldn't. I had a little better luck driving 50 miles to ""the big city"" where the Sprint Map suggested it had very strong coverage, my Karma had hit and miss luck at working there (might have been the sparrows flying overhead or some kid flying his paper kite causing problems, but even taking my Go Karma outside (clear of trees) it still had problems with Sprint.Bottom line... Go Karma is s very exciting product especially since your unused data can be cycled-forward to your next month.I have a data plan in my 2015 Chevrolet Volt, costing $50 per month (works EVERYWHERE) but if I don't use all the data, it goes away and won't by passed into the following month. I had hoped the Go Karma would replace my OnStar data plan, but Sprint failed miserably.If Sprint could ever become much more ""less than miserable"" and create a better and more saturated coverage area, I'd purchase the GoKarma again in a heartbeat.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZAAT001FXW7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U23LZAE#wasThisHelpful","R1ZAAT001FXW7T","A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"NOT A VINE REVIEW! I BOUGHT THIS MYSELF 😁I wanted a discret way to visually document encounters with certain people that I might encounter having the ability to record the video and audio without someone knowing I might document the event.I've had over a months experience in carrying this device in my shirt pocket and as it protrudes slightly above the opening in my pocket in work shirts and dress shirts, nobody has ever suspected it was anything other than a common ball point pen.In a few tests runs, I've found it easy to start the recording simply by pressing down on the small button on top of the ""pen"" for about 3 seconds then letting up.The small SD mini card records the event, and although I have not tried it in a Windows computer I have, it works easily on my Mac. I've been pleased with the quality of the video and the audio is probably the only weak-link in this camera but it works well enough to be understood if recording conversation with someone standing in front of you or in very close proximity.I haven't tried (nor need) editing the footage in something like iMovie because the raw footage is all I am interested in.Please note, this is NOT a Vine Review and I never would nor will review products that I have not purchased myself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OD190V2D6QH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WU7PEH0#wasThisHelpful","R1OD190V2D6QH","A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm using this to track the amount of electricity I use to charge my Chevrolet Volt. I simply tapped into the line I installed feeding 240 volts to a NEMA plug where the external EVSE (charger) hangs on my wall in my garage.This works well to advise how many kilowatts I use for each charge.I'd say my only ""complaint"" is the manual which probably was written in the UK and refers to electric rates as ""terrif"".The small box where I read my daily or weekly or instant electric usage can be attached to a wall or other surface using two small screws, but I elected not to attach it to anything so that I can move it around with me as needed. The Bluetooth range seems robust inside my large two car garage. I haven't determined how far the range is for Bluetooth but I'm pleased with how good it performs for my needs.As I track the kilowatt usage, I'm seeing very close to what my Volt is reporting in regard to kilowatts used in my daily use of my car. For example, if my Volt reports it went 40 miles on 8.1 kilowatts of electricity, the Ensupra also shows it required 8.1 kilowatts to recharge my Volt.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29H44A31BVXVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QN0GH7G#wasThisHelpful","R29H44A31BVXVX","A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow! Illegal for use on a vehicle here in the United States because the various colors of flashing red and blue resemble the lights of law enforcement and or other emergency vehicles (if you put this on the top of your car, I can guarantee that a cop will eventually pull you over or someone will use a cell phone to report you as an imposter law enforcement vehicle) but I'm using these on the perimeter of my ranch on tall poles to scare off coyotes at night and THEY WORK! In fact, I am buying 10 more.These various colored and flashing lights work great for me in scaring off nocturnal predators on my two ranches here in Texas. I placed three of them on long metal poles (at the top) and the flashing lights have scared coyotes away. I read somewhere that coyotes were afraid of flashing lights so I decided to experiment and darned if these things work for this purpose. The lights are VERY bright when you look at them from directly behind the light source (thus the reason they resemble emergency vehicles and police cars) and since putting them up on my ranch, I don't even hear coyotes much less see their tracks near where I keep my goats and chickens and other livestock.I originally wanted one of these to use on the top of my car thinking that at night in the fog, they would give me an extra margin of safety, but they flash so fast and the red-amber-blue combination are so bright and flash so fast that it made my car look like a state trooper. If the lights flashed slower and were one color (maybe like the flashing lights we see on the back of large trucks that haul gasoline) they might be more accepted by law enforcement, but as the lights are now, they look too much like state highway patrol or local police cars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REJYI2UKAIDU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CSM22UO#wasThisHelpful","REJYI2UKAIDU5","A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this fruit cake for my father-in-law who is in assisted living.When the fruitcake arrived at my house, I removed the tin box from the cardboard shipping container so that I could gift wrap it for Christmas for him. Moments before I placed the fruitcake on my counter for wrapping, I thought it would be a good idea to examine the contents of the container, and I removed the cover to look at the cake. As I stood there, looking down at this wonderful specimen laying helplessly before me, I succumbed to the incredible and succulent aroma that came upon me and in which became mingled with my olfactory receptors. Sadly, in a moment of weakness, I found my hands grasping for a knife in which to slice through the cake in order to take a small ""test"" sample. My weakness grew as did my hunger and to make a long story short, I very selfishly devoured the cake as the glutton I turned into and I will seek forgiveness from the Pope and beg for leniency as I hurriedly order a new cake to have shipped directly to my father-in-law whom I know will be filled with glee as I was, in sampling this incredible baked item that was such a joy to consume.Say what you will or might want to say about fruitcakes, but this one was wickedly wonderful and those folks down in Corsicana, Texas make some mighty bodacious and fabulous fruitcakes. I have never-ever tasted one that was even this close to totally wonderful. (Maybe I died and went to Heaven and I don't need to contact the Pope?)(UPDATE, 1-2-2015...

"*******(UPDATE... 3-5-2015  I bought an Arlo Home Monitoring System, ironically from NetGear - and the Arlo is the total opposite of my experience with the VueZone - which I understand NetGear purchased from another company that went out of business... The VueZone is lousy, the Arlo is great... and in fact please look for my review of the Arlo.)********I bought the VueCam system and while it was a quick and easy instal and the app worked really great on my iPhone 5S, I was never-ever able to receive email alerts as advertised. For ten days I tried to get the email alert working (even trying my alternate email address) and nothing worked. The support from NetGear was disappointing. Two calls to their phone support people in India was an exercise in frustration. And although the people in India were polite and courteous, taking to them on the phone sounded like they were sitting in a bar and using a speaker phone. I could hardly understand them. Even before getting to talk to them, it was horrendous calling their toll-free number and then wading through the voice prompts and deciding what number to press.After several test runs in broad daylight and in low light conditions, the cameras (even though both were set for motion detect) never-ever gave me a single clue that something (me, even riding past the cameras in a large Kubota RTV) and I sent the system back for a refund.The resolution was poor but I could have lived with the low quality image, just to see if someone had forced open a door or broke a window. The fee they wanted for the privilege of using their ""service"" while annoying, I was willing to pay just so I could have peace-of-mind.Too bad, because I was VERY impressed with the iPhone app but very disappointed in support.

"(UPDATE 10 days after I bought this.... I am sending it back to Amazon for a full refund. NetGear support is pathetic, both through email answers and especially through their phone technical support located in India. I spent 45 minutes today on the phone to a very nice young woman in India (who sounded like she was in a noisy sweat-shop) and although she was courteous and polite, after giving her all my information to include a ticket number that NetGear gave me (and info how to get email alerts, which didn't work and which I had set up properly in the first place...) The lady in India gave me a new number to call 1-888-638-4327 where I again had to wade through recorded voice quizzes and then passed along to another person in India (also a nice chap, sitting in what sounded like a bowling alley.) The background noise is so bad that it is difficult to hear these people... Email alerts DO NOT WORK thus making these cameras useless as a quick way to know if your home has been broken into.)PROS...**** Cameras are very small and easy to place nearly anywhere because they attach by a magnet to a small base that sticks on a wall, a pole, a glass surface or just about anywhere. The magnetic base allows the camera to swivel and tilt (by hand) and this allows to get the exact camera angle you want.**** Included in my two-camera system was an outdoor housing that prevents rain from getting into the cameras. This too is ""svelte"" and it's small size makes it easy to locate in tight spots.**** Once you establish an account (for viewing) it's VERY easy to get into your account to see your cameras from any internet connection. It worked well on my iPhone 5S and several of my Mac computers.CONS....***** I hate to even mention this as a ""con"" but the image quality is just a tad low resolution, but it is good enough for me to easily see if a door or a window has been compromised, or if tools are missing from an interior building.**** No sound, but no big deal for me because I simply need to see if a window/door has been breached and sound isn't really needed nor do I need to talk to my dogs.**** No pan or tilt and again not critical for me, but I can see how this would be an advantage for many people.**** Short battery life for the tiny cameras. Batteries are about $2 each (the cameras take two of them) and they last about 14 days it seems.**** Email alerts never worked for me despite having the cameras set for motion and verifying that my settings were all correct.**** Phone support is located in India. Wait times are WAY TOO LONG and despite having spend 45 minutes on the phone with them in India on two calls, they never resolved my problem. While the phone reps in India were polite, courteous... the background sound made me think they were housed in a bowling alley next to a railroad station.Other notes...You get several options when you establish your account which include a free account for viewing, but the freebie wasn't as feature-laden as I wanted and I elected to purchase their ""Two Locations - five cameras"" option.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PSELC8FE0CVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFPGDQ4#wasThisHelpful","R2PSELC8FE0CVW","A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this bracelet out of concern if I ever was pulled over by a policeman and needed to get out of my car, I didn't want him/her to think I had been drinking (I walk like a drunk because of my MS).  And I once was challenged by a fully enabled person when I needed access to a handicap space... The idea of wearing this bracelet seemed to fit the bill, so to speak, as a way to add validity to my MS ailment.After wearing it for 5 months, the one small insignia that reads ""Multiple Sclerosis"" fell off. It is not much more than a decal that I recall from my youth, that we placed on toy models we built when I was a kid.I found the bracelet easy to size (removing a link is a no-brainer) and the bracelet was always comfortable and easy to put on and remove, and it never changed color nor did the metal stain, but the small emblems on the bracelet are easy to lose. Now I simply have a bracelet with the ""medical ID"" showing on each side and no specific emblem for my actual medical condition.This bracelet is $40 delivered here on Amazon but I bought my replacement for $27.75 delivered through ""E"" bay.

"(EDIT 12-13-2014...  Look at all the one star reviews that have been submitted December 2014! This seems to suggest that their camera is coming out of their factory with a defect rendering it useless.)When removing the package and opening the small instruction booklet, I was excited to read it and see the installation process seemed easy and straight-forward. You plug the AC power supply in to a 120 volt outlet, plug the other end into the camera, flip the small slider switch to ""on"" and then the camera starts searching for a WIFI signal.After sitting near (and far) from my Apple Extreme router, this camera was NOT able to find it. I tried several times, placing it anywhere from 20 feet away to 20 inches from my fairly new Apple router (which has performed beyond my expectations and which EVERY other device can find.) I brought the camera home from my office and decided to try to see if it would find my other router, let it set for nearly two hours, tired rebooting my router while the camera was turned on, did't work. I even let it search all night after I went to bed and the next morning it still was not able to find my second router. Then I tried to unplug the camera and power it up and see if it could reboot and find my router, but to no avail.Their app won't even open on my iPhone 5S, it just spins, I suspect because the camera can't find my router.I went to the company website to look for an FAQ that might explain what to do when the camera can't locate the WIFI and the website doesn't  even have an FAQ ""can't find the router"" or ""what to do to connect to a wireless router."" (The FAQa are pretty much worthless anyway, you should look at their website before you consider buying this camera...)It seems to that with more and more 1 star ratings being added so quickly as of late, this product must have a manufacturing flaw that is rendering it inoperative. Look at all the recent one star ratings and it's obvious this is a flawed piece and is buggy as a  10 day old hot dog that has been laying under the ball park bleachers.Please note that I returned this for a refund.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL5JMCA5UI16Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FB69DSS#wasThisHelpful","RL5JMCA5UI16Z","A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Several years ago I started seeing annoying TV commercials (hey, aren't ALL tv commercials annoying now?) for ""toe nail fungus"" products. I had never had any problems with toe nail fungus nor even heard of it until the TV commercials started. Well, ""welcome to the club of sufferers"" because three months ago I got this ailment and I no longer laugh at the commercials.I live on a ranch and about a year ago, I bought a pair of shoes called ""Muckers"" because they allow me to walk in mud, muck and wet grass without my feet getting wet. I liked the shoes so much that I started wearing them nearly all the time, however since they are made of a rubberized material, I suspect this is what caused my toenail fungus (fortunately only on one big toe) and I realized that the shoes were probably the culprit.I bought two each of these BATTOP UV Sanitizers and have made the following observations.#1. They easily slide into any shoe I own.... and I like the fact they don't need to be plugged into a 110 volt outlet.#2. The AAA batteries that power these little jewels run a long time and don't need to be replaced very often.#3. UV light is an excellent way to kill virus and germs, and in fact a company has just developed a small robot that can go inside of hospital rooms using UV light to sanitize hospitals, and they advise the UV light is also killing the ebola virus!These small lights are very easy to use. Just insert the batteries into the product, press the small button on the top for three seconds until the light comes on (don't look directly at the light, just slide it in the shoe and when you see the soft blue illumination, release the button and allow the device to slide in all the way to where it comes into contact with the toe area... and the light will stay on for about 10 minutes.My wife (although has a ""day job"" and doesn't need ""muck shoes"" is happy I found these germ killing lights and has told me that my shoes no longer have ""that aroma"" they once used to have (not that I can smell much myself) so I suppose if this has passed the ""wife's nose test"" that indeed, the lights are like a little Army and have gone on the warpath killing all that nasty stuff that was once lurking in my muck shoes!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BKX3FHSN7M9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIIHM70#wasThisHelpful","R3BKX3FHSN7M9M","A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have three vehicles and in order for this fan to be placed in the window of any vehicle, you must cut a rubber liner supplied with the fan and slide the rubber liner along the top portion of your car, van or pickup glass window. The fan is supposed to butt-up against the rubber, then your window is rolled up so that the rubber liner can slide into the window channel (typically felt or rubber itself) and the problem is, that no car window is squared off or straight. Most windows have a gentle curve as they slope down from near the roof line to where your rear view mirrors are located on the bottom part of the window on the outside of your car, van or pickup.One previous reviewer stated this fan didn't work on his car and I can see why now. The rubber ""gasket"" supplied with this product is neither long enough nor flexible enough to follow the natural slope of ANY window. Thus my reason for sending the fan back for a refund (less than $10 for shipping I will have to eat) because Amazon gave me ""Sorry, it's not our fault this didn't fit"" which is total bull.Sadly, the fan seems quite robust and in full sunlight it kicks out some serious ""wind"" from the two small fans.The instructions on a piece of paper that come in the box are written in Chinese, but the box also has instructions and drawings inside the lid that easily explain how to install and use the fan, but the fan can not probably be used on anything other than a vehicle that has square or perfectly rectangular windows. I wanted to add a photo showing the natural curve of my driver's side window and how their material can not accommodate the curve, but it looks like Amazon now longer allows for videos and pictures... But, the person who wrote the review about his Prius and the difficulty with the rubber strip, I think you can get the idea that the rubber strip is just a bad way to try and seal off the window along the juncture of the window channel (frame) and the glass itself.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R4HRIKN5M9BI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J97X2YG#wasThisHelpful","R1R4HRIKN5M9BI","A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've built and flown two airplanes and decided, this would be an easy project for me in order to repair the glass on my wife's iPhone 4S.The product arrived and I was impressed by the fact that so many small tools came with the kit. A set of instructions seemed well laid out, however in bold letters on the face-page of the instructions, the makers of this product advise do not proceed without first going to their web site that has a video showing the replacement of the screen and all the steps you'll need to follow.I went to their website and watched the video in the entirety and again a second time, following each step along the way. The first thing I decided, you must have the eye sight of a brain surgeon to see the small parts (screws) and the patience of a watch maker, but that is NOT why I rate this with one star.Their video showed what they said was an iPhone 4S, but when the removed the back, their iPhone 4S in no way resembled our iPhone 4S. The vibrator motor displayed in their video, wasn't even seen in our iPhone and several screws inside their iPhone 4S were not anywhere close to where metal covers were located in our iPhone. I tossed in the towel and went out and bought my wife an iPhone 5S and was done with the kit.Long story made short, for about $30 more, you should be able to find someone in your town who is in the business of replacing iPhone glass. It will be faster and less frustrating this way, and you'll even save on the shipping.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DNXEP2RWG8V1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00822VUSY#wasThisHelpful","R3DNXEP2RWG8V1","A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't have big expectations for this trinket and wanted to use it one time for a party, however it failed to work right out of the package. It is extremely flimsy in every aspect of how it is designed and assembled and the build-quality is beyond abysmal.The wiring juncture (allowing the wiring harness to be plugged in from the control box to the light) is very fragile and if you plug the harness together and then need to unplug it, part of the plastic can come off and you have a mess of wires having raw ends. That being said, this device failed to work even BEFORE I pulled the harness apart. I was going to repack it and send it back to the vendor to get a refund, but the expense of mailing it back and the time needed out-value the refund I would receive.This is typical made in China, ""use once and throw it away"" quality but in my case, I wasn't even to use it one time. It's sad that we Americans tolerate ""quality"" like this where we are willing to spend money on cheap and poorly made trinkets from China and soon the trinkets are broken and then tossed away into the garbage, and with this product, it was worthless right out of the package.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IQF1VFE3JT6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMC4XLQ#wasThisHelpful","R3IQF1VFE3JT6Q","A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This cap is made of cotton and breathes better than my black poly cap, thus the comfort level is wonderful. The cap fits and rides well on my head and is easily adjusted to make it even more snug on days when the wind is really howling. The velcro strap in the back of the cap is so much better than the plastic adjustable strap with holes on the black cap I have.

"I'm very happy with this case as it does a very good job of protecting my LG 800G.

The indentation on the top of the case that engages the ""on/off"" button is a tad stiff and it makes it hard to turn the phone off. I find I have to use something like a dull screwdriver to make this button work, but I have arthritis and the average person might not have an issues with this.#2.

"(UPDATE 2-22-2012... ABC News aired a report tonight stating that Master Locks is pulling out of China! Hip-hip hurray... Now, when this lock is made in an American factory here in the USA, you'll see the quality go back to the longtime quality that Master Locks was famous for...)I've used Master locks since I was a kid in grade school back in the 60s. The name ""Master Lock"" until today stood for quality, dependability, safety, durability and ruggedness.About 15 years ago, I purchased 5 of the ""set your own combination"" padlocks made by Master for use on gates here at my farm and for tool boxes. These locks have stood the test of time outside in bad weather, dust, Texas heat, hail storms, ice, rain and snow and are still giving me great service to this day, which is why I ordered 5 more for tool boxes, gates, sheds etc, here on Amazon.My new Master Locks arrived this morning, 12-7-2011 and I was eager to change the combinations from the factory setting of 0-0-0-0 (as I have done in the past with my original MADE IN THE USA Master Locks) to the same combination as my older Master Locks. As I examined the locks, I noticed they were no longer housed in a bright brass case, but now came in a regular steel case that was spray painted a dull black. I can only imagine after being outside on a gate, or a trailer, the insides would turn to rust, unlike the old Master Locks that have real brass cases.When attempting to set the new combinations, one of them would NOT allow me to re-set the combination from the factory setting of 0-0-0-0. Two problems (that I can determine) why this lock would not allow this...#1. The small ""key"" for resetting the combinations that now comes with the lock is so thin now, it is not durable enough to twist inside the access hole to re-trigger the tumbler. The cheap key bends when attempting to turn it 90 degrees. Those darned folks in China, now they are even skimping on this little key! A few years back when these were made in the USA, the re-set key was stout enough to use for chipping ice. These days, the key must be made from re-cycled aluminum foil or something.#2. The rotary wheels on the new locks, do NOT click into place on the back of the lock (like my old Master Locks) where the numbers are suppose to align-up with a indentation where you dial the numbers. The ""slop"" in the action on these new locks is so bad, it's probably the reason the tumblers won't set when attempting to rotate the key. I spent half and hour trying to set the combination on three of the locks and I gave up. The tolerances are not as good with the Made In China Master Locks as the fit and tolerance as my old reliable MADE IN THE USA Master Locks.This is the first time in my 5 year relationship with Amazon that I am returning a purchase. Up to this time, everything I've ordered has been acceptable.These new Master Locks are no longer made in the United States (by craftsmen, like my older Master locks) and when I inspected the packages this afternoon, I confirmed my suspicions where they came from.After nearly 50 years of being a loyal Master Lock customer, I will probably not ever buy one of these poorly made locks from them again.

"It's dark and large and scares my dogs when I wear this contraption on my head but WOW, I like the fit and comfort despite my critters thinking Darth Vader just landed in the yard and is ""coming to get us...""I needed a replacement respirator for when I spray pesticides and spray paint and especially when shredding turf on my farm. Several months ago, I was shredding with my big tractor and 14 foot wide mower and I didn't have my old respirator on because I hated wearing it. It restricted my vision, was uncomfortable and was getting rather tired.In the process of going through some rough spots on the highway right-of-way, I must have shredded something having fiberglass particles in it. My eye became so irritated, I had to make an emergency run to an opthomologist where she found several shards in my eye and was able to remove them (the pain was incredible!) and the very next day I ordered the 3M 6900 full-face respirator. I have used this product on 6 occasions and LOVE the comfort but especially the superior vision it affords over my previous respirator. One of the reasons I went with this is because I have never found any product made by 3M not to exceed my expectations.This respirator has a feature (if you purchase as an option) to allow for prescription lenses to be wore underneath. It was too pricy for me, so I called my eye doctor and ordered several sets of disposable contact lenses to wear underneath. They (and my 3M 6900) are serving me well as I shred, paint and apply herbicides... I'm very happy with my purchase.

The technician recommended a LifeProof case at Best Buy and he said that probably would have that would have prevented the glass screen on my old iPhone from breaking. While he is making the repair to my old iPhone, I go to Best Buy and purchase the LifeProof case for my new 4S.All is well with the new iPhone and LifeProof case. I notice it takes a little more pressure to make the apps work through the LifeProof screen but no big deal, I quickly adapt.A couple of weeks later, my wife and I take a flight from Dallas/Fort Worth airport to Savanna, Georgia and we return home a week later.  I didn't use my iPhone 4S for making calls while we were gone, except to use the mapping apps while in Savanna.It's now the first week of November, and as I use my iPhone 4S for making calls after the adventure in Savannah, the audio is muffled. People I call are complaining that they are hearing their own voice being echoed when they talk back to me. Some of the calls I place to people, my own audio is so distorted that people can't understand me. I suspect a problem with my new iPhone and I Google ""iPhone 4S distorted audio"", iPhone 4s audio echo"" and I find numerous sites where people are complaining about their new iPhone 4S having audio clarity problems as I have experienced. I call Apple and they arrange to have my iPhone 4S sent back for warranty repair.  A few days later, the replacement iPhone 4S arrives, it checks out fine and I place it back in the LifeProof case. All is well for a number of days, the iPhone works fine. I make a quick trip to Colorado, return home and the next day, I call a business in a nearby town. The person says repeatedly ""hello, HELLO"" and then hangs up on me... I call my wife at work and while she recognizes my number on her iPhone, she can't understand me because my audio is so garbled.I call Apple and talk to them about the garbled audio and I advise them this replacement phone only holds a charge for  a day. Apple graciously sends me an overnight box to return my iPhone 4S. A few days later, the 3rd iPhone 4S arrives and the battery on this 3rd 4S runs nearly two days... I'm a happy camper with two days use on the 4S.  I place the 3rd 4S back in the LifeProof case... everything works out fine.  A week later, the dreaded audio feedback, garbled audio returns. I call Apple and ask them what my problem is. This time the Apple rep suggests the problem is with AT&T.I am so frustrated at this point; I purchase a TracFone and use it until I can make the 100-mile drive to the AT&T store and advise them Apple suggests the problem with my terrible audio is on their end. The store manager directs me to one of her reps (a savvy retired Air Force guy) and I explain my problem to him.  He takes one quick look at my iPhone 4S and says, ""Here's your problem. The LifeProof case!""  He tells me to go outside and to call him on his phone. Sure enough, he can't even understand me. He motions for me to come back in and he removes the LifeProof case asking me to go back outside. I call him again and the audio on both sides is crystal clear.  PROBLEM SOLVED...I go home, get online to LifeProof and advise their case had been causing severe audio feedback and echo problems (and I am not the only customer affected...) and I advise I have just changed my 5 star review I left on Amazon to a 1 star review. She advises that they are ""no longer"" marketing LifeProof cases through Amazon. Had you purchased your case at BestBuy, we could have replaced your case with a new one.""  She never offered me any explanation, did not offer to exchange my case and I was stuck with this defective product they flooded the market with.LifeProof (in their wisdom) gives this ""corrective fix"" to customers in regard to their inherent defective cases... ""Blow hard into the microphone for about 3 to 4 seconds.  The sufficient effort require(d) is akin to blowing a candle out.  You could also pretend you were blowing up a balloon by sealing your lips over the hole and then blowing.""  Well, many people are tired of having to blow into their defective LifeProof cases several if not dozens of times per day (Google for yourself and especially on MacRumors)LifeProof didn't do a good job at designing this case. Their ""fix"" didn't work for me... many 3rd party accessories, such as chargers and audio docking devices DO NOT work with their case. Many people complain that the screen on the LifeProof makes it more difficult to work apps... I'd strongly recommend researching though Google or Bing what other customers have to say about this case. It seems to me that LifeProof ""GOOFED"" when they were designing this product.In hindsight, It seems that any changes in barometric pressure, or changes in altitude (such as when I went from 1,400 feet at the DFW airport to sea-level in Savanah... and even when going up and down in an elevator) can trigger the problems associated with pressures inside the LifeProof case. If the pressure changes, it seems that audio from the person you are calling gets ""funneled"" back into the mouthpiece on the iPhone and creates this ""echo"" problem that many people experience when they are talking to someone having a LifeProof case on their iPhone. I even concluded that changes in temperatures can trigger the audio problems. It seems the problem is worse in colder weather than during warm temperatures.The LifeProof case is very sexy looking. It fit nicely in my shirt pocket and was much more comfortable than my new Mophie case that I bought to replace the LifeProof (however the Mophie has an internal back-up battery and thus the reason for the extra bulk in my shirt pocket compared to the slender LifeProof case.) Please also be warned that LifeProof advises that the gaskets that make the case waterproof will be rendered useless after you have removed your iPhone from the case ""50 times."" So, if you are having to pull your iPhone out of the case in order to make it work with docking stations and chargers that the LifeProof case CAN NOT ACCEPT, soon, your LifeProof case is no longer waterproof.If you are happy to constantly blow onto the case... if you can live without your 3rd party accessories that you have for your iPhone that are NOT compatible with the LifeProof case... and if you don't have a problem with something called ""pillowing"" associated with this product (I never had that specific problem) you might actually like the LifeProof case... but for me, their ""service after the sale"" and numerous problems with this case (that ate up the biggest part of my $100 bill) isn't worth the grief and aggravation. And it looks really silly when you are at an airport or out in public, blowing into your iPhone in order to make the LifeProof case ""happy.""","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU4YM233H5NGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005E52BGC#wasThisHelpful","RU4YM233H5NGP","A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:31 MinsI've been using electric gate openers on my farm since 1997. My first ""batch"" of gate openers was marketed as ""GTO"" whom I suspect is or was acquired by Mighty Mule a few years ago.I currently have 4 each Mighty Mule 350 gate openers on my farm. From my experience, they seem to last only as long as the warranty is valid.  I figure these must have a computer chip that automatically makes them go defunct about a week after they have been in service for a year. My latest issue is the opener that gives access to our yard (from a livestock pasture) has for no reason started opening and closing on it's own. (The video I'm showing with my review was shot on my cell phone... I just happened to be walking form my barn back to my house when I saw the gate opener going nuts. It opened on it's own for no reason and then started closing a couple of feet, and then jerking backwards to close, then opening a few feet and closing. This process continued for more than ten minutes. Sorry for the lousy video, it was a spur of the moment thing.)One of my dogs got out in the middle of the night because the Mighty Mule started opening and closing on it's own in early September. Here it is nearly October and the Mighty Mule is still going nuts, despite turning it off for 24 hours hoping it had a software issue.  We live 1,200 from the highway, so we know this isn't happening because of someone else using a remote control, and none of the other gate openers are going nuts (at the moment, but as soon as they are a year old, based on 14 years of experience, they will die or go ""nuts"" about a week after they have been in service for exactly a year.I guess it is just best to figure the gate openers cost $1 per day and at the end of the year, you buy another one. They don't seem to have any competition, so you are basically stuck with the company who makes the Mighty Mule.From now on, each time we leave our yard and our farm for even short durations, we are forced to get out of our vehicle and turn the power switch off to ensure our gates just don't go ""bump"" in the night allowing livestock or pets to escape, or thieves to enter our property.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F2ODG3JERHDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A8RC9O#wasThisHelpful","R2F2ODG3JERHDH","A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I3GL5GLBEQ7X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I buy a lot of shoes on line and know that I have a standard size 9.5 W foot.  Sometimes the width can get a bit tricky,  as some shoes are narrower or wider than others.  But I'm always size 9.5. That is why I was so surprised with these shoes - the width was fine,  but the length was definitely too short,  my toes were high up against the tip of the shoe and it was not comfortable at all.  I tried them on in the house and then returned them immediately.  I agree with the person who said they were a good utility shoe,  but I was hoping for a little more line/elegance when I got them,  but they were just as clunky as the landsend shoes I get - which are far more comfortable.  So I will hesitate to buy Vaneli on line again until I get a better sense of their sizingAs always,  Amazon makes returns effortless and smooth.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B94J1OD1J2QM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9RW0CC#wasThisHelpful","R1B94J1OD1J2QM","A14R9XMZVJ6INB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14R9XMZVJ6INB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the brand Propet,  I've bought them before and I'm a standard size 9.5 W with them.  I liked the look and the stone color a lot.  Unfortunately,  while the toes were comfortable and wide enough,  the back of the show was oddly lower than normal and worked more like a slipper than a shoe,  slipping on and off as I walked.  This would only get worse as the leather got looser,  so despite the great price,  I had to return them.  As always,  Amazon returns were effortless.  I buy with confidence now that they offer free returns on shoes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NTR7PAVOZK5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPEEBPS#wasThisHelpful","R2NTR7PAVOZK5P","A14R9XMZVJ6INB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14R9XMZVJ6INB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a hard book for me to rate.  It's certainly not easily forgettable - which is saying something,  seeing how many books I read a year.  But it's not a comfortable read or a comfortable relationship that is created.  There are spoilers in this review.I actually think that Daniel,  the sleep deprived,  sleep walking,  sleeping killing protagonist was actually too crazy,  and I worried for Bel,  Joe Bellman,  the young local cop who might/wants to save him.  This is one of those angst ridden tortured romances but Daniel couldn't always distinguish reality from his sleep walking escapades and he felt fragile and damaged to me.  Joe Beman (Bel) was a good young cop,  not exactly hiding but not publicizing his gayness.  They meet when Daniel sleep drives himself to danger and Bel gets him out of it.  I was interested while I read it and thought about it afterwards but I wouldn't classify this as a romance,  and the violence in it is also disturbing (and non consensual,  though not between the lovers)  I think Daniel needed a lot more work on himself and perhaps a stint in a psychiatric hospital would not have gone amiss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30RM5TFKLD03Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J6PCAKI#wasThisHelpful","R30RM5TFKLD03Q","A14R9XMZVJ6INB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14R9XMZVJ6INB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I liked everything about this book,  from the main characters,  their internal thoughts,  their connection,  to the secondary characters and the descriptions of college and small town life.

"I've read a lot of Cardeno C and s/he has written some of my all time m/m  favorites.  However this book was frankly... boring.  It lacked the intensity that Cardeno usually brings and it was both low key and also hard to believe at the same time.  For someone who was close enough to Jesse to inherit his diner,  Tanner didn't seem to know much about his life,  and seeing Mike was one of his closest friends, he didn't know much about his home life.  I didn't like the age differences,  didn't like the story development,  didn't feel engaged with either the quiet shy Tanner or the more beautiful macho Steve.

"I always look forward to a new Lucas Davenport book.  I love his voice,  his friendships, his point of view.  The only negative is that he is so familiar to me after 25 books, some of which I have reread,  that he can be too familiar - there are no surprises with him.  These hard boiled twisty crimes which are often horrific and with very high body counts are starting to feel a bit like cozy mysteries to me.  Of course if you've not read the other 25 books,  you would find this a crazy statement.However,  I feel that Sandford is also suffering a bit,  which is why Lucas is so over his position at the BCA.  Indeed,  the majority of the book is not even set in Minnesota.  Also while his characters are aging,  they don't really address this enough,  and that could be a very lively theme in the forthcoming books (I definitely want this series to continue!)  What happens to the cool 35 year old cop when he is 50 plus.  There has to be a different point of view,  and that is the elephant in Lucas's house - he needs to have a case where he confronts his own aging and allows that to be part of the story,  otherwise it's sharply written and engaging while we read it,  but not truly memorable afterwards.Maybe I am expecting too much,  but some of the earlier books really lingered ( Shadow Prey is a personal favorite) and some of these later ones I devour like popcorn,  but then forget as soon as they are done.

These fit just fine in terms of length and width,  but a good walking shoe can make you feel like you are walking on air,  and these most definitely did not.

The characters knew each other for a few years, so it wasn't precisely whirlwind, but they neither of them felt three dimensional or real.  The Japanese Takeo was a cipher,  and the hero,  whose point of view we saw the most,  was kind of bland.

"these bars were recommended to me.  I love variety assortments, because it gives me so many options.  I didn't love these bars as much as my friends did.  They also mentioned zapping them in the microwave for 30 seconds to get a warm brownie affect. They are low in sugar and have a good amount of protein,  so I would recommend them on that level.

However this one is different, he actually takes it out of his toy bowl and plays with it all by himself,  and if we offer it to him, he takes it happily.

"I just received these headphones in time for the Thanksgiving break. They are getting lots of use between the hubby's football games blasting & my son's xbox. I have enjoyed catching up on several of my shows using my iPad and drowning out all the other noises in the house!I normally use Bose headphones [...], so my comparisons will be based on this:1. These headphones are heavier & have an 80's retro feel to them2. They are bulky and will not be great for travel3. There is a nice extension cord that allows for longer or shorter lengths depending on your device (arm wearing or for laps etc.)4. They block out outside ambient noise (thank goodness!)5. Gold plated jacks for higher quality6. The ear muffs sit a little tight & square on your ears7. There is amble padding on the top of the earphones for comfort on your headI think I like the Bose headphones better because they deliver everything these headphones do but come in a better design for travel etc.My 2 cents!

There is also a small hole that can be punched out if you need your bags to hang on pegs for a commercial application.Thank you Avery for making this ""Mom's"" job easier!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E31OJMVFOB2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IMAOJM#wasThisHelpful","R1E31OJMVFOB2C","A261Q5U692JF17","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A261Q5U692JF17?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What would you do if you could go back in time?  Would you change anything?  Brock Matthews has that experience via his dreams.  He begins to have a nightmare involving his deceased father for five nights in a row.  He visits his best friend who gives him a book on lucid dreaming which claims that the dreamer can learn to control his dreams and thereby stop the nightmare from occurring.  Brock reads the book, finds it intriguing and gives it a try.  What happens next…well, you’ll have to read the book to find out!Brock’s life, in addition to his nightmare, is falling apart.  His world famous coffee company that he runs with his brother is on the verge of bankruptcy, his wife is very distant and aloof and at his high school reunion an old girlfriend makes an appearance and an impression on Brock.  Brock also has some guilt over the way his relationship with his father stood at the time of his father’s death.  In addition, he has always felt his father loved his brother more and has been very competitive with his brother in just about everything.  He and his brother have a lot of tension in their relationship.  What if he could change things?  Brock has always viewed himself as a Christian, and he is sure he knows God’s plan for him.This was a very interesting concept of redemption and healing.  I’ve read other books by this author and really enjoyed them.  The regrets about the past and the wishing for a “do-over” in some situations really rang true for me.  I liked the faith elements in the story as well as the realistic struggles Brock encountered.  The emotions evoked from grief to laughter were something else that engaged me in the story.  I’m looking forward to the next intriguing story from the pen of this author!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QSR4IYO11F73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401686117#wasThisHelpful","R3QSR4IYO11F73","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The setting of the story begins in Chicago right before Christmas.  A wonderful 86-year-old lady named Joy wants to spread Christmas joy along route 66.  Miranda, a young divorcee just returning from visiting her sister, sees Joy packing all these large tubs with names on them.  Soon, before Miranda knows what hit her, she joins Joy on the ride, learning to drive an RV.  Hopefully, Joy will see life come into Miranda’s eyes again.  You see Miranda has no members of her family living close by, Joy is moving, the house is in foreclosure and Miranda has no job.The novel then leads readers on a heartfelt journey into some of the lives of various people who connected with Joy via her website.  Throughout the tale readers are reminded of ways to share joy with others and not to be as self-absorbed as society tends to live life.  I loved this elderly character and her heart to take one last trip before entering an assisted living facility near where her two grown sons live.Joy is a character whose actions challenge us to think outside the box in creative ways in giving away some much of what we have been blessed to own.  Above all, the greatest gift Joy gives is of her time, energy and looking for those who need to be reached by listening to their stories with a heart of love.  Lastly, though Joy’s plans didn’t quite go the way she had planned, she trusted the Lord to do that which would glorify Him as well as touch many people’s hearts and lives.This is a very heartwarming story that I hope you will read and share with others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9OLHOIXOD2RF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800719670#wasThisHelpful","R9OLHOIXOD2RF","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is a devotional that doesn’t spew platitudes, but encourages women in their walk with the Lord.  One devotion I read wasn’t just about prayer, but also placed a letter of Paul in its historical context.  Read the Scripture portion placed underneath the title for the day’s devotion.  Use whatever version you are comfortable with, then there is space where women can write thoughts, prayers, questions, etc.Personally, I would have liked to see more thought-provoking writing beyond the couple of minutes that it takes to read at its current length.  I would suggest not writing in the book as the ink might bleed through the pages plus the advantage of using a notebook means no shortage of room to write what the Lord places on your heart or whatever you wish to express to Him.Use the devotional at a moment to reenergize your Spirit or in the times you’re able to sit, being still to know He is God!  These books are a great way to start having regular moments with the Lord or can spark study into a topic or book in the Bible at a deeper level.

"Prince Malachi at the age of 21 is forced into an arranged marriage by his father when his brother refuses to marry the girl whose father saved the life of their father.  Malachi meets his bride at their wedding ceremony and soon discovers she is no more interested in marrying him than he is in marrying her.  However, he will obey his father and he promises Jessabelle he will be a faithful husband.  At 19, Jessabelle has never even been on a date and now finds herself married to a royal prince.  She is thrust into the public eye and a royal family when all she wants to do is blend into the background.  She is not comfortable in her marriage or her position as a royal princess.  Will she ever get over her insecurity and feel a sense of belonging in this royal family?A mere three weeks after her wedding, her father dies.  Jessabelle is still trying to adjust to being a wife and now she grieves for her father.  Her mother died when she was a young girl, so now she feels all alone.  Her husband is incredibly kind and respectful of her.  He supports her any way he can.  Jessabelle begins to have an inkling of what love might be like, but is far from letting down her emotional walls to let Malachi into her heart.While I enjoyed this book, I wish I would have read the author’s other series about other members of the royal family as I felt I was missing some background on several of the characters that appeared in this book.  Events and relationships were referred to that I didn’t know about.  This didn’t detract from the writing or the plot of this story though I would have liked to know these details to enhance my reading experience.  Prince Malachi was a wonderful prince and Christian man with a great deal of patience, compassion and empathy for his new bride.  He was so gentle and loving toward her; he treated her as precious to him, but also reminded her that her identity came from God not man.  I liked getting to know Jessabelle and see her grow into her place in the royal family.  The relationship development between Jessabelle and Malachi was also very touching.  I’m looking forward to future books in this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUX6JIZSKA4YT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990987272#wasThisHelpful","RUX6JIZSKA4YT","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I learned who the author was of Sky Lantern I knew I wanted to read it as Matt writes with lots of heart and soul.  I knew nothing about sky lanterns until I saw them in a few movies and my curiosity was sparked.  What is shared is a story of a young lady who lost her father to cancer and part of her way of expressing her heart was writing a simple note and sending it off on a lantern.I believe that God, who is in control of all things, made sure the lantern came down in Matt’s yard.  He is a father of three daughters.  Matt places an open letter on his blog, hoping to connect with the girl who sent the lantern.  Anyone who wishes to read the letter that sets the adventure in motion can read it online.What is so astounding is the number of people that were touched and encouraged when Matt set out to meet with the girl.  When you get the book, plan on being touched deeply in your soul, heart with possibly tears in your eyes.  Anyone who has lost a family member or friend or known someone who has will want to see what acts of kindness can do to peoples’ hearts and lives.  Along with that, I think the book shows the strong bond between parents and children and to nurture that relationship until the end of their life!  Seize the moment and make the most of the time God gives you to build trust, love, a godly legacy and good memories!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R184NMV4UBZ0IA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501123491#wasThisHelpful","R184NMV4UBZ0IA","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story is definitely a heart-tugging, attention-grabbing, emotional rollercoaster kind of novel.  The main female character is named Tammy.  She finds her marriage falling apart, single-parenting is more than a challenge, her work as an organ procurement coordinator fulfilling and she seeks to speak the gospel message to her clients.Nick is a divorcee who loses his firstborn son in an accident, which is how his and Tammy’s paths cross again.  They had not seen each other since high school ten years ago.  Nick is dealing with grief and an ex-wife who is keeping their other son away from him as she blames him for the death of their first son.I found the themes of prayer, leaning on the Lord, forgiveness, trust and more very refreshing to see in the tale.  The author shows us through other minor characters what unforgiveness, bitterness and other unresolved feelings can do to an individual as well as having a rippling effect on others.Another aspect of the story that brings the aspect of reality to it is that resolving issues and dealing with emotions takes time.  The subplot of a father unknown by his son and learning what he was told about his father was not truth caused Nick to go looking to find out what really became of his dad.  The book doesn’t tie up all the various threads into nice packages with some threads are left hanging.  I think that leaves it to the reader’s imagination as to how situations can possibly be resolved.I highly recommend Jennifer’s novel and consider the many ways we can stand beside a friend, learn from others’ mistakes and as well as our own.  Readers will also be shown that finding the fulfillment we seek isn’t in a paycheck, but in sharing Jesus with whomever we meet this side of heaven!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMLHK11FAD4XB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596694432#wasThisHelpful","RMLHK11FAD4XB","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We met the Whitman family in the first book of the series, Home to Chicory Lane, followed by Two Roads Home.  In each story, we are given a bird’s-eye view into the various issues some of the grown Whitman children have faced along with how they interact and the running of the inn.  Here, in the third book, the author tackles a couple of hard issues such as domestic abuse, infertility, adoption, marriage and faith.  I was really grabbed by the heart when Danea continued to be disappointed about not getting pregnant even when spending so much money.As God opens her eyes, she decides to volunteer at a home for domestically fractured families, meeting a woman named Misty.  When Danea and her husband Dallas willingly take Misty’s son into their home over Thanksgiving, there comes a point when it becomes evident that Misty is in trouble.  She doesn’t return as agreed and no one is able to contact her.  The couple is facing challenging decisions as their hearts love Misty’s 3-year-old son, but she is now in legal trouble and facing a long separation from her son.  However, there is also a secret Misty has kept from this couple that will require more wrestling with God and lots of prayer.The Whitman characters are close to one another and stand with each other through the various seasons of life.  I love how the grandparents are there as sounding boards or for counsel and most importantly as prayer warriors for the children’s families.  The patriarch, Grant, wants to make sure that the family doesn’t lose its closeness so he has them over every Tuesday night for family nights.  Rightly portrayed is how sometimes the families aren’t thrilled about coming over; yet, they learn the cost of coming over and being together is well worth the sacrifice each makes to be there every week.I look forward to the fourth book coming out in 2016 and if it is the last one that will be hard as I have enjoyed the Whitman family a whole lot!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKDS77JUZGT6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426770456#wasThisHelpful","RKDS77JUZGT6X","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The other two novels in this series are, A Woman of Fortune and Where Rivers Part.  Each book can be read as a stand-alone, so if you dislike one you can try another.  Why do I suggest trying another?  Well, A Woman of Fortune wasn’t bad, but it just didn’t draw me in whereas Where Rivers Part captured my heart.  Now, with A Reason to Stay, it was a little hard to read though not due to the author’s writing.  There is a scene in chapter two that unfortunately is reminiscent of an actual event where a shooter took the life of a reporter, cameraman and injured the woman being interviewed.  For me that was very hard to read even though in a fictional world and with made up characters.  I don’t think the author intended to hurt anyone by including this scene in her novel, but it might be hard for some to read.The main female character is Faith who is working in the media as a news anchor when the news station decides to hire a professional group to shadow Faith for a couple weeks.  With the viewership in slow decline, they want to find out what changes need to be made in order to bring the ratings back up.  Faith isn’t happy about this and it appears this professional group peeks into every part of her life, both professional and personal.Faith was not happy in her marriage and hadn’t decided which route she wanted to take.  Geary, her husband had a definite view of how he wanted some things done in his marriage to Faith.  Both bring their baggage into the marriage as well as their brokenness, which must be dealt with or their marriage is over even though it has barely begun.The best truth of the whole book is that when we turn things over to God and work on our marriage, amazing things happen.  It isn’t a magic wand; it is hard work mostly on our knees in prayer and some may take part in counseling.  However, God leads couples to face their hearts’ truth and knowing He will do above and beyond all we ask or think brings hope.  I for one can testify that God does heal peoples’ broken marriages and can cause growth.  He also renews, restores and refreshes!  So it is so good that the author gives the readers real hope that is found in God and God alone!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNU8AWDMXU3NK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800722744#wasThisHelpful","RNU8AWDMXU3NK","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first point Ann brings to light is both the negative definition of the word “wicked” and the way it is used as slang.  Such as “that movie was wicked I want to see it again!”  So the characters we learn about in the study are those women who were wicked and displeased God.  We also learn of “wickedly” awesome women we may want to be like as we learn from them in the Bible.I learned Ann has written other books along this line and that she isn’t a trained theologian, but a woman who desires to help women draw near to the Author of the Bible.  Like Ann shares with us, in ancient times stories were passed down orally from one generation to the next.  God in His sovereignty in His time took the oral tradition and brought it to print down through generations to today.  What a God He is who loves us before we loved Him, and He continues to invite us to sit at His feet and learn.Each chapter quotes from the Bible and then readers can read a fictionalized account that might help them cement the women studied in their minds and hearts.  Afterwards, we are told a little about the time in which the people lived and the event took place.  Let us never forget these were real people who lived, loved, followed God or disobeyed Him among other actions.Whether readers do this study in a group setting or alone with the Lord, there are questions which help us contemplate, remember and encourage us to grow in Him.  The study isn’t just for head knowledge, but for heart knowledge leading to a life that is transformed by His Word.There are 20 chapters with which to enjoy, be encouraged or exhorted.  We can learn from those who were wicked as in evil as well as we can learn from those who just were women who chose to do or say as He directed.  I hope that you will delve into the 20 women Ann highlights and consider sharing what the Lord shows you with another person who wants to grow with you using this study.  The study is not an end-all, but a beginning.  When you are done, consider studying further any of the women who you learned from and want to know more about from the Bible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AESNKABQFSHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031034168X#wasThisHelpful","R1AESNKABQFSHV","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Amish of Bee County series began with the novel, The Beekeeper’s Son; here is the sequel to that story, The Bishop’s Son.  Readers can look forward to the next novel in the series in 2016 titled, The Saddlemaker’s Son.There are two young men interested in the main female character named Leila.  Jesse, though a bishop’s son, hasn’t yet committed himself to the Amish life or church as he continues to enjoy his freedom.  Will is committed to the Amish way wholeheartedly and is interested in Leila as well.  Jesse wants to show Leila a different world than her Amish community, and Will wants her to remain close to the community even though she is interested in working outside the Amish village.Kelly Irwin writes interesting novels though sometimes the ending is quite predictable.  What brings tension into the story isn’t just two young men interested in one girl, but the fact that they are also cousins.  The beliefs of the Amish and Christianity are brought to the story in an interesting way.I think the relationship tension along with wrestling with one’s personal beliefs though interesting just didn’t capture my attention as much as I had hoped.  The author writes a good novel; it just didn’t click with me.  You might consider reading the first book, The Beekeeper’s Son, in order to understand the background of the lead characters.  Kelly Irwin has written other novels as well so if these stories don’t draw you in like me consider looking into her other books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R331OQTCQP1EKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310339545#wasThisHelpful","R331OQTCQP1EKQ","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The brothers of St. Alcuin’s are back in this fourth book, preparing for the new abbot’s return.  Brother John is now the Abbot and has returned after a year’s training in Cambridge to take up the position of leader of St. Alcuin’s.  He doesn’t feel up to the task of filling Father Peregrine’s shoes.  As he begins his service, he is overwhelmed with the details and never-ending duties of his office.  He still has the heart of a healer and sometimes wonders if he has made the right decision is becoming abbot.In addition to all his new responsibilities, an enemy of Father Peregrine’s shows up at the doorstep of the monastery seeking admittance.  This throws the brotherhood into division as to how to proceed with this newcomer in their midst.  Some want to refuse him admittance while others plead to show mercy and the love of Christ to him.  Can the brothers come to a uniform decision or will this be a splinter that continues to fester until the infection spreads unchecked.I would recommend reading the series in order from the beginning before reading this fourth book.  I have enjoyed this series tremendously.  The writing evokes emotions and touches the heart.  I can’t imagine having less in common with monks in medieval England, but their emotional and spiritual struggles ring true to me in this day and age.  The author writes with great depth and has researched well her topic.  I feel as if I’m right there in the monastery with the monks, living life with them daily.  Readers will see humor in some characters, legalism in some and great compassion and mercy by showing the love of Christ in others.  This series is definitely on my “keeper” shelf and I hope it will be on your shelf as well!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OOV2CIUZP4RE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782641483#wasThisHelpful","R2OOV2CIUZP4RE","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How I so enjoy a good story, don’t you?  The Imposter weaves a wonderful tale about loss, love, redemption, and so much more.  In the story, we read of two men who really couldn’t face the truth in their lives while having no problems pointing out the faults of others.  However, they didn’t stop there and the pain caused repercussions in many lives.  The various characters are created with strengths and weaknesses along with living life well and making mistakes.Seeing the pastor honestly not know how to deal with a couple of issues, but praying with uplifted hands under the stars was for me the best.  I could just imagine seeing a person lifting both hands and giving the burden to Jesus, then walking away a whole lot lighter than when they began praying.  More than a few people in the community had things to repent of and then had hope blooming in their hearts to walk fresh from that point forward with God.In the story, there is sadness when some choose not to repent or allow the Lord to be in control.  Parts of the story towards the end revealed things I never saw coming.  I like stories that convey truth, faith and real humanity, which this author does a grand job creating.  None of it for me was dry or unbelievable; it was lifelike, real, heart-touching and faith-building.  Books are very unique and never seem to grow old.  Stories are there for us to read again and again perhaps sharing with those in our lives.  I cannot wait till the next book comes out in this new series by Suzanne Woods Fisher!  Grab a copy, settle into a comfy chair and lose yourself in the world created in The Imposter!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JUL448Z7F6ZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800723201#wasThisHelpful","R3JUL448Z7F6ZD","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ted Dekker is an author who never ceases to amaze me with the stories he shares with all of us!  A. D. 33 is the sequel to A. D. 30 where we meet again with Maviah and Saba who are learning what it really means to follow Yeshua.  They are also learning what His teachings mean and how He means for them to live out the truths compared to what they thought they meant.  We enjoy the action, battles, intrigue and how the disciples possibly acted or spoke around the Messiah.I felt as I read how sand would feel when different characters were racing on camels to battle or to another city.  The scene of the arena really stole my breath as a person was chained to a pole, bathed in blood and the lion enters.  Whew!  It was like being a spectator and wanting to yell for a savior or to the king or queen to spare the life.  How Ted Dekker brings the various aspects of the Lord or Scripture or action was just mind boggling.To be able to travel backwards to a time long past where Christ was living and facing the sacrifice of Himself for all mankind deeply touched the heart of this reader.  Both books, A. D. 30 & 33, are definitely novels to share with those who love to read or love history.  When anyone opens these books, be prepared to be challenged and changed as the words or actions of a character you might relate to responds to Yeshua’s offer.With the holidays around the corner, please consider giving a set of these novels to people you know whether they are family, friends, neighbors or coworkers.  Be ready to share what you loved about the stories and hear what the recipients of the novels thought too.  Book clubs will really benefit from doing both novels and sharing how various parts of the stories spoke to their heart.  Unlike other Ted Dekker novels or other novels of this type, Christ is pointed to and at the end of A. D. 33 there is a link for readers to download a free e-book.Enjoy the novels as well as what the author shares of his heart before delving into the world of fiction!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ODDZQ6JCCAOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1599954176#wasThisHelpful","R2ODDZQ6JCCAOC","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Keane has returned to Hidden Springs, Kentucky after serving in Columbus on the police force.  Upon his return, he begins work as a deputy for the county sheriff.  He likes being back home in his own small town that was founded by his ancestors.  He hopes one day to raise his children here.  His Aunt Lindy still lives in the family home, but has assured him once he marries she will move out and into an apartment.  She strongly hints that she hopes that will be soon, with the right girl of course.Then the town gossip stomps into the sheriff’s office, which is located in the courthouse, complaining of a drunken man sitting on the courthouse steps.  When Michael goes to investigate, he finds much more than he bargained for.  With an unidentified body found dead on the courthouse steps, rumors begin flying.  However, one person is hesitant to say much and soon pays a high price for silence.  Now, with two murders in this small town and no leads, Michael begins to look to the past, including his own, in order to ferret out any clues or leads so he can stop the killer before he/she strikes again.This is a good start to the new genre of mystery for this author.  The story moved a little bit slow, but there is a great, suspense-filled scene toward the end of the book where readers find out the identity of the killer.  I really liked Aunt Lindy’s never give up attitude and her expecting God to work miracles.  She had complete faith that he would work a miracle in healing her nephew, and He did.  The character of Lester reminded me of Barney Fife from the old Andy Griffith television show, which made for a few laughs.  The world of small town politics and gossip is alive and well in this story.  I’m looking forward to the second book in the series to revisit the small town residents of Hidden Springs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PUXR2QEXXTZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XNJGRPM#wasThisHelpful","R3PUXR2QEXXTZ1","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Title:  A Lesson in Hope (Hope #2)Author:  Philip GulleyPages:  272Year:  2015Publisher:  Center StreetMy rating is 4 stars.I’ve never read any Philip Gulley books so I did look at some of his previous books as well as what other readers thought.  Some of the reviews weren’t clear enough for me to know whether the reader enjoyed it or not, plus it would have been advantageous for me to have read the Harmony Series to understand the main male character, which I haven’t done.As a Quaker Pastor, Sam definitely is in many situations that are hard and challenging as are many pastors.  Sam is supported by his wife Barbara.  His parents drop in for a visit and his brother then decides to introduce the woman he is dating.  The background characters are various, intriguing and can be found in any church.  Sam doesn’t seem to me to be held by convictions of a pastor as he is of what others think he should or shouldn’t do.  The story really places a heavy concentration in what or where Sam finds fulfillment.  In one place, he doesn’t seem to understand the blessings around him until he calls a meeting house only to learn the letter he received was sent out to many and not just to him.There were some very funny parts in the book that caused me to burst out laughing and they came when I least expected them.  I appreciated those moments as well as the tension in the congregation when it learns it is to receive a large sum of money.  Perhaps if I had time to read the other series or understood the Friends beliefs I would understand more what the author shares.  However, authors need to realize that some readers draw conclusions, rightly or wrongly, from fiction as they do nonfiction.  Be careful of what and how you present a denomination in life, beliefs or mannerisms.I do suggest readers read the Harmony series to get a better understanding of the main character Sam as the pastor, as well as the congregations.Disclosure of Material Connection:  I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.

"Bonnie S. Calhoun’s Lightning picks up where Thunder left off.  Selah Rishon has transformed into a novarium or enhanced human.  She grows in power and skill as she continues to find out more about her biological father and his people.  In the meantime, Selah discovers that her mother, little brother, and step-father have disappeared, and she embarks on a journey back to the mountain to find her family and to find out all she can about what she is becoming.  The evil that is in the mountain threatens to destroy Selah and her family, but she must do all that she can to rescue them before it may be too late.  At great personal cost, she survives to begin a new journey to the west where she must find the Third Protocol that will complete her transformation.With action and peril throughout, Bonnie Calhoun delivers a story that includes what makes her happy as a writer:  body count, blood, and blowing things up.  It all appears in this action-packed story along with well-written characters that convey bravery as well as fear, conflict as well as strength, darkness as well as light.  Although the story takes place a few hundred years in the future in the ruins of what was once America before a super volcanic eruption wiped out most of the country, hope still survives in the midst of treachery and turmoil.  These characters are believable and portray both the best and worst of human beings.  Even those who are on the “right” side are shown as flawed, which adds to the realism of the story along with providing for an interesting plot.Those who read this novel will certainly look forward to book three of the Stone Braide Chronicles—coming fall 2016!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JSMVBNYA1NLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800723775#wasThisHelpful","R1JSMVBNYA1NLE","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What way to end a series that begins with A Promise to Cherish followed by Promise to Return!  As hard as it is for authors to conclude a series, for me as a reader it is hard too as I have loved the series and become attached to the characters.  The last book focuses on the returning soldier Joe and his becoming familiar with the life outside of a war zone.  Joe also has to learn to communicate with his deaf daughter and build trust with her again since he just left her with Esther, his wife’s cousin, after his wife’s death.For years Esther has had to learn how to communicate with Daisy as well as help her with her emotions from losing her mom and her father’s desertion.  Esther has been caring for people since she was a child herself along with people leaving her without any explanation or care.  Esther must also deal with the fact that she is Amish and Joe is English.  He expected Esther to raise Daisy in the ways of Englishers of which she is unfamiliar.  There are memories that haunt Esther along with emotions she has kept locked away in her heart until her “dead” father suddenly shows up.The author was raised as a child in the Amish life until her family decided to leave the Amish community. The inside knowledge the author shares makes her stories believable as well as captures the heart of readers.  One theme is how soldiers need time to acclimate to daily life without war but with memories of war.  There is an internal struggle going on inside Esther to understand what sin really is, what the church expects and one fails to do isn’t sin.  The risk to love is hardest of all for Esther and Daisy too because of having experienced abandonment in their pasts.All three books will not just entertain, but capture your heart and allow you to perhaps lose yourself for a while in the fictional setting or characters’ lives.  Through it all, it is God who never leaves us.  He alone heals us in the deepest parts of our hearts and souls.  We have only to be still and know He is God.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHZEZM4M7JUVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476735050#wasThisHelpful","RHZEZM4M7JUVA","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What do you have when adding a pinch of work and mix it with family issues, murder and intrigue? Another suspense driven FBI case that will keep readers turning pages until the conclusion!  Thatcher is the experienced FBI agent who is paired up with Bethany from another FBI division.  From the start there are sparks because their methods of solving a case are as vastly different as are their personalities.The stage is set when different people from the Houston area are killed.  The solving of the case is complicated.  Thatcher and Bethany are learning how each work a case along with sharing some of their past and present.  As time goes on, both FBI agents become targets of a killer they have yet to identify.  There is also a hint of a budding romance that goes against some FBI regulations.The other two novels in the series are Firewall and Double Cross.  Personally, I am always on the watch for a new novel by Diann Mills as her stories are captivating and tension building.  The characters crafted by the author are very realistic and it’s easy to visualize the actions in the book which brings readers like me coming back for more!One thing I like too is the chapters are short, which makes the action go faster so there is never a dull moment!  It reminds me of rollercoaster rises in that you have to be strapped in securely, but at least there is no motion sickness when I read!  I love the crime and law enforcement type of stories.  I commend those who place their lives on the line every moment so we can live safely.  I like trying to figure out who the mastermind is behind the scenes usually pulling the strings, but Diann is really good at keeping the answer at bay.Grab a book then settle in for an adventure!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GPHDA2OARS9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1414389957#wasThisHelpful","R1GPHDA2OARS9F","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kevin Wylie is an attorney with a live-in girlfriend who seems to be constantly pushing him to further his career.  He finds out his boss is crooked and is fired the same day.  The next day he receives a phone call from his father’s girlfriend that he is dying from cancer and having surgery the next day.  He hasn’t heard a word from his father in 28 years, so he is shocked to hear from someone about him now.  He decides to travel back to where he spent the first eight years of his life with his parents before their divorce to see his father and get some answers.  While there, Kevin is given a chance to work with his father, who is also a lawyer, taking on a case that could make Kevin’s own law business a success if that is what he decides to do.The other part of the story is about the investigation into the disappearance of a millionaire businessman who has recently made his home in the small Florida town of Gladestown.  He made a large chunk of his money by selling out the employees of one of his companies.  The company soon went bankrupt after he sold his large stock holdings, causing the company to close, everyone lost their jobs, their health insurance, their retirement savings and some even lost their lives.  So Roy Johnson is not a very well-liked man, has no real friends and lives a secluded life.  He goes for a walk one night near alligator-infested water and never returns.  His wife reports him missing and a few days later bits of his clothing and his wallet are found in the water.From the back cover of the book, I thought this sounded like an intriguing mystery.  The mystery itself is interesting, but there was so much profanity and unnecessary sexual situations I couldn’t really get into the story or connect with the characters.  The sex isn’t rampant throughout the story, but it is there.  The foul language is pretty much throughout the book.  For me, these two issues were too much to overcome when rating this book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W47IJ8HM6GP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455508632#wasThisHelpful","R1W47IJ8HM6GP4","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This tale will keep readers glued to the pages long after the sun sets!  The story is set during WWII before America entered the war, with a young man joining the RAF via Canada.  Roger has wanted nothing but to pilot a plane!  When he gets shot down in Germany, then captured, he begins to experience a nightmare.  For decades he has been locked up and alone, except for the occasional visitor bringing food and sometimes news.When Roger comes back to the U. S., he meets a woman named Katharine, who then becomes part of the drama that unfolds when people begin attempting to take Roger’s life.  In time, they grow close to each other, but it isn’t until one horrible moment when she realizes one of the men in her life is telling the truth and another is a liar.I found the plot very fascinating and intriguing.  There are faith, discerning between truth and lies, along with Roger being alone without human touch for decades.  The whole idea of the Nazis wanting to control pertinent areas of a nation because they think they know best is a stunning premise.  No matter what group of people, there are always others who think they know best and can tell some what to do better than anyone.The ending was creative, and I wonder if the author will be taking the storyline into a sequel.  I loved how Katharine had to face the ugly truth about her caretaker she had for years.  The inner turmoil Roger had while in captivity led him to examine faith and prayer issues.  This work of fiction shows how many changes can occur without us really knowing until we look backwards and see all that has happened.I hope you pick up the book and enjoy a great mystery with intrigue, romance and faith!  This is a very well-crafted story!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29G7AY9UFEDFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825443873#wasThisHelpful","R29G7AY9UFEDFM","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The story started a little slow for me as it was building the foundation, which I am sure builds into the next two sequels.  After a short time, the plot and climax took off as the women in this small B & B in Florida began having personal issues though not with each other per se.  One of the main characters is Beverly who was to have inherited the B & B from her aunt when an English man comes stating he has inherited the business that Beverly has built.Three young, Amish, single girlfriends come from Ohio for a two-week stay.  One of them is engaged to be married to her friend’s brother.  There are Sara, Mattie and Lorena who stay at the B & B to have time together before Lorena is married.  However, Lorena is having second thoughts about being engaged because of the lack of any type of feelings she has for her future husband.  The author adds to the mix a man Lorena begins to develop really deep affection and feelings for.It doesn’t take long to fall in love with the storyline and while not age specific they are perfectly suited for the YA group.  The budding romances, daring to leave the home nest, faith and truth are just some of the themes that come alive in the pages.  I look forward to reading the next book, The Proposal at Siesta Key followed by the third book, A Wedding at the Orange Blossom Inn.  I sure hope you will follow where all three lead characters Lorena, Sara and Mattie end their journeys.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QLZCIMLDO6G3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006233770X#wasThisHelpful","R1QLZCIMLDO6G3","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are introduced to characters in the first book titled, The Promise of Palm Grove along with a wonderful B & B.  The setting is sunny Florida in the small town of Pinecraft that is close to the ocean along with a wonderful, close knit, Amish community.  The Orange Blossom B & B is operated daily by Beverly.  Recently she hired a young lady named Penny Troyer to care for Michael Know while he recoups after surgery.Trouble begins to brew when Beverley’s unhealed heart is hurt when she thinks she views an improper moment between Michael and Rachael.  Now, after taking time to pray, she is confronted by the owner, Eric, as he learns about owning this business he inherited.  On top of this, Tricia comes to surprise her Aunt Beverly, running away from an embarrassing situation at home.There is romance blooming with a new set of young people in the community and there really isn’t much reference to the characters readers met in book one.  I was a little disappointed by that as I came to enjoy them in the first story.  There is a third book that I will be reading titled, A Wedding at the Orange Blossom Inn by the same author.  Perhaps the characters not written into the second book will show up more in book three.  Either way I know I laughed a lot while reading this tale because of the way one guest of the inn was expressing how she viewed Florida.Please consider reading the books written by Shelley Shepard Gray as they are highly entertaining, faith filled and have moments of climax with tension that make for an enjoyable afternoon of getting lost in the fictional town of Pinecraft!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WLNF17YS36LR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062337726#wasThisHelpful","R2WLNF17YS36LR","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story begins during the Revolutionary War.  Seamus Ogilvy is a general under George Washington’s command.  He gives eight years of his life to the war, and when he returns home, he find he must take his young daughter, Lily Cate, from unwilling relatives in the middle of the night to bring her home.  During the war, his wife dies and is buried in Williamsburg not their home of Tall Acre.  His wife was unhappy with him being gone so long and with country life so had moved to Williamsburg to live with her sister.  Upon the war’s end, Seamus is faced with a mountain of work at Tall Acre that in eight years of absence has accumulated.  He is also facing a potential custody battle from his wife’s sister who wants his daughter for her own.  If he were to marry, which he has absolutely no desire to do, he could show that his daughter would grow up with a mother and deflect the lawsuit.Sophie Menzies is a staunch American Patriot despite her Scottish roots and the Tory beliefs of her father, who abandoned her and her mother and brother.  Sophie is now living alone at the family home next door to Tall Acre.  She and her two remaining old servants are barely eating a meal a day.  No one will hire Sophie as they attribute her father’s Tory stance to her, even though she proudly proclaims her American beliefs.  She meets Lily Cate one day while foraging for nuts to eat.  They form a fast friendship and soon Sophie loves Lily Cate like a daughter.  Sophie soon discovers her home has been given to an American as a spoil of war since it belonged to her Tory father.  With no home, no job and no food, Sophie prays for a solution to her problems.There is just something about this author’s writing that draws me in from page one, gets my mind and heart engaged to keep me reading steadfastly until the wonderful ending of the story.  Every book I’ve read by Laura Frantz is one I would recommend.  The romance between Seamus and Sophie is so engaging!  The faith of Sophie in this story is amazing.  Her faith reignites the lagging faith of Seamus, spurring him on to trust God beyond what was thought to be endurable.  The writing is great, and I was sorry the story ended.  There is also a wonderful plot twist that I didn’t see coming that just made the story so much more satisfying at its end!  I hope to have some time to read some of Laura’s other books I’ve not had a chance to read before.  Please don’t miss this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FUYCJBZVHA9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080072044X#wasThisHelpful","R1FUYCJBZVHA9Q","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I even knew the book existed, I saw a clip of the movie Captive.  When I finished reading the book, I felt a few emotions deeply in my heart.  The first is that God is a redeemer, and while some people were killed by the assailant, there is hope that more will come to know Him.  The second is that our world today shows us the devastating results when a person or persons take a life of a loved one.  The third is that we all need to be prayer warriors for those who serve and are the front lines of defense so others can live peacefully.  Finally, my personal heartfelt thanks for the honesty with which this novel was written and the hope that families and friends of the four victims allow God to redeem their lives.One impacting aspect of the book is that after many years of failing treatment centers and family members trying to help her, Ashley discovered through this experience that many of the truths she was taught became real.  Ashley will be the first one to tell readers she is taking it one day at a time and listening to what pleases God and doing it.  We all should be such servants of Christ.Inspiring just doesn’t really cover what you’ll read or see in the movie, but it’s a start.  I hope readers take time to thank those who serve, pray for those who are hurting and in bondage as well as be thankful for their life.  I wouldn’t be surprised if some people found themselves asking God what He has for them to do, or where He wants them to serve.  God just waits to be asked and believe me He’ll answer the seeker.Last of all remember to pray for the family and friends of those who commit crimes for they too are victims just in a different way.  They hurt, suffer, and go through all types of emotions just like those who were victimized by what someone did to their loved one.  Remember, above all, Jesus wants us to literally minister to those in prison.  While all may not be open to the gospel, our job is to obey Him and share the gospel, letting the individual be responsible for the result.  Our society needs us to reach out with the hope what no one or anything else can bring or give them.  Perhaps you might consider giving this book, a Bible or The Purpose Driven Life to a person(s) who you know or to a total stranger.Like this story reminds us God does indeed redeem and has never stopped seeking the lost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DTAIY4G5H2PX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062439200#wasThisHelpful","R3DTAIY4G5H2PX","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The cover surely doesn’t capture the really wonderful tale written inside.  I hope the sequel coming out in 2016 has a better cover that conveys the story more accurately.  Inside is a story that includes themes like overcoming fear, trusting, relying on the Lord and romance to name a few.  The main characters are a woman and her very young son who change their names and looks in order to stay safe and alive.  When her car breaks down, she walks into a small town looking for a job.  While she is eating, she decides to go to the restroom and while in the restroom her bag is stolen.  Now she has neither money nor any belongings, but she’s alive.  She is not sure how safe she is after witnessing a murder.If I tell you her name that would give away a little of the book so I will wait for you readers to discover who she is when you open the book.  The other characters are a family named Callahan who have endured heartache and are running a couple of businesses, with one being a Christmas tree company started by the father, who the family lost a year ago.  Three brothers, who are all bachelors, have an aunt coming home from the hospital in a few days and needing a caretaker.  While she may have a rough side to her, she sure is a pistol making me laugh at times when reading.Through various happenings the woman and her young son come to the Christmas tree place looking for a job exactly when the bachelors need someone to look after their spitfire of an aunt.  There is palpable tension I felt when reading the book as it becomes apparent that someone is out to eliminate the woman and her son as they can identify the men who committed murder.  The focus is on Beau, who is the oldest of the three brothers and who runs the tree farm.  Zac owns and runs a restaurant followed by Riley who is looking to mature outside the “little brother” box.

"Jared Donnelly has returned to his home town after being away for fifteen years, riding the motocross circuit after some troubled and tough teenage years.  He has an idea for helping troubled youths as well as helping the local economy, but will his idea get shot down by the town council?  Upon his return, he runs into an old crush of his from high school, Becca Norton.  Once he spends some time with her, he realizes he still has feelings for her.Becca Norton is a high school teacher and divorced mother of two children.  Her finances are not in the best shape so she is forced to work at the church day care over the summer to earn extra money.  The pastor’s wayward brother has returned home with plans to build a motocross school with a racetrack practically in Becca’s backyard.  Becca secretly had a crush on Jared in high school, but never told anyone.  Now, as she sees him so mature and wanting to give back to the community as well as follow God’s plan for his life, she wants to have a relationship with him.  As the newest member of the town council, will she vote against Jared’s plans to placate her ex-in-laws who are threatening her with a child custody battle?  Becca struggles with her decision, but relies on God to provide the answer.These Love Inspired books are great for when readers have a little time, but not a lot.  They are short, usually around 200 pages, and easy to read.  The lessons evident in this particular story are forgiveness, taking our problems to the Lord first and not as a last resort and doing what is right in His sight to name a few.  I have several more of these enjoyable reads that I look forward to sharing with you soon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF4J7LZAW1TAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373818378#wasThisHelpful","RF4J7LZAW1TAY","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Milly Mathews is a young woman who wants to get married, but has very few options in her hometown so she creates a group of other like-minded women.  They decide to place an ad in the newspaper, inviting men who are interested in marriage to begin corresponding with the group.  The ad meets with immediate success as the first man arrives in town without even answering the ad!  The man in question is Nicholas Brookfield and his curiosity is piqued by the ad.  He wants to meet the woman in charge of placing the ad.  He meets Milly, but before they can get beyond a brief introduction Milly is called out to her ranch due to an Indian attack.Upon arriving home where Milly lives with her sister Sarah, they discover the barn has been burned down, their livestock stolen and their only experienced ranch hand injured.  The two women are at a loss as to what to do, but are determined not to sell out to their sneaky neighbor.  Nick volunteers to stay and help out until the foreman gets back on his feet.  A family of freed slaves agrees to work for Milly in exchange for room and board, but some in the town then begin to treat Milly differently.  Milly and Nick begin to develop a relationship, but will Nick’s past come back to haunt him?  Will the town accept these freed slaves or will Milly send them away?One thing I consistently find enjoyable and satisfying about these stories is that faith is always in the forefront.  While this story wasn’t my favorite, it does have a good plot and two likeable main characters.  They pray in the good times and the bad for God’s guidance and protection.  The plot just wasn’t to my liking.  I will be reading more of these little books as they are a nice way to spend an afternoon and they bring faith to the focus.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLIGQ9175PBBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373828470#wasThisHelpful","RLIGQ9175PBBP","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The time period for this story is 1910 and the place is Monaco to begin with and then moves to England.  There is a lengthy cast of characters to follow, but the author provides a helpful list.  The story takes place among the aristocracy of British society.Justin Wildon, Lord Harlow is a young, handsome man in his mid-twenties with a future title of duke awaiting him.  He is best friends with Brook Eden and has been since she was five years old and he was twelve.  He has taught her how to shoot a gun, ride astride instead of sidesaddle, and many other activities most upper class English people would consider unladylike.  He has spent much of his time in Monaco as that is where his father has lived since leaving England years ago.  He has just returned from a trip home to England where he discovered Brook’s true identity.  As a baby she was found as a survivor of a carriage accident and taken by an actress to live in Monaco.  The woman who she thought was her real mother has died recently and Brook has discovered that her supposed mother wasn’t her biological mother.  She finds a letter that gives a clue as to the possible identity of her family and Justin agrees to investigate for her.  What follows is a story of secrets, intrigue, deception, love and faith.I thought the first 75 pages or so were slow going, but after that the story picked up with more intrigue.  So stick with it as the rest of the book will make the book definitely worth reading.  There were also a lot of characters to try to keep track of who was related to whom.  I really liked the Christian faith element lived out by Brook and Justin.  I also liked the tone of their relationship to one another with one true to life aspect is their lack of or difficulty in communicating with each other.  This is a good, clean and easy book to read.  I look forward to the rest of the series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV0AFHACZGAXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764213504#wasThisHelpful","RV0AFHACZGAXT","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is a teacher who brings to the forefront a historical and a deeper understanding of the Bible; however, there is more.  Ray reminds us of how the ancient people were living and what God is calling us to become for the world.  When I searched for more of the DVDs, I was glad to know there are many more along with Ray Vander Laan ministries.When I viewed the first lesson, I was simply amazed at being taken back to the land and listening to the expounding of the Bible.  For me, it made it come alive and with deeper understanding.  Like any person we tend to approach the Bible from an American point of view, but when we do, we miss the real heart of God.  There is more than one lesson on the DVD and the Discovery Guide helps viewers understand more and makes this a very useful tool for any small group.I wonder how I ever missed the ministry of Ray Vander Laan along with his teaching and way he shares from the land of the Bible.  Go with me to understand Scripture in more depth than before and see the heart of God for people.  The lessons are challenging and enjoyable.  There are questions and helpful insights with each lesson.  Any person who is willing to open their heart to the Lord cannot help but be touched.  Please consider joining me and many others in viewing the DVD and going through the discovery book that can be purchased separately.  Don’t pass up these excellent lessons for personal growth or to use with others in a group setting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NXGPKT826CV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310811996#wasThisHelpful","R1NXGPKT826CV7","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maggie Cartwright is 26 years old and has just answered an ad for a mail-order bride.  Her husband-to-be is the number one suspect in a train robbery that happened two years ago.  The Pinkerton Agency never gives up on a case and has been working this case for two years.  Now, with Maggie on the scene, they hope to finally wrap this one up.  Maggie has created a fictional past in her letters to Garrett Thomas during their previous months of correspondence.  She has arrived in the Arizona Territory under the pretense of marrying Garrett, but what she is really been assigned to do is learn where he has hidden the money from the train robbery and who is partner in crime is.She moves in with the family, searches the house and begins taking care of Garrett’s two young children.  As time progresses, she finds no evidence of the money anywhere and begins to care for the children and Garrett.  She tells herself to stay on task, to not get emotionally involved and finish her assignment, but the wedding date looms closer and closer.  She finally stumbles onto a clue, but will it be enough to prove who the criminal is to solve the case?After reading the first book in the series and finding it just so-so, I wanted to give the series a second chance before writing it off.  I’m glad I did.  I enjoyed this second book in the series much more.  I thought the story flowed well with a good plot, the characters were likeable and the faith of Maggie very evident.  I loved the character of Aunt Hetty!  The mystery portion of the story was not much of a challenge, but the journey to discover the answers was entertaining.  I’m now looking forward to book three in the series to see what interesting situation the next Pinkerton lady detective finds herself in and how she will solve the case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RHLEAQJ3M1MK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1628366273#wasThisHelpful","R1RHLEAQJ3M1MK","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series begins with a novel titled, Welcome to Last Chance, followed by One More Last Chance, then continues with At Home in Last Chance.  In each novel, there are down home characters who find what their heart is searching for through interaction with eclectic town’s people.  Each novel focuses on a main person who is usually new to the town and learning how vastly different a small town is compared to bigger towns or city life.  Some aspects of small town living are endearing and others can seem somewhat frustrating to the newbie’s in town.Here we meet a man named Andy who came back home to coach the local high school football team he played on years ago.  Readers are also introduced to a new doctor, Dr. Jess, who will be practicing in Last Chance.  She is a very driven woman who has no clue what some home town quirks are nor does she know what to make of Andy when she first meets him.  Andy and Jess come from two totally different home life backgrounds and that brings sparks along with misunderstandings to the budding friendship.I have read each of the novels in this series, thoroughly getting lost in the pages until the very end of the book.  The characters seem down home and at times like a reflection of real life and real people who deal with some real heart issues.  However, these players also want to rejoice in God, enjoy dinner together at a restaurant or a table and even when reunions occur during homecoming week they share fun and laughter.I sure hope there are more stories to come in this series.  I plan on collecting the series and keeping them in my home library to read again in the near future or share with a friend.  It’s very enjoyable to sit down and read a book knowing the author has done a masterful job of creating an imaginary world where readers can lose themselves in for a short time.  There are also many references to faith and what living our faith before others might look like whether the times are good or bad.  So join me in reading A Place to Call Home series; you’ll simply love the books!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R51YIARRTVNCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XNJGN4M#wasThisHelpful","R51YIARRTVNCC","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read the title and author, I was drawn back in my mind to the day I married my husband in a church.  It was the very church where Tozer preached to people.  There are other writings of Tozer that are also rich in teaching and if possible read about Tozer’s life.  Tozer was a man who sought hard after God and in this book he challenges all to live a life fully and completely for God.Some of the chapter themes were convicting as I read and realized God was speaking to my heart about where He is working.  Other times I was challenged in my thoughts or comforted emotionally.  There is always room for the believer to grow in becoming more Christ like and this book is one where words of exhortation are delivered without apology.  Prayers are given to aid the person in asking for the Lord’s help, hand or voice.Nothing replaces the Bible; however, there are authors who have written what God has laid on their heart to share with others in the hopes of drawing them near to Him.  Tozer is one such author.  The book was originally published in 1948 and some of the problems that we see in the Body needing to be addressed are addressed by the author.  Draw near to the heart of the author as he points the reader to the heart and mind of our God!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL5D2QO35BBIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1622452968#wasThisHelpful","RL5D2QO35BBIX","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cathy Gohlke wrote an exceptional tension-filled novel with mystery, intrigue, courage and so very much more.  Cathy’s other novel I have read is Saving Amelie, which is another riveting tale set in the WWII historical timeframe.  In her newest endeavor, the author crafts a heart-ripping redemptive story as one woman in America longs to learn her true ancestry after her mother’s passing.Hannah is invited to Berlin to visit a grandfather she has never met or known about and learning about his past just about breaks her heart.  Yet, in the end, we learn a bigger story that has happened and who is the true Savior of mankind.  I so enjoyed hearing about Cathy’s travels and her experiences when she was researching this tale, including in her trips with various family members.Some stories reach out and keep your attention because of characters and the action described in the pages.  With Secrets She Kept, the attention of the reader doesn’t falter as the author uses flashbacks and returning to the current time to convey the tale from a couple different characters’ point of view.  The best use of this method helped me enjoy understanding how each point of view could add a different dimension to the story being shared.We must never forget WWII or any other wars or tragedy because they are part of our nation’s history and we can glean many lessons from what was experienced.  What Cathy shares is fiction and well-crafted, but also easy to imagine events happening for real as set up in the book.  I hope you will read, enjoy and savor the flavor of the novel long after you finish it and then perhaps share it with another person.  Here is a book for every personal library for people to read for years to come!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BDSJ09XJVG8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1496400801#wasThisHelpful","R2BDSJ09XJVG8U","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ava Carson has married the man of her dreams, but he has turned into the man of her nightmares.  They have been married for about three years and have one child together.  She has adopted Mitchell’s 8-year-old son from his previous marriage that ended with his first wife’s death approximately five years ago.  As the relationship has progressed, Mitchell has become more and more controlling.  Ava has been making excuses for him because his job is stressful or he is just a perfectionist.  She now is beginning to realize how controlling and manipulative he is.  If he can’t control her, then he will not be in a relationship with her.  As a child custody battle ensues, Ava never dreams how far Mitchell will go to get his way.  With the children’s lives at stake, Ava will do anything necessary to protect them.Negatives:  First off, this is not a Christian book even though it is marketed by a Christian publisher and aimed toward a Christian reading market.  There is a lot of swearing in the book.  There is also a brief appearance of a gay couple.  There is a flashback scene from the honeymoon that is far more detailed than one would expect in a Christian book.  None of the characters have a relationship with God, who is never mentioned.  The 8-year-old boy in the story is too mature for the most part and seemed more like a 12- or 13-year-old a lot of the time.  This book could have been picked up in any secular location as there is nothing Christian or faith-focused about it.  I am disappointed in the publishing company.Positives:  This is a talented author, who has written a good psychological thriller that could have been great without the negatives mentioned above.  I really liked her writing style.  There is a tension-filled and climactic ending, and the story as a whole will keep readers on pace with quick turning of the pages.  I also liked the changing points of view from Ava to Jack to Mitchell, etc…  I thought that worked very well in the story.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQECA0RFVGOVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718030907#wasThisHelpful","RQECA0RFVGOVE","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story is set in West Virginia in the year 1975 on the eve of 1976 when a family is devastated by the sudden death of Henry Phillips’ father.  Now Henry, his sister Sadie and his mother Perla have to learn how to live without the man they loved.  Sadie is a librarian in Ohio where she returns to after the funeral.  Perla is trying to get Henry to return to college to finish his degree though Henry wants nothing to do with school.Margaret and her younger sister Mayfair help Henry’s grandmother on the farm and with the house work.  However, Mayfair has a special gift that she shares with whoever is in need.  She is also a diabetic who suffers from hypoglycemia after she aids a person.  There are many more heart-touching characters and scenes the author crafts together to draw readers to a story that shows the love of God and family.  In the tale, there is also redemption along with prayer and sharing of one’s heart with others.I enjoyed the relationships that reflected genuine love and care with various characters in the small town.  Some were family loving wayward family members and other relationships were friendships of a sort.  This was an era that saw the demise of moonshine and the beginning of drugs being transported and sold throughout the country.  Henry is the main male character who, after losing his father, is really lost and therefore makes some bad choices that put his life and future on a dangerous path.Mayfair is a quiet character in the story yet she is the most in tune with how others are either in need of healing physically or emotionally.  Mayfair shares that people have to want to be better or to change because she cannot make that choice for them.  I love Sarah’s novels because the characters reflect both the positive and the shortfall of humanity.  Above all, they show how God longs to reach us with His love and care and how we sometimes struggle to understand the reality of His being.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ2CWN37TNTG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764212265#wasThisHelpful","RQ2CWN37TNTG2","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Betting on Hope is the first book in the series where we are introduced to the Monahan family and their ranch.  Since Maggie’s column brought Wishing Springs into focus by mentioning how there are several single cowboys, Abby decides her life needs to change as Maggie’s column suggests.  Now in Wishing Springs, Abby is starting to fall asleep behind the wheel when she slams on the brakes in order to avoid hitting a bull.  She then swerves to avoid hitting the cowboy standing off to the side.  Well that cowboy’s name is Bo and after Maggie ends up in a ditch, he runs over along with one of his brothers to see if she is hurt.  From there, the tension between the cowboy and Abby begins to climb!  Bo’s and Abby’s pasts collide on the ranch as well as their feelings for each other and then to complicate things a baby is just dropped off in Pop’s front yard.  Bo loves making special stirrups, being a volunteer fireman, and more.  Abby is a woman seeking to understand who she is after suffering a terrible tragedy two years prior.What I liked most about the book was the characters had lifelike issues to face, to struggle with and choices to make for the path they were going to travel.  The characters are examples of what human nature looks like as well as how faith can play an important part of life.  The author crafts these characters as if they are so real that readers can identify with their triumphs or failures.  Monahan’s ranch is being pulled out of debt by the hardworking adult sons while they care for their grandfather who has Alzheimer’s.  Through each son’s special gift they are able to keep the ranch making money to pay off the gambling debts their father had by using the ranch as collateral.Betting on Hope is Tru’s story and this sequel is about Bo.

"Jesus loved to tell stories to people and people loved to listen to them until some people turned away because what He offered they didn’t accept.  Now, centuries earlier, God did an amazing work when He took the Jewish people from captivity to a land they were to conquer and thrive in.  If you have ever read about the Exodus or seen the many versions of movies based on this historical event, then you are familiar with that story.Sonya Contreras utilizes storytelling, an historical event and a Biblical account to give us a novel that takes the reader back in time to the ancient world.  What made this novel different for me was the heart of the author and the unique approach to what we read in Exodus 1-15.  The novel doesn’t cover everything in the passage as it’s the first book in the series with a second book in the works titled, I Have Called You By Name.The one aspect of the novel that I most appreciated was pointing out that the plagues were to show the false gods versus The One True God.  It was an epic battle for the hearts and souls of those God would call His own against the false gods who weren’t gods at all.  The story shows how through the plagues various characters either realized they were worshipping a false god or some would choose to fight against the God of the Hebrew people.What I also enjoyed was how the author showed how some of the Hebrew people were struggling with following The One True God.  Throughout the book I was enthralled with the drama between Moses and Pharaoh, and eventually how Pharaoh was eventually revealed to the people as nothing but a mortal man, belying their belief in his deity.When you read the list of sources the author used, you get a glimpse into her heart to see a woman who believes wholeheartedly in God and via stories tells the world about Him.  The novel will help readers in understanding how each plague was directly correlated with a specific god or gods that was believed to have power and how God totally and unequivocally shredded these false deities.  I appreciate the author’s work, research and her heart to tell the world a story that captures the heart and engages the mind!  I look forward to her second book whenever it’s released and I plan to read it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VWTBT4W5Q8VL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990723704#wasThisHelpful","R1VWTBT4W5Q8VL","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really was not quite sure how to explain my fascination with the story told by Amanda Tru.  There are many aspects to the novel such as time travel, a mystery, romance and the constant change of direction in the novel.  As I continued to read, I could tell the intensity of the tale was slowly escalating as well as some of the secret characteristics in a couple of the characters I sensed more than read in any description.I sensed there was a bigger story behind what I read; I am not sure if it was due to the intervention by a male character, who is a doctor befriending Hannah because she experiences time travel or if he really loved Hannah.  The antagonist in the story is easy to notice, but what devious evil plan might she have towards Hannah?  Hannah is the only character who travels in time and some of her actions later on begin to bother her greatly.The story is for older young people with some of the “kissing” scenes I came across, nothing x-rated but teens are already hormonal and need to read stories that help encourage them to not rush a relationship.  There are six books in all in the series, and I am quite curious to see where it all ends.  Terrific story telling is involved and quite captivating all the way through; I couldn’t put it down until the very last page.  Now I want to grab book two to see how this all progresses and if there is, in fact, a mystery involved or a different crafty ending!  This is a very intriguing tale with eclectic characters and an ending that is still veiled.  I hope you enjoy the series as much as I believe I will, especially when I read the final installment and all the hints come together to form a complete picture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROL1M3V5I7HSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939603676#wasThisHelpful","ROL1M3V5I7HSF","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a thriller!  I have read other works of Dan Walsh and enjoyed them too.  When I saw the cover of When Night Comes, I must say I was highly intrigued!  Then when I began reading, wow!  The story can be called mystery, thriller, suspense and high octane tension and all of that would be true!  Set in a small town, an upscale private college a student turns up dead, but one look at the victim and it is easy to see something weird is going on!The further I read the book the deeper the mystery became along with a higher body count.  The test subjects, though they didn’t know they were being sued, had dreams that were very lifelike.  In fact, they could recall everything they experienced no matter how horrifying, scary or weird it felt.  The only person who could attest to the drugs effect was a well-known author who was on campus to give some lectures on history as well as finish his latest novel.  What he got was more than he bargained for with a possible romance so different from his last experience.When Night Comes kept my eyes glued to the pages as action ramped up and the wonder of how the mystery would be solved was drawing closer.  Part of the cast of characters was former agency man and a doctor who not only forgot his Hippocratic Oath but only saw the end result in dollar signs; no one else mattered.The hardest part about finishing a great story like this is just that, the end.  I have no idea what Dan Walsh plans next or is working on currently, but I hope he brings on more suspense type tales that engage the reader as thoroughly as this one did.  The interesting part was when Jack, who was the lecturer/author, would dream it was always in the WWII era.  History has a way of coming alive for those of us who weren’t around when it happened and reading it in a novel is a little more exciting than simply a textbook.  So please don’t pass up this wonderful work of fiction!  It captivates without scaring the audience.  I don’t want to be scared; I want to be drawn in to the tale and then share what I think with other readers.  If you know of someone who likes mysteries, history or even suspense books, here is one to give as a gift because they won’t be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2313O6SSRAJLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=069231816X#wasThisHelpful","R2313O6SSRAJLL","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not by Sight is an exceptional piece of historical writing set during WWI in England with characters that are mesmerizing.  We are introduced to a young woman whose brother is in France fighting.  She despises those who are still at home enjoying life and wealth; her name is Grace Mabry.  Grace’s father owns a tea shop in London, but her mother has died.  Grace believes the only way to get others in the fight is to shame them by giving them a white feather.  Now, if you’re not aware of what the white feather stands for, it stands for cowardice.  This I learned by watching a 1939 movie called, The Four Feathers, which was remade in 2002.Grace attends a masquerade ball with her maid.  She is uninvited, but she will do what she believes will get the war over sooner and her brother home faster.  The man she sees and slips the feather to is a man named Jack and what occurs after that moment will keep people turning pages until the very end of the novel!  I couldn’t put the book aside for long as the storyline captivated my attention and heart as well as an intense desire to see how the character interactions would play out.Kate Breslin also wrote For Such a Time, which is another work of historical fiction that reaches out from the pages and captures the heart of anyone who reads the tale.  Inside Not By Sight is a tale of mystery, intrigue, courage, love, and more during a time when life was dangerous and sometimes short.  There is a group known as WFC (Women’s Forage Corps) where women come together to perform various tasks to send aid to those overseas or those living at home.  Grace is a part of a group sent by her father after her actions at the masquerade ball.  It was really intriguing to read how these various women worked together and how their group is singled out and investigated because a spy is believed to be in their midst.Not By Sight is a rich and rewarding masterpiece that I can highly recommend!  Don’t forget to read her first novel, For Such a Time, which is also captivating.  I highly anticipate whatever may come next from the pen of Kate Breslin!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SWNMYSUHSXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764211617#wasThisHelpful","R2SWNMYSUHSXV","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Read any newspaper, listen or watch TV and it doesn’t take anyone too long to realize that our society has gone through a major decline.  People are hopeless.  Some are applauding actions or remarks that not too distant in the past would not have found an audience.  Babylon in our society seems to be growing by leaps and bounds.  Read the Old Testament passages referring to Babylon to help you understand the reference to life today in America.I have noticed an increase in books referring to Babylon and some of them are quite good; others are not.  Larry Osborne has written a book with a subtitle, “Why Hope, Humility, and Wisdom Matter in a Godless Culture.”  He is referring to characteristics of a man from ancient times, a young Jewish man who was exiled to Babylon centuries ago.  While Daniel underwent intense training in many subjects, the main lesson Daniel reminds us of is that no matter what happens we can stay true to the One God we love and adore.The book has sections titled, “Daniel’s Story”, “Prepared for battle” and “Hope: Where Courage is Birthed” to name a few.  There are actions we can take that will influence our culture and bring glory to God even if we never know the end result of what He tells us to do.  The author shows readers what Daniel did with his life in his situation and then shares with us what we can do today in our society.You might find ideas that are challenging and that would be okay.  You may find areas in the book with which you and that is okay too.  Go to your Bible and read Daniel chapters 1-6 so you can refresh your heart and mind with God’s truth and discern what you’re reading in Thriving in Babylon.  One of the main ideas really is He hasn’t called us to run scared or silent.  He has given us Daniel as an example of what we can do or how we can live today that will impact hearts for Christ.A friend and I have been studying Daniel for a while, long before some of these books were published.  It is no accident that authors are trying to encourage and exhort us not to hide, be silent or forget Who we serve!  We are our society’s Daniels of today.  We need to seek Him for the courage, wisdom and strength to face the furnace or lion’s den that seeks to devour our faith!  Remember as you read Daniel he didn’t know the outcome of his actions before he obeyed God.  Daniel lived a life of faith that influenced leaders of large kingdoms, and we can most certainly live a life of faith in which others will be influenced or challenged to come away from the lifelessness of Babylon to Christ, our living Hope!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZY60LH27G33T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1434704211#wasThisHelpful","RZY60LH27G33T","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Irene Hannon’s latest novel, Hope Harbor really captured my heart from the word go!  The male lead character is Michael and he has come to Hope Harbor to hopefully gain some peace in his troubled heart and soul.  At his first stop, he runs into problems with his motel reservation and then he knocks a young lady off her bike by accident as he is crossing the street.  He faces the young lady named Tracy, apologizing and thinking this is the end of their meeting, but alas it isn’t so!As I discovered reading the tale of forgiveness, redemption, hope and new beginnings, my heart was captured by both the tough times some of the characters had gone through.  One of the characters named Charley runs a little food business right by the beach, selling fish tacos.  While they don’t sound pleasant to me because I don’t like fish, this Charley is a real friendly small town guy.Tracy is part owner of a cranberry farm as well as a CPA.  Her past has left scars on her heart that cause her to run anytime someone draws near.  As readers continue to delve further into the book, so many interesting interactions take place between the hometown residents.  One of the funnier ones is the friendship between a priest and protestant pastor, especially when they go golfing.Hope is the main theme of the story, but it is also born out of risking rejection when seeking to make amends with a person from one’s past.  I think if some of the characters didn’t risk, their hope couldn’t have been restored.  One other point I got from the book is that our God is a God of second chances, and the wisdom to know how to proceed when an opportunity presents itself for another chance in a relationship was touching.I learned something about sea gulls too, but I will leave that for you to discover when you read this work of fiction!  I look forward to Irene’s second book in Men of Valor series coming Spring of 2016 as well as book two in the Hope Harbor series due to be released in summer of 2016.  I already have a couple of novels on my 2016 watch list!  Yeah!  Enjoy the story!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWKFE2RIHR6TF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800724526#wasThisHelpful","RWKFE2RIHR6TF","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone who is familiar with the Bible will enjoy reading a novelization of the man Paul and his life.  Those who haven’t read the Bible may find this novel of vast interest and willing to be open to the Gospel that is clearly shared multiple times in the book.  What I really enjoyed was how it made Paul seem that he was a man to whom God spoke and through whom He gave us portions of the written Word we have in the New Testament today.It was curious to consider what pain, suffering, longings, joys and trails he lived through and with while traveling all across the land.  The variety of people he spoke to who both accepted his message and those who wanted nothing to do with the offer of salvation, especially through Paul’s speaking.  In the novel, it reminded me of how human Paul was and to not place him upon a pedestal, but to worship God alone.The book begins and continues to draw readers in by making the reality of the message of God through Paul very believable.  Spread throughout the novel is Scripture and it is shown to be as natural as any other story to be shared with anyone we may come across.Jerry Jenkins brings the ancient world to life and people to us fresh from the past to examine and consider the work God has done in and through their lives.  To think of how God spoke to Paul and trained him for the work He was calling him to, taking the Gospel to the Gentiles.  The cost to Paul we tend to forget, and this tale gives us pause to consider that anyone who takes up his cross and follows the Lord will pay a cost throughout their lives.Empire’s End is a great read and frankly if you know of someone unwilling to read the Bible, this novel is a great way to evangelize them.  So grab a copy for your own personal library and maybe one or two to prayerfully give to those whom the Lord lays on your heart.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R366DZ1YWEIOOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617950076#wasThisHelpful","R366DZ1YWEIOOL","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Inspector John Jago is in his forties and has been in his current occupation for a little more than twenty years.  He has a new partner that he is training, young Peter Cradock.  The year is 1940 and the war with Germany has accelerated.  The beginning of the bombing campaign enacted on London takes place in this story.  During one of the bombing raids, the inspector and his protégé are called to the scene of a murder.  They find identification on the body, but while waiting for the police surgeon to arrive at the scene, another bomb is launched landing directly on the crime scene, obliterating any evidence including the dead body!As the inspector and his partner investigate the crime, asking questions of those who knew the victim, they uncover other criminal activities.  The road to justice for the victim is full of twists and turns and plenty of deception.  Another murder is committed by one of their prime suspects in the first murder, so they must rethink their line of inquiry.  Of course, there is much more going on than meets the eye with many more questions than answers.  Inspector Jago has much experience and advice to impart to detective Cradock, who views things a bit more simply the Jago.  Is Cradock nave or is Jago just too cynical?  However, the two work well together, complementing each other while investigating crime.I so enjoyed this new entry into the world of British mysteries!  The writing was detailed and the plot interesting.  I enjoyed the setting of London at the beginning of WWII.  The main character of Inspector Jago is haunted by his past experience of fighting in WWI.  His memories don’t hinder his work, but they are ever present in his mind as he experiences the blitz of German bomber planes shelling London repeatedly.  His belief or unbelief in God is briefly discussed in this story and maybe this theme will be developed more in future writings.  I’m a fan of British mysteries and this is one I definitely recommend.  I can’t wait for the next book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DLXB0PHN9DYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782641270#wasThisHelpful","R2DLXB0PHN9DYL","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Special Ops leader Eric Moyer and his team are en route to their respective homes aboard an airplane when they receive a call mid-air from their commander.  They soon are informed they are being re-routed and sent on another mission.  This particular mission is extremely dangerous and there will be no help available once the team is in country.  They are tasked with retrieving a fallen satellite with very sensitive information with a secondary mission of rescuing a captured Special Ops team if possible.While on mission, Sergeant Major Eric Moyer receives terrible news from home that could potentially compromise him during this urgent mission.  While having to deal with the situation at home emotionally, he also must keep his head on straight to keep his team safe while fighting off special ops teams from China and an armed Russian group who are also after the satellite.This book was fantastic!  The story was relevant to what is happening today and the characters were well-defined and three dimensional, that is easy to relate to and feel emotion toward.  The story was exciting, full of action and suspense.  I couldn’t put the book down; it was that good!  I just loved the camaraderie and teasing amongst the Special Ops team members.  I had some laugh out loud moments.  I also appreciated the very real aspect of being captured by an enemy and what may follow.  That really brought home to me the risk these brave men and women take when accepting a mission.  I am not very familiar with the military, but this gave me a new appreciation for those men and women in the armed services who put their lives on the line every day, willing to die if necessary to protect me.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all who serve our great nation!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TS3WOKCGW8P5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433671409#wasThisHelpful","R3TS3WOKCGW8P5","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Silas Jonesy is a farmer who arrives at his estranged wife’s request to give her aid when he discovers she has died.  She left him ten years ago and he hadn’t heard from her at all until her letter of a few weeks prior.  She also left him with a son, Anthony, he knew nothing about.  However, there is another man in the picture who seems to think Anthony is his son.  Before the question of paternity can be resolved, Anthony runs away.  He seems particularly close to his teacher, Kate Dawson.  Kate and Silas search endlessly for Anthony and appear to draw close over the weeks of searching for him.  Silas wants a future with Kate, but will he be enough for her?  Everyone he has known has never wanted him for any length of time and left him all alone.  Will Kate run from him too?Kate Dawson works as a teacher in Breton, Missouri.  She has been supporting Anthony and his mother on her meager teacher’s pay.  Anthony’s mother Lucinda has given her consent for Kate to keep Anthony as her son once Lucinda dies, which will be soon as she has consumption.  With Lucinda’s death, Kate expects to take care of Anthony whom she has come to love like a son, but she doesn’t expect two men to show up with each claiming to be Anthony’s father.  She thinks about stealing away with Anthony to live somewhere else where no one knows them.  After all, running is her specialty.What a sweet historical romance!  The audience will read of the two main characters’ struggles with their pasts as well as the consequences of their past actions.  Then, the story shows how to the Silas and Kate put their trust in God, no matter how bleak the circumstances.  Both main characters were a delight to meet and get to know better.  Silas with his daily struggle against alcohol and abandonment and Kate with her propensity to run away and hide when things get tough show issues many can relate to.  But they both turned to God and surrendered their fears to Him.  God can and will do what is best for those who place their trust in Him!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OV2JZQN1L7TP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764211706#wasThisHelpful","R2OV2JZQN1L7TP","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Salvatore Russo or Sal or Falcon as he is known to his brothers in arms on the Special Forces Team stationed in Afghanistan is angry at the world it would seem.  However, his anger is really directed at one person, Cassie Walker.  Underneath the anger though are shame, guilt and anger at himself.  He chooses to deal with his feelings in an unhealthy way, one that could get him discharged if discovered.  He has always been intense and any mission failures seen as person failures.  He is driven and completely loyal to his team.  Now that Cassie is on the scene he seems more distracted.  With a mole leaking sensitive information to an enemy, Daniel Jin, and further attempts on the lives of fellow soldiers, Falcon needs his focus more than ever.  But Cassie reveals something she has kept from him for four years and Falcon isn’t sure how he is supposed to deal with this new revelation.Cassie Walker took this mission in Afghanistan, working for the CIA, so she could be close to Sal and hopefully receive his forgiveness.  Whenever she encounters him though he is angry with her and leaves no doubt that there will never be a future for the two of them together.  A friend Cassie knew ten years ago, but has kept in touch with, now is the means by which Daniel Jin can devastate the lives of servicemen and women everywhere.  However, Cassie has faith in her friend, who she used to think of as closer than a sister.  Has her friend really changed that much?  Is she really so cold and evil?  While on the trail of her friend and trying to free her from the clutches of Daniel Jin, Cassie is also worried about Sal and her feelings of love that she still has for him.  Will he ever forgive her?The plot of the story kept me guessing as to the trustworthiness of a few characters until the closing chapters.  There was plenty of action, intrigue and well-developed characters.  Cassie and Sal had a physical relationship in the past, which didn’t work out at the time, but in the beginning of this story Sal couldn’t stand to even be in the same room with her.  Trust or lack thereof was a main theme in the book, and I liked how Cassie in the intervening four years apart from Sal had given her life to Christ.  She trusted Him and this His plan for her life.  There were some surprises in the story that made for a great conclusion.  I have really enjoyed this military series from Ronie Kendig and hope she keeps writing in this genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RADXNX2O2S1UY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=162416319X#wasThisHelpful","RADXNX2O2S1UY","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heather Day Gilbert has written another winner!  I recently read the first book in this series, Miranda Warning, and loved it so I was really excited to buy the second book in the series to see if the mystery and adventure would continue at the same high level.  I was not disappointed!This story takes place about 1-1/2 to 2 years after the first book.  Tess Spencer is now working part-time at a health spa to help pay off her husband’s law school loans.  Her employer has decided she wants to put in an outdoor pool at the health spa so a construction firm begins digging and soon makes a grisly discovery…a human bone.  A homicide detective is called in as it is soon discovered that there are multiple victims and they have not died natural deaths even though they did die some time ago.  The detective has heard about how Tess solved her first mystery and asks for her help on this case as she can get the inside scoop as a worker on the grounds where the bodies were discovered.  Then, another body is discovered in this mass grave; however, this body has been recently killed.As Tess continues to ask questions to discover the identity of the serial killer, she also is dealing with raising her young daughter, the decline in health of her dear friend Miranda, her husband accepting a new job and the uncertainty of whether she still has a job at the spa or not.  Her questions soon put her in the sights of the killer.I just love the whole Spencer family!  Nikki Jo and Roger are so generous with their time and finances and love.  Thomas is such a great example of a strong Christian husband.  Tess is growing in her faith walk with God.  I liked the incorporation of the You Tube videos on different methods of escaping various confinements.  I am definitely looking forward to the next book in the series!

"No man is an island” and for that matter neither is a woman.  In this book, you’ll discover the richness relationships can bring and the pain too.  At the beginning of each chapter is a quote, some of which will truly tug your heart maybe causing you to pause before reading further as happened with me.I started the book on a late afternoon and read till the very end early in the morning hours.  What types of stories keep you reading?  Sometimes for me it’s the draw of a favorite author, or wondering what story lies behind the cover, or maybe even a continuation of a pervious novel published.  I am not sure that I can pinpoint one reason for staying up reading till the last page in Crazy Little Thing Called Love other than it was magnetic.The main two characters rush off during their high school spring break to get married on the spur of the moment.  Then readers find out that not too long afterwards they get a divorce.  What is so appealing is the journey we read of these two people who are drawn to each other almost a decade later and the surprise they find of that truth after no communication in many years.The ending will really grab your heart as the message is extremely powerful.  I continue to discover this author’s gift of telling a romantic tale that delves deeper into the heart of human beings.  I loved how forgiveness was a strong theme and learning to turn back to God when a couple of the characters learned they had strayed.Best of all is the truth shared that any relationship takes work be that in granting forgiveness, showing mercy, prayer, or pursuing the heart of God or another person.  The other person may be a family member, friend, acquaintance, spouse, or neighbor.  Whoever it is a commitment to God comes first in order for any human relationship to grow.  Love is a crazy thing; we never know when it might be shown right there in front of our face.  I wouldn’t miss the journey for anything!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A81XSM16B3NU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476789789#wasThisHelpful","R3A81XSM16B3NU","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tracie Peterson is a favorite author of mine from way back when I read her series of stories set in Alaska.  There is romance in Refining Fire, but what is more captivating is the faith exhibited by one young woman named Abrianna.  Abrianna could be referred to as a spit-fire of a woman, who has deep convictions based on the Word of God.  Now occasionally she gets herself into trouble, but her impulsiveness at times brings out the desire to act in the hearts of others.Militine Scott is a young lady who lives at the Madison Bridal School with no living relatives.  She is woman fraught with nightmares and questions.  Militine is afraid to get near any one person for fear of being hurt, but especially men due to the abuse she suffered at the hands of her earthly father.  Militine seems like her character is a little bit skeptic with a whole lot of seeking.  I think that is probably true of many real people who have suffered abuse of all kinds.Militine’s life is ordered and she tends to erect walls around her heart; she fears that if anyone knows her secrets they will abandon her in a heartbeat.  As I read further into the tale, it was enjoyable to watch the change that slowly came into the heart of this young woman.  Militine is not impulsive like Abrianna, but she sticks close to her side and ventures into many escapades that are dangerous.Tracie Peterson’s writing is captivating because it isn’t all romance nor is the ending wrapped up nice and neat in a tidy bow.  There is action, adventure, questions expressed externally by characters and contemplated internally and not always easy to answer.  Throughout the book the author has the characters point to God whether they understand how God or even why God is allowing experiences to come their way.  I liked how answers weren’t always quick or spoken without any thought.  If her characters did not know the answers to inquiries, they shared their personal experiences or pointed to the Bible.  At times they even said they didn’t have the answers to some of the questions raised by other characters and isn’t that the truth for real people?I hope you enjoy reading Refining Fire as much as I did and will share it with someone you know who loves a good story!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R317N56QNJ6QB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764210629#wasThisHelpful","R317N56QNJ6QB3","A2IEEN02KO9ISO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IEEN02KO9ISO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Ivory soles, chocolate brown tongues and laces, burnt orange, tan, cream and vintage black designs. They remind me of a bandana. I wear a 9 in women's and a 7 in men's Converse.

"Love this lip balm! I've been looking for a lip balm with sunscreen protection that doesn't feel waxy, sticky, heavy, or taste bad and this fits the bill. I got the Acai one, and the scent is so subtle and nice and dissipates a few minutes after applying. This balm is hydrating and isn't sticky, thankfully. I like it so much that I ordered another to add to a friend's birthday gift because she is addicted to lip balms and Chapstick and I know she'll like how this feels. The added antioxidant benefits from the Acai are an added bonus to keep lips looking young and protected from free-radicals. You can't go wrong with this.

"If you love KMFDM and love patches, you need this. Like another reviewer, I had this same patch back in the day and was so happy to find another. Very high quality patch with really tight and sturdy embroidering. This patch isn't flat like cheaper patches. The letters are nice and raised, giving it a lot of texture. As with all iron on patches, place a thin towel over the patch when you're ironing on to prevent discoloration to the design. Don't rub the iron back and forth either, use moderate pressure and press down in 3 second intervals all over patch moving iron to different spots each time you lift the iron up, paying special attention to corners. Flip the towel up to check patch's adhesion periodically as you work. That glue can get very hot, so be careful touching it to check it.Throw back love!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BHF4IMQGPH2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000V9VJJQ#wasThisHelpful","R3BHF4IMQGPH2W","A16VM71BLBCMMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16VM71BLBCMMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These boots are okay, but not what I had in mind. They look okay but they are very stiff. The insoles are hard and flat and uncomfortable. I'd put inserts in them if I were keeping them. I know they're synthetic but these boots are extremely hot. My feet were dying for them to come off 20 mins after trying them on. I wouldn't recommend hiking in them at all. These are merely fashion boots and aren't practical for any kind of physical activity. If you know anything about how boots are supposed to fit for hiking purposes, these are not going to give you the support needed and could lead to injury. Not only that but when stepping they crease at the toe in a way that's indicative of synthetic shoes. They do run large. I normally wear a 9 and took others advice, and ordered an 8.5. I could have even gone with an 8, but it doesn't matter since these are going back. Couldn't help but try them since they were so affordable, but in the long run the price reflects the quality, so keep that in mind.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R280J64FAUJZVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R58OVZK#wasThisHelpful","R280J64FAUJZVG","A16VM71BLBCMMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16VM71BLBCMMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't like this tank at all. I have ordered tons of Bear Dance tanks over the past few years and this is the first time I've been disappointed.  The tank in the photo looks like your average muscle tank, even though the description does say it's cropped it doesn't really look very cropped in the photo. Well, it really is cropped. I always order Large's in Bear Dance tanks, but this one fits differently and is actually very large. It's supposed to be flowy, but it is so wide that it just makes everything too open, if that makes sense. The way this tank's armholes are cut makes them fall all the way in the front and shows half of the cup part of my bra. It's very unflattering and creates a very boxy silhouette. I don't have a very long torso, so the cropped length of this tank actually makes me look stumpy. This might be better suited for a very petite person who doesn't need to wear a bra and who has a longer torso.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UX9EEF39QYCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014G5ZTSM#wasThisHelpful","R1UX9EEF39QYCO","A16VM71BLBCMMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16VM71BLBCMMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So good. I've gotten so annoyed by people ringing my bell during the day trying to get me to sign up for something. My dog freaks out, but he's tiny and ineffective.These solicitors are persistent, too. Sometimes they'll stand there for 5-7 minutes ringing, waiting. Knocking. Waiting. Repeat. I end up yelling at them and then I feel bad.So, I got this. This adorable, seemingly well constructed little sign.My boyfriend thinks it's a bit rude, and I said well, it's much nicer than me telling them to go....well.... you get the drift.It looks great, and adheres securely and solidly on the stucco (ugh) where the doorbell is. I was a bit concerned that it wouldn't sit flush against it (if it happened to actually stick), but luckily it does and rather securely. I was in a bit of a rush to get this up, as you can imagine, and I placed this just a bit off center to the bell. I tried to move it and it didn't budge.It's a perfect size, too. Small enough to scoot in nicely at or around your door without much disruption, and big enough to be noticed when decending upon it.I can't wait to see if no one rings my bell!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YA7ZIQCQTTDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NI6SKMI#wasThisHelpful","R2YA7ZIQCQTTDY","A16VM71BLBCMMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16VM71BLBCMMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm on the fence with this one. No doubt, it smells fantastic and the packaging is amazing (obviously). It is very moisturizing, but it leaves my skin greasier than normal in the morning. It's very thick and creamy and you only need a very small amount.I'm 32, and I have combo skin that is prone to breakouts. This really didn't do much other than moisturize. It hasn't broken me out (yet), but I don't see any real benefit using this over anything else. It's just a very moisturizing moisturizer, so I'm sure it would be good for extra dry skin. Probably best for a teen with dry skin just starting out using skincare. Might try it again in the winter when my skin gets a bit dry. Doesn't absorb completely, so it's definitely a moisturizer for the evening. You don't want to attempt using this under makeup, it'll slide right off.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23K4QL9703BB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RC9X11M#wasThisHelpful","R23K4QL9703BB0","A16VM71BLBCMMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16VM71BLBCMMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This shirt was a surprise. I bought an XL and it's about the size of a Woman's S/M. The material is soft, but is very comfortable. The sleeves are kinda boxy, but that's the style. It's rather short, but I wouldn't say it's cropped. It's about the length of most 90's tees (if you didn't wear junior's clothing in the 90's, sorry). The print is bold and perfect (I love eyes) and it fits me pretty well. It's definitely a very casual tee.

"I've had these shoes for 3 years so far, and they really hold up well. They still look new. Granted,I'm only wear them if I'm going on walks in my hilly neighborhood because they're not so great for working out in because they are heavier than a typical athletic shoe. They are on the bulkier side and take some getting used to if you've never worn toning/rocking shoes. I tripped in these shoes a couple of times when I first u got them just because I wasn't used to walking in them. When you step in these, you're forced to walk heel to toe and the rocking motion sort of springs you forward. You can really feel the toning action in your legs after a long walk, but mostly in the calves. I have tendon damage in my right ankle from a bad roll that never healed properly, and these shoes will cause some fatigue to that ankle, however, I also feel like they help strengthen that ankle (because I'm using muscles in these shoes I don't typically use when wearing other shoes or sneakers), and they provide a lot of stability to it while I'm walking. The arch is incredibly comfortable. Lots of kooshy, but firm, support.These shoes are a worthwhile investment and I've been very happy with these over the last 3 years. They may not be the prettiest shoes ever, but as far as these type of shoes go, this is the nicest looking pair I've come across.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG9MA1W30J79Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039NN7IW#wasThisHelpful","RG9MA1W30J79Q","A16VM71BLBCMMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16VM71BLBCMMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Needed to replace zipper pulls on a pair of leather boots with a full back zipper, and this lace was perfect. A little more chocolate in color than I hoped, but still matches nicely. Soft, stretchy, yet super sturdy. Thicker than I envisioned but still thin enough that it fit into the zipper loops nicely. Looks even nicer than the leather lace zipper pulls the boots came with (which snapped bc they were so thin). Will find more uses for the rest of the lace.

I have combination skin that is prone to breakouts, and I have larger pores on and around my nose. This sponge really helps at getting them cleaned out, making tightening them up a lot easier. Cleansers also easily rinse out. This sponge is a must have for me. I really should buy two at a time or something so I always have one on hand when it needs replacing.

"This is exactly what I wanted! This is a great, lightweight, distressed looking hoodie. Fits fantastically! Soft, lightweight material with a slight stretch to it.The cuffs have the coolest thumb holes that I've ever seen! They are perfectly placed and comfortable, unlike some thumb holes in other hoodies or thermals that are just awkward and uncomfortable. These thumb holes are smoothly sewn and placed. This hoodie is not going to keep you warm by any means, however, it's perfect for Cali evenings! This hoodie is also long which is awesome! On my 5'6 frame the Medium comes to the top of my thighs and almost completely covers my butt. The puckered ruching at the zipper gives a lot of texture, especially with the distressing. It looks so cool. The only thing I don't really like is the hoodie cord, but that's easily removed and replaced with something a little cooler looking, maybe some kind of a leather cord. The cord that comes on the hoodie is your basic woven nylon cheapie cord. Don't let that deter you though, because honestly, the coolness of this hoodie completely outweighs that one minor downfall. Oh, also, the zipper is plastic. Eh, you gotta pick and choose your battles. For the price though, this hoodie is just SO cool! It looks like something from the costuming dept on Lost or The 100 (which is exactly what I was looking for aesthetic wise), or even an All Saints Spitalfields brand hoodie! If this came in some more dark colors, like an olive or brown, I'd buy it immediately!The Medium fits me perfectly, not too tight but not baggy either.

I ordered the black and the bolo tie is dove grey enamel with a black enamel center and is just about the size of a 50 cent coin. The soft leather cord is somewhat thicker than expected, but is in proportion of the hardware and beads, and is of good quality. It has a chunkier look and feel to it, without being masculine. It has a good weight to it too, it doesn't feel flimsy or like it's going to break. The bolo tie is adjustable, so you can choose where you prefer it. It's a perfect length as well. The bottom of the fringed ends falls right above the belly button on me, so it is quite long.I'm really REALLY happy with this purchase!

"Love these! I primarily got these to wear outside when I water my garden at night to avoid insects from crawling on my feet, especially spiders. They're so comfy though, I'll probably order another pair to wear regularly. They take a few to get used to if you're not used to walking in platform flip flops, as they feel kind of clunky at first. I haven't owned a pair like this since I was a teen, but I'm really loving how comfortable they are. Every step is cushy and the arch doesn't hurt or cause any strain. I haven't wanted to take them off! Plus, the height they give my 5'6 frame is awesome. Now, I can also wear a couple of super bells I have that are too long without having to take them up at the hem! Total win. I'm glad I chose these over some of the other brands I've had in the past that have platform flip flops. These are much more comfortable than I remember those brands being.

This is not a dainty or feminine necklace in any way. I like layering and balancing out it's badassness with more feminine looking pieces.The chain is really thick and is also much longer than the chain in the photo. At least, the chain that came with the one I received is. It hangs just below the breast bone. Actually, I like the length a lot, tbh. Allows for more layering options.Honestly, this bullet necklace can't be beat for the price. Quality wise it looks like it should cost at least 3x as much, so I'm pretty happy. Has a really nice weight to it but isn't uncomfortably heavy.The bullet I received is in perfect condition, no dents or scratches and is really shiny.

"This is indeed fake, just like the review from Meryl says. I ordered Pretty Flamingo awhile ago and never used it.  What I received was the weird, orangey-pink color dye in the jar, just as she pictured, with no serial stamp. I could tell immediately when I opened it. The chemical smell was not that of Manic Panic. I've been using Manic Panic for years. The consistency is runnier and thin. The security seal is cheap and hard to remove, unlike MP's. I did a strand test anyway, cuz I wanted to see what the results would be with this. After leaving it sit overnight on a test cutting of my dirty blonde color hair, the result was not even noticeable. If I kind of moved it around in the light it had a creamcicle like tinge to it, but definitely was not Pink Flamingo, which I have used before. The results were completely different.I suggest ordering from a reputable retailer if you must order online (Manic Panic's website for instance, or go into a retail shop like Sally's or an alternative lifestyle store/goth/punk store).It completely bewilders me why they would go to so much trouble faking packaging and dye for a $10 hair dye. The profit would have to be worth the trouble, so you can bet that ""dye"" is worth pennies, and not vegan. Judging by the smell, I wouldn't put it on my hair at all. It smells like toxic chemicals. There's almost a sting when smelling it.Don't take the chance!","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VUA3GGAZCJ9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NSVAZI#wasThisHelpful","R1VUA3GGAZCJ9N","A16VM71BLBCMMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16VM71BLBCMMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No wonder this choker has so many glowing reviews, it really is awesome. The velvet choker is solid quality, for sure. It doesn't look cheap or gimmicky, it's a really nice plush velvet ribbon. The the little crescent moon is so cute, and it catches the light just right to add a bit of shine and shimmer to the look of it, not to mention it's the perfect size in proportion to the ribbon (nothing bugs me more than a tiny charm dangling from a Godzilla-sized ribbon in comparison, but I'm picky). I'm really really happy with this choker. It looks sooo cute on.

"I absolutely adore these glasses. Judging from other reviews I thought they'd be truly oversized, but they're actually not that big, for me anyway. Granted, other cat eye glasses I've tried have been smaller but cat eye glasses tend to look pinched on me. These are actually a great size and they're really comfortable and fit my face well without giving me the pinched look. The color combination looks fantastic and goes with pretty much everything. They don't feel or look cheap to me. In fact they're probably the nicest pair I've bought in a long time. I wanted something a little more current in style to go with my new shoulder length blunt bob and they really compliment my new style and are exactly what I was looking for. They could be a tad darker, but I prefer really dark glasses in general because I'm so light sensitive. All in all, these are great glasses. I've bought AJ Morgan in the past and they tend to be a brand I don't mind paying a little extra for because they hold up so well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PQ3PME1DSVX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EO87RAU#wasThisHelpful","R3PQ3PME1DSVX9","A16VM71BLBCMMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16VM71BLBCMMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought both the pink and black. The pink I got in a Medium and the black I got in a Large. I like the look of the large better in general because it's more flowy on me than the medium, however the sleeves are really really loose. I would have preferred the sleeves on the Large to fit more like the Medium. Regardless, they are nice tops. The light stripe is more of a light oatmeal. Not white. These tops are also rather sheer so you may want to wear a nude bra with them or layer a tank underneath. The material is nice but if you're sensitive to scratchy materials this top might not be for you. I wouldn't say it's extremely scratchy, but it's enough that I noticed it. It's not too bad because the weight of the material is really light so it is bearable, it's just not the softest top ever. I bought these tops primarily because the black stripe one is an exactly like a top Aria (Lucy Hale) wore on the current season of PLL, and I really liked the look. It might even be the top she wore, but I don't know if it is since they didn't show the back and the back of this top has buttons down the center. I agree with the other review about sizing up if you want the oversized flowy fit. Just be aware that the sleeves will also be much larger.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XBC5YX039CZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PY4SHOS#wasThisHelpful","R1XBC5YX039CZ9","A16VM71BLBCMMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16VM71BLBCMMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love love Big Star jeans. I have 8 pairs (now) of the Alex fit and for some reason these fit a whole size larger. I bought the normal size I wear in Big Star which is a 30, and usually they fit like a glove without much breathing room because most of their jeans don't have stretch, but these definitely are more of a 31. Mind you they aren't stretchy but they did stretch out while wearing. As soon as I opened them I thought they looked too big. As soon as I put them on I realized I was right and they were a lot looser than I expected around the waist, butt and thigh, but I didn't think they'd stretch out this much while wearing so I figured it wasn't that big of a deal.  After 8 hours of wear they are baggy and falling down. I love the color and the print so much (FYI they are a faded black with a faded rose print which looks awesome compared to a super bright print) I just wish they fit like my other pairs. Hopefully they'll do some shrinking in the wash. They're so big that I'm even going to wash them in hot water and dry them on high. Seriously. They're that much bigger. If a 29 was available I'd so send them back, but unfortunately that size is sold out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R313KDLLJN95V3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NEIRCC#wasThisHelpful","R313KDLLJN95V3","A16VM71BLBCMMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16VM71BLBCMMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't tell you how blown away by this piece I was as I unwrapped it and saw what my new Celestite looked like!! It FAR exceeds my expectations in every way. It's absolutely stunning! I couldn't have asked for anything better!!! I am ecstatic about it. It's a great weight, quite heavy, it's larger than I even anticipated yet feels great holding it in the palm of my hand. It's like this piece was meant for me. It's so sparkly and has so much depth and the way that it's opened up is incredible. I do however feel that Crystal Allies should use foam sheets for packaging because that paper doesn't not provide much protection in that size of a box at all. A tiny piece did pop off the side but even though that happened it did not destroy or alter my specimen in any horrible way. If anything the piece that fell off can be turned into a piece of jewelry that will always connect me to my lovely specimen when it is at home. I'm uploading some photos of my piece. The photos don't even do it the justice it deserves because it's still 10x prettier in person. I will definitely be ordering from this company in the future because if this is any indicator, their specimens are superb!

"This is awesome, hands down. The colors are definitely darker/more intense in person. The oranges are really bright orange, the purples are plum. Has more blues than it appears online. At first I was concerned that it wasn't what I wanted but upon further examination it actually is perfect. I can't decide if I want to keep it on the wall above the bed, or if I want to sew up the top and make it a curtain. I might just buy another for this purpose. I could even cut it down the middle and make two panels or drape it from the ceiling for a meditation/hookah corner. The possibilities are endless. I think I've seen one almost exactly like it an Urban Outfitters catalog/look book that was double the price. It's not overly feminine color wise so I think my boyfriend will approve (we'll see when he gets home from work, haha). I was trying to find a happy medium between what I wanted and what I think he'd like. It doesn't have any hanging loops, which I was aware of before ordering, but two normal flat gold thumb tacks are enough to hold it up on the wall and support its weight. It's a decent weight cotton, not too flimsy but if used as a curtain certainly won't completely block out light. In fact, the reason I am considering making it into a curtain is because it looks quite beautiful with the light coming through it. The colors are diffused by the light and they glow. Creates a very mystical looking space, even flush against the wall. I bought the Large and it is huge and fits the 12 foot wide wall behind the bed perfectly, with a bit of room on either side. I'd take a picture but our room is a disaster since I'm redoing closets atm.All in all, this is a fabulous tapestry/hanging/blanket/curtain, and I wouldn't hesitate to order another for another purpose or area in our home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDJ940XEHFHZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMLF0KU#wasThisHelpful","RDJ940XEHFHZB","A16VM71BLBCMMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16VM71BLBCMMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Update**After washing these do soften up and they do shrink a bit, mostly in length and around the chest.Definitely better than expected. In fact, I like it so much I just ordered another before writing this review (as I'm wearing the tank in question btw). These remind me of vintage tanks I commandeered from my dad that he'd get at biker bars up and down the coast in the 70's and 80's. Same kind of cut and style. Oversized, but not excessively so (honestly the model photos are atrocious and it looks better on irl). Material isn't clingly. The cotton isn't very soft when it comes but you know, as you wash it over the years it gets softer and softer so it's no big deal.I bought a Large, based on other reviews for how I wanted it to fit, all the while crossing my fingers hoping that this wasn't just another thing I'm going to have to send back due to poor online shopping impulse control and finding sizing way off base. Luckily, it fits exactly how I pictured/wanted it to fit. Nice and loose, but not so much that the chest and armholes are unflattering. For reference I'm 136 lbs, 34C and I wear anything between a 6-10 depending on brand and fit. I'm 5'6 and this tank falls just below my crotch. A perfect length I must say. It's not too tunic-y but it's just teetering on the edge. I'm super picky about length, and this is perfect. Might buy some more and use some vintage iron on transfers I have. Definitely a good tank for a decent price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BC4RUDENPP2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPWPRIU#wasThisHelpful","R1BC4RUDENPP2V","A16VM71BLBCMMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16VM71BLBCMMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though these were a little misshapen out of the packaging, I was able to bend them back into a more circular shape. They are still very cute. The red stone is more translucent in person than they appear in the photo, and the black is simply unnoticeable while on. I feel like the post is a bit too long, but once pushed flush against my lobe they look fine. I suppose if you have ""fatter"" ear lobes you won't find this to be a problem.

"I have a 7 yr old terrier/chihuahua mix (Ivan) who has always been weird about food. He even quarters and sections off his dry food in equal portions. He is a rescue from the South Central pound in LA, so I'm assuming it has to do with his previous experience. I know he was taken away from the original owners due to abuse and his second owner abandoned him. Needless to say he's had a hard life until I adopted him.He's the kind of dog that will just stare at his food for a good 10-15 minutes before eating it. He'll nudge it, lick the bowl, but wont actually eat for what seems like forever. I've tried other raised feeders, but they've scared him for whatever reason and he won't go near them. The only way I've been able to get him to eat for years is by propping his dish up on an incline with a pillow.This Monday he had major oral surgery and had 18 teeth removed (it was a shock) and I was looking for a new dish to better accommodate his poor lil swollen mouth. Nothing really stood out until I saw this, this awesomeness of a dish/feeder. I ordered it and crossed my fingers that he wouldn't be intimidated by it.I received it today, much sooner than expected, and hoped for the best as I prepared his food. He took to it right away!!! He didn't stare at it, he didn't lick the bowl, he ate it all up!! It was SO apparent that this feeder was SO much easier for him! The angle and size is absolutely PERFECT! I was worried it would be too low, but it's not at all! I sat there and watched him eat and couldn't believe how quickly he understood it. He didn't have to bend his head around trying to get into corners and no food was left behind!This dish/feeder is heaven sent! I'm almost ashamed I didn't think of it lol!Now I will be ordering one for my 15 yr old cat!The ONLY way this could be even better is if replacement bowls were available on the off chance something happens to this one. Buying a whole new feeder to replace a bowl is simply ludicrous. You guys really need to get on that because I'm sure that really deters possible buyers, especially considering the price. I have to say though that it IS worth every darn penny!The dish itself is quite sturdy feeling so hopefully nothing happens to it. I'm just going to handle it with care and hand wash it.I'd recommend this feeder to every pet owner, although it won't work for large dogs. Size options would also be available for people with big dogs because it's simply fantastic!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQW99LCIUG3QB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWELVGQ#wasThisHelpful","RQW99LCIUG3QB","A16VM71BLBCMMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16VM71BLBCMMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ok, it's not a huge savings over just boiling water, but it does save some time, and it's certainly less dishes. I threw together some quick pasta using leftover sauce tonight.Toss the pasta in a big pan, cover with water, heat for about 10-12 minutes, then stir in the sauce. That's it. It was ready to go, and tasted just like normal pasta. No one in our family could tell the difference.I think it would make excellent pasta style casseroles too - cook it on the stovetop, cover it with cheese, and throw it in the oven for a quick 20-30 minute dish.

"A couple years ago the first book in the series was offered as a free Kindle book. Assassin's Apprentice, I believe. I made the excellent/foolish mistake of taking it for free. I've been stuck on the series ever since, including a misguided tour down the Rain Wilds in the dragon series, only to come back to Fitz and the Fool for another round after perceived retirement.I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish - spending an entire flight reading it, then some more when landing, much to the annoyance of my wife as we started our vacation. I'm happy to say that we lost a lot of Bee's exposition from the first book, replaced with Fitz's story and his gut reactions to coming back to his old life. However, the character has developed nuance and experience that shows throughout his decisions and makes him a more rounded character.Overall, excellent book and highly recommended, much more so than Book I of the Fitz and the Fool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R334UXANOEDKU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553392921#wasThisHelpful","R334UXANOEDKU2","A3U6J0DLLDEWM2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U6J0DLLDEWM2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For shredding power and quality of shred, this would be five stars. Unfortunately, the cheap plastic housing that will inevitably break, and feels quite flimsy for this price level, knocks it down one star.Pros:- Nice small dice shredding. Better than all comparable price models I have tested.- Handles credit cards, multiple sheets, staples all with easy. No blocking or jamming up.- Easy to tell when on and off due to a bright light, and little concern that it will be left on for little ones to get into.Cons:- Cheap feeling housing.

"I'm very pleased. I've used Cascade packs, and they work fine, but they're more expensive - and don't do as well as these Finish packs. We currently rent, and our landlord bought the cheapest dishwasher possible. It doesn't do much on its own. These, however, work wonders on everything in the dishwasher, from easy stuff to caked on grime.Pros:- They don't tear. I got so tired of leaked Cascade packs, and these are made of heavier duty film and won't tear.

"In a long line of whitening products comes Colgate's entry into the market - Optic White Platinum toothpaste.

They weren't stained to start with, but they didn't get any better from what I could see.- It's very expensive.- Kind of funky taste - not great, not terrible, just a bit off.

"I was really surprised at how big this bag is! I was expecting a smaller bag, more of a lunch sized tote.This tote bag is 16.5 x 5.5 x 15.8 inches!I have decided I will use this bag for one of two things. Either a beach bag/oversized day trip bag or to fill with my yarn, hooks and looms for a nice portable crafting bag! Then I can take my knitting/crocheting with me in the car!The tote bag from Lightaccents is very well made. The fabric is a canvas type material. I chose the blue and white print.It has a loop over button enclosure, and a big front open pocket.Inside you will find 3 sectioned compartments on the one side of the bag, and a big section on the other side of the bag. As well as the middle of the tote that is open for you to fill wit your goodies.The bottom of the tote has little silver feet, so the bag remains clean as you set it on the carpet/ground next to you.The handles are the perfect length and this is very easy to carry. Excellent workmanship.I'm honored to have been chosen to test this item and I agreed to give my feedback on how the tote worked for me.So excited to be able to put this to great use.

"This 12X Zoom Telephoto Lens kit for my IPhone 6 is Amazing.If you do not have a digital SLR camera this might be what you are looking for.The product is a 4X-12X Zoom Telephoto Lens/ Fish Eye Lens/ 2 in 1 10X Macro & 0.65X Wide Angle Lens kit with a tripod and different phone cases to fit your phone so you are able to use this Lens set up. I'm assuming they fit-  iPhone6s/6s plus/ 6 plus/6/5S/5 phones.This is a very high quality set up, and pretty advanced for a cell phone. To be able to take these kind of pictures with this lens is just an amazing thought.I had a bit of trouble getting the ring around the big lens. And had trouble keeping the lens stabilized, it kept wanting to move downward. It's probably user error, as this is something my husband usually helps me with, and he's out of town for the week, so I thought I'd give it a try by myself.I took a picture before the lens looking at some of my Grandson's magnets on my refrigerator, and after I attached the lens. Both from the same distance. It's amazing what the 12X zoom can do.My only thought is to be able to use this you would either have to have it on a countertop or  something at eye level to be able to stand and look through the phone and zoom lens. Or you would have to be laying on the ground as the tripod is only about 3 inches tall. You could use this without the tripod but it would be heavy for the case, in my opinion.This set up also comes with a clip on attachment to be able to screw on the fish eye lens or the macro lens, and attach it right to the phone, easy on easy off.I'm honored to have been chosen to test this lens kit from Daots. Thank you for letting me give my opinion on how it worked for me. It really is a very high quality product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29FWRC6JVURTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9JYJU4#wasThisHelpful","R29FWRC6JVURTV","A2866X4VRWGEO8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2866X4VRWGEO8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The RFID pouch for the back of the cell phone by Zero Grid appears well made out of a dual-layer reinforced lycra fabric with a soft microfiber backing.This comes with a 3M sticky back tape pad that appears to hold up to 300lbs, as it's stamped on the peel off back of the tape.The ad page states this will accommodate up to 8 cards, but I do not feel like mine would stretch out that much. I would say 3-4 cards maximum.The cards fit snug in the pouch.I did not like the idea of taping something like this to my Iphone 6, so I will not be doing that.

"I love the elegant look of this bracelet by Mondaynoon.I chose the baby blue and white steel design. This features Swarovski crystals as well.Very pretty and it fit very well.

"If you are looking for a high quality Crochet hook set this one is for you!I bought this for my youngest daughter and myself. I have not crocheted in years, and my oldest just began making a baby blanket for her 2nd child. So I figured this would give my youngest and I something to do, and to relearn a lost art, so to speak.What I love about this LiLiSew 11 piece set is the cushioned handles! With me getting older and my grip not being what it use to, these are very easy for me to hold onto. They do not slip and my hands do not cramp! This is great for me!This 11 piece set comes with:B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L US sized hooks.OR measured in MM as:2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8This also comes with 10 additional stitch markers so you know where you left off, and helps prevent stitch unravel.I love the bright colors. The hooks are made out of aluminum so they are very light weight!This would be a great gift for a beginner or experienced crocheter who will appreciate less hand fatigue!I bought these at a discounted price to test and agreed to give my opinion of how they worked for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NN83H2X05KDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016V35TD2#wasThisHelpful","R3NN83H2X05KDC","A2866X4VRWGEO8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2866X4VRWGEO8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love the quality of Buttons & Bows Men's Bamboo Crew socks.These socks fit a Men's sock size 7-9, so they are smaller than the normal 10-13 Men's size.The Bamboo socks feel more like a nylon type material and are very soft to the touch, and soft and comfortable to wear.I wore these, and actually these could be considered unisex.The socks have about a 1 inch cuff on the leg part of the sock. They fit tight to my leg.I chose the black socks.The benefit from the Bamboo socks are they are made from 70% bamboo, to fight the bacteria that causes infections and foul odors.

"WOW! I have never been more impressed with a full sized headphone's quality and sound before.The Sently  LS-4430 Thorx headphones are very high quality headphones.From the look of the box, to un-boxing you can tell these are a high quality item.The headphones are collapsible, as well as adjustable via the Stainless steel headband.They come with a Tangle free flat 3.5 mm audio cable that also has a built in microphone inline. There's a headphone symbol on the plug so you know what end connects to the headphones. The cable is 50 inches long.You could easily use these while in a car due to the microphone capability. Great for traveling.I like to listen to my music when I clean my house and with these headphones I could do that, and also never miss a call from my hubby! I could clean and talk hands free, assuming my phone was in my pocket :)Music playback from various devices such as smartphones, tablets, PC etc. via the aux plug end.The ear muffs are highly cushioned with a leather type overlay. Very soft and comfortable and fit the ears well.The sound of the music I was streaming from my Iphone 6 was AMAZING! Such high quality, crisp, clear sound, bass was perfectly equalized with the mid and treble.Very lightweight. Easy to store.

"I have been wanting a different cheese grater, especially when grating my fresh Parmesan cheese.This drum roller type cheese grater has 3 different drums, with a small shredder, medium shredder and a sliced drum.Very easy to use, and you can be right or left handed. It will work either way, which is a huge plus for the lefties of this world.So first you open up the handle and unclip the top and insert your desired drum attachment. Lock into place and insert the cheese into the top compartment above the drum. Then press down firmly on the handle. This will keep the cheese in place and you crank the handle to start the shredding process.I started with my Parmesan cheese and the small shredder. This was easy to use. Cranking became hard at times. Keep in mind Parmesan is a hard dry cheese.Next I inserted the medium shredder roller. And put a chunk of Mozzarella in the top compartment, and proceeded to shred that. It was easy to turn. Next I tried the sliced drum roller. I got small slices of cheese.I posted photos of each cheese and the shredding options in my photos.This grater seems  to be made very well, but I'm a little uncertain about the top of the handle where you grip. I feel like this could be a weak point. I will not let my husband try this. I feel one big squeeze might crack it. I had no problems and loved how easy this was to use. And I did not injure myself as I normally do when shredding Parmesan on my handheld grater.This item will be well used in my household.This is dishwasher safe.

Each lens comes with a lens cover.The clamp is made of a softer material and I used it right over my phone case with no issues.I did read where some people stated this might scratch the phone.

"The power behind this portable inverter is excellent!This 1300W inverter has both a cigarette/power adapter end as well as the alligator clip to hook directly to a car battery.This will be really useful on our trips in the vehicle. This can power my father's breathing machine using the cigarette charging adapter. Which will be a huge help when traveling or during power outages.This is great for use in vehicle to charge cellphones, tablets or even to run a portable dvd player with the screens for movies in vehicle with the kids.You can hook direct to the battery for items that might need a higher power demand. Like a small compressor for filling up air mattresses, a bigger sized tv or even some smaller power tools.The unit is nice and compact and lightweight. It weights about 2 lbs and is 6 3/4""x3 3/4""x2 1/4"".The plugs look a little confusing, but this will accept a standard ac power plug. There's a port for the usb.  There are red and green lights to show when the unit is powered on (green) or if there has been a fault (red), along with the on/off switch.Keep in mind if you are using this in car the car battery will be fine as you are driving and your cars battery is staying charged.

The end handle is easy to grip and hold. The reason they call this a 2 handle leash is there is also a built in strap 1 foot above where the collar would attach on the dog, so you can easily grab there and keep the dog close to you in case he gets a little too curious and tries to pull toward whatever is catching it's interest.The latch is also high quality and easy to clip onto the dog's collar.Cute little red logo (hand in hand) nicely stitched onto leash.This high quality nylon leash is machine washable but states it's better to hand wash the item.Lifetime guarantee.I would highly recommend this 4 foot double handle leash.I received this for testing purposes in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R384Z50CJKQJDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XI1ZVM0#wasThisHelpful","R384Z50CJKQJDP","A2866X4VRWGEO8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2866X4VRWGEO8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Very sturdy piece of equipment and would work perfectly during those challenging times when you need something to cut with and have nothing available.I would recommend this to have in any camping type kit, or in an RV.

"I ordered this Portable Boombox for my husband to take to work with himThis radio is very unique.This is the first radio I have seen with a USB hookup, an SD card slot and an AUX input! You may be asking what all that is for... You can load music to your SD card, use the USB to hook into some Cell phones to listen to your playlist, or use the AUX post to hook up a bluetooth receiver to pull music off you cellphone, or plug in an aux cable to a MP3 player for your playlist. The possibilities are amazing!This also has the AM/FM radio as well as a CD player built in. The sound is quite good, considering the compact size of this boombox.This plugs into the AC power with the cord or uses 6 C batteries( not included) . The cord has a hideaway compartment if you are using just the batteries, for ultimate portability.All button are easy to access on the front of the unit. Dial for the radio is located on the right size. The AUX port is located on the back of the unit.Hubby has chosen to use this at work, and loves it!I could not figure out how to listen to my music using the USB and my Iphone 6. Hubby has a Windows phone and was listening to his music just fine. It did sound different when listening through his phone and the USB connection. He said there was probably a setting he needed to switch on his phone, as it was kinda muffled when playing.The price point seems a bit high, but considering all the features, makes this product alot different than other like products, and totally worth it.I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXVLYHY67QKKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015P2ABMO#wasThisHelpful","RXVLYHY67QKKK","A2866X4VRWGEO8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2866X4VRWGEO8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No awful aftertaste.These seemed to work just as well as our usual brand.I received these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20QV4MKADXVCI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3D0BPK#wasThisHelpful","R20QV4MKADXVCI","A2866X4VRWGEO8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2866X4VRWGEO8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have been having a serious mole issue this last summer!We have lived here 20 years and now those little critters are making a mess of my yard!I currently trap them when I can, but really wanted something else to deter them from even wanting to burrow through my yard and garden.I decided to give this Mole Mace a try. There's a set of instructions that you need to follow for this product to work properly.I have just started using this product, and will now move onto the instructions that say I can place some of these granules in their tunnels.I have not seen any new activity, since starting this product, so I'm really hopeful this will do the trick.Make sure you water the granules down as directed, and follow the instructions for best results.I like that this product is not dangerous to my dogs!The granules remind me of coffee grounds. They look very similar.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18IFTGX2G3R6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014IAS63U#wasThisHelpful","R18IFTGX2G3R6I","A2866X4VRWGEO8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2866X4VRWGEO8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""History of Travis County and Austin 1839-1899"" by Mary Starr Barkley (The Steck Company, 1963, 388 pages).  ""History of Travis County and Austin 1839-1899"" by Mary Starr Barkley is the history of the capital of the Republic, then the state of Texas and it's formation of being a small frontier town to the important capital of Texas over a 60 year time span.  Ms. Barkley relates the growth of a community from a small spot in the center of Texas wilderness to its important place in Texas' political and economic world.  First called ""Waterloo"" the town was selected as the capital of the Republic of Texas in 1839, and the name was soon changed to honor the pioneer and one of the first founders of Texas, Stephen F. Austin.The six decades of history presented in this book gives an excellent insight into the persons who laid the foundation for Travis County and Austin as the capital and capital county of Austin.  Government officials, both state and local merchants, educators, clergymen, farmers, adventureers, average citizens, (and a few outlaws and banditos) are presneted and explained with great clarity and fascinating prose.  All facets of Austin are included as the county first surged to life with rugged optimism, went through the split of brother versus brother, and family versus family during the Civil War.  Many regiments that fought for the Confederacy gathered in Austin and were sent off to fight in the Army of Northern Virginia, Army of Tennessee, Trans-Mississippi theater regiments.  The men from Texas would enlist and then hear great speeches from the officials of the state and the Confederate government to bolster spirits of the men who fought for the south.  However, at the same time there was a sizeable citizenry in Austin that were against secession including Texas great and an important founder Sam Houston, who tried in vain to keep Texas neutral and out of the Civil War.  During the early days of secession, 6th street in Austin would host huge bonfires with effigy's of Abraham Lincoln lit afire and sing great patriotic Confederate songs.  As the war progressed however, many would gather in Austin to hear the news of far off battles such as Gaines Mill, Second Manassas (Bull Run), Sharpsburg (Antietam), Gettysburg, Vicksburg, Chickamauga, Franklin and other terrible battles and see the casualty lists that claimed the lives of many men from Austin.  Economic hardship was also prevalent in the capital of Texas.After the Civil War Austin, as the rest of Texas, was set back due to Reconstruction and it would be over 20 years until Austin and Texas would rebound and have great growth in the 1880's and 1890's.The author has presented in an interesting way the threads of history of this local history.  Ms. Barkley used documents, books, newspapers, and narratives as source materials and used personal interviews with the ""old timers"" of Austin to give this complete 60 year history of the capital of the Great State of Texas.The chapters are: 1. Path of the Pinoeers 2. Geography-Topography-Indians 3. Austin in 1839 4. Austin, 1839-1846 5. Austin, 1846-1860 6. Austin, 1861-1870 7. Austin, 1870-1899 8. Austin in 1899 9. Education-Schools 10. The University of Texas 11. Capitol and Newspapers 12. Civic Development (Fire and Police Protection, Utilities) 13. Economic Development 14. Religious Development 15. Recreation, Historic Homes, Arts, Folklore. Appendix, References, Index.This is a very IMPORTANT book because Austin reflected the hardship, growth, war, and opportunity that was also Texas.  Ms. Barkley has woven together a vital history of the capital of the Lone Star State and it should be in every serious student, scholar, and historian of Texas and Texas History library.  It is a book that is VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and is a MUST HAVE to any devotee to Texas history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13TT02J70WCEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006BRY0M#wasThisHelpful","R13TT02J70WCEZ","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Reminiscences of Company H First Arkansas Mounted Rifles"" by Dr. Robert H. Dacus (Post-Dispatch Print, 1897, 48 pages).  ""Reminiscences of Company H First Arkansas Mounted Rifles"" by Dr. Robert H. Dacus is the battle history of this regiment of the famed ""First Arkansas Mounted Rifles"" written by a soldier some 32 years after the end of the Civil War.  Dr. Dacus during the war was a private in the First Arkansas Rifles and tells the battle history of the regiment as they fought primarily in the Western then Trans-Mississippi theater.He begins his memories saying ""What I have written has been almost entirely from memory; having nothing but the company roll to guide me; and as more than thirty years has elapsed the incidents recorded occurred.  I feel that someone ought to give to posterity a condensed but true history of every company of Arkansas troops that served in the war.  Were this done, and the whole taken and compiled into historical form, it would show the heroic part by Arkansas in the great struggle for state supremacy, one of the grandest of all the grand principles of Democracy.""Throughout this short but fascinating read Dr. Dacus gives the history of the various battles of company H and they were intense. The company was formed at Fort Smith, Arkansas and drilled and then were in their first battles at Oak Hill, MO and then at Elkhorn Tavern (Pea Ridge) Arkansas.  It was then transferred east of the Mississippi and under the command of Generals P. T. Beauregard,  Braxton Bragg, Joseph E. Johnston, John Bell Hood, and then at the time of surrender again under General Joseph E. Johnston.This hard fighting regiment was in the major engagements of battles in the Trans-Mississippi/Western Theater from Pea Ridge to Bentonville.  Between these battles they were in the Chickamauga Campaign, Meridian and Atlanta Campaign, Franklin-Nashville Campaign, and finally the Carolina Campaigns. Dr. Dacus gives brief descriptions of the battles and what Company H did in the battles.  It is an intense read full of heroism by the soldiers of Company H.  This is one of the few reminiscences where a soldier does not describe mainly the camp life of the soldiers.  However, it is not needed in this short read.  The battles are descriptive enough of the hardships the company and regiment went through.  Even though the official name of the company was Mounted Rifles, they fought mostly dismounted.This is a fascinating read that is a valuable source of information about an Arkansas Regiment.  There are not nearly enough published history about the brave regiments from Arkansas that fought in the War Between the States and especially the Western/Trans-Mississippi theater of the war.  This history provides an invaluable source to fill in the lesser known history of western regiments of the Confederacy.Dr. Dacus did a tremendous service to the history of the Confederate regiments from Arkansas, Confederate military history, and Arkansas History in this excellent history.  Highly Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WDCAFRFWH7QS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1478207981#wasThisHelpful","R2WDCAFRFWH7QS","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Army of Tennessee"" by Stanley F. Horn (University of Oklahoma Press, 3rd Printing, 1941, 503 pages). ""The Army of Tennessee"" by Stanley F. Horn is the monumental book about the major Confederate army in the western theater of the Civil War.  This monumental work is in-depth and the narrative is excellent by the author Stanley F. Horn.  The author tells the history of this tragic yet valorous army that fought in many states against the Union army. The Army of Tennessee had ever-changing commanders, jealousy and bickering among the major generals in the army, many hard fought battles and many ""what ifs"" and ""could have been"".  While the Army of Northern Virginia was the main attention in the history of the Civil War, the Army of Tennessee was just as important and fought in just as many hard fought battles as their brothers in the eastern theater of the war.The Army of Tennessee was the major army of the Confederacy that operated between the Appalachians and the Mississippi River.  It carried the fortunes of the south and on its bayonets went into major battles numerous times often being ill-equipped and without major supplies.  This excellent army went against the Union's best generals such as U.S. Grant, George ""The Rock of Chickamauga"" Thomas, William T. Sherman and it matched these generals blow-by-blow.  From the fighting at Shiloh where the first general of the Army of Tennessee  the Texan Albert Sidney Johnston was killed, to the hard and bloody fought battle at Chickamauga where the army suffered heavy casualties, the Army of Tennessee's soldiers were noted for their brave and tenastic fighting.  Yet the Army of Tennessee would be denied victory many times due to the unwise decisions of its commanders such as Braxton Bragg who would suffer defeat from the almost victory after the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863 where the Army would suffer defeat at Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain.The Army of Tennessee would be commanded by Joseph E. Johnston an excellent general but an ""enemy"" of Confederate President Jefferson Davis.  The animosity between these two leaders would hinder the Army of Tennessee as did the in-fighting between the generals in the army.  The Army of Tennessee would suffer heavily in the battle of Franklin under yet another commander John Bell Hood, who before Franklin would lead the Texas Brigade in the Army of Northern Virginia and would win the famous early battles of the Civil War against the Army of the Potomac.  However, as a corps commander General Hood would suffer defeat as he was not able to lead the Army of Tennessee and would make a grievous error at Franklin.The Army of Tennessee tried to stop General William T. Sherman as his army marched through Georgia and would make Sherman pay for his mistake at Kennesaw Mountain outside of Atlanta.  However, this would be a fruitless victory for the Army of Tennessee and the Confederacy as Sherman would continue his destructive march through the Georgia countryside.  The Army of Tennessee would ultimately surrender to the Union as its General Joseph E. Johnston surrendered to General William T. Sherman in North Carolina a few weeks after General Robert E. Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Courthouse in April 1865.Mr. Horn rightfully makes the case that it wasn't due to the soldiers and officers fighting spirit that would make the Army of Tennessee lose major battles, but it was the constant in-fighting between its commanders and ever replacing the major commanders that would lead to nearly won victory's but not clear victory's the Confederacy dearly needed.  This in-depth and fascinating history clearly states that case.Mr. Horn is to be recommended for this monumental book that is the definitive history of the Army of Tennessee.  It was first published in 1941, and is the referenced history for many other author's and historians books about the Civil War in the Western Theater.The prose is outstanding, the references are clearly accurate, and the maps inside this classic work enhance the reader to understand the actions of the Army of Tennessee.This is a very important book on the Civil War and must be considered a vital part of anyone's Civil War library.  Simply said, if a reader doesn't have this book in their own Civil War personal library, then their library is missing a vital history and will have a noticeable incomplete Civil War library.This is a MUST have to any serious student, author, historian or Civil War Scholar.  It is a must have for anyone interested in the Western Theater of the Civil War, Confederate Military History, Union Military History of the Western Theater and Civil War History overall.  It is not merely a recommended history but should be a REQUIRED history to any serious Civil War scholar, historian, or student!  A MUST HAVE!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R114LOBDYVWSBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0806102667#wasThisHelpful","R114LOBDYVWSBU","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Highly Irregular Irregulars: Texas Rangers In the Mexican War"" by Frederick Wilkins (Eakin Press, 226 Pages).  ""The Highly Irregular Regulars"" Texas Rangers in the Mexican War"" is the history of the famous Texas Rangers during the Mexican War of the 1840's.  When the United States declared war with Mexico it called on for men to fight and conquer Mexico and their ""upstart"".  Thousands of Texans would volunteer to join in the fight against Mexico.  The Texas Rangers was one of the fiercest units in this war.  In the beginning chapters of this excellent book, Mr. Wilkins gives the history of the Texas Revolution and the men who fought for Texas against General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.  Many of the men of the Texas Revolution were still angry towards Mexico and the Mexican Army so they enthusiastically would join in the fight against Mexico for the second time.The governor of Texas and the U.S. Government called for the men and they were formed under such leaders as Jack Hays and Ben McCulloch who would in less than 20 years later become a Confederate General.  The Texas Rangers during the Mexican War would endure hardships and lack of efficient supplies, however, these hardships would not affect their ferocity against the enemy or the ""wildness"" of the Texans.Many of the Texas Rangers had years of fighting before the war against hostile Comanches, Kiowas, and Apaches in Texas.  Many of the Rangers also had ""checkered backgrounds"" and were on the wrong side of the frontier law of Texas.  Combining these men into regiments definitely led to some ""fierce and wild regiments"" and many times would show no mercy towards overrunning the enemy.The Texas Rangers would also fall under the commander of U.S. Forces in Mexico Zachary Taylor who would assign the Rangers in some of the toughest fighting of the war in places such as Monterrey, Buena Vista, and other locations in Northern and Central Mexico.Under excellent leadership from Samuel H. Walker, Jack Hays and Ben McCulloch, the Rangers became well known for their fierce fighting but also as unpredictable and wild men who would often take the valuables off of the Mexican prisoners and the dead and keep the ""fortunes of war"" for themselves.  The Rangers would also display ""lawlessness"" that was often overlooked by their officers in the regiment, as they knew that in combat the Texas Rangers were always ready to fight"".  Supplies not only for the Rangers but also for the U.S. Army in Mexico was piecemeal at best so they would often have to forage for their own food and supplies and would raid towns in Mexico to get their supplies.After the U.S. defeated Mexico, many of the Rangers found it hard to adapt to ""peacetime"" and would become bounty hunters, others would go back to Mexico, where the law was few and far between the frontier.  Others would go back to Texas and resume their frontier and city lives.Mr. Wilkin's fascinating read of the ""Irregular Regulars"" is a valuable history of the Texas Rangers in the War with Mexico.  His descriptions of the weapons the Rangers would use is also a valuable history of the weapons used during the Mexican War.  His description of daily camp life among the rangers is accurate and provides excellent photos, illusrations and stories of the men not only in camp life but also in describing the action against the Mexican Army. The chapters are: 1. The Legend Begins 2. First Service 3. The Regiments Form 4. June 1846 5. Toward Monterrey 6. Armistice 8 The Walker Colt 9. Buena Vista 10. Chevallie's Battalion 11. Central MexicoI highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Texas History, The Mexican War History, Texas Ranger History and U.S. History of the 1840's.

"""The Civil War Reminiscences of Major Silas T. Grisamore C.S.A. edited with an introduction by Arthur W. Bergeron Jr. (Louisiana State University Press, 1993, 227 pages).  ""The Civil War Reminiscences of Major Silas T. Grisamore C.S.A."" is the diary of this officer/quartermaster of the 18th Louisiana Infantry Regiment that fought mainly in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the War Between the States and in Louisiana.  Silas T. Grisamore, originally born in Indiana in 1825 and moved to Louisiana when he was 21 in 1846 was a merchant before the war.  When the war began, Grisamore enlisted with the Lafourche Creoles, soon to become Company G of the 18th Louisiana Infantry Regiment and was commissioned as the quartermaster officer of the regiment due to his experience as a merchant.  Much of his service during the war was as the quartermaster (supply and acquisitions) of the regiment and later the infantry division.Major Grisamore's personal diary details the daily life, the battles, the hardships that the regiment went through.  Many of the Major's tales are humoerous such as one account where a Colonel of the regiment was actually relieved that his brand new uniform was left behind and ""captured"" by the Union.  He hated new clothes and a ""burden was lifted"" when the Yankees captured the house he was  in after he escaped the night before.  Major Grisamore also details the hardships of obtaining supplies for the regiment during the war, as the war dragged on, supplies were harder to get and severe shortages was common to a Confederate Regiment and the 18th Louisiana Infantry Regiment was no exception.  Major Grisamore was also in close proximity to many of the battles the regiment fought in.  From Shiloh to Pleasant Hill, Mansfield and other battles in and around Louisiana, the major is a keen observer of the terrible reality of battle and gives an excellent and accurate account of the regiment in battle.Major Grisamore provides detailed information about the status of General Alfred Mounton during the battle of Labadieville and the actions of General Henry H. Silby at the battle of Bisland that are not found in any other sources thus far.  Major Grisamore was an excellent writer and observer.After the war, Major Grisamore beginning in 1867 under the pseudonym of ""Uncle Silas,"" wrote his memories to a a local newspaper ""The Weekly Thibodaux Sentinel"" as a weekly entry of his reminiscences of the war.  He would write these articles up into 1871.  Arthur W. Burgeron would take the reminiscences of Major Grisamore and presented them in chronological order with excellent footnotes and author's notes that greatly help the reader follow the actions of the 18th Louisiana Infantry Regiment and the actions of Major Grisamore.  At the end of the book, Major Grisamore provides the history of the officers of the 18th Louisiana and what they did after the war.This is an excellent book that is a valuable resource to anyone interested in a Confederate regiment from Louisiana and the supplies they procured in order to survive.  This excellent book also provides a valuable service in describing the lesser known battles and skirmishes in Louisiana and the Trans-Mississippi Theater that are not well known.I highly recommend this to anyone interested in the Civil War in the Trans-Mississippi Theater, Confederate Louisiana history, and history of the 18th Louisiana Infantry Regiment.

"""The Fighting Fifth Pat Cleburne's Cutting Edge: The Fifth Arkansas Infantry Regiment. (Floyd R. Barnhill Sr, 1990, 245 pages.)  ""The Fighting Fifth Pat Cleburne's Cutting Edge: The Fifth Arkansas Infantry Regiment"" by Flolyd R. Barnhill Sr. and Major Calvin L. Collier is the fascinating history of one of the hardest fighting Confederate regiments in the western theater of the Civil War.  The author's grandfather fought in the Fifth Arkansas and this book honors his service in the Civil War.  The Fifth Arkansas was part of the Arkansas Brigade organized in 1861 by General William J. Hardee at Pittman's Ferry on the Current River.  The brigade was commanded at various times by Generals S. A. M. Wood, T. C. Hindman, St. John Richardson Liddell, Daniel Govan, and the by one of the finest and fiercest Generals in the Confederate Army Patrick Cleburne.Very little information exists relating to the Arkansas regiments that marched off to the war and even less is known about the regiments raised in Northeast Arkansas, however because of the author's excellent research he has been able to write a fascinating and accurate history of one of the regiments, The Fifth Arkansas Infantry Regiment.  The author has graphically recounted the exploits of this regiment as it fought in many battles such as Perryville, Murfreesboro, Chickamauga, Atlanta and Franklin.  These fierce battles are shown how hard and fierce the Fifth Arkansas Regiment fought and suffered many casualties in the battles against fearful odds.The men of the Fifth saw the enemy in plain sight and close up for the first time at the Battle of Perryville, Kentucky and it was a small introduction to the many bloody battles the Fifth fought in.  The regiment marched from Arkansas at the beginning of the war and then would march over Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina and while doing so their casualty list in killed and dead of wounds would surmount.  At the end of December 1862, they were again in the battle at Murfreesboro against the Union Army and the men of the Fifth Arkansas would go into battle with many having no shoes and had to wear feed sacks or rags tied to their feet with twine.  Many were without coats or serviceable trousers.  Those who did had liberated them from dead and wounded Union soldiers and brought them from the field at Murfreesboro. The Fifth would also fight in the battles of Liberty Gap, Ringgold, Resaca, New Hope Church-Pickett's Mill, Marietta, Kennesaw Mountain, Atlanta, Jonesboro, Decatur, Nashville and at the end of the war the few that survived fought at Bentonville and surrendered in April of 1865 as part of the army of General Joseph E. Johnston.Throughout this excellent book the authors describe the attitudes of the men as fiercely loyal to Arkansas and the Confederacy, the harshness of disease and sickness that swept through the army, the endless marches with little rest, and between battles the everyday life of living in camp.Major Calvin L. Collier (USAF, Ret) the author of many fine books about Arkansas regiments contributed and edited to this excellent book and both authors have written an outstanding ""biography"" of one of General Cleburne's fine Arkansas Regiments over the four years of the War Between the States.

"""The Thirty-seventh North Carolina Troops: Tar Heels in the Army of Northern Virginia"" by Michael C. Hardy (McFarland & Company, Inc, 2003, 346 pages).  ""The Thirty-seventh North Carolina Troops: Tar Heels in the Army of Northern Virginia"" by Michael C. Hardy is the fascinating and thorough history of the soldiers of North Carolina who made up this Tar Heel Regiment that fought in the Army of Northern Virginia.  The author from numerous sources wrote the history of the officers and men who fought four years under the leadership of General Robert E. Lee and other excellent and not-so-excellent generals and leaders in the Army of Northern Virginia.  As the back cover states, ""This account of the unit's four years of service, told largely in the soldiers' own words.  Drawn from letters, diaries, and postwar articles and interviews, this history follows the unit from its organization in November 1861 until its surrender at Appomattox.""  The author has done OUTSTANDING research in compiling all the sources to write this history of a hard fighting regiment.  This is NOT a casual read of a Civil War Regiment, it is an in-depth ""biography"" of a regiment.  Mr. Hardy gives great honor to the soldiers of the 37th NC Regiment in writing the history of the regiment mostly in their own words, however, there is numerous maps, photographs of the officers and men of the regiment that were taken during and after the war, an outstanding bibliography, appendixes, author's notes, and other excellent references that help the reader understand the complete history of the 37th NC.  After reading this, it is easy to understand why Michael C. Hardy is considered to be one of the top historians of North Carolina history.  His books are well documented, have excellent prose, thoroughly researched and an invaluable resource into North Carolina Civil War and post Civil War history.There is so much fascinating history that it would take several pages to account for each important historical account of the regiment.  Suffice to say this is an OUTSTANDING history of the hard fighting North Carolina regiment that is invaluable to anyone interested in the history of Confederate North Carolina, the Army of Northern Virginia, battles of the eastern theater of the Civil War, and Civil War history in general.

"""Fight and Survive! A History Of Jackson County, Arkansas In the Civil War."" by Lady Elizabeth Watkins (River Road Press, 1974, 203 Pages).  ""Fight and Survive! A History Of Jackson County Arkansas In the Civil War"", is the history of this county in northern Arkansas that was a key point of mustering Confederate soldiers, and a key transportation portal that was fought over by both Union and Confederate forces during the Civil War.  Ms. Watson, the author provides a fascinating story of the men who overwhelmingly joined Confederate Regiments from Jackson County and fought primarily in the Trans-Mississippi Theater in the First Arkansas Infantry Regiment as well as many other regiments provided from the state of Arkansas when the state seceded from the Union and joined the Confederacy in 1861.Jacksonport, Arkansas (the county seat) was one of the main mustering points for the Confederate army in Arkansas.  Throughout the war, both armies contended for possession of this strategic port that shipped cotton, corn and other agricultural supplies.  Located at the center of the White and Black river trade.  The Confederate attack on Helena was planned here in 1863 by Generals Sterling Price and Theophilus H. Holmes.  At various times Jacksonport was headquarters for such military leaders as Earl Van Dorn, John S. Marmaduke, Dandridge McRae and Jo Shelby.  Thus the importance of having a protection of the county from enemy forces was quite evident.Jackson County provided many young men to the Confederacy and Ms. Watson describes the tremendous burden of supplying these men the adequate food, clothing, weaponry and other essentials for the men in the Arkansas Regiments.  From the first ""rush"" of excitement of the men who wrote home with ""war fever"" to the harsh reality of sickness that killed many men in the first years of the war, to the skirmishes and battles these soldiers from Jackson County fought and were wounded and killed.  Jackson county faced the harsh realities of hostile Union forces who were looking to seize food-stores, supplies and capture Confederate soldiers.  Many families would suffer sever hardships, yet remained resolved to the Confederate cause throughout the war. Ms. Watson has the newspaper articles, letters from the soldiers, official reports from the Confederate officers and great photos of the leaders who were in and fought in Jackson County during the war.  Many skirmishes were fought in Jackson County and the author describes the short but fierce action.  Jackson County suffered from bushwhackers, roving bandits, renegades and other fierce men who would prey on the civilian population due to a lack of legal deputies and other officials.  General Jo Shelby and other leaders demanded more soldiers from the county and state to join the Confederacy and many families did provide all their fathers and sons,but some would hide their sons and fathers as the war wore on.  However, Jackson County provided a key and proud service for Arkansas and the Confederacy as did most counties throughout the Confederate States.Men from Jackson county wold join the 1st, 2nd, 7th, 8th, 30th, 31st, 32nd, 37th, Arkansas Infantry Regiments, Jackson Artillery, 1st, 2nd, 45th, 46th, 47th,  Arkansas Cavalry Regiments, Ford's Arkansas Cavalry Battalion, Hooker's Company of Arkansas Mounted Volunteers, McGehee's Arkansas Cavalry Regiment, and the 1st Regiment of Arkansas Mounted Rifles,  She also provides a roll of each of these regiments and battalions so it is very useful to trace genealogy for those interested in their Civil War ancestors.  Maps are included that show the key river locations and troop positions in Jackson County, both Union and Confederate.This is an outstanding book and resource of history that gives the background of a county that supported the Confederacy for four years.  Jackson County did a tremendous service and Ms. Watson's fascinating account of the history of Jackson County, Arkansas is a valuable resource of information about the Confederate history of Northern Arkansas, the Trans-Mississippi Theater, Arkansas Confederate History and regiments, and civilian life during the Civil War.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14FV1HTO8E4G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EBVNJM#wasThisHelpful","R14FV1HTO8E4G9","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""With The 11th New York Fire Zouaves In Camp, Battle, and Prison: The Narrative of Private Arthur O'Neil Alcock in The New York Atlas and Leader."" by Brian C. Pohanka and Patrick A. Schroeder. (Schroeder Publications, 2011, 232 pages).  ""With The 11th New York Fire Zouaves"" is the fascinating read of a series of letters that a Union Soldier Private Arthur O'Neil Alcock wrote to his hometown Newspaper of the New York Atlas and Leader.  His letters provide a view into the life of a Union Zoave Soldier in camp, marches, and battles.  The late Civil War Historian Brian Pohanka author of ""Vortex of Hell"" about the 5th New York Zouaves, and Appomattox Court House National Historic Park Historian Patrick Schroeder did an outstanding job editing these letters and also providing an excellent introduction about the zouaves and the regiment that was made famous by Colonel Elmer Ellsworth who was the leader of the famous drill unit before he was killed by a tavern owner while removing a Confederate Flag in 1861.Private Alcock's letters provide a view into the life of these firemen turned soldiers during the Civil War.  This regiment would fight in battle after battle, they put out a hotel fire or two, they would drill most proficiently and would lose many men to battle and sickness.  Private Alcock himself would be mortally wounded during the battle of the Wilderness when a minie bullet struck him above the left knee and cause his leg to be amputated and he would never recover from the surgery and died at the age of 44 in 1864.The editors as always provide outstanding photographs of the officers and men of the 11th New York, as well as many illustrations to enhance the readers appreciation of the regiment.  Both editors are known for their dedication of the history of the New York Zouaves and have done a great honor of the history of the New York Zouaves with the addition of this fine book as well as their other books.I highly recommend this excellent book to anyone interested in the history of the famous New York Zouave Regiments that fought in the Civil War, the history of the Army of the Potomac, the battles of the eastern theater of the Civil War, and New York Civil War History!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QM6IYP4SQ86A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1889246468#wasThisHelpful","R3QM6IYP4SQ86A","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""General Lee and Hood's Texas Brigade at the Battle of the Wilderness"" by Dayton Kelley (Hill Junior College Press, 1969, 75 pages) is about the famous incident during the Battle of the Wilderness on May 6, 1864 where General Robert E. Lee, (Commanding General of the Army of Northern Virginia) was at the front lines during the Battle and as the men of Hood's Texas Brigade were being formed into line of battle in preparation to stem the Federal Advance they became aware that General Lee intended to lead the brigade.  Realizing the danger that General Lee put himself in, they shouted and implored him to go to the rear out of danger.  From all sides arose the shout, ""Lee to the rear!  Lee to the rear!""A Texan stepped out of the ranks and caught Traveller's (General Lee's horse) bridle, turning the horse and rider around and away from the fire to the front.  The Texas Brigade then moved forward behind its commander, General John Gregg and went into battle at the right time to stem the Federal Advance.Mr. Kelley in this account examines and tells the history of the account from many of the men who witnessed it.  From the reports of General James Longstreet down the ranks to Sergeant J. B. Polley of the Fourth Texas Infantry Regiment there are many who remember this and give their views of General Lee's desire to lead the charge.  There is always different views of what happened and who actually took Traveller's bridle and led General Lee to the back of the lines, however the overall account remains true and accurate. In the book there are paintings and illustrations of the incident done by various artists over the years.Mr. Kelley also tells that this was not the first time that General Lee wanted to be at the front of a charge.  During the Battle of Spotsylvania, General Lee wanted to lead the charge against the Federals with regiments of either Georgia or Mississippi (various accounts differ), and they too told General Lee to get behind the lines so he could be safe from harm.This interesting book only describes the incident and not the entire battle.  Mr. Kelley used letters, correspondence, and other accounts from the veterans in the book.This is a rare book that is a bit expensive, however it is a must have for those who want to learn about the famous history of General Lee offering to lead the charge.This is an the only dissent is that Mr. Kelley should have written the history of the Texas Brigade during the entire battle and not just the one incident with General Lee.  However, that being said, this is a book that I recommend to those who want to know about the famous ""General Lee to the rear!"" account.  General Robert E. Lee was a brave and courageous leader who was willing to lead the charge against the Army of the Potomac, and it was only the love and devotion of his troops that prevented him to lead the charge that would have certainly got him killed or seriously wounded.Highly recommended to those Civil War students, authors/historians who want to know more about the Battle of the Wilderness, Hood's Texas Brigade, Confederate Military History, and Civil War History.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AGMP7IIQO5OF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001MSH200#wasThisHelpful","R3AGMP7IIQO5OF","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dove Men+ Care Dry Spray Antiperpirant is a refreshing deoderant that isn't heavily perfumed, isn't wet and sticky and still keeps the underarms dry.  For many years spray deoderants were wet and sticky and the smell would fade just after a few hours.  This isn't so with Dove Men+Care Spray Antiperspirant.  It has a pleasant smell, it goes on cool, and it leaves underarms dry for at least 12 hours.  I have tried many antiperspirant and even though I still use a typical mans stick deodorant, whenever I want to switch to a spray, it will definitely be Dove Men+ Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant!

"My dog ""Pistol"" is a male Dachshund and has HORRIBLE breath, I mean really, really BAD!  In the past I have tried various ways to get him to have decent breath.  He doesn't care for rawhides, any other type of ""breath mint"" chewables for dogs he just looks at me to say ""NO! Try again!"".  About 6 months ago I picked up Milk-Bone Brushing Chews Daily Dental Treats and gave him one.  He LOVED it!  He ate it, and then jumped into my lap and then gave me the ""approval"" look!  And...his bad breath is greatly reduced!  I mean he has dog breath that is always unpleasant, but after he eats the Milk-Bones his breath is decent and it doesn't smell like he just ate something rotten!  The Milk-Bone's also do a great job of removing plaque from his teeth which is critical in a dog's health (especially now that he is an older dog).I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Milk-Bone Brushing Chews for dogs!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MQEH76VPNYVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INTTDWG#wasThisHelpful","R2MQEH76VPNYVW","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Gettysburg Glimpses: True Stories from the Battlefield"" by Scott L. Mingus Sr. is the short but fascinating histories of individual soldiers (both North and South) during the Battle of Gettysburg from July 1 to July 3, 1863.  The stories contain instances of heroic and brave actions, tragic circumstances of death, hardships before the battle, the aftermath, the bodies left, and other details that the soldiers went through.  From civilians who witnessed the battle from rooftops and other observatories, to the soldiers in the thick of the battle at the Bliss Farm, Little Round Top, the Peach Orchard, the Railroad Cut, Pickett's Charge and other areas of the battle, reading these gives you an understanding of the chaos, the deadly encounters, the heroism, and the carnage that was fought over three days in the hot and muggy Pennsylvania summer.  Men from as far away as Texas and Arkansas and as close by as Chambersburg, Harrisburg, and Gettysburg fought violently against each other, and they all had encounters.  Most of the soldiers who survived never told their history of the battle, but some did, and that is what Scott Mingus did excellently, he researched from many sources, books written in the years right after the battle or at the turn of the century, or from personal diaries, letters to loved ones and newspaper articles.  These soldiers who fought for the USA and CSA wrote their memories for people to know what happened during the battle.Each story is fascinating be it a paragraph or pages long.  Each story told adds to the tremendous history of the battle, and the men who fought in it.This is an excellent book that helps those who are interested in the battle the intense short stories of the soldiers that fought at Gettysburg.  It is highly recommended for those who want to know more about the Battle of Gettysburg, the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia, Civil War History, and the Civil War in the Eastern Theater of the War.This is another excellent book by Gettysburg/Civil War Historian and author Scott L. Mingus Sr. and it is a valued book in my personal library of the Battle of Gettysburg and the Civil War!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMM3V8JCI7OBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1436396220#wasThisHelpful","RMM3V8JCI7OBD","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""A History Of The Third South Carolina Infantry 1861-1865"" by Mac Wyckoff (Sergeant Kirland's Museum and Historical Society Publishing, 1995, 330 Pages), is the history of the hard fighting regiment from South Carolina that fought in the Army of Northern Virginia under the leadership of Robert E. Lee during the Civil War.  This regiment from the first state of the secession was quickly formed right after South Carolina seceded from the Union in December of 1860.  The regiment was formed from the men of Charleston and other towns throughout South Carolina.  From the cities to the country young men would enlist in the Confederate Army at first due to their passion of becoming independent from what they considered a hostile Federal Government, others would join because their brothers, fathers, cousins, and close friends would enlist, and others for the ""romanticism and adventure"" of going off to war.The men were organized into companies that formed the Third South Carolina Regiments and were enthusiastically supported by the people they encountered as they first formed on the South Carolina Coastline then marching up to Virginia to be a part of the Army of Northern Virginia.  At first the regiment encountered the Union Army in small skirmishes, then afterwards would be involved in the major battles of the ANV.  The regiment would fight in Manassas (Bull Run), the Seven Days Campaign, Sharpsburg (Antietam), Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, while as a part of the famous Kershaw Brigade where they would fight at the Peach Orchard the Wheatfield, they would encounter the Army of the Potomac's Second Corps and engage in intense close combat many soldiers would fall.After Gettysburg, the regiment would transfer to the western theater of the war under General James Longstreet's Corps and fight a Chickamauga, the Tennessee Campaign, Overland Campaign, Petersburg, Cedar Creek and finally surrender at Greensboro on April 28, 1865 a few weeks after General Robert E. Lee surrendered the ANV at Appomattox Courthouse.Mac Wyckoff wrote an excellent history of the Third South Carolina Infantry, his narrative puts the reader right in the action of the battles the Third SC fought in, the daily camp life the soldiers endured, and of course the unfortunate phases of the diseases that swept thru the regiment and cause much sickness and death of the men of South Carolina.Of the 1343 soldiers in the regiment 298 were killed in battle from 1861-1865, 298 died of disease, 697  survived combat wounds, 110 men transferred to other units during the war.The author also provides many photos of the officers and men of the regiment, maps, illustrations of the battles the Third SC fought in, and the end chapters provide an excellent muster of the regiment, great footnotes and author's notes.This is a great book about this hard fighting regiment from South Carolina, it is an interesting read that is not bogged down in mundane details, and keeps the reader interested from the first pages to the end of the book.  Highly recommended to anyone interested in the history of South Carolina during the Civil War, South Carolina Infantry Regiments during the war, the Army of Northern Virginia, and Confederate History.  A great read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T24XD7C8KKUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0963213784#wasThisHelpful","R2T24XD7C8KKUY","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Duty Bound: The Hyatt Brothers and Confederates of the Third Arkansas Infantry Regiment, Army of Northern Virginia, C.S.A."" by Van Hawkins (Arkansas University Press, 2011, 158 pages) is the letters from three brothers of Company C of the Third Arkansas Infantry Regiment to their parents.  The three brothers, Benjamin, Elijah, and Robert enlisted in the Third Arkansas in 1861 and described their life as a Confederate Infantry Soldier in the regiment.  The brothers wrote a total of 70 letters home addressed to their parents and gave a valuable view of day-to-day existence in the regiment in addition to the chaotic and gruesome battles they participated in.Benjamin's (Ben) letters display an intense passion for the cause he believed in, he also has great detail and insight into the various important leaders he fought under in the Army of Northern Virginia.  These are important letters in Civil War history because the Third Arkansas Infantry Regiment is the only regiment from Arkansas who fought in the Army of Northern Virginia under the leadership of General Robert E. Lee.  Also included in this great read are letters from other soldiers in the regiment.  The letters date from 1860 to 1865 and begin while Ben was attending law school at what would become the University of Mississippi.  Ben would describe the camp life and the battles he fought in until his death at the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863.  Elijah's letters started on August 9, 1861 to September 14, 1862, just three days before he died in the Battle of Sharpsburg (Antietam) where he received mortal wounds.  Thomas would be wounded at the Battle of Mufressboro in 1862, and after his recovery, he would be captured at the Battle of Jonesboro and would remain a POW until his parole in June of 1865.Throughout the book, the author gives the history of the regiment as they fought in the ANV.  He gives a brief but excellent history of the various battles the Third Arkansas Infantry fought in under the great command of Colonel Van Manning.  Mr. Hawkins also gives excerpts of the letters the Hyatt brothers wrote, great photographs of the various documents from the Ordinance of Secession that Arkansas delivered, photographs of the officers of the regiment, after battle photos, illustrations of the time, and also good endnotes.  At the end of the book is a muster of Company C of the Third Arkansas and a brief history of the soldiers of Company C.This is a valuable book due to the scarcity of published material of the Third Arkansas Infantry.  There is only one other book that I know of that is solely about the Third Arkansas and that is Calvin L.Collier's classic book ""They Do To Tie To!: The Story of The Third Arkansas Infantry C.S.A."", which was published in 1959.The Third Arkansas Infantry as a part of the famous Hood's Texas Brigade was known for their bravery and tenacity in battle.  During the Battle of Gettysburg, the Third Arkansas with their ""brother regiment"", the First Texas Infantry helped take Devil's Den in the late afternoon of July 2nd, 1863 with many casualties.  At Gettysburg and other battles, the Third Arkansas fought fiercely and with the other Texas Regiments were part of General Robert E. Lee's ""shock troops"" which he would send in charging first into the Union lines to break up their infantry lines.There is not nearly as much published history about the Third Arkansas Infantry as compared to other Confederate Regiments in the Army of Northern Virginia, and this great read helps add to the history of the brave regiment from Arkansas that fought in the Army of Northern Virginia.  It is a great all around read and history, from the letters of the Hyatt Brothers, the letters of other soldiers of Company C.  The book has excellent photos that help enhance the history of the regiment, and as stated good footnotes and the muster of the men of Company C of The Third Arkansas Infantry.The author of Duty Bound, Van Hawkins did excellent research, editing, and overall fascinating history of the Third Arkansas and it is highly recommended to any Civil War scholar, student, and enthusiast who is interested in Arkansas Civil War History, Army of Northern Virginia History, Confederate Military History, and history of Hood's Texas Brigade during the Civil War.  Again, this is a great read that I highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XWMUF5K19FBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007AKCI3U#wasThisHelpful","R1XWMUF5K19FBI","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Ships of The Civil War 1861-1865: An Illustrated Guide To The Fighting Vessels Of The Union And The Confederacy"" by Kevin J. Dougherty is an excellent resource for anyone interested in the fighting ships of both the Union and Confederate Navies during the Civil War.  At 224 pages, the brief history of the vessels and outstanding illustrations of the ships tell the amazing stories of many of the famous and not so famous vessels that patroled the coastlines, rivers, and open seas during the Civil War.  Many of the ships in this book were overhauled and adapted to become fighting vessels.  Included in the book are the Ironclads, Gunboats, Raiders, Cruisers, Blockade Runners, and Submarines.  It was both the Union and Confederate Navies that helped ""modernize"" vessels and the world had to take notice.  Such famous vessles and the CSS Merrimack and the USS Monitor are highlighted, including their famous battle, the Confederate Dreadnaught the CSS Abelmarle which became the victim of what some consider the ""first Navy Commando/SEAL"" Lt. William Cushing who with a 12 man crew sunk her.Other brief histories are about the Blockade Runners (invaluable assistance in bringing supplies to the Confederacy), gunboats (which helped secure the Mississippi River for the Union), sailing ""man of wars"" including the CSS Alabama, and other great vessels of the time.The illustrations of the vessels are truly excellent and enhance the reading of the history of the vessels.  A brief but fascinating read in the beginning give the historical overview of the naval war between the Union and the Confederacy and the stratigies used by the navies is provided.Only a few vessels survive today as museum displays, but after reading this fascinating book and with the outstanding illustrations it is easy for the reader to understand how important both the Union and Confederate Navies were during the four years of hte Civil War.  Highly recommended for anyone intersted in Civil War Naval History, American Naval History, and Union and Confederate Naval Strategy from 1861 to 1865.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S2DWYBI52YCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1909160679#wasThisHelpful","R2S2DWYBI52YCH","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Marshall Guards: Harrison (Texas) County's Contribution to Hood's Texas Brigade by Colonel Harold B. Simpson (USAF Ret),  (Port Caddo Press, 1967, 26 pages) is the history of Marshall County Texas soldiers who fought in the First Texas Infantry (Company E) as part of the famed Hood's Texas Brigade fighting primarily in the Eastern Theater of the Civil War as a part of the Army of Northern Virginia.This limited release book (only 50 copies), is based on a lecture that Colonel Simpson presented in 1965 to the Harrison County Historical Society and the Colonels lecture was later expanded and published in a very limited release of 50 copies.  The men of Marshall  County Texas would hear the call of Texas and the Confederacy in 1861 and join the Confederate Army.  The men of Texas in Hood's Brigade were raised in 26 counties located in East Central and Southeast Texas.  The men from Harrison county would be known as the ""Marshall Guards"" and later would be designated as Company E in the First Texas Infantry.  The soldiers of Company E were originally trained under the experience eye of Frederick S. Bass, a former instructor in military tactics at Marshall University.  A short while later, the company was sent to Virginia and organized as a regiment in later what would be known as ""Hood's Texas Brigade"".The original strength of the company was four officers, eight non-commissioned officers, one ensign or flag bearer, and 55 enlisted men for an overall strength of 68 men. The company as with the rest of Hood's Texas Brigade fought in 38 battles and skirmishes including the battles of Gaines' Mill, Second Manassas (Bull Run), Sharpsburg (Antietam), Gettysburg, Chickamauga, and the Wilderness.The company lost the most men in battle at Manassas where the First Texas would suffer 82.3% casualites.  At Gettysburg the company would lose 8 men.  During the war the Bass Company (in Company E) had an overall rate of 53% casualties which included 15 killed, 40 wounded and nine either missing or POW.These men endured the hardships of severe winters, disease, battle casualties, starvation and other terrible things endured by the Civil War soldier.  However, the men of Hood's Texas Brigade were always known as fierce in battle, shock troops that General Robert E. Lee always depended on in ""tight situations"" as he called them.  At the Battle of The Wilderness it was the men of Hood's Brigade who led General Lee back to safety of his lines as he wanted to lead the Texans and other regiments in the ANV into charging the Union lines.  General Lee would say ""Texans always move them!"".  A great tribute to the men of Company E, and the rest of Hood's Texas Brigade.This is a brief read about this great company from Marshall, Texas who fought valiantly in the War Between the States.  Colonel Simpson who was the modern historian of Hood's Texas Brigade did a great tribute to Harrison County, Texas by publishing this great read.  It is a Very Rare book that is expensive, however it is a valuable history to anyone who is interested in Hood's Texas Brigade, the Army of Northern Virginia, Confederate Military History, Texas History, and Civil War History.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20V1CPKAS0ZVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007ENQ5A#wasThisHelpful","R20V1CPKAS0ZVU","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Reminiscences of the Boys in Gray 1861-1865"" and originally published in 1912 is the outstanding compilation of the Texas Confederate Civil War veterans who were interviewed, wrote letters to the editor Mamie Yeary who took 3 years to conduct interviews, receive letters from hundreds of veterans who fought and survived the Civil War. These men had various and fascinating experiences of their service in the Confederate Army and Navy and wrote either a few lines or up to 3 or 4 pages describing what camp life was like, battles that were harrowing, and their views of the officers and men that they served with.  From the eastern theater of the Civil War fighting in the Army of Northern Virginia under General Robert E. Lee to serving in the far flung western posts in Texas, the Trans-Mississippi, the Army of  Tennessee and other places, all these veterans described their actions.  In each of the histories the men told where they were born, the regiment, company and brigades they were under, and where they currently lived.These soldiers accounts of the battles they were in is fascinating and a harrowing read, seeing their friends, fellow soldiers, and the leaders of their regiments being wounded and killed in battle is sobering.  Some of the soldiers were captured and sent to Union POW camps and their survival was also a sobering read.  Their views of why they fought for Texas and the Confederacy provides a valuable insight to their beliefs of the Confederacy and Texas.The book is a LARGE volume of work.  Originally printed in 1912, and reprinted in 2003 by Morningside Publications it is 902 fascinating pages long.From Generals to the Privates all these men in this outstanding and historical publication provide a VALUABLE insight to the experience not only of the men from Texas but the Confederate Soldier who fought in the War Between the States.What makes this even a more amazing read is that these interviews and letters took place almost 50 years after the war.  Yet almost every soldiers memories is detailed clearly.  It is true that being in a battle and the emotions and memories are always there and these men never forgot.  Skirmishes to the large battles such as Gettysburg, Chickamauga, Shiloh, Manassas, Pea Ridge, Mansfield, Iuka, Glorietta Pass, Galveston, Vicksburg, Perryville, and many, many more battles the Texans fought in and their memories of these battles are in this great book by Mamie Yeary.This is one of the most valuable books not only of Texas Confederate History and Confederate History but of Civil War History in existence.  I highly recommend that any true Civil War scholar, author, student, ""arm chair general"" should have this in their library.  This is an important work of American history and Texas History.  It is a somewhat rare volume that is usually over $100.00 and is mainly sold by secondary booksellers, yet if you want to add a treasured and important Civil War book to use as a reference than this is the book.One of the most important volumes of Civil War History in my opinion ever published and HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28B8791DGKIFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9333108173#wasThisHelpful","R28B8791DGKIFV","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Life of Robert Hall"" is an outstanding book about the life of this true Texas pioneer, soldier, and observer of Texas in its early years.  Edited by ""Brazos"", Hall penned his autobiography in later years and his life was definitely a fascinating and valuable one for the Republic and later the great Lone Star State.Born in South Carolina, in 1814, as a boy Hall and his family moved to Tennessee where he grew up and became close friends with legendary Davy Crockett..  He led an exciting young life and traveled up and down the Mississippi River delivering cargo and goods to famous ports along the river.  After hearing about the brave Texans and their independence from Mexico Hall and some of his friends traveled to Texas but arrived to late to help with the Alamo and arrived in Texas shortly after the Battle of San Jacinto.  He became a close friend to General Sam Houston and married into the prominent King family of Gonzales County.  He became noted for his bravery, chivalry, and tenacity against friends and foe alike and wrote a fascinating account of his actions in the Mexican War.  Hall's account of such battles as Monterrey, and Buena Vista are a valuable history to those who want to know more about the battles of the Mexican War.  He also participated as a Texas Ranger against the fierce Comanche Raids to were a common occurrence in Young Texas. His first hand accounts of expeditions such as the one that fought at Plum Creek are ""gritty and intense"".He considered such men as good friends, Sam Houston, Ed Burleson, Paint Caldwell, Ben and Henry McCulloch, ""Big Foot"" Wallace and Jack Hays.  Talk about knowing some interesting and famous men of Texas and U.S. History!Hall's was against slavery and secession, and thought that Texas should of remained in the Union, though he came to fight and defend Texas in the 36th Texas Cavalry CSA.  After the Civil War, Hall became a famous man throughout Texas and many came to hear his great stories and history of the early Republic and later U.S. state of Texas.  He died in 1899 in Cotulla, Texas and is buried in Belmont, Texas.The original publication of this book published in 1898 is an extremely rare and valuable book.  It is amazing that Robert Hall is not famous in Texas history.  This brave soldier and leader became a prominent and valuable figure in the early years of Texas.  He was a brave soldier and leader and many of Texas's leaders came to rely on Hall in tough situations.  He rescued women and children from the Comanches, fought bravely in the Mexican War and later the Civil War. He has a secure place in the pantheon of Texas heroes where he belongs.  Hopefully, in time he will become more famous among historians, students, and classrooms that teach Texas history.  This great biography of Robert Hall is highly recommended to anyone interested in U.S. and Texas history, Mexican War history, Indian War history, Confederate and Civil War history.  A great read of a truly great man and leader of Texas!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MK7Y8KZ65IBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0938349902#wasThisHelpful","R3MK7Y8KZ65IBS","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Early Days In Texas: A Trip to Hell and Heaven"" by Jim McIntire and edited by Robert K. DeArment (published in 1992, 184 pages) is a autobiography of this interesting Texan as he relates his life and adventures in the mid to late 1800's in Texas and other frontier states.The editor quickly warns the reader that Jim McIntire enjoyed telling ""tall tales"" of his life and experiences and to take his autobiography with ""a grain of salt"".  Jim McIntire was born in Ohio but as a youth traveled to Texas to experience the frontier and cowboy life he read about in 10 cent novels.  As a youth in Ohio, McIntire became a leader of a black ""minstrel show"" that travelled through Ohio and had some funny yet dangerous adventures.  After being bored with this, he traveled to Texas where he became a cattle driver, Indian fighter, Texas Ranger, saloon keeper, gambler, card dealer, an outlaw, and many more occupations.  His descriptions of fighting the Comanches and Kiowas is a thrilling adventure and gruesome.  Having no love for the Indians, Hispanics (he calls them greasers), and blacks (liberally using the ""n"" word), that are in Texas and he shows no mercy or understanding when they are breaking the law, according to McIntire.His stories of dealing with notorious Sam Bass, meeting Billy the Kid, Pat Garrett, and other famous western figures make a great read.  Eventually, McIntire would run afoul of the law and became a notorious outlaw himself, bragging about the men he had killed along the way.  His description of frontier Texas gives an excellent window into the frontier life of Texas small towns and ranches.Jim McIntire did a lot in his life, and it is amazing (if true) that he survived any of the encounters and circumstances that he was in.  As Larry D. Ball (Professor of History at Arkansas State University) says on the back cover, ""The representation of this little volume constitutes a very worthwhile service to the readership in frontier studies.  While Jim McIntire is not always honest with his readers, he provides entree into the shadowy frontier underworld and the calloused and brutal nature of the Indian wars."" The editor's annotations are very full and informative and give a truthful version of the circumstances that McIntire described. Jim Mcintire was the kind of cowboy that would be great to listen to at a campfire and being captivated by his stories.  You wouldn't know which stories are true or not, however, one thing you wouldn't want to do is call him out on his stories and say he was a ""liar"".  Jim McIntire was good with a gun and would probably shoot you between the eyes, or thrash you to within an inch of your life for calling him out.  I would enjoy listening to his stories of being an outlaw, saloon keeper, and Texas Ranger, but always wonder which ones were true, which stories were exaggerated, or which stores are just tall tales.All in all this is a good read about early frontier Texas and is enjoyable to read and think about how life in frontier Texas was tough, and made the Lone Star state truly a unique and distinct place to live.

"""Florida In The Civil War"" by authors Lewis N. Wynne and Robert Taylor (published 2002, 160 pages) is an excellent but brief overview of the history of Florida's participation in the Civil War as a state in the Confederate States of America.  The authors attempted to give the overview in both word and images the soldiers, leaders, officials, and citizens of Florida during the four years of the war from 1861 to 1865.Less than 20 years after joining the United States, Florida became the third state to secede and join the CSA in 1861.  The coastline of Florida was prized for import and export of goods and both Richmond and Washington D.C. vied for control of the coastline.  Naval blockades by the Union Navy became effective in stopping vital supplies throughout the Confederacy.  A few forts remained in Union control throughout the war.Florida sent many brave men, t(over 15000),though not as much to fight due to the population in both the Army of Northern Virginia, and the Trans-Mississippi theater of the war, and the authors do a good job of giving the history of the Florida Regiments in both theaters of the war. From Shiloh and Chickamauga in the west to Antietam and Gettysburg in the east, the hard fought battles decimated the Florida soldiers and caused much anguish to loved ones back home.The average citizens of Florida, women, Seminoles, Hispanics, and not to forget slaves, shouldered the tremendous burden and hardship of keeping enough food to eat, keep their property and land, and survive day to day.  Both authors give a tribute in the chapters to the Florida home front.More than a few battles were fought in Florida between the Union and Confederate Regiments, yet at the end of the war the Florida capital of Tallahassee was still the only state capital east of the Mississippi River to escape Union occupation during the war.The chapters of the books are:Chapter 1 - Seven Days of DestinyChapter 2 - The War BeginsChapter 3 - On Distant Fields: The Army of Northern VirginiaChapter 4 - On Distant Fields: The Western TheaterChapter 5 - Inside the Confederate StorehouseChapter 6 - Enduring the BlockadeChapter 7- Florida's War on the Home FrontChapter 8 - A Not-So-United Florida: UnionistsChapter 9 - Battles in Civil War FloridaChapter 10 - Florida in the Reconstruction EraEpilogue: The Controversy ContinuesSelected Bibliography and IndexFlorida's contribution to the Confederacy was outstanding, yet many of today's society does not know that the men of Florida fought in the Civil War and were part of the Confederacy.  Hopefully, due to this excellent book and more about Civil War Florida, more will know the contributions of Florida and the sacrifices made both in battle and the home front of the men and women of the ""Sunshine State"".  This is a great read recommended for those interested in Florida history, Confederate and U.S. History, battles the regiments from Florida fought in the Eastern and Western theaters of the War and Civil War history in general.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P59WJEW9XL92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738514918#wasThisHelpful","R1P59WJEW9XL92","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Texas Volunteers In The Mexican War"" by Henry W. Barton is a straightforward logistical account of the service of the soldiers from Texas who volunteered to fight in the war with Mexico.  Published in 1970 by Texian Press, this is a study to show how that volunteer system worked in a new state far away from Washington D.C., was able to muster Texans in a volunteer army and in a military sense what Texas did during the Mexican War of 1846-1848.Mr. Barton, skips the military combat that the Texans fought in battle, but gives a logistical history of the men, units, movements, and official correspondence between the leaders of the Texans such as Ben McCullough, Albert Sidney Johnston, and how they assumed authority over the regiments.Mr. Barton shows how these troop units were volunteers requisitioned by each of three levels, but ill coordinated levels  of federal authority under a volunteer system which had grown ""empirically"" from the militia concept which was the basic thinking of the framers of the Constitution, but ill prepared and limited in the organization within the U.S. Army.Mr. Barton, succeeds in telling this based on the reports, personal correspondence, and other official documents.  He gives a detailed history of the movements of the regiments and a brief overview of the combat they went through on the border and within Mexico.If you are looking for an exciting read of the men and regiments from Texas, then this is not the book you would enjoy.  Mr. Barton, was a retired officer in the U.S. Army and this reads like an official review.  It is dry and straightforward facts.  It definitely does not read like an exciting account of the regiments and their combat actions or personal thoughts and history.  It reads like an official history of the regiments during the war and their movements.  Though it is a good resource for researchers and authors interested in the Mexican War and the Texas Regiments who participated in the war.  Mr. Barton has excellent resources and excellent footnotes and bibliography.This is recommended for those who are interested in the movements of the regiments and the controversy of how the U.S. Army and government treated these regiments from a new state within the United States.  Many of the leaders and men in this book, would later join the Confederate Army during the Civil War.  It is interesting to see where they were and their reports early in their career which would eventually lead to the Civil War less than 20 years later.Recommended to researchers, authors, and Mexican War students who want an almost official history of Texas during the Mexican War, Texas history, and U.S. Military History of the 1840's.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20GPO8CRBZMBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E7RTU8#wasThisHelpful","R20GPO8CRBZMBY","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Second Texas Infantry: From Shiloh to Vicksburg"" by Joseph E. Chance and published in 1984 (216 pages) is an outstanding book about this little known but hard fighting infantry regiment from Texas that fought in the western theater of the Civil War.  This regiment was formed from militia companies organized in Harris, Galveston, Jackson, Gonzales, and Robertson Counties of Texas.  This hard fighting regiment fought with distinction in Tennessee and Mississippi, participating in the battles of Shiloh, Corinth, Vicksburg and many minor battles and skirmishes.Under the command of John C. Moore during the battle of Shiloh, the Second Texas was in the thick of the fighting.  The regiment was on the right flank of the Confederate army in attacking Union lines.  They overran the outlying Federal camps and took part in the heavy fighting around the Hornet's Nest.  in the early afternoon, nearly 1000 troops of Union General Benjamin Prentiss' division surrendered to the Second Texas.However, there was controversy as Corps commander William J. Hardee criticized the regiment and General Moore for the ultimate Confederate defeat on the second day of the battle of Shiloh as General Hardee accused the regiment and General Moore of fleeing the battle.  General Moore responded by saying that Colonel William Rogers was in command of the regiment that day while General Moore commanded the brigade.  Moore also noted that the chain of command was not followed, and that several officers of Hardee's staff shouted for the soldiers to fall back during the battle.  Such accusations and counter accusations would be written about and spoken about by both officers years after the war was over.The Second Texas was also at Vicksburg and surrendered to forces under U.S. Grant after Union forces besieged the city for several months.  However, during the siege the regiment was noted for repulsing back Union charges into Confederate defenses.The Second Texas was furloughed to Texas as paroled prisoners of war. After being exchanged in November 1863, the regiment was reassembled at Camp Bee and placed under Gen. John B. Magruder, commander of the District of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. But the regiment, decimated by its service in Mississippi, could muster no more than a battalion of effective troops. It was never restaffed, but continued to carry the regimental designation throughout the remainder of the war. The unit was stationed in Galveston and assigned to guard the port against capture. It then participated in a last skirmish at the mouth of Caney Creek, Texas, in February 1864. Rather than surrender at the cessation of hostilities, the men mutinied in May 1865 and disbanded to return to their homes, after service distinguished by gallantry under fire and devotion to duty.Author Joseph E. Chance used many sources for this book most of the resources were out of print and some were from rare books, and thus not was well known among readers and historians of this fine Texas Regiment that served in the Confederate Army.  Manuscripts, personal letters, official reports and other documents are in the final chapters and appendixes.Mr. Chance also has photographs of the soldiers of the regiment and the locations of where they served.  This is a great book about the history of this brave regiment that is little well known and is a fine and important read to anyone interested in the western theater of the Civil War (Trans-Mississippi), Confederate history, Texas history, Civil War history.  It is a fine read that is highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D54FBWBLY0MB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1571680217#wasThisHelpful","R1D54FBWBLY0MB","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""No Tears For The General"" The life of Alfred Sully, 1821-1879"" is the history of the Union General based on his letters to his family, and published by his grandson Langdon Sully in 1974.  The editor, who received a crate of letters of the general from a family member was able to piece together the history of the general from a young cadet at West Point to his final day as an officer in the Union Army during the Indian Wars of the 1870's.In this great read, the author was able to piece together the history of his grandfather and his military career by putting together in chronological order the letters he wrote mainly to his sister in Philadelphia.  He came from an artistic family, his father Thomas was a famous painter at the time, and Alfred himself would send back many drawings and paintings of his life in California, the Great Plains, Native American Tribes, and other landscapes and people throughout his life.The young officer after graduating from West Point in 1841, saw service in the Mexican War and then was transferred to California before it became a state.  While in California, then Lt. Sully made keen observations of life in a Spanish-California town, commenting on both the good and bad of the population that made up California and its customs.  Being stationed at various forts in California, his accurate observations of the customs of the Spanish in California, Native Americans, and others in California, are things I never knew before about life in the western U.S.  While in California the young officer fell in love with a daughter of a prominent Spanish-California family and eloped with her.  She being 15 at the time and he several years older cause quite a stir with her family.  Unfortunately, not long after she gave birth to their son, she would die from either food poisoning, or another ailment, and the baby would die a month after his mother.After the death of his wife and son, Lt. Sully became a changed man, no longer able to look at life and love the same way, the officer devoted his time and thinking of being the best officer in the U.S. Army he could be.  Not an easy task, the army before the Civil War was mainly a huge mess, with many officers being promoted due to political influences.  Both the enlisted and officers according to Lt. Sully were either drunks, gamblers, scam artists, and other unfavorable behavior.  Though Lt. Sully did partake in drink, he never gambled and never became a drunk.  For a brief time he was sent to Europe as an envoy to different countries.  Once back in the U.S., he went west to the great plains and helped establish and build forts in the Nebraska Territory.  This was a hard and miserable endeavor since many of the forts were abandoned and no supplies, hostile climate and land, Indian uprisings, and many other bad circumstances were happening.  However, Lt. Sully (promoted to Captain but he didn't know it then), concentrated on re-establishing and rebuilding abandoned forts, and make life easier day-by-day.  As part of his duties involved being a supply officer, he did his job honestly and professionally and didn't take any bribes or offer any.  This is notable since he would say that pay was terrible and the army was being ignored by the government.As the Civil War started in 1861, Captain Sully went back east and eventually became the commanding officer of the 1st Minnesota Infantry Regiment.  Due to his connections with General George McClellan, and his ability, Sully quickly rose in ranks and became a Brigadier General.  A good general of the regiment he was in many of the early battles of the Civil War up to Fredericksburg.  General Sully was very critical of the officers who were not in the army before the war, but were made high ranking officers due to political connections.  He had no use for those type of men who had no experience in the military.He was then transferred back west and became well-known as an Indian fighter whenever the Sioux or other tribes would uprise.  He was always sympathetic to the Native-Americans, but was harsh in punishment when he felt they deserved it.  Not without controversy, many thought him to be ""cold as steel"" and ""distant"" when dealing with both soldiers and Indians.  After being reduced in ranks after the war (many promotions were breveted), Sully ultimately became a Colonel again in the post war army and died in 1879.Langdon Sully did an excellent job in editing his grandfathers letters, sketches and drawings which are plentiful in the book and enhance his grandfathers story.  General Sully was an honest man who was devoted to his family and his military career.  His grandson doesn't flinch in criticism at times of his grandfathers behavior and attitude, however, the general suffered great tragedies in his life which would alter anyone.This is an excellent history of the pre-Civil War officers serving in the U.S. Army, an excellent history of Spanish California and their customs and cities, an excellent history of life in the army serving in the Great Plains and observations of Native-American life, and great Civil War and Indian War history.This is an excellent read and a great tribute to this Civil War General and career officer and is highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HSUFPSL6AN4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0910118337#wasThisHelpful","R3HSUFPSL6AN4H","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""One of Cleburne's Command: The Civil War Reminiscences And Diary of Captain Samuel T. Foster, Granbury's Texas Brigade, CSA is the diary of Captain Foster and his service in the western theater of the Civil War.  Captain Foster was a member of the 24th Texas Cavalry (dismounted) in Granbury's Texas Brigade. As part of this hard fighting Texas Brigade, it drew high praise from General Patrick Cleburne who called the Texans ""a band of heroes.""Captain Foster gives fascinating and well written descriptions of everyday army life fighting both on horse then on foot.  His details of the battle of Arkansas Post in 1863, when the Fort surrendered and he became a prisoner of war is riveting.  His account of being a prisoner of war gives details that I didn't know such as officers who were captured were allowed to keep their Confederate money (up to $100) and use it in the ""settlers store"" to by meager supplies that enlisted men were not afforded.  Ultimately Captain Foster was exchanged and sent via boat and railroad to Richmond, Virginia where he not only saw his brother (a soldier in Hood's Texas Brigade), but caught up with his unit (where he learned he was promoted to Captain while as a prisoner).  Captain Foster also gives his accounts of the battles from Chickamauga to Franklin.  In this diary and memories Captain Foster relates his experiences of daily camp life and the daily descriptions of the Atlanta Campaign of 1864 describing the ""everlasting firing"" and the Federal assaults and the Confederate counterattacks.He was wounded three times during the war and accompanied the remnants of his regiment and brigade when it surrendered on April 26, 1865 under General Joseph E. Johnston.  After the war Captain Foster returned to Texas and let a highly productive life serving in various posts under the U.S. Government.  He died on January 8, 1919 and is buried in Laredo, Texas.Editor Norman D. Brown did an outstanding job of editing Captain Foster's diary and gave outstanding footnotes and endnotes which describe the battles, movements, commanding officers, and other important historical points throughout this book and that helps the reader TREMENDOUSLY in understanding what Captain Foster was describing in his diary and the events that took place around him.This is a top notch read that is a valuable addition to the history of the western theater/trans-Mississippi area of the Civil War.  Granbury's Brigade under Hiram Granbury was noted for its bravery in battle and fighting spirit, yet for many years the history of the brigade was not well known.

"""Confederates of Chappell Hill, Texas: Prosperity, Civil War and Decline"" by Stephen Chicoine is a fascinating ""snapshot"" of a southeastern Texas town that was a prosperous antebellum center due to cotton and proximity of the Brazos River that connected the town to Galveston thus cotton and other cargo could be transferred back and forth to the Texas coast and shipped nationally and internationally.  Many of the men in Chappell Hill were active in the Texas Revolution and Mexican War and were known statewide and nationally.During the 1850's cotton planters from other southern states moved and settled in the Chappell Hill area and began to flourish economically and socially.  Chappell Hill would turn from a small frontier Texas town to a town that modeled the prosperous medium towns of the antebellum south.  The planters would also bring their slaves with them to work the plantation fields.  Slaves would make up 30% of the population of Texas before the Civil War.  With plantations and prosperity, owners of plantations and other prominent officials looked warily towards national events in the eastern United States when abolitionists and other forces gained in power and influence from the Union.  Men in Texas would enlist in the infantry, cavalry, and artillery regiments.  Chappell Hill would answer the call from Austin and Richmond and many of her sons enlisted in regiments that fought in the eastern and western theater of the Civil War.The soldiers from Chappell Hill jsuch as Daniel H. Browning, William Browning joined such famous regiments such as Terry's Texas Rangers.  Other soldiers such as William C. Chappell and A. J. Robertson would join Sibley's Brigade and be in the famous New Mexico expedition.  Other soldiers such as Rufus King Felder and his cousin Miers M. Felder joined the famous Hood's Texas Brigade, many other men from Chappell Hill joined various regiments from Texas and would fight in various battles throughout the war.Through letters home these men would describe their daily camp life, fierce battles, and the heavy toll of disease that ravaged many regiments.  Mr. Chicoine also described the suffering that slowly but surely as the war progress would inflict on Chappell Hill.  The shipping of cotton to Galveston would stop, imports and exports of goods would be strangled, and the town felt the effects of the war keenly.Many of the men from Chappell Hill who would join the army of the Confederacy never returned home, and those that did return were different than when they were the ""eager recruits"" in 1861.  After the war, reconstruction and other U.S. policies changed the town in various ways.  A vicious case of Yellow Fever swept through the town, poverty became a common place. Chappell Hill was no different than other southern towns who found the reconstruction policies difficult.  Many who were rich before the Civil War found that after the war, that their fortunes were forever lost and had to adjust to just make a living in order to survive.  The veterans of the armies of the Confederacies began to hold reunions and meet with their old comrades and talk about prior victories in the war as well as losses on the battlefield.  Eventually, Chappell Hill would become ""normal"" again and many of the sons and grandsons of the Confederate soldiers enlisted in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines and fight for the Stars and Stripes.  Fourth of July parades would become a yearly event and the town celebrated, but many would always remember that for four years they were a proud part of the Confederate States of America.The author has done an excellent job of giving the history of this southeastern Texas town and how the War Between the States affected this town and the men and women who lived, fought, and in many cases died in the causes they believed in.  This is an excellent book that is recommended to anyone interested in Civil War and Confederate History, Texas History, Civil War Texas History, and the socio-economic effects of the Civil War to a southern antebellum and post-Civil War reconstruction town","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QDDJ95ZUGF5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786419822#wasThisHelpful","R2QDDJ95ZUGF5S","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Daniel's Battery: The 9th Texas Field Battery"" by John D. Perkins is the history of this Texas Artillery Battery commonly known as Daniel's Battery in honor of Captain James M. Daniel the first commanding officer of the battery.  This short read at 100 pages including the appendix's, bibliography, footnotes, and index is the history of this unit as it fought in the Trans-Mississippi Department of the Civil War.  Formed in the spring of 1862, the battery left Texas marching to Nelson, Arkansas where it became a unit of the famous Walker's Texas Division.  In 1863, it was a part of the expedition that failed to relieve Vicksburg.  Later in 1863, the battery saw action at the Battle of Bayou Bourbeau and shelled Union gunboats on the Mississippi River.In 1864, the battery was involved in the two-day battles of Mansfield and Pleasant Hill., and directly was involved in presenting the invasion of Texas by the Union army during the Red River Campaign.The author John D. Perkins also gives the background of the officers and enlisted that made up Daniel's Battery.  Using a wide variety of resources, the author examines the socio-economic make up of the battery and compares it to other Confederate Units.  Mr. Perkins also notes that the men of Daniel's Battery were mainly from Lamar County in Northeast Texas and though the county voted against secession in 1861, when the Confederacy needed soldiers, Lamar County answered the call and the men formed the 9th Texas Field Battery and other units in the Confederate Infantry, Artillery, and Cavalry.The men in Daniel's Battery were of various ages from 16 years of age to 50 years of age with the average age of 27.5 years.  They were also of a lower economic class and most of the men never owned slaves.  These are the soldiers that when Texas seceded from the Union and joined the Confederacy, the men went with their state and defended Texas against invasion.Mr. Perkins tells more about the individual soldiers and what their life was in Daniel's Battery than the few battles the unit participated in.  Disease cost more lives than combat in the battery as sanitary conditions were terrible as with other units throughout the Civil War.The author also provides information about the pre-war occupations of the battery members, their wealth, slaveholders and also addresses the debated issue that the war was ""a rich man's war but a poor-mans fight"".  Overall, the authors opinion is that most of the men were of the poorer class, and the wide majority didn't own slaves, but fought for their state and newly formed country to defend against invasion from the Federal forces and to defend their own individual and states rights.The battery overall was not in many battles, but when the battery was involved in fighting, they did so effectively.This is a short history of the unit because there was not many resources available to the author.  The Trans-Mississippi theater of the Civil War was not as well documented as the eastern theater of the Civil War, especially the regiments that fought from Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana.I commend the author for writing and giving the history of this artillery battery from Texas that is not well known. ""Daniels Battery: The 9th Texas Field Battery"" adds valuable history to the Trans-Mississippi theater of the Civil War and helps fill in the gaps of history about artillery units in the Trans-Mississippi theater.  It is recommended to scholars, students, and ""arm chair"" historians wanting to know more about Texas units in the Civil War, Texas history, Confederate History, the Trans-Mississippi theater of the Civil War, and Civil War history overall.  A good read!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SB07QAZGH5YJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=091217238X#wasThisHelpful","R3SB07QAZGH5YJ","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Civil War Letters of General Frank ""Bull"" Paxton, CSA, A Lieutenant of Lee and Jackson, are the war time letters of this great general of the legendary ""Stonewall Brigade"" and his wife.  General Frank ""Bull"" Paxton, a good and honest man who rose up in the ranks in the early part of the Civil War was born in Rockbridge County, Virginia in 1828, and was also cousin to Texas General and Governor Sam Houston.  After graduating from Washington College (later renamed Washington and Lee), Yale University and the University of Virginia Law School, he was a land speculator in Ohio.  He returned to Virginia in 1854 and opened a law office in Lexington and became a good friend to Thomas J. (Stonewall) Jackson.Bull Paxton was an ardent secessionist and when the war started he was elected a lieutenant in the ""Rockbridge Rifles"" (later Company B, 5th Virginia Infantry Regiment).  Fighting at First Bull Run (Manassas) he rose in the ranks to be a part of General Jackson's staff and was later appointed as Major in the 7th Virginia Infantry Regiment.  Later he became Chief of Staff for General Jackson.  Recommended by Jackson, Paxton later was appointed as Brigadier General.  He was killed on May 3, 1863 leading his regiment at the Battle of Chancellorsville.In this book, edited by his son, General Paxton wrote loving letters to his wife of his convictions of loving his state (Virginia) and swearing fidelity to his new country (Confederate States of America), he believed strongly that the United States Constitution allowed individual states to secede and he believed this at an early age.  General Paxton was a strong Christian Gentleman who was always a kind and thoughtful man admired by his soldiers, peers, and the leaders of the Army of Northern Virginia.  To be recommended as Brigadier General by Stonewall Jackson, shows the character and beliefs of this great gentleman from Virginia.  He expresses his thoughts in great spirit and conviction to his wife and children and he has an excellent prose in expressing his beliefs, the everyday life as an officer in the Army of Northern Virginia, the brief descriptions of his actions in battle, and his thoughts of his men and superiors.  This General was a good man and had a premonition of death, telling one of his officers that he would die in battle the next day.Years after the war, General Paxton's son John Gallantin Paxton would collect his father's letters and privately publish them.  General Paxton's grandson Dick Paxton, submitted the privately published book about his grandfather to Hill College Press, the great publishing press of Civil War books, and this excellent book was first published in 1978.  The introduction of the book is by the famous modern historian of Hood's Texas Brigade, the late Colonel Harold B. Simpson (USAF Ret), and introduces the life of General Paxton in fascinating prose.In the closing chapters of this short read (102 pages), the official correspondence of General Paxton's death is given as well as the official correspondence of General Paxton to his superiors (General Jackson and General Lee).This is an excellent book of this great general.  Reading this has given this reader a greater insight of the life of a General in the famous Stonewall Brigade, why he fought against his former country, and his religious beliefs.  This was a man who loved his family, his fellow soldiers, and he was a great leader of men who died as so many other soldiers did, way to young and had so much more leadership and inspiration to give his men.  Thus is the tragedy of war.A great read that is highly recommended to anyone interested in the Army of Northern Virginia, the Stonewall Brigade, the eastern theater of the Civil War, and Civil War history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XFT3GHD2KT3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0912172231#wasThisHelpful","R2XFT3GHD2KT3C","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""War Years, C.S.A., 12 Mississippi Regiment Major S. H. Giles,Q.M. Original Letters, 1860 -1865 edited by Shepherd Brown, is the war letters of his great grandfather who was the quartermaster of the regiment.  In the letters Major Giles who wrote to his wife, gave the descriptions of the supplies the regiment needed and ordered as they marched and fought the Union Army in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina.  While the letters do not provide much about the details of the battles the regiment fought in, it does give an interesting account of what was needed to supply the regiment as an effective fighting unit.  Major Giles letters to hiswife, daughter, Confederate officials, list the officers and men who were in the 12th Miss Regiment, the supplies the regiment needed and used, general orders issued to and from the regiment, a few newspaper articles published about the regiment, personal letters to Major Giles wife and loved ones and other interesting facts that give an overall picture of what was used and needed by a Confederate regiment that fought in the western theater of the Civil War.This is a book that I recommend to a researcher of the War Between the States who is interested in the everyday life of a Confederate Regiment and the items that were needed to supply the unit as an effective combat regiment.  It is also valuable to anyone interested in knowing more about the quartermaster details and paperwork that was done between a regiment and headquarters in the field.It is a book that is not ""action filled"", but that is fine, the editor and author Mr. Brown used his great grandfather's letters to complete a history of his service for the Confederacy.  It is a great tribute to his great grandfather.  The letters Major GIles wrote to his wife are tender and descriptive of camp life, observations of soldiers in the regiment, what the regiment ate, and what Major GIles observed in the different states the regiment was in.  The book may not hold interest in those who like to read a battlefield account of a Confederate Regiment, but it is a valuable book that gives the details of the supplies needed, the official reports a regiment filed, and the overall ""life"" of a Confederate Regiment from Mississippi.  An interesting read overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XWFIN88113I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041E3LLQ#wasThisHelpful","R2XWFIN88113I","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""'Lone Star Generals In Gray"" by Ralph A. Wooster is the biographies of Confederate Generals who were either native Texans or residents of Texas when the Civil War began in 1861 and joined the Confederate Army.  Mr. Wooster did an excellent job of telling the brief but thorough biographies of these generals and their history before, during, and after the war.From famous Confederate Generals such as Albert Sidney Johnston, John Bell Hood, Jerome Robertson to lesser known generals such as William Steele, Thomas Neville Waul, the author tells the biography of 37 of the Confederate Generals from the Lone Star State.  This fascinating book is much like the great book ""Generals In Gray"" by Ezra Warner.  However, Mr. Wooster goes more in depth in the biographies of the generals.  He reviews their life before the war and many of them had military service in such wars as the Texas Revolution, the Mexican War, and other conflicts.  Most of the generals from Texas had great military experience.Mr. Wooster also does not shy of giving criticism of the actions of the Texas generals when necessary.  Giving the balanced and impartial view, some of these generals had major flaws in character, military strategy, and inexperience.  The controversial generals from Texas such as Albert Sidney Johnston and John Bell Hood are reviewed and Mr. Wooster tells about General Johnston's albeit brief service in the Confederate Army and the opportunities General Johnston could of taken advantage of in some of the battles before his death at the Battle of Shiloh are reviewed.  Also, the controversy of John Bell Hood at Franklin is told as well.This is a fascinating read of the Generals of Texas, all 37 of them.  Most of the Generals were appointed by the Confederate Congress and President Jefferson Davis, while some of the generals were appointed but never confirmed by the Confederate Congress and President Davis for various reasons, some unknown to this day.This should be considered a ""companion book"" to Ezra Warner's ""Generals In Gray"".  It is a valuable book that can assist research into various campaigns and battles of the Civil War by the generals in the campaigns and battles.  The generals from Texas contributed to the Confederacy for the four years of the war, many of the generals are still admired for their bravery and tenacity in battle, in which more than a few died in battle.  Hiram Granbury and Tom Green just to name a few of the Texas Generals who did die in battle.  This is a HIGHLY recommended book for anyone interested in Texas history, Texas Confederate History, Civil War history and pre-Civil War history and post-Civil War history in Texas.

"""The Bugle Softly Blows"" published in 1965 by Texian Press and edited by the late Colonel Harold B. Simpson is the diary of Confederate soldier Benjamin M. Seaton of the 10th Texas Infantry.  It is a unique and valuable diary because of the rarity of the everyday life and the hard fought battles that the 10th Texas Infantry was engaged in is not widely documented.  Seaton is a unique individual in that he never mentioned his life before the Civil War in his diary, or what happened to him after the Civil War.  His diary begins on November 5, 1861 when he joins the Confederate army, and the diary ends on April 24, 1865.  Between those dates, he keeps a great account of what everyday life was for him in the regiment.  This regiment also referred to as ""Nelson's Regiment"" in honor of its original commander Allison Nelson, had a good combat record.  The 10th Texas fought in some of the most crucial campaigns and engagements of the Civil War.  It fought through the Atlanta Campaign of 1864 from Dalton to Jonesboro and Seaton's daily recordings in his diary are most thorough.His spelling is rudimentary, however the editor, the late Colonel Harold B. Simpson, the great author and editor of Hood's Texas Brigade, made an excellent glossary to enable the reader to familiarize themselves with Seaton's grammar, spelling, and word usage.  Thus the diary is published exactly as Seaton wrote it.  He used phonetic spelling at times and it is a great example of an untutored Southwestern frontiersman of the 1860's (as told in the inside fold of the book).Colonel Simpson did an outstanding job yet again as editor of this important diary of a soldier of the 10th Texas Infantry.  It is a rare book, that is a bit expensive, however, it is an important book that tells the story of this Texas Regiment and their contribution in the western theater of the Civil War.  There are many books about the Texas Regiments in Hood's Texas Brigade, and important books about the Confederate Cavalry Regiments from Texas, however, there is not that many books about Texas Regiments that fought in the western theater of the war.  Thus, this is an important book that helps tell the history of Texas Regiments that fought in the great campaigns of the Western theater of the Civil War.Benjamin Seaton's diary was clearly written with great penmanship, and it was protected through the years because of it's leather cover and folds and Colonel Simpson's was able to edit it exactly the way it was written, and he introduces the history of the regiment in the preface.  Again, as noted before this is an outstanding book that is highly recommended to anyone who wants to learn about the history of the Texas Regiments in the western theater of the Civil War, the history of the Battles in Georgia, the history of the western theater of the Civil War, everyday life in a Texas Infantry Regiment, and Civil War History.

"Civil War historian and author Eric J. Wittenberg has written an outstanding history of the famed 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment.  ""Rush's Lancers"" by Mr. Wittenberg is the history of this famous regiment made up of Philadelphia's noble sons.  The men (many from the upper crust of Philadelphia society) earned their fame for the many campaigns and battles they partook as part of the Army of the Potomac from 1862 to the end of the Civil War in 1865.  First formed during the American Revolution as part of General George Washington's personal body guard, this regiment at the beginning of the Civil War was equipped at first with antiquated weaponry such as lancers thus there name was made as Rush's Lancers named after Richard H. Rush.First going into battle in 1862, the regiment was in the thick of many engagements against the Army of Northern Virginia.  The regiment traveled many miles in Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia and was known for their bravery in battle and being highly trained and proficient in weaponry which served them well at Antietam (Sharpsburg), Gettysburg, and later in the war at Petersburg.  After the war some of the officers of the regiment went on to have great careers in the regular army.Mr. Wittenberg in his thorough research of the regiment tells of the everyday life of the Union Cavalrymen both officer and enlisted, and the tremendous sacrifice these cavalry troopers endured.  Some of the cavalrymen would die of disease that spread through many regiments, wounds received in battle, and being killed in action.  When the cavalry and infantry units of the Army of Northern Virginia faced the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry, they knew they were in for a ""tough time"" in battle.This is a complete and thorough history of the regiment from 1862 to 1865.  The author as noted before has outstanding end notes, bibliography, photos, maps, and campaign history that compliments this as an accurate and resourceful read.  This is a book that is a great tribute to the regiment and the Union Cavalry Regiments of the Army of the Potomac.  It is a must read to anyone interested in the history of the Union Cavalry of the Civil War, Army of the Potomac, and history of the Union Regiments of Pennsylvania from 1862 to 1865.

"Outstanding history of the intense fighting at Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. Mike Priest gives a fascinating account of the intensive bloody battle on the fields of Gettysburg between the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia. The author gives a time frame and location of all the fighting during the second day of the battle. Giving the soldiers and commanders history of the action. The regiments both north and south hammered away at each other all over the vicinity such as the Peach Orchard, the Round Tops, the Wheatfield and the other locations. The narrative of the action is captivating and you are right in the action of the troops that fought against each other. The author has superb end notes, citations and bibliography based on the soldiers account of the battle. It is an intense read that draws you in the battle and you feel that you are witnessing the charges, defense, artillery barrages, and the hand-to-hand fighting that took place.It took years of great research from Mike Priest to write this book based on the soldiers accounts, hundreds of personal accounts, newspaper articles, manuscripts and memoirs from the soldiers of the AoP and the ANV and Mr. Priest has woven them together to make an outstanding account of the second day of fighting at Gettysburg on July 2, 1863.Mr. Priest as noted before did an excellent job citing the resources for the book and this greatly enhances the accuracy of the soldiers accounts of the battle.I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone interested in the Battle of Gettysburg. It is a must read for the Civil War scholar, student, and historian and compliments the top books about the battle from the notable authors of the battle such as Coddington, Pfanz, Mingus, Petruzzi, Coco, and Wittenburg and other fine authors.Mike Priest is called the ""Ernie Pyle of the Civil War"" by noted National Park Historian Emeritus Ed Bearss. After reading this fine book and the other great books by Mike Priest I definitely agree with Mr. Bearss. A truly outstanding account of the fighting on July 2, 1863 at Gettysburg.

"William Physick Zuber wrote his excellent memoirs about growing up in Texas and being a soldier of Texas during the Texas Revolution and the Civil War.  At the age of fifteen, Zuber joined Sam Houston's Texas army in 1836.  He recorded the history of the battles he was in, the victories and defeats of armies on the move during the Texas Revolution.  Meeting such men as Stephen Austin, Sam Houston, and Mexican General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna and was present when Santa Anna was found out to be hiding among the surrendered Mexican troops.William ""Willie"" Zuber wrote his memoirs in great detail, yet easy to read and follow and had quite a life.  He details his love of learning and his methods of self-education.  He describes the day-to-day life as a soldier in Sam Houston's army and the encounters with the Mexican Army.  He later became a soldier in the Texas Militia patrolling the Texas frontier against Mexican soldiers, Comanche's, Kiowa's and other tribes that were killing Texas settlers.At the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, Willie Zuber was 42 years old with a wife and four children who didn't want him to enlist in the Confederate Cavalry, yet he did enlist and became a member of the 21st Texas Cavalry (CSA).  As a cavalrymen, Private Zuber served in the western theater of the Civil War in Arkansas, Missouri, Indian Territory and Texas.  He describes the skirmishes and small battles he partook in, and the daily life of a Confederate Cavalryman.  He described the sickness that swept thru his regiments and other regiments that fought and observed that disease took more lives than the battles fought.  He did fight in many skirmishes where he either trailed retreating Union Soldiers, or he retreated when the Union Cavalry was to large to fight against.  His observations of the war are fascinating and the detail of his regiment and the officers and enlisted men are accurate and truthful.  After the war, Willie Zuber became active in the politics of Reconstruction of Texas, and the founding of the Texas Veterans Association.Willie Zuber became a religious man during the Civil War and led many camp meetings and helped soldiers find faith in the thick of war, he also became active in the Masons but was not able to advance due to be absent during most of the meetings.  Willie Zuber has written his memoirs with clarity and detail and is not bogged down in unnecessary detail.  He had an excellent memory and quite clearly wrote about the important events in the history of young Texas.  His memories of the Civil War are a great read and add much to the history of the Civil War in Texas, Arkansas, Missouri and the Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma).  He was able to keep a journal during most of his life and it became a valuable resource in writing his memoirs that were later edited by his Grand Niece Llerea Friend.This is an excellent memoir written by a man who saw the founding of the great state of Texas and the early years when it was a fledgling republic, and also Texas during the Civil War and the western theater of the Civil War.  It is HIGHLY recommended to anyone interested in Texas and Civil War History.

"Author Scott Mingus Sr., has written a fascinating book about Confederate General William ""Extra Billy"" Smith, a former U.S. Senator, Governor, lawyer, and a man who spoke his mind and didn't care what others thought about him or what he said.  On his appointment in January 1863, at the age of 65, Smith was the oldest Confederate general to hold field command in the war. Before the war, while serving in Congress Smith became a vocal states rights activist and favored the expansion of slavery in new territories.  This did not endear him to abolitionists and others who wanted to stop slavery.  Known for his outspoken views in congress, he was well liked among the people he represented and was elected many times over a long career serving the United States before and after the war.This controversial congressman, later became a controversial general for his conduct and by the Gettysburg campaign, Smith's superiors questioned his tactics.  Smith refused to pursue retreating Union XI Corps troops, concerned that a Union force was approaching from his left, which was a significant reason that the Confederates failed to attack and take Cemetery Hill on July 1, 1863.  He was the only General not commended by General Jubal Early for performance at Gettysburg and thus Smith resigned his commission. Later he would serve as Governor of Virginia and would advocate the use of arming slaves for the defense of Richmond, Virginia.  He would occasionally command troops during the final defense of Richmond, however he was removed from office during the closing days of the war and was arrested but shortly was paroled once the war was over.Later Smith at the age of 80 would serve in the Virginia House of Delegates for two years, he would pursue agricultural interests, he died at the age of 89 and was buried in Richmond.Scott Mingus, in this great read explained all of this in fascinating research he conducted and the result is a great biography on this ""larger than life"" political and military figure pre-bellum and post-bellum  south.  Mr. Mingus, is to be commended for this biography because of all the documents, articles, letters, photos, and other historical elements over a man who served in Congress on and off for many, many years.  This is a great read for anyone interested in the controversial issues that congress debated about before the Civil War, U.S. political history, the Army of Northern Virginia and the battles the army fought in, reconstruction history, and U.S. History.

Jack Reacher is the ultimate agent and in this book he does it again by being in the tight situations and being an effective and deadly killer when needs be.  I won't spoil the plot or story let's just say that things from his past are brought to the front again and the plot is page turning!

"Mccormick has been known for years to be the brand that is essential for basic cooking.  Spices, sauces, seasonings, and other essentials for meals.  Their classic Brown Gravy been used in my kitchen for many years.  With the easy to make brown gravy from Mccormick you can add fresh mushrooms to make a delicious mushroom gravy for over meat dishes, over mashed potatoes.  Mccormick even has a recipe to make pepper steak that is delicious.  Their gluten free brown gravy is delicious and being gluten free, they don't sacrifice the taste of the gravy whatsoever.  It is not over salty, it is quick to make just add water and boil.I have always been happy with the Mccormick brand and as noted I have used it in my kitchen for many years and will continue for many more years.

"In 1978, the editors of Time-Life published this book ""The Mexican War"" as part of a series about the Old West.  The editors did a great job in telling the history of the war between the United States and Mexico with fascinating stories, photos of the soldiers, leaders and the uniforms (colored and black and white), maps, and the equipment and weapons used.The Mexican–American War, also known as the Mexican War, the U.S.–Mexican War or the Invasion of Mexico, was an armed conflict between the United States and the Centralist Republic of Mexico (which became the Second Federal Republic of Mexico during the war) from 1846 to 1848. It followed in the wake of the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas, which Mexico considered part of its territory, despite the 1836 Texas Revolution.The war was essentially a land grab for the United States who coveted the southwestern territories of the former Colonial Spanish Empire.  President James Polk envisioned a ""Manifest Destiny"" where the U.S. Flag would fly between the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean.  Much of the land was Mexican territory, and as a result of the successful Texas Revolution, many in the United States believed that the territories should be part of the U.S., even if it meant taking it by force.  The Mexican Army fought valiantly in many battles during the war, however, they were fighting against overwhelming odds against a superior army both in equipment and number of soldiers.As a result of the Mexican War, the controversy of slavery would heat up due to the new land acquired by the United States  and whether the territories would be ""free states"" or ""slave states"".  This controversy would grow louder and more passionate and would lead to the Civil War 14 years later.  Great leaders would emerge such as Robert E. Lee, Thomas J. (Stonewall Jackson), U.S. Grant, and more.  The Mexican War would serve as a training ground for combat that these officers would use 14 years later.This excellent read tells this history and much more and is highly recommended to anyone interested in the history of the southwest United States, Mexican History, Texas History, and U.S. and Southern History.  A great read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L2PDYPBVP95G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0809423022#wasThisHelpful","R1L2PDYPBVP95G","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The autobiography of Willburn Hill King With the 18th Texas Infantry is the fascinating biography of this little known Confederate General who enlisted in the beginning of the Civil War in the Missouri State Guard and rose to the rank of Captain.  He was in the battle of Carthage and Oak Hills.  He was a brave officer and admired by his men.  However, when the Missouri State troops were not mustered into the regular Confederate Army because of some unknown reason by President Jefferson Davis, he decided to go to Texas and enlist there.  His description of his travels from Missouri to East Texas in 1861 and early 1862 describes the desperation and the destruction of the war in the western theatre of the war.He enlisted once again as private in the 18th Texas Infantry which mustered into the army on May 13, 1862.  In this unit he served in Arkansas and Louisiana until the end of the war in 1865.  After the Battle of Mansfield he was promoted to Brigadier General and served temporarily as commander of Walker's and Polignac's division.After the war, Wilburn King moved to Central America but eventually settled in Sulphur Springs Texas where he served as mayor and a Texas State legislator.  He was a Adjutant General of the State of Texas and commanded troops in the Texas State Militia and the Texas Rangers.  He was later in the action of the famed ""fence cutting war"" and helped to end lawlessness in Texas during the 1880's.Willburn King Hill passed away in October of 1910 in Sulphur Springs, Texas and was buried in Corsicana, Texas, leaving behind a fascinating memoir of his Civil War service to the Confederacy and was an astute observer of the war and its destruction in the western theatre of the war.  This is an excellent book about a little known but distinct and brave officer that served in the Confederate Army in both the Missouri State Guard and the 18th Texas Infantry RegimentEditor L. David Norris did an excellent job of editing General King's personal recollections and also telling the story of the battles the general was in, what life was like in Missouri and Texas during the war, and the harshness and brutality of the war in the deaths of General Hill's troops, friends, and relatives.This is a great read about this unique and brave General who fought for Texas and Missouri and is highly recommended for Civil War scholars, academics, students, and enthusiasts who want to learn more about the Civil War in Missouri and Texas, the battles of Carthage and Oak Hills, Texas history, Confederate History and Civil War History.

"""A Forgotten Glory: The Missions of Old Texas"", by James Burke is an excellent history of the Spanish Missions built in the 17th and 17th Century by Spanish Friars and Native Americans in Texas.  Mr. Burke gives the history of these missions that had a large influence on Texas society for well over 300 years.  In the book Mr. Burke gives the history of how the missions were built, where they were located, what their mission to society was, and their present condition (as of 1979).  In the book the following chapters are:- Texas and the Little Brothers- The Patron Saint of Texas- Early Inhabitants of Texas- Old Texas as a Mission Field- The Mission and Its Function- Architecture of the Old Mission- Chronological Catalogue of Texas Missions- Missions Classified- Missions Lost- Missions Standing- Missions Ruined- Lest We ForgetPlus the Principal Sources and IndexThis is an overall excellent read.  The stories of these missions are interesting, inspirational, and have tragedy.  These priests and friars from Spain led their calling to ""the New World"" with a goal of converting the Native Americans of Texas to Christianity. Some of the friars and priests were successful, but in many cases they were not.  Due to the harsh climate, the understandable mistrust of the Native Americans to the priests and soldiers, and hostility of Native American tribes such as the Apaches and Comanches, many of the missions were either destroyed or abandoned.  Yet, some survive (with the majority being in present day San Antonio).  Their are excellent black and white printed photos in the book, maps that shows where the mission are/were located, and the brief history of these missions and the men who built them.The reason why I chose not to give it a five star review is the authors biased (yes this book was written over 30 years ago) and simplistic view of the Native Americans.  He based much of his research about the relationships between the Native Americans and the missions on the Catholic Church's documents written by the priests, books published by the Catholic Church, and antiquated publications written over a century ago or longer.  In much of these books and documents, the view is that the ""Indians"" were mostly savage and uncivilized and that the Missions were doing them a favor by trying to make them become Christian.  As we know now, that mostly led to conflicts and death.  Mr. Burke says in more than a few instances that the ""noble savages"" who became Christian were a blessing and had a much improved life.  Well, that is now viewed as inaccurate and simplistic.  However, that being said, this is an excellent book that gives the history of the Old Spanish Missions in Texas and is recommended for those interested in Colonial Spanish Texas, the history of the Catholic Church in America and the Southwest, and Texas-U.S. History.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EA6SSWC45L8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0872440494#wasThisHelpful","R3EA6SSWC45L8U","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Noted Civil War author and historian Scott L. Mingus Sr. has written a masterful history of the month before the Battle Of Gettysburg when General Robert E. Lee sent Generals Jubal Early and John Gordon to assess the strengths and weakness of the area he decided to march the Army of Northern Virginia through when he decided to invade the North a second time.  In this excellent book, the author details the cavalry led by the Confederate Generals as they probed and invaded the Maryland/Pennsylvania borders.  Pennsylvania was woefully unprepared for such a pre-invasion as the author clearly states and the response of the militia units though brave, was hardly a match for the battle tough cavalry soldiers of the Army of Northern Virginia.The Governor of Pennsylvania became aware of the threat early on and called on hometown militia units and other regiments to protect and defend the state.  Unfortunately, many of the men never had any experience on how to fight in a battle and when they encountered the Confederate Cavalry, many fled with their lives, many were captured, and more than a few were killed.  Mr. Mingus gives fascinating detail to these encounters in this fine read.  General Lee after reading the reports of Generals Early and Gordon correctly assumed that the Army of Northern Virginia would face no formidable resistance when he wanted to invade the north with the goals of marching his army to Harrisburg (Pennsylvania's capital) and with an ultimate goal of laying siege and possibly capturing Philadelphia thus hoping that the Union Army and President Abraham Lincoln would sue for peace and recognize the Confederate States of America as a separate country.Though the small battles were relatively short in duration, when the ANV Cavalry probed the Maryland and Pennsylvania countryside and small towns, they were important for the intelligence gathered by the cavalry of the ANV.  The cavalry units saw the plentiful harvest the farmers in the areas were growing thus giving much needed food supplies to the main army.  This and other excellent details are described in this great read by Scott Mingus.When you think of the Battle of Gettysburg, it is easy to forget what led up to the invasion.  General Lee had to have the intelligence of what the army might encounter in their march from Virginia into Maryland and Pennsylvania, that is what the expedition a month before the battle was about.  Mr. Mingus adds a fine addition to the storied Gettysburg Campaign.  This is a valued work in the history of the campaign and for a student, scholar, or historian to have a complete picture of the campaign, then this book must be added to their collection.  This is another fine book by the noted author and historian and another fine book published by Savas Beatie.  A DEFINITE MUST READ!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ASOV2UOZ0SFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611210720#wasThisHelpful","R2ASOV2UOZ0SFV","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Cry Comanche"" written by the late Colonel Harold B. Simpson (USAF), is the history of the the 2nd U.S. Cavalry Regiment stationed on the Texas Frontier from 1855 to 1861.  This famed regiment was hand picked by then Secretary of War Jefferson Davis and consisted of the best cavalry officers that were in the pre-Civil War U.S. Army.  The officers of the regiment consisted of Albert Sidney Johnston, Robert E. Lee, E. Kirby Smith, John Bell Hood, William J. Hardee, Earl Van Dorn, Fitzhugh Lee, George H. Thomas, and George Stoneman Jr.  These men were from the southern United States and were well known for their excellent discipline, appearance, horsemanship, and tactics.  The regiment was activated on March 4, 1854 by an Act of Congress and signed into law by President Franklin Pierce the next day.  The regiment originally headquartered at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri traveled to Texas and some of the officers brought their families with them.  In concert with the high standards set in selecting the very best soldiers, the regiment was furnished with the newest and the best of weapons and equipment.The 2nd U.S. Cavalry was authorized to serve on the Texas frontier and the border with Mexico.  During the five year history of the regiment it was involved in 40 Indian engagements, many patrols, reconnaissance missions and provided escorts.  The battles occured mostly in Texas but also into the northern frontier (north of the Red River).  In 1859 and 1860 George Stoneman led the soldiers south of the Rio Grande against hostile Comanches and Mexican Bandits.This famed regiment was composed mostly from men of the south and in 1861 a majority of the men resigned their commissions with U.S.  Army and cast their lot with the newly formed Confederate States Army, and their experience and tactics learned in the 2nd U.S. Cavalry would serve them well against their former compatriots, soldiers, and friends.Colonel Simpson, wrote a fascinating and factual history of the regiment.  This book is not a ""romantic and fictionalized"" book of the regiment, it is factual and gives a clear cut yet great history of this elite regiment and the brief five year history. Colonel Simpson also accounts for the resignations of the senior officers of the regiment who followed their families and their heart to fight against the United States.  Many of the officers such as Robert E. Lee were loyal to the United States and were anti-slavery, yet they couldn't and wouldn't fight against their homes and their families that were in the south.  A few of the officers though remained loyal to the Union such as George Thomas aka ""The Rock of Chickamauga"".Many of the lessons learned from the Texas Frontier would serve these officers well in future battles.  Their experiences of marching and riding hundreds of miles in severe weather, harsh patrols, terrible living conditions, and other extreme circumstances would be remembered by these officers as they commanded thousands of troops during the Civil War years.Colonel Simpson again has written a masterful history of Texas History, pre-Civil War History, and U.S. History.  He wrote many ""classics"" of history and this fine addition is a definite must have for anyone interested in the U.S. Army before the Civil War, Texas History, Texas Frontier History, and U.S. and Confederate States History.

"Excellent narrative of two young boys from Texas who were kidnapped by the Comanches and lived with them for five years.  As told by Clinton L. Smith and his brother Jeff.  Clinton was a young lad when he was kidnapped by the Comanches.  He was brought up in a loving and good family in the Hill Country of Texas and was kidnapped along with his brother while tending the family sheep.  The Comanches who were a nomadic Native American tribe, kidnapped many young white boys and girls.  Clinton soon had to test his ""manhood"" and was thrown into the ring with a young Comanche and had to show that he could fight.  After the second fight with the same boy, Clinton defeated him.  Clinton was adopted by the chief of the local band of Comanches.  The Comanches were nomadic and never stayed long in one place.  Always on the hunt for game or stealing horses and cattle from local ranchers and farmers, they would also kill many white settlers whenever they encountered them.  Clinton slowly became a warrior and forgot many of his ""white ways"".  As a warrior, Clinton would go on raiding parties, stole horses and cattle, raided farms and ranches, killed enemy warriors, rode ""Indian-Style"", and adopted many of the Comanche ways of life and would forget the culture where he was born.  Clinton traveled much of the western half of the United States.  Later, he was reunited with his white family and became a leading citizen and quickly adapted back to the ""white man's ways"".  He and his brother Jeff would never forget what they had learned from the Comanches (Jeff would also be adopted by the great Apache Chief Geronimo).  Clint would become an excellent ranch hand, cowboy, and leader of his family and community.An excellent read and I am impressed with Clinton's memories and they are quite vivid.  He had and excellent memory about his years with the Comanches and his adventures with them are exciting and intense.  This is a great first hand account of life with the Comanches and is highly recommended for anyone who is interested in Texas history, Native-American History, Comanche life in Texas and the Western United States.

"J. Michael Joslin has written a lively story based on his great-great grandfather Ralph Terry and his history of being a soldier in the 24th Michigan Infantry which was part of the famed Iron Brigade in the Civil War.  As a tribute to Ralph Terry, Mr. Joslin's book is part novel and part regimental history of the 24th Michigan and their involvement in numerous battles in the Army of The Potomac.Ralph Terry is a farmer from rural Michigan with a young expectant wife, and lives a quiet and peaceful life surrounded by family and friends.  Hearing the news reports of the local men joining the Union Army, Ralph is compelled to join and fight for the Union and is also worried about leaving his wife and later on, young son to fight.  In this good read, Ralph becomes a ""mule team"" driver to support the troops, and later on participates as an infantry soldier and fights in numerous battles including Gettysburg where as a part of the Iron Brigade is in the thick of battle.  Ralph has a definite ""adventure"" during his time in the 24th from being a mule-driver, to encountering numerous enemy soldiers where Ralph finds he has much in common with the ""ordinary"" Rebel soldiers, he soon learns that war is brutal and bloody, and it leaves a lasting impression on him and his friends from home who are also in the regiment.  He writes numerous letters to his wife and reflects on what he has seen and learned about war, and soldiering.Mr. Joslin in this great read also weaves in the history of the regiment and the great men who fought in it.  It is a combination that leaves the reader not only learning more about the actual experiences of Private Terry, but also the history of the 24th Michigan Infantry, who participated in most of the battles of the Army of the Potomac.  Private Terry participated in many of the battles the regiment fought in, he also caught Malaria which left him in the hospital for many months during the war.  Private Terry survived the war but some of his friends did not.  He was a brave soldier, and Mr. Joslin gives him a great tribute by writing this great read.  This is a novel-regimental history book that I recommend for anyone who wants to know more about what a common soldier of the Iron Brigade went thru during the Civil War, and it is also a great regimental history of the 24th Michigan and is a recommended read for anyone who wants to know more about the 24th Michigan Infantry Regiment and the Iron Brigade.

"At the Battle of Gettysburg from July 1 to July 3, 1863 thousands of men from both the Union and Confederate Armies faced each other in bloody battles and in these battles in the thick of the fighting were the flags of both Northern and Southern Regiments.  These flags were fiercely protected and fought over.  Many men would die in a matter of seconds to protect their flags and keep them from the enemy's hands.  For the Confederate flag bearers this meant that they would probably not survive the battle unharmed, either maimed, wounded, or be killed was the order of the day.Author Richard Rollins in this excellent book ""The Damned Ref Flags of the Rebellion"" The Confederate Flag at Gettysburg, he gets into the mindset of the soldiers who fought so fiercely to protect and preserve their battle flags.  The author goes into the history of the soldiers and regiments that fought for these banners and willingly died to protect them.  For the southern soldiers, it meant they were fighting for their homes, family, faith, and country.  Though it has become a controversial topic about why the south fought which the author goes into about the issues of slavery and why many men from the south didn't own a slave, or in many circumstances didn't know anyone who did, they would still fight for their state and in the early to mid-1800's the state meant their country.  These men from the south would fight along their brothers, cousins, uncles, fathers, and friends from their home, county, and state and honor was above all.  These were gallant men and brave men who were fierce in battle, yet compassionate to help ""enemy"" wounded and dying.  On the other spectrum, men from the North were just as fierce, loyal, and brave, and when they saw the ""rebel flag"" they knew that to them it meant that these men from the south, though fierce and brave must  be stopped at all costs and must be defeated.At the Battle of Gettysburg both northern and southern men died fiercely, bravely, and savagely in many circumstances.  The author of this fine book tells about the regiments from the South and their flags from Arkansas, Texas, South Carolina, North Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee, Georgia and Virginia these flags flew in the Pennsylvania sun and land and the men of the south knew if they would win this major battle, it might be the last of the war.  From the actions of men such as Colonel Henry Burgwyn of the 26th North Carolina Infantry Regiment who would die delivering the regimental flag to another soldier, to the actions of Sergeant George Branard of the 1st Texas Infantry Regiment who planted the Lone Star Flag of Texas on top of a boulder at Devil's Den, Mr. Rollins tells the stories of the gallantry and bravery of the men and regiments of the Army of Northern Virginia.  He also tells about the determination and bravery of the Union Soldiers who were just as determined to wrest from the hands of the color bearers the ""damned flags of the rebellion"".  There was great emotion on both armies such as after Pickett's Charge, the soldiers from the Army of The Potomac would run out and try to capture these flags single handedly  and in most cases were killed, but for the lucky few a captured ANV flag would give them fame and the Medal of Honor.  In once circumstance a Union General took a captured flag and dragged it on the ground while riding in front of the cheering troops.  Such emotion would long be remembered.The author has colored photos of the captured ANV Flags and where they reside today, (mostly at the Museum of the Confederacy, or in state archives).  Also included is a chart of the captured flags and where they were captured during the battle or if they were never captured.  Tactics, strategy, and history of the regiments fighting at Gettysburg is also included with the three days history of the fighting and an analysis of Pickett's Charge.Today, when one sees the flags of the Army of Northern Virginia it brings out emotions no matter what side of history you are on, whether a Southern man or woman has pride, fondness, and a sense of family history and heritage, or for a Northern man or woman who sees the ANV flag as a history of slavery and rebellion, that is up to the individuals.  However, we all must admire the bravery, courage, and gallantry of the men who fought those first three days of July in 1863 and the flags they flew into battle.  This is a highly recommended read for anyone who wants to know about the Battle of Gettysburg, also is recommended for anyone interested in the history of the Army of Northern Virginia, the Army of the Potomac, the eastern theatre of the Civil War and Civil War history.  A recommended read that should be in every Civil War library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3INN7T9OU8F17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0963899333#wasThisHelpful","R3INN7T9OU8F17","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From 1859 to 1861, two U.S. Army officers traveled throughout the Texas Frontier and the New Mexico Territory to conduct inspections and inventory of the frontier forts and the soldiers that were stationed at the forts.  The officers were Lt. Col. Joseph E. Johnston and Col. Joseph K. F. Mansfield.  These officers were charged with investigating and evaluating the welfare, efficiency, and combat readiness of the troops.  These reports, were factual, thorough, and accurate and gave the U.S. Inspectors office an overview of the readiness of these forts and troops as they dealt with hostile Indian tribes of Texas and New Mexico Territory, defense of nearby towns and villages, cattle trails, and outlaws.Jerry Thompson, editor of this outstanding book, tells the story of how these officers were tasked with a difficult assignment by the U.S. Army department.  These officers had to travel hundreds if not a few thousand miles overall, in the harsh conditions of frontier life in the Texas and New Mexico frontier.  Johnston's and Mansfield's reports provide a fascinating profile of the officers and men of these forts, overall conditions of the forts, many were unsatisfactory in conditions such as buildings that were barely able to stand up, spoiled food sources such as the meats, vegetables, and sugar that often was bad before arriving at the forts, the number of horses and oxen in good condition, the morale of the troops, and those who were awaiting court-martial for serious offenses or were placed on extra duty for minor charges.  The reports take not of the relations between the forts and the local population of the Hispanic communities, White settlers, and the Native American tribes in the area.Lt. Col Johnston inspected 20 forts throughout Texas and the New Mexico territory and the forts he inspected were:Fort Union, Fort Marcy, Fort Garland, Fort Burgwin, Fort Defiance, Post at Los Lunas, Fort Craig, Fort Fillmore, Fort Stanton, Fort Buchanan, Fort Bliss, Fort Fillmore, Fort Quitman, Fort Davis, Camp Stockton, Fort Lancaster, Camp Hudson, Fort Clark, Fort IngeCol Mansfield inspected 16 forts and some of the forts were the same forts that Lt. Col. Johnston inspected earlier and were:Fort Inge, Camp Wood, Fort Davis, Fort Quitman, Fort Stockton, Fort Lancaster, Fort Hudson, Fort Clark, Fort Duncan, Fort McIntosh, Ringgold Barracks, Paymaster Cunningham, Capt. George Stoneman's Cavalry, Department Headquarters.Some of these forts are still standing today, but most were abandoned not long after the inspections due to the Civil War, conditions of the forts, assignments of the troops to other forts, and other factors.These reports are a fascinating read and provide a vital glimpse into frontier life in the western United States on the eve of the Civil War.  Not long after the inspections were complete, the Civil War began and Lt. Col. Johnston resigned his commission to join the Confederate Army and rose in rank to become a full general.  Col Mansfield, would later become a General in the Union Army and later was mortally wounded at Sharpsburg (Antietam) and died on September 18,1862.Mr. Thompson does an excellent job in telling the history of these inspectors and how they rose in the ranks in both the Union and Confederate armies.  Also, the editor tells of the soldiers who were at the forts during the inspection and whether they stayed in the Union Army or resigned their post or commission and joined the Confederate Army.  It is an interesting ""what if"", if General Johnston would of been assigned command of the troops in Texas during the war and if the outcome of the invasion of New Mexico territory would of ended differently than General Silby's invasion that ended in failure.  General Johnston certainly knew the strengths and weaknesses of the various forts and their locations due his familiarity with the forts, troops, and the land.In the reports, both Colonels note the morale which was generally low overall of the officers and men due to the remoteness of the forts, the overall unsatisfactory supplies and conditions of the forts, and other details.  It is easier to understand why some of the officers would join the Confederacy after feeling they were alone in the frontier being stationed in the remote Texas and New Mexico deserts and prairies.This excellent book is a vital snapshot into the soldier's life in the frontier before the Civil War, and the conditions of these forts.  It is an important work that is VITAL for anyone who wants to know about the US Army in Texas and New Mexico on the eve of the Civil War, the logistical history of the US Army on the Texas and New Mexico frontier, and the overland trails that connected the forts.  It definitely is an important book for U.S.,and Texas History, and the history of the frontier army on the eve of the Civil War.  I can't recommended this book highly enough and it is a definite MUST READ for anyone interested in frontier army life before the Civil War in Texas and New Mexico Territory.

"Evault Boswell, editor of ""Texas Boys in Gray"" took the stories of the Texans who fought for the Confederacy from Mamie Yeary's outstanding and classic book ""Reminiscences of the Boys in Gray"" that was published in 1912.  In this condensed version, the editor takes the stories from Confederate Veterans that were in Texas Regiments and those who fought in other states regiments but settled in Texas after the Civil War.  These are the reminiscences of the veterans experiences that they told decades after the war.  These veterans still remember harrowing and brutal accounts of the battles they fought in, camp life, religious faith during the war, and how they look back on the war years after it was over.  The following chapters are:- Original Forward by Miss Mamie Yeary- Preface- Chapter 1: Close Encounters  - Chapter 2: The Halt, the Lame, and the Dead- Chapter 3: Christ in the Camp - Chapter 4: Terrible Cost and Hardships- Chapter 5: Rally 'round the Flag, Boys - Chapter 6: Hardtack and Rats- Chapter 7: Afterglow - Chapter 8: The High and the Mighty- Chapter 9: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to War - Chapter 10: Over These Prison Walls I Would Fly- Chapter 11: Valor and Bravado - Index by Cities and ContributorsThese veterans tell their stories of how they and their comrades fought from 1st Manassas (Bull Run) to Pea Ridge to Gettysburg to Chickamauga to Sailor's Creek.  These veterans stories are vivid and fascinating and in some cases they only gave a sentence or two.  But they are all fascinating to read and gives you a greater appreciation of why they fought for Texas and the Confederacy.  A great read for anyone interested in Texas in the Civil War, battles of the eastern theatre and western theatre in the war, Civil War and Confederate History.  A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED READ!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17T8RABPER86C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1556227779#wasThisHelpful","R17T8RABPER86C","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When people think of American History, they usually think that American History begins at around 1492 with Christopher Columbus and then think of Jamestown as the beginning of American History.  However, American History begins thousands of years before with the native peoples that inhabited the North American continent.  Author Michael S. Durham has written a guide to Ancient Native American Sites that are located in the United States.  These fascinating historical and ancient sites in this book span 30 states from the east coast of the US to the west coast of the US.  From the Anasazi of the American Southwest to the Natchez of the gulf coast of Mississippi and many other sites, Ancient Native Americans built homes, hunting camps, and even towns like Mesa Verde in southwest Colorado.  This guide tells the brief history of these sites, how you can visit them, who runs the sites now and what there is to see.From the National Park Service to private organizations these sites are available to the public to discover and learn about the Ancient Native Americans who though have been gone for thousands of years, but left their mysterious cultures, buildings, and artifacts for us to learn from.  Some of these sites are small and not much is left in artifacts, but others left thousands of artifacts and buildings.  Some of these sites still remain a mystery of how they were originally intended and all of these sites have still not given up all that is there for us to learn from.The author has broken down the sites into the following:-States that have the sites-Attraction:-Hours:-Admission Fee:-For More Information:-Then the history of the site, how it was discovered, the main sites to see within the parks and sites:-How to get there:This is a great book that is highly recommend to have if you plan to see any of these sites.  The book was published in 1994, so I am sure that many facts have changed about the sites and what there is to see and do, but still, this is a great book to take if you want to discover these fascinating Ancient Native American Sites.

"Texas is a Strong, Tough, and Independent state, it is the LONE STAR State, and many unique and fascinating people have made it become a ""legend"" not only in U.S. History but in World History.  In this excellent book the authors tell about a few of the Strong, Tough, and Independent women who have made Texas legendary.  These short stories (1 to 2 pages) highlight the fascinating history of these women who come from different background and have made different yet important contributions to Texas.  These women highlighted the different historical eras of Texas from Colonial Spanish Texas to the founding of the Texas Republic, to today, and from entertainment to pioneers to the grocery business, and from different ethnicity and cultures these women though had the same characteristics Strong, Tough, and Independent, these women were and are fascinating and the authors tell their story excellently.  The women highlighted in this book are:-Rosa Maria Hinojosa de Balli, Adina de Zavala, Clara Driscoll-Lady Bird Johnson, Barbara Bush-Florence Butt (the true founder of the great HEB Grocery Chain), Mary Kay Ash-Katherine Anne Porter, Tanya Tucker, Molly Irvins-Katherine Stinson, Bessie Coleman, Kara Hultgreen-Barbara Jordan, Governor Ann RIchards-Mildred (Babe) Didrikson Zaharias, Barbara Jacket-May Owen, Sarah WilliamsSarah Tilghman Hughes, Marrie Reynolds Garcia-Frances Battise, Helen GrovesThese women were politicians, entertainers, pilots, First Ladies of the United States, Senators, and much more.  The saying that is popular is ""behind every good man there is a woman"", let me say that ""behind every good state there are many GREAT WOMEN who have made it great!"" and this fascinating read (brief at 113 pages) shows the GREAT women that have made Texas legendary!  Published in 1996, some of the women in this book have since passed away (Ann Richards, Barbara Jordan) and some passed away long ago, yet their contributions have lived on, especially in Texas!

"TL Murphy in ""Kelly's Heroes: The Irish Brigade at Gettysburg"" gives a brief overview of the heavy fighting by this hard fighting brigade during the battle of Gettysburg.  The Irish Regiments from Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York were in some very bloody and fierce fighting at The Wheat Field when they fought the regiments from South Carolina and Georgia during the afternoon of July 2, 1863.  In this brief read, the author tells about the formation of the regiment, the officers, enlisted men, and commanders that formed this famous brigade and some brief history of the previous battles the brigade fought in.the Irish Brigade was still a force to be reckoned with when they were thrown in to support Sickles' collapsing line on the afternoon of July 2.  One of the memorable moments of the battle came as the men of the Irish Brigade knelt while the Brigade Chaplain, Father William Corby, stood atop a boulder and pronounced general absolution to the men.They then attacked into the Wheatfield, charging across into the Rose Woods and the Stony Hill. The Confederate advance was temporarily halted just a it threatened to overwhelm the entire Union position, although the brigade was flanked by Confederate Reinforcements advancing from the Peach Orchard and forced to withdraw back across the bloody Wheatfield.The monument is a Celtic cross supported by a granite base, standing 19’ 6” tall. It was sculpted by William R. O’Donovan, a former Confederate soldier who fought at Gettysburg. The front of the cross is an ornate bronze ornamented by a 2nd Corps trefoil, the numbers of the three New York regiments, the Seal of the State of New York, and a harp flanked by eagles. At the foot of the cross lies a lifesized Irish wolfhound, symbol of honor and fidelity. The monument was dedicated on July 2nd, 1888.Mr. Murphy also tells about the dedicaiton and how Father Corby says ""what happened to the rest of the men?"" which brought many tears from the veterans and Father Corby couldn't speak for several minutes.  An emotional dedication for the hard fighting veterans who attended the dedicaiton.This is a great brief read that tells about just one of the many battles the brigade fought in.  Included are photos of some of the men of the brigade and what happened to them during and after the war.  A great read that is a brief summary of the Irish Brigade fighting during Gettysburg.

"This book is a photographic history in time of the farms, fields, homes, and families of Gettysburg.  The emphasis is on the land and structures that existed in photos after the battle took place up to the early 20th Century.  As author Tim Smith noted, many of the structures in the old photos have long since disappeared and much of the photos of the fields show them completely different than they are today.  This is a great reference for researchers, historians, and future authors who want to have photos in their essays, reports, articles, and books that could add to their work about the battle.  The emphasis is not really on the battle itself, but photos of how the land and structures were in the battle.Again, this is primarily for researchers, future authors, and historians who want a reference to how the area look during and the years right after the battle.  In the back of the book are permission forms to fill out and send to the Adams County Historical Society if you want the photos in your publication.  An interesting photo collection overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N0ICJ2AZS38L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1577471253#wasThisHelpful","R2N0ICJ2AZS38L","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Naval Proceedings, a monthly magazine published by the U.S. Naval Institute is an excellent magazine where senior enlisted sailor and Naval Officers submit articles on the current state of readiness of the U.S. Navy and its allies in Naval Warfare. Officers and Senior Enlisted submit truthful and factual articles about areas of the Navy and its tactics in its current state. A majority of the articles criticize with factual details on deficiencies that the Navy doesn't address or address properly. From morale, technological deficiencies, out of date naval warfare philosophy, and other issues that are ""dead on"" correct. I admire the people who submit these articles that either blame or praise the Navy and its way of ""doing business"".One thing to point out though is that you won't find articles submitted by junior enlisted sailors. These sailors know that if they submit an article or report in Naval Proceedings that they face the risk wrath of the chain of command if they submit an article that is critical of the Navy. They don't have the ""power"" of being immune from ""the powers that be"". Even though they are as intelligent, in some case much more intelligent, than their chain of command in the Navy. It is a ""brave soul"" who can criticize with facts, resources, and documentation and submit it to those in the Naval Community. Some officers and senior enlisted realize that there career could be in jeopardy, yet they have the passion and dedication to point out flaws in the Navy System. Naval Proceedings is an OUTSTANDING magazine and I recommend it to those who want to know about the ""current state"" of the United States Navy and its allies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R97PESC7GHG7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006KTOY#wasThisHelpful","R97PESC7GHG7F","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"H. Joaquin Jackson, Texan, Lawman, and a Texas Ranger wrote this fascinating read as a sequel to his first book ""One Ranger"".  Ranger Jackson in his first book wrorte about his life growing up in Texas, joining the Marine Corps, becoming a lawman after the Marines and then joining the legendary Texas Rangers.  In the book, he described the tough standards and training it took to become a Texas Ranger and the men who made the Texas Rangers legendary.  Ranger Jackson in the sequel tells more stories about the infamous men he had to deal with, not with ""Texas Justice"" but with following the law. Ranger Jackson in his long career with the Rangers met many great lawmen, dealt with some very ""tough hombres"", honed his detective skills at the FBI Academy, and described the actions it took to chase down and arrest some very bad murderers, cattle rustlers, and strike agitators, just to name a few.Ranger Jackson reminiscences about the experiences it took to maintain justice on the modern Texas/Western frontier, and each story is a page turner.  He also talks about the dogs that became part of his family and how they impacted his life and family.  Ranger Jackson's family (wife and sons) describe their living and loving a Ranger and how life wasn't always easy to say the least.Ranger Jackson is a lawman who could of easily fit in with the Texas Rangers of old.  He is tough, straightforward pulling no punches, knows the land, how to track not only lost cattle but outlaws, how to act with an iron hand yet be compassionate to the innocent victims of bad crimes, and is humble in how he became a Texas Ranger we all can admire.In this great book a few of the chapters are:-La Heulga: The United Farm Workers Strike of 1996-1997- By the Light of the Rustlers' Moon-  My Own Good Ole Boys: The FBI National Academy- Sadistic Deaths in the Desert: The Frome Murders- A Man Not to mess With- To All the Dogs I Loved Before- The Deadly Duo: Lucas and Toole- The Hunt for Alfredo Hernandez: a Muy Mal HombreThere are more chapters in this book that are just as fascinating to read.  Ranger Jackson is a Ranger that you do NOT want to get on the bad side of, and the exact type of Ranger that you want to protect yourself and help you find justice on those who did wrong.  He retired in 1993 from the Texas Rangers and started his own investigative company that he is the head of.  When Ranger Jackson retired, the Texas Rangers did indeed lose a lawman of the ""old school"", a tough, straightforward, hard as nails Texas lawman, but his great legacy lives on and inspires those young men and women who want to become a legendary Texas Ranger.  As Tom Selleck said Ranger Jackson has ""a life well lived"", I definitely agree and am an admirer of this great TEXAS RANGER!

"Clay Coppedge the author of this great read published most of the stories in the Country World Newspaper and the Texas Co-op Power Magazine.  The stories are of the ""bigger than life"" legends, history, and people that made up and still make up the legendary Hill Country of Texas.  Various stories about the places, people, and history of the Hill Country has made for a fascinating read.  From the Germans who settled near Fredericksburg who wisely made peace with the Comanches, to Jim Bowie and his famous knife, Sam Houston and wanting to move the capital to Houston, which MANY Austinites did NOT appreciate, to local landmarks such as the history of Enchanted Rock, to the story of the famous little town of Luckenbach are part of the many short stories in these chronicles.  The chapters in the book are:- Part I: A Forbidding Land- Part II: The Good, the Bad, and the Witty- Part III: From Dinosaurs to Polo- Part IV: Texas OriginalsWithin these chapters are great short stories that will give the reader a greater appreciation of the unique and varied history of the Hill Country and the people, places, legends and history that truly made the Hill Country the famous and wonderful place it is today.

"John Michael Priest has written an excellent history of both the Union and Confederate Armies and their action during the Battle of Gettysburg where he describes the actions of both armies on the battles last day, July, 3, 1863.  Mr. Priest has given us the actions of the soldiers, regiments, brigades, and commanders of both armies and what they were doing.  He doesn't get ""bogged down"" in detail and keeps the action vivid and lively.  It is suspenseful and easy to understand what the soldiers are doing to be ready to go into battle.Most everyone who has read this book already knows about the Battle of Gettysburg and the history of the three days of the main battle on July 1, 2, and 3, 1863 so there is no reason to go over the specifics of the last day's action and especially Pickett's Charge.  For those of you who don't know much about the battle and the famous Army of Northern Virginia's charge into the Army of the Potomac, then this is a perfect start for you.  Mr. Priest in this excellent book, puts the reader in ""the thick of the action"" from the start you learn about the men (from Private to General) who were dramatically and permanently affected by the charge and the battle.  You learn that many had loved ones at home both north and south and were waiting for their safe return.  Sadly, for so many this never occurred.I won't give details or the outcome, most of you already know how it was unfolded and what the overall result would be.  Let me say though that Mr. Priest is to be commended for his fine work on the battles last day of July 3, 1863.  It is a fascinating read, it is easy to understand (even for a reader who doesn't understand the war or the battle), it is a great refresher for those Civil War ""enthusiasts"", scholars, and historians.  It is a book that I will use as a valuable reference in the upcoming years, and it is highly recommended for those who want to know more about the Battle Of Gettysburg, the Army of Northern Virginia, main battles of the Civil War, and great stories of the brave men who fought at Gettysburg.

"Thomas S. Terrell of Kerrville, Texas found the letters of his great-great Uncle Virginius E. Pettey who enlisted in the 5th Texas Infantry of Company E (Hood's Texas Brigade).  In 2005 Mr. Terrell published the letters in the Kerrville Daily Times as ""Letters From Home"" for the next six months, and latter these articles became the book ""The Boys From Brenham"".  Pvt Pettey, from Brenhem, Texas was an eager soldier to fight for the Confederacy and Texas and wrote letters home to his family describing the enthusiasm and excitement the ""local boys"" was experiencing when they first left for war.  Meeting new men from different parts of the Lone Star State and from those throughout the south, this young soldier saw many new and interesting things as he traveled to Richmond, Virginia with the rest of his regiment to form Hood's Texas Brigade.Pvt Pettey soon discovered that ""army life"" was not just a grand adventure, it was filled with tedious camp life duties, some of his friends and fellow soldiers soon fell ill with disease and sickness, and soon would discover the viciousness of battle.  In these letters you see the steady transformation of the grim reality of war and battle.  Private Pettey was a close observer and would write a series of fascinating letters of the war that the Army of Northern Virginia fought in.  These are the same experiences that thousands of southern and northern men would share in their letters home to loved ones.  These are a fascinating read and reaffirms to modern readers that the war was not glorious but that it was a grim reality faced by the hundreds of thousands of men who fought for what they believed in.These letters became treasured and were kept by Private Pettey's family down through the ages until Mr. Terrell shared them with the local newspaper in 2005.  These are a fascinating read and are another glimpse into the war of 150 years ago.Private Pettey was a proud soldier of Hood's Texas Brigade and fought bravely with his fellow soldiers and friends in the early battles of thewar.  Private Pettey charged in the front rank of Hood's Texas Brigade as it broke the line at Gaines' Mill.  A month later, during the Brigade's victorious assault at Second Manassas (Bull Run), he carried the colors of the Fifth Texas until he was mortally wounded.  He died on the field of battle on September 1, 1862.  His last words were recorded in a letter written by his sergeant.  These are his last words:""Tell my friends that I have died for a good cause, and that I am perfectly willing to die for I have served my country faithfully"".Mr. Terrell has edited an excellent book based on his great-great Uncle's letters and he also has provided photos Private Pettey and other family members.  It is a book that is highly recommended to all who are interested in Hood's Texas Brigade, the early battles that the Army of Northern Virginia participated in, those who are interested in the daily lives of the soldiers who fought in the war, and Civil War History.  A great and tragic read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUJY9172YAS9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002TTJE52#wasThisHelpful","RUJY9172YAS9T","A2BSZPRBKYAB2K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Texas, the graveyards are a telling sign of the culture that surrounds these cemeteries especially the early ones.  Terry G. Jordan in 1982 published this interesting book based up the travels of the ""back roads and hidden trails"" that led to these fascinating cemeteries.  He encountered the Anglo-American, Black, Indian, Mexican and German Cemeteries that are throughout Texas and most are dated back to the founding of the Lone Star State after the Texas Revolution.Many of these cemeteries are a reflection of traditional culture that was in the area and carried over from Europe or Africa, or Ancient Native American Influence and customs.  Through photographs, maps, and drawings he illustrates Texas graveyards and beliefs behind their creation.As stated in the inner leaf, ""Texas Graveyards is important in preserving a Texas legacy endangered by changing customs, rural depopulation, vandals, and the erosion of time.""  Since its publication 32 years ago many of the graves and cemeteries have either fallen further into disrepair or have disappeared altogether.  That is why this is an important book for Texas History since it is illustrated with many photographs of graves and cemeteries that are no longer existing.  Let us hope that over the last 30 years that people have been able to save and preserve many of these graves, tombstones, and cemeteries not only for the sake of the descendants of the people buried, but for our own cultural heritage of the many cultures of Texas.

"Corel VideoStudio Pro X8 runs smoothly, is properly organized, and easy to learn. There is a trial available from Corel on their website so you can try it out. For additional information, visit the Corel site videostudiopro.com and click on FEATURES to see the new features in this Pro X8 version, and what features have been enhanced.  Tools for learning how to use the software is also available.I've worked with various video editing programs throughout the years including Windows Movie Maker, Sony Vegas, Premiere Elements, Premiere Pro, Premiere CC, and a few others that are no longer made. Corel has done a great job of improving their VideoStudio series and this version runs smoothly.  It's easy to import files from your drives, or from DV devices (like a Mini DV camcorder or newer camcorders).The 64-bit version install takes about 30 minutes (on a Windows 7 Home PC with a AMD Quad Core processor and 8 GB of RAM). During the install, right after the Serial Number entry, don't click install yet and go to the OPTIONS tab and uncheck any of the three options you don't want installed (Product Updates, Quicktime, Flash).  After the install, the program work quickly and without any hiccups. One minor thing that bothere me was the previews of every option (for titles, transitions) plays automatically. Not sure how to turn these off.It's easy to add things like titles, transitions, and remove things from the timeline. Like other programs you can work on the timeline or storyboard.  If you've worked with any video editing program mentioned above, the layout of VideoStudio is similar.NOTE: There is a variety of support for different input formats and also output formats, but the MXF format (used in Panasonic Pro camcorders) is NOT supported in VideoStudio.  You have to convert the files to WMV using a separate program or use another program that works with MXF files like Premiere CC. There is a supplemental program included that works similar to Windows DVD Maker. You choose the files/clips and choose one of the preset designs for the DVD menu and navigation, set the title and music, and you have an instant DVD that makes you look somewhat professional.With any of these video editing programs, for me it's always about how smooth it runs, how easy is it to find tools and use them, and the formats supported. Video-editing is a very time-consuming process, so the editing program needs to be fast and smooth, and this Corel VideoStudio Pro X8 does it well.  Currently, I still prefer using Premiere CC since I'm used to that program, but Corel VS is comparable to Premiere Elements but has more features than Elements. I will be spending more time with Corel VS Pro X8 to see what it is fully capable of.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2STDWCTUZTDIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0I6J9E#wasThisHelpful","R2STDWCTUZTDIF","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic learning toy that is easy to use, allows mental development of children (and adults), and runs smoothly.Be careful when opening the box, as the top portion slipped off mine, and the robot slipped out and fell about 2 feet onto a carpet. So, to avoid that, be careful when holding the box and removing the robot from the box.  You can use this with Android devices and Apple devices. Start by downloading the GO app from the app store. Switch the Dash robot to ON (ON button is a small white circle on the back right between the neck and wheel), and then start the app. The app will search for the robot and should connect easily within 10 seconds. After it connects, to select the robot it has found, on your device press and hold the center button to make the connection between Dash and the device (in my case iPad). It will then ask to update (if necessary), but in order to update, you need to connect Dash to a power outlet using the included orange USB cable. The mini-USB connector on Dash is on the back left side (opposite the ON button).  Once Dash is receiving power, run the update on the app. My Dash was already pre-charged and I didn't need to charge it, but I think USB connection is required just as a safety measure when running the update. The USB provides power and the updates are sent from the device to Dash, and the updates should only take 30 to 60 seconds. Then you choose a name for Dash.  After setup, a video plays and the robot interacts while it plays, blinking lights and playing noises, and moving around a bit.  It's exciting to see young kids get excited by the simple interactions from Dash during the video. You can search for additional robots anytime in case you have other robots in this series.Also included are two building block connectors that attach to Dash's ears. The building block connectors work with LEG, KNEX, and other similar types of building blocks.GO App (main app): The app now lets you control Dash as you please. The GO app is the main app, but there are three other separate official apps (all free)  that you can download to increase the interactivity with Dash. The GO app is simple to use. The left side (yellow tab) allows you to move Dash in any direction.  I get about 90% to 100% precision on the movement of Dash, and Dash moves smoothly over flat, smooth surfaces (non-carpeted).  Dash can move on carpet, but much slower, so it's best to use non-carpeted surfaces. You can adjust the speed of Dash's movement from four levels, 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% full speed. Dash moves slowly at 25% and medium speed at 100%.  Most children will enjoy 25% and 50%, and most adults will enjoy 100%.  Also on the left side (blue tab), you can set the brightness of the twelve LED's around Dash's eye.  And you can also adjust which LEDs should be lit, and this allows complete control. You can choose just one LED, or alternative LED's, create a smile using bottom four LEDs, etc. On the right half of the screen the green tab allows you to move Dash's head around in any direction (270 degrees). The blue tab allows different sounds and interactions. There are six sounds (siren, tires screeching, horn, cow, elephant, dog) and there are three pre-programmed commands that Dash will do. The first command is curious, where Dash moves around slowly making curiosity noises. The second command is panic, where Dash moves around quickly and breathes a sigh of relief. The third command is dizzy, where Dash spins around three times, getting dizzy, and shakes his head shaking the dizzy away and makes noise. Most young children will love these simple movements. The third tab on the right lets you set the color of Dash's ears and of the triangle on Dash's front.  You can choose any color from the ROYGBIV spectrum, and the ears and triangle both have separate spectrums allowing for different colors. The GO app provides all these basic commands. There are three other free apps that allow for even more fun. Dash was fully responsive from using the app 30 feet away.PATH app: This is a separate free download. It lets you design/draw a path, and Dash will follow that path. The games require you to put sound and light interactions in the path in the app, and Dash will react when he reaches those in the path.  This is a fun learning tool for young children and shows some of the potential that Dash can be used as a learning tool. This is a basic learning app.BLOCKLY app: This is another separate free download that lets you develop algorithms (set of instructions). This is a more advanced learning app. You have a list of commands, and you drag and drop them, choose different options for each, and then run it (just like a program), and Dash will go through and do all the commands in the list/program you made. It's very simple to use, and very easy to learn. I'm a professional programmer, and this is an absolute blast for children to learn this step-by-step way of thinking. I loved this app the most.XYLO app: This is also a separate free download, but it requires the Dash Xylophone (sold separately). The xylophone comes with arms that attach to Dash's shoulders, and he interacts and plays the xylophone using the commands from the Xylo app.  I don't have the xylophone and was not able to test it, but I did run through the app.Overall, this is an excellent learning tool. Every child is different, and different things will hold their interest. Some may be fascinated by Dash, and others will ignore it. But it has potential to teach things while having fun. It is durable, made of strong plastic, and it was 100% responsive during all my tests. Even from 30 feet, Dash was still fully responsive to my commands on the iPad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35PBXVO7LYNLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKURVKY#wasThisHelpful","R35PBXVO7LYNLB","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One side is a matte finish, and the other a glossy finish. This screen protector is made for 13.3"" screens. The size is 12 and 3/8"" wide x 7 and 5/8"" in height. It has a nice sturdy thickness to it, but is still flexible. You get one screen protector and 8 adhesive pads.  There are recessed points on the protector that show you where to put the pads. Peel a pad off the white paper, place it on the protector, then remove the thin top layer of plastic on the pad. Once the four pads are placed, attach to your monitor/laptop.  It does a great job of preventing viewing from the side. As others have mentioned, it depends on how much spacing is between your LCD screen and the keyboard when you close your laptop. So, it depends on the design of your laptop. The adhesive pads are thin. The adhesive will last a few times if you have to remove the screen protector and put it back on. Once the pads wear out, you'll need to find an alternative way to stick the protector on. The protector is excellent, the adhesive pads are just ok.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH2VLQRINK3VZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7R1CKQ#wasThisHelpful","RH2VLQRINK3VZ","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great Plush to play with. However, the learning features of it are very simple and basic, and average. The George plush is 16"" in height, and 8"" wide (6.5"" when arms are not at his side).  The plush is very soft and very huggable and squeezable.  The age is 1+, and it makes a great plush for them. But for the learning features, I recommend the age of 3+.Features: 1) BUCKLE: on his right shoulder strap, the buckle is attached to his clothes, so it won't separate from the doll unless you cut it off, so it's a good safety feature.  For children 3+, it may be easy to remove the strap from the buckle, and get the strap through the buckle.2) TIE: under his neck, nice enough for small hands to learn how to tie a shoelace.3) BUTTON: on his left shoulder strap, it stays buttoned/locked when buttoned.4) SNAP: on his right leg, it's a metal button snap that most of us grew up with. It does require some strength to open and close it, so recommended for children 3+.  The pocket is a small, but functional pocket.5) VELCRO: on his left leg, it's a same-sized pocket, also functional. The velcro opens and closes easily.The plush is made in China, and is hand-washable. The Curious George logo on the front is painted on. And lastly, the clothes do come off, but there is a small amount of stitching on the shoulders. You can remove it to get the clothes off, and let your child play dress-up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EYCK1LI6AWZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOSSYSA#wasThisHelpful","R1EYCK1LI6AWZS","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rating 4.5 stars.The hand grip is textured and provides excellent grip and is 4"" long (perfect for small, medium, and medium-large hands. Large and X-large hands may want a bigger hand grip). The build quality is great, and feels durable. The twist locks for the extensions could be of better quality. They feel of a cheaper plastic and should have been thicker and better quality. The rubber covers are great and cover the ports entirely. The pole does have some weight to it, mostly from the thick rubber used in the hand grip.  The aluminum allow is strong but lightweight. The included screw screwed in easily when attaching my GoPro. You can attach other devices too, but they will need their own adapters to be mounted properly.In the package, the extension pole is in the front, but there is a small flat box next to it in the hidden area that contains a 6"" USB cable, a 3-ft USB charging cable, and the screw to lock in a GoPro camera.  The pole is 30"" long when fully extended. When fully compacted, the pole is 19.5"" long.The built-in rechargeable battery has a capacity of 5200 mAh, allowing up to 10 hours of recording time on a GoPro. The wrist lanyard has a snap lock to adjust for tightness around wrist. The hand grip is excellent. It is definitely textured, but soft, and the ridges are deep for excellent grip. You may start feeling the texture in your hands with prolonged use.  The charging port for the built-in battery is covered by a rubber cover, located two inches above the hand grip. There are also two USB ports, both covered by rubber covers, at the top right under where the GoPro attaches.The 6"" USB cable attaches to your GoPro and plugs into one of the USB ports under the GoPro mount area. The 3 ft USB charging cable plugs into the port near the hang grip.  There are three tiny holes containing LED lights under the charging port that tell how much power remains. You can easily check by pressing the power button located under the LED lights. The LEDs should be easy to see and tell if they are solid or blinking. If it is hard to see them, pull the rubber cover up or down so the holes match up.You can charge the battery by plugging the USB cable into a computer (make sure the USB port on your computer provides enough power for charging (most do)).  Or you can plug the USB cable into an adapter that plugs into the wall and charge that way.  According to the manual, the pole is also compatible with 5V AC adapters (5V/1A requires up to 6 hours charge time, and 5V/0.5A requires up to 12 hours charge time).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z7HT3752E0WT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OIK31NG#wasThisHelpful","R1Z7HT3752E0WT","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: 4.5 starsThis is a great case/keyboard combo for the iPad Air 2.  The cover should be a little thicker, but it is thick enough to provide adequate protection. When closed, the screen will be very close to touching the keys of the keyboard, and while it won't activate or do anything, it is best to use a screen protector, or place a thin wipe cloth between the two, just for that extra protection.The case snaps onto an iPad Air 2 perfectly. There are only two tabs at the top that snap onto the iPad, but it holds it in place. The bottom area is 10""W x 7"" L (the keyboard uses 4.5"" L and the top portion of the bottom area uses 2.5"" L).  The top portion of the bottom area is where the iPad will rest (shown in the third picture).  Because the keyboard is smaller than normal laptop keyboards, it will take a few days to get used to the smaller size.  The keyboard is 10""W, with each key being slightly smaller than 5/8"" W (a laptop with 14"" screen has keys that are 6/8"" W).  It's just like moving from a PC keyboard to a laptop keyboard. But once you get the hang of it, the keys are very responsive, they are just slightly raised, and the keys presses are mostly quiet. In a quiet room, someone can hear you type from across the room.There is a 15"" USB to micro-USB cable included to charge the keyboard. The micro-USB plugs into the keyboard. The interior of the case is smooth rubber. The exterior of the case has an ultra-smooth but textured feel. The red tab in the picture is a loop to clip your stylus into.  Regarding the placement of the keys, I had used other keyboards before that were similar to this, so I had no problem adapting. If the keyboard has key placement different from what you are used to, it may take a few days to get used to.  This case is built well and is a single piece, with the keyboard portion being a plastic piece that is glued on. All the cutouts are there for the iPad Air 2.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17NSNJJEA8Z3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PK260AW#wasThisHelpful","R17NSNJJEA8Z3G","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use a few different supplements in powder form and this one is great. I also have the Vega Protein and Greens.  The powder in this Vega All-In-One Shake is a soft powder, similar to all-purpose flour. It dissolves easily in water, mostly, and tastes good.  No complaints about the taste. Initially I started with a tablespoon in a glass of water. And then added a second, and then a third to find my preference in thickness and taste.  The NATURAL flavor taste is a very mild grass-like taste. The water turns a very light green. It's a mild taste and I use it alternating with the chocolate flavor.  The CHOCOLATE flavor is like a dark chocolate taste, of medium strength. The powder is darker and has a stronger chocolate taste than the Vega Protein and Greens Chocolate powder. I've been mixing a tablespoon of this All-in-One (for vitamins and minerals) and a tablespoon of the Vega Protein and Greens (for amino acids).They provide decent nutrition, taste good, and mix instantly (mostly). The label recommends adding the powder to any non-dairy drink (so no milk), and I only add to water.  Other nutritional drinks offer different vitamins and minerals, so determine your nutritional needs.  There is no sugar added, the drink still tastes really good. The other powders I use are Pro-Complex, and Vega Sport Performance Protein, but I don't mix those with this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGLWU64DYF6U4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0Y130A#wasThisHelpful","RGLWU64DYF6U4","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is excellent.  It can be used as a fun activity book, as a supplement, or even as a primary in home-schooling. It's that good. Perfect for giving your child a head-start before they enter pre-school, or as a supplement while they are in preschool. The illustrations are done in the same drawing style and design as the classic books most of us grew up with.  There are short stories, learning tracing with simple shapes, tracing and writing letters and numbers, shapes, and other fun activities to keep learning fun. That's what makes this book so great. It's fun on every page from the illustrations and simplicity of it that will help children stay focused. There are also letter flash cards in the back of the book the book that can be cut-out. There's also number flash cards (up to 10). At the end of every section there are Achievement pages, and there are 100 stickers in the back (12 are achievement stickers and the rest are animals, food, items, and Curious George's face in the classic style).  And there is a final completion Certificate in the back when the child completes the book.  The organization of the chapters and learning process is excellent.  The dimensions of the book are 10.75"" H x 8.25"" W x 0.75"" D (thick).

"I love these blades, and also the Bosch Icon blades. Both are excellent blades.  They have lasted at last a year or more over the last decade. I installed them on a 2000 Camry LE, and a 2010 Camry SE, and the 24"" and 20"" blades fit perfectly.  This 24"" blade is just 2 mm short of 24"", and same goes for the 20"" blade.INSTALL: Installing the blades is a breeze for hook assemblies. Not sure about the other two types. The instructions for the hook are decent, really easy for anyone who's done it before, but if it is your first time, have someone show you how to do it.DESIGN: The wiper blade assembly is curved when not installed, composed of a single rubber blade and five plastic segments holding the blade. When the blade is installed on a windshield, the curve of the blade is made flat, and this means that the pressure required will keep the blade on the windshield and provide clean, smooth wipes.MAINTENANCE: If blades stop wiping cleanly and smoothly, lift them up, and place them gently back onto the windshield to allow for a better seating.  But, while you have them up, be sure to wipe down the rubber blade ever 2 to 4 weeks to keep them working like new.  You'll notice how much dirt builds up on the blades.  Wipe your windshield too.I've used other brands too, like TRICOFLEX and RAIN-X.  The Bosch ICON and INSIGHT have plastic assemblies that are slightly heavier, bigger, and wider/thicker than the TRICOFLEX.  The TRICOFLEX worked okay for me.  The RAIN-X wipers worked well for me, but not as good as the Boschi ICON or INSIGHT.  Others may have different experiences, but these are what have been reliable for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGYJL9M0M0KUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWNZ1LG#wasThisHelpful","RGYJL9M0M0KUA","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice magnet set. You get one of each letter, in a wooden case. The cover of the case is a thin piece of plastic that slides away, and it holds all 26 letters, tightly though. Sometimes you will need to remove some letters, re-position them, and try sliding the cover again. The case measures 10.75"" W x 4.5"" H x 1.25"" D.  Each letter is 2"" in height, and 1/8"" in thickness. The entire back of each letter is magnetic, but the magnetic layer is thin.  While the magnetic layer is thin, they do stick well to magnetic surfaces and stay stuck. It appears to be the right amount of magnetic strength. Children 3 years and older should be able to remove the letters off a magnetic surface easily. They can also be pushed around on a magnetic surface. The magnetic strength is strong enough to hold the letters up, which are also light to begin with, and not fall off a vertical surface.  The letters are light, so even if they fall on a child's foot, they won't feel any pain.  The corners/edges of each letter is smooth.  The handle on the case is made of the same material used for backpacks, but it feels like it will tear away after some use.  The handle quality and design could be better.

"Thanks to the next-gen hardware, the setting and landscapes of Paris is amazing, as is the massive scale.  Animations are smooth, the detail impressive, and the crowds are full.  Movement is really good and responsive. Graphics draw deep into the distance and still look detailed. The character can be upgraded, and that's one of the best parts of the game. There are so many different choices and paths to go down when upgrading.Some of the levels can be frustrating, like in the stealth missions, where your character won't do what you want him to do, especially when you need to take cover.  The story can get boring for some missions, but others are very enjoyable and engaging. The pick-pocketing skill is removed from this game, and that was one of the more fun things to do in prior games.  There are definitely some bugs/glitches in the game where you will get stuck and have to restart the mission.Unity is a good game in the series, but it's not as good as the prior games in the series. Black Flag, the prior game in the series, plays a lot better.  If you've played the other games in the series, Unity isn't anything special. If this is your first Assassin's Creed game, it's a good game, but definitely check out the other games in the series for better stories, characters, and action.The single player is fun, but it becomes even more fun when playing the 2-player or 4-player multiplayer.

"These are standalone alarms. They DO NOT connect to a main console (and cannot call out and cannot notify your phone). They work independently of one another. This pack contains three door/window alarms, and a larger keypad door alarm.  They are made for dry, interior locations. They run on batteries. If you are not home and the alarms are triggered, they will sound a loud 120dB siren that can be heard outside and is very uncomfortable inside. The build quality is medium quality, but they do work and are reliable. They are an inexpensive alternative to home security systems (which include a console).  Because these are standalone alarms and are NOT connected to a console, they CANNOT call you or notify the police. They are just a siren. Useful for when you are home.  And when you are not home, they will make a loud noise to bring attention to your alarmed area. The Keypad Door Alarm and the three window/door alarm sensors DO NOT work together. They DO NOT communicate with each other. Each of the four alarms works separately.A) Keypad Door Alarm - requires three AAA batteries (not included), in the back, behind a screw. The keypad accepts a four digit code that you set. You can choose either the CHIME setting (alert) or ALARM setting (siren).  You can also choose a delay for the alarm so you get 45 seconds delay for exit after entering code, or 30 seconds for entry to enter the code and disarm the system. The sensor can be mounted on either the left side or right side of the keypad. Mounting screws and plastic anchors, and double-sided tape is included. The tape is thin and I would prefer if it was double the thickness. Size of the keypad alarm is 4"" H x almost 2.75"" W x 1.25"" D.B) Three window/door alarm sensors - Each alarm requires four LR44 batteries (all 12 batteries included). The LR44 batteries are the small button/cell batteries. Check availability and pricing on them for future replacements. The batteries are in the front, under a slide cover. The siren is loud when the alarm is triggered, but it is possible to pull down the cover and remove the batteries. So be sure to put them out of reach when mounting.

"These are a great, inexpensive way to add security protection, and a great alternative for an alarm system.  These are Stand-alone alarms, meaning they DO NOT require an alarm system. They will not work with a security console either.  Each alarm works independently of one another.Each main piece contact is 2.5"" H x 1.25"" W x 0.5"" D in size. The thin piece contact has a width of 0.25"" and the same H and D measurements as the main piece contact.  The contact (thin vertical part) can go on either side of the main contact. This provides convenience in being able to position it almost anywhere.  The alarm is loud enough to be heard across the hall for apartments, and in other rooms of a house.You can choose either an ALARM or a visitor CHIME as the setting. The Alarm will sound a loud alarm if opened (great for when you are sleeping or away), while the Chime will make a nice single sound to let you know when someone opened a door (great for while you are home).  It's easy to switch between the OFF / ALARM / CHIME modes. There is double-sided adhesive pads included , and they work, but I think they should be thicker to provide better and lasting adhesive (depends where you place your contact/alarm). When the contacts separate more than 15mm, the alarm sounds until the contact meet again, or until the alarm is disarmed. With the CHIME setting, it will make a single sound and turn off.Requires 4 x LR44 batteries. They are included in the pack.  Make sure you can purchase additional batteries from somewhere if you plan on using these alarms for a long time. There is a 90 Day Limited warranty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YKH62OKZX925/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M30SKM0#wasThisHelpful","R2YKH62OKZX925","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The quality is excellent. This isn't a liquid oil, but it is a solid form of the oil (up to 76 degrees F, which is the melting point), which can be easily scraped/shaved easily out of the bottle with a spoon. The bottle comes fully sealed with a foil cover inside, and because it is solid inside, there is no chance of it spilling when the oil is a solid. There are a lot of advantages of this coconut oil, and they are the Non-GMO and Non-Hydrogenated claims. The bottle is also a non-BPA container.It also have many uses. You can eat it directly with a spoon and it tastes great. You can use it in cooking since it has a neutral scent and flavor, and used in cooking up to 400 degrees. It can be used as a replacement for butter. It can also be used for skin care and hair care as a moisturizer, or lubricant for shaving.  The label says it is a Vegan product. And there is no refrigeration required. But it is bottled in a facility that packs peanut oil (in case you are allergic).The coconut oil is a product of the Philippines, manufactured for Nutiva.

"This is a medium-sized printer that works great as a general printer, scanner, copier, and photo printer. The printer measures 17.5"" W x 6"" H x 14.5"" D.  The printer has a black matte finish, and that's a good thing to prevent any fingerprint marks. The buttons have a plastic feel, made of medium density quality plastic.The LCD screen on the front measures 2"" W x 1.5"" H. It is very clear for text and images, nice high resolution for a small screen.  The scanner bed is 8.5"" x 11.5"", great for scanning letter size documents. The scanner lid also raises to accommodate thicker objects.The USB and power connections are in the back, all the way to the left. The power cable is 5 ft 2 inches long, non-polarized 2-prong plug.  A USB cable is NOT included, so you need to buy one if you want to directly connect to the printer. The printer also allows for a Wireless network connection.  It's fairly easy to setup the printer, it just requires some time cycling through letters to enter your network name (SSID) and password.  The software that comes on the CD is decent. I like Canon software for printers. It's straightforward and works reliably for me.  Once the printer is connected to your wireless network, any device on your network  can print to it, whether it's tablets, smartphones, laptops, or desktops.There are five ink cartridges included: Cyan, Yellow, Magenta, Black, and Pigment Black (for photos).  The current price of ink cartridges are $35 to $40 for the 4 pack single size color cartridges (CYMB), and same price for the 2 pack of double size Pigment Black. The sample pack of paper is five sheets of 4"" x 6"" glossy photo paper.From my experience, when using any of these types of printers for printing photos, the cartridges will be empty after maybe eight to ten 8 x 10's, or twenty 4 x 6's. Depends on the photos and the colors in the photos.Note: There is a piece of orange tape in the back, that holds the roller tray. Remember to remove the tape so you can push the roller left to unlock to remove any papers during paper jams.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39ARCC2XH6RHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOSGSC0#wasThisHelpful","R39ARCC2XH6RHL","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really great program that runs smoothly.  It comes with 3 licenses.  But there is no CD. It's a card with a serial number on the back.

For ONLINE BACKUP, you have 3 licenses to use, each offering 1GB of online storage. Unlimited storage is available for the current price of $60 per year.  The process is straightforward, and an easy step-by-ste process. You can work while it runs the backup.As for the SHREDDER, choose the folder you want to remove permanently, and shred it.There are PC and Home Network Tools.  You can get a view f all the devices connected to your home network. Useful tool for seeing if others are connecting to your network or if you have devices connected that you forgot about.

"These are very average claws. They aren't bad, but there isn't anything good about them. They look great from the picture, but don't fit so great. I have medium size hands for a male. The blue gloves extend past my elbows, and is 16"" from wrist to past my elbows near my bicep. The claws extend about 14"".  My hands did get sweaty within the costume gloves.  Now the issue with the fit. The claws connect into a piece under the glove. That piece should sit on top of your knuckle area. But it doesn't sit properly where it is supposed too, so the claws dangle over instead of being straight extended.  Maybe if I wear thick gloves underneath for a better fit, but my hands would sweat even more.  These are okay for a short time, but after a few minutes I wanted to take them off and leave them off unless someone asked to see them on.The claws are also very close together, they are touching in mine.  So it looks awkward.  The colors are accurate though. The blue is very nice and the claws are silver and a hard plastic.

"This is a fantastic scissor for home and office use. Cut through paper, card stock, thin cardboard, felt, and fabric with ease.  From the point to the rubber handle end, it is 8"" in length. The steel blade portion is 3.5"" long of the 8"".  The handle is 3.5"" wide, and covered in gray hard plastic, and the orange part is rubber, It just cuts so smoothly. The blades are molded into the handles, so they won't come loose.  The titanium bond is all around the blade, and it definitely helps the blade last longer. I have another Westcott Titanium Bonded Scissor, and it's been working flawlessly for three years.Note: This is a strong scissor, but not meant for cutting the plastic blister packs that some items come in.

"Item: Maidenform Women's Flexees Shapewear Firm Control Camisole.It works. The version I am reviewing is the FIRM control version, and it provides decent smoothing.  There is another version ULTRA FIRM if you need more smoothing. The material is really nice and durable. The material is 70% nylon and 30% elastane. The interior has a slightly textured material to grip to your undershirt (or body), and the exterior is smooth to allow for any type of clothing to sit easily on the camisole. It looks and fits exactly as it looks in the picture. The camisole is a single piece, but it is stitched in the center under the chest. The top portion that sits on the chests/breasts, is a single layer and provides some smoothing/compression. The portion from the bottom of the chest to the bottom (waist) is two layers, providing even more smoothing/compression. This does a great job of smoothing if you have someThe straps also adjust for taller women. Depending on your activity and what you are wearing underneath, the camisole may shift/ride up a little.

"This is a useful device. It works, is reliable, and does a decent job of notifying people around you. I think the alarm could have been slightly louder. The current 100dB is loud, but I would have preferred if it was even louder.The device comes in an easy to open plastic clam package.It is 3"" long (or 3.125"" to be exact).  The width is 1.75"" at its widest, and 1"" at the top. As for the thickness, it seems to be about 1"" thick at its thickest. It is very light, about the same as six quarters with the battery installed. A CR2 battery is included, along with the 6"" strap.LED LIGHT: The white LED light is on the front (top) of the device. The center gray button works the LED light. It's nice and bright for illuminating items within a foot, like the car door lock, etc. The LED will light dark areas 10 to 15 feet away with a medium amount of light, and provides a low amount of light for objects 20 feet away.  If someone looks directly into the LED, it is strong enough to temporarily blind someone for a few seconds, but it's not powerful.PANIC ALARM: The strength of the alarm is 100 dB. It's loud when you are in a silent area, whether outside or inside, possibly to 100 feet, and maybe even 200 feet depending on the area. If there is noise constant noise around you, the alarm may be noticeable to people near you, but maybe not people who are 100 feet away. The red light also blinks and does provide additional notification that it's an emergency.  The red LED light should be brighter and more noticeable. The button for the alarm should be more prominent. It is the third button, the one under the gray button.  During an emergency, during panic, one may end up pressing the round gray center button instead of the panic button under it.  Turning the alarm on and off is easy. Press and hold one second to activate, and press and hold for two seconds while it's on to turn it off.There are two additional alarm options, separate from the PANIC alarm. The INSTANT ALARM and DELAY ALARM can be armed using the top button.INSTANT ALARM: Press and hold the top button to arm, you have 20 seconds to set it at its location, and then it arms. Any movement will activate the alarm instantly. Great for putting in stationary purses, luggage, anything that you want to make sure isn't moved, and notifies you instantly if it is moved. The alarm will sound for 3 minutes and then turn off and reset it back to being armed as you had set it.DELAY ALARM: This is useful for putting on doorknobs. Set the alarm, place it on the doorknob, and it arms. When the door is moved, the device has to swing to detect movement, so a door opening very slowly may not trigger it. When the door swings open, the device LED blinks rapidly, and you have 20 minutes to disarm it. Just hold the button to disarm it. If it is not disarmedin 20 seconds, the alarm sounds. The alarm will sound for 3 minutes and then turn off and reset it back to being armed as you had set it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26JQRQ8LE0ETX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JF6YRUE#wasThisHelpful","R26JQRQ8LE0ETX","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The paint job on each figure is quite good.  No paint running or splotches. Each figure has weapons that can be held in their hands. The two big figures are decent overall.SPORTS CAR (CAR) Measures 5"" front to back x 2.25"" wide x 1.25"" H.  The wheels don't sit flush, so they don't move smoothly, but they do move when pushing the car on a hard surface.(ROBOT) When transforming from car to robot, some of the pieces (arms) did pop off their joints. They are ball joints, and I was able to pop them back into place like it never happened. Figure measures 5.5"" H x 4.5"" W x 2"" D (at the feet)  and 1"" D (at the body.  The shoulders and elbows move at the joints, the knees, feet, and the leg joints at the waist move.(OVERALL) The figure is a 4 out of 5. What I didn't like as the plastic thinness, and the feet don't sit flat on the ground.  It's a decent figure overall.MOTORCYCLE (CAR) - The back wheel doesn't spin or touch the ground in car mode.  Motorcycle measures 2.5"" front to back x 1.25"" in height x 0.75"" wide.(ROBOT) Measurements are 2"" H x 1"" W x 0.75"" depth.(OVERALL) The figure seems so plain and boring as a figure. It is a small figure, so I didn't expect much. It does stand by itself. Arms and legs move, but there are no elbow and knee joints since the arms and legs are single pieces. Head does not move. Hands do not move. 2 out of 5 for this figure.AMBULANCE (CAR)- The wheels move smoothly most of the time, sometimes one of the wheels doesn't move. Paint job is quite good. As a car, it measures 4.25"" front to back, 1.75"" wide, and 2"" tall at its highest point.(ROBOT) As a robot, it measures 5.25"" H x 3"" W x 2.5"" front to back. The robot stands by itself. Transforming it from car to robot was kind of difficult. Even though the transformation process is provided step by step, it's not completely clear, and trying to find the exact points to lift, turn, or pull out is not easy.  It took about 10 minutes to transform the first time. As a robot, it stands by itself and stays standing after positioning it properly.(OVERALL) The overall quality of the figure is decent. It's made of light medium thickness plastic. For a figure this size, it seems to be okay. Arms and Legs, Hands, and feet all move.  Joint as the knees and joints at the torso where the legs connect all move. Shoulders and elbows move at the joints.  4 out of 5 for this figure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JRRUO338P18T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILA28H4#wasThisHelpful","R2JRRUO338P18T","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Number 2 plastics are one of the safest plastics. The material is hollow, but the shell is somewhat thick. It is durable. Each of the four wheels spins independently. It rolls better on carpet than it does on flat surfaces. One of the wheels does get suck sometimes for a second or two. The top of the elephant has a handle for kids to carry it easily.

"This is a great case. The interior main area, with blue lining, is really well padded to provide exceptional protection for any lens. It can accommodate lenses that are smaller than 8 inches tall and 3.75"" in diameter. This case provides a safe place to put a second lens while changing a lens. You cannot fit a DSLR camera in the case. Only lenses.  One of the pictures looks like it has a DSLR, but I couldn't fit my T3i or 5DM2.EXTERIOR: The dimensions of the case are 9.5"" H x 6.5"" W x 4.5"" D.INTERIOR: The dimensions of the interior are 8"" H x 5"" W x 3.75"" D.When unzipped, the top portion folds over to present an additional area to store a lens while you are replacing a lens.PADDING: The padding inside the main area (blue lining) is excellent. Nice and thick. However, the padding on the top (the portion that folds over) could use some more padding, similar to how thick the bottom is, especially when placing a lens in there during lens replacement.The shoulder strap is 40"" long and comes with plastic connectors with metal clips. You can see it in the pictures. This is an advantage because most fully plastic clips always break over time.  The shoulder strap also has a nice thick padded area that makes it very comfortable when it sits on your shoulder for long periods of time.There are two mesh pockets, one on each side, 4"" x 4"" flat, made of breathable mesh.  The zippers are durable, medium-thick quality. Overall, this is an excellent case. You cannot strap it to your belt since there aren't any slide-through connectors. It only has the top handle, and the shoulder strap for carrying.  I guess if your belt was a small belt, less than an inch in height, you might be able to slide your belt through the connectors meant for the should strap.  The top handle is nice and thick and good quality too.There is also a nice weather protector cover which stretches slightly and covers the front, top, and bottom of the case. The back of the case, which rests against your body is left open.  There are velcro straps to secure the cover around the connector clips of the shoulder strap.  The quality of the weather cover is a light-medium thickness, and medium durability.Lastly, be careful when opening the box with a box cutter to prevent cutting the case.

"I love the taste of the Rich Chocolate Boost. It tastes good, it provides vitamins and minerals, and energy in case I want to supplement a meal, or just have it as a snack. I do feel hungry again in 2 hours, but sometimes, that's all the time I need to continue doing whatever I'm doing until the next meal. The bottles are clear plastic, wrapped in an opaque label. The inside of the label is completely black to keep the contents safe from light. Each bottle is 8 oz, made of strong disposable plastic, resealable, and is 5.75"" tall and 3.25"" wide. the 24 pack comes as two 12 packs.I usually drink it at room temperature and love the taste. I've been drinking Ensure and Boost for a year now. You can put it in the refrrigerator, but not the freezer, and if you open it and don't finish it, it should be finished within 24 hours.Boost is Gluten-Free, and suitable for individuals with lactose intolerance. But they are not for individuals with galactosemia.  Each serving size (1 bottle) contains 20 grams of sugar. It does seem high, but cut sugar out of your other meals/drinks. Each serving provides 10g of protein.There are NO artificial sweeteners like sucralose, aspartame, or acesulfame potassium like some Ensure bottles contain. Boost does use corn syrup and stevia leaf extract as sweeteners. If you are drinking Boost for the first time, you may notice the taste is just okay. You do get used to it. Any drink that is loaded with vitamins and minerals usually has an off-taste. But to help the taste, they add sugar and chocolate. But that means the sugar content is 20g. Compare this with your all other drinks you consume in a day to see how it compares.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M8T7UXKTAS9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LWUP02A#wasThisHelpful","R3M8T7UXKTAS9G","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First thing I noticed upon opening the box was the pleasant smell even while the rolls were still in their plastic wrap. It's not strong or overbearing, and it's completely mild and pleasant. The tissues are indeed soft. They break apart easily in water unless you layer them. They leave little to no residue.  Each sheet measures 4"" x 4"".  They appear to be just a slight bit smaller than the other brands of rolls I have, about 1/8"" shorter. The sheets have a pleasant floral design. They are soft enough for wiping your face or nose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PF2MSRY5QN4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L3EA4M6#wasThisHelpful","R3PF2MSRY5QN4K","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This air stone is is 1.5"" in diameter, and 0.5"" thick. It lets out a lot of air bubbles, kind of like an effervescent tablet (like Alka Selzer) dropped into a glass of water. The stone is heavy enough, but I can't seem to get it to lay flat on the bottom. I have a flexible tube attached to it, and it just doesn't want to stay down even after trying to bury it under gravel.. It stays vertical or diagonal, but not flat. Because of the very high amount of bubbles it creates, I have to split the air or decrease the air going to it. It's too much. it seems to be a good quality stone and will last for a long time. There is very little gravel or dust from the air stone. I soaked it in water for a few hours and tested it in a water bin before trying it out in my aquarium. Once I put it in, the fish were interested in it, but scared to go through the bubbles since it was powerful. They go through the other bubble wall I have since it outputs a lot less bubbles (10"" x 2"" piece), but this this stone creates a lot of air bubbles in a 20 gallon long tank, and the fish will look at the bubbles but not get near it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ID0Q60SRAHX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050HJ7Q6#wasThisHelpful","R3ID0Q60SRAHX0","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This definitely does let out a good amount of bubbles. When I first got it, I soaked it in a water bin for a few hours. Then just lightly scrubbed it with a regular toothbrush. After connecting to an air tube, I could only get it to let bubbles out when it was vertical or diagonal. Nothing came out when it was flat. I lightly brushed it again and then it started letting out air in about 33% of its length when it was flat. So I put it in my 20 gallon tank. laid it flat at the bottom, and it was working fine. I upgraded my pump to a double air-pump, and let one of the outputs directly to this air stone. Now about 75% is creating bubbles after about 3 weeks of use. I see a small amount of bubbles being created in the remaining 25%, but a very small amount, like the size of a pen point. So for me, about 75% works now and it creates a nice bubble wall that the fish love to swim through, play in, and just let the bubbles carry them up.  Make sure both ends are tight, and test it in a water bin first before placing in your aquarium.  Scrub it a bit with a light toothbrush if nothing is coming out.  And make sure you are using a strong pump too. If you split the air, it may not be getting the maximum of air it requires.  It is heavy enough to stay at the bottom, but I did bury it under some gravel to hide the plastic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLZIISMIKIVP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002564ZI#wasThisHelpful","RLZIISMIKIVP4","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Item: Black and Decker TO3250XSB 8-Slice Extra Wide Toaster OvenThis toaster oven works well, looks great, and cooks evenly using convection technology. Convection technology has been around for a long time now, and the way it works is it uses a fan to blow around the hot air to keep moisture in the food. It works well, includes some accessories, and does a good job of cooking evenly using convection. The fan is what is noticeable when the oven is on.  While it's not loud, it not quiet either. It's enough to let you know the oven is on if you are in the same room.Be careful when opening the box to prevent the top of the oven from being scratched by your boxcutter/scissor. There is a one inch clearance between the top of the oven and top of the box, so use a small blade to cut the tape on the box.  When using the oven, it does get hot all over, the front/back, sides, top/bottom, so don't place anything on top of the oven or next to it when in use.Dimensions (Exterior): 11.5"" H x 22"" W x 15"" D (roughly 2"" in the back of the oven extrudes, included in the 15"").  Of the 11.5"" H, the feet are 1.5"" in height and do a good job of raising the oven from the ground.  This is very important since the entire oven gets hot and shouldn't be touched.Dimensions (Interior): 6"" usable height, but trays should be shorter in case contents rise. There is more space vertically, but they are used up by the heating coils. 16"" wide. 10.5"" D.  While the 10.5"" D extends all the way back.PLUG: The grounded three-prong plug comes out of the bottom of the oven, near the back right. The plug is only 23"" long (less than 2 ft).ACCESSORIES: The included CRUMB TRAY fits the bottom interior completely. It slides in and removes easily. If you bend down and get eye-level with the bottom of the oven, you'll see the gap where the crumb tray slides in/out without opening the glass door.The BAKING TRAY is 13.5"" W x 7.5"" L.  The depth is 0.65"".  All accessories are medium-grade quality and medium thickness. They appear to be made of thick aluminum.The RACK is what the trays will rest on. The rack sets in near the bottom of the oven, but it can be put in at the top too for BROILING. The rack sits about 2.5"" under the heat coil if you put the rack at the top.GLASS DOOR: The glass doorpulls down and stops when it is perpendicular to the oven (90 degree angle).  It only has two positions, fully closed or fully open.The glass door gets very hot when cooking, so never touch it.  The handle is 1.5"" away from the glass, so you can easily and comfortably pull the handle to open/close the door. It will be comfortable with people with medium sized hands. I'm a male with medium sized hands. If you have larger/thicker fingers, it may still be comfortable, but you may also be getting closer to the glass then.KNOBS: The look and quality of the knobs are nice. There are three knobs: TOP is the main knob, where you can set the oven temperature, or the BROIL or TOAST option.  The MIDDLE knob has the STAY ON option (required when using the oven and temperatures of the top knob), and the timer options.  The BOTTOM knob is specifically for the toast timer. The range is wide and allows you to get the precise toast level you want.OVEN: To use the oven, set the middle knob to STAY ON, and then set the top knob to the temperature preferred. It took 4 minutes and 30 seconds to get from a cold oven to 350 degrees internally. You can also use the middle knob to set the TIMER. The oven works convectionally, meaning the oven heats up , but is aided by a fan to blow around the hot air to keep the food from drying out and keep moisture in.TOAST: To make toast, set the top knob to TOAST. Then set the bottom knob to the desired toast level.TIMERS: The sound of timer clicks counting down is noticeable from within the same room, but the completion ding can be heard in an adjacent room.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R49XUV73U23NL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2I428#wasThisHelpful","R49XUV73U23NL","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The blade is 8"" long, and 1.75"" wide near the handle. The handle is 5"" long, and 1.25"" wide. The blade is 1/16"" thick at its thickest. The blade is ultra sharp out of the box. It cuts anything easily, even thick corrugated cardboard. The handle is made of soft rubber, but not flexible, and it is rounded so it fits easily in your hand.  It fits perfectly in my medium-sized hands (male) to cut anything easily and be able to apply the right amount of pressure. The handle is nice, but it is a basic, plain handle all-around. Personally, I would have preferred some grip marks or something to make the grip even better. It won't slip out of your hands, and the grip is good enough to make sure of it.I own various knives, but I'm probably an intermediate user. I don't own any high-end of professional knives. This knife is useful in cutting fruits and vegetables throughout the day.  I don't use this knife on meat since I have a different knife for cutting chicken.BUILD: The blade seems strong and barely bends. Bends side to side only a very small amount with force. So that's good. The blade is securely placed in the handle and does not move.  The knife is very lightweight. It weighs 4.7 oz, which is roughly the weight of 24 quarters. The blade is very light, and most of the weight comes from the handle.When using this knife, it should always glide smoothly. Never apply a lot of force. If it doesn't slice easily, then the blade needs sharpening. If you apply too much force, the chance of slipping increases greatly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JYR0RIRZ1QSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004OCJ7#wasThisHelpful","R2JYR0RIRZ1QSV","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Chia seeds are fantastic. The bag contains 100% Chia Seeds (Salvia Hispanica), product of Mexico. They don't have any taste. The bag comes filled to the top, is resealable, and it reseals well. The seeds are extremely small, and great for mixing into anything. The serving size is 1 tablespoon, but I use 1 teaspoon, and add it to a glass of almond milk or regular milk, and drink it right away. If you let the seeds sit in a liquid for a minute or two, they will start to swell up and double in size, and they develop a gelatinous exterior similar to tapioca (in bubble tea), but they are much smaller in size. There is no need to grind them up since they are very small to begin with. You can add them to anything.

"I've used glue traps before and they do work. One morning I found a mouse trapped in the glue, couldn't move at all, and it started panicking when I started getting close to it. In order to remove caught pests, just use a long handled utensil and wipe the pest off into a garbage can or however you dispose of pests.  These glue traps can also be used for catching various bugs.These trays are somewhat light, and weigh 3.35 oz, about the same weight as 17 US quarters.The glue is very sticky. I touched it with my finger and it was stuck to my finger.  The two trays come facing each other, without covers.  The glue is so strong that is stays put even when the tray is upside down, and doesn't move.Each trap is 9.5"" L x 4.5"" W and has a thickness of 3/8"".  The glue is filled up to half of the trap thickness, so it has about 3/16"" thickness of glue. Great for catching mice, and most rats. Larger rats may be able to drag the tray with them.There are a few points that stick up within the trap where you can put your bait gel or peanut butter. I use these in combination with the plastic teeth traps, and the glue traps always work. All mice and most rats will be stuck in the glue, unable to move. A few larger rats that don't get all four feet stuck in the glue may be able to drag the tray.The glue traps are also effective in catching anything else besides mice and rats: snakes (smaller ones), cockroaches, scorpions, spiders, bugs.  Because the glue doesn't run and stays in place, you can hang these traps vertically if necessary, to catch lightweight pests.Once the traps are full of pests, either throw away the whole tray, or wipe everything off and whatever glue remains can still be used to trap more pests.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R362H6X6DLGP8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QV1CNW#wasThisHelpful","R362H6X6DLGP8M","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a fan of these old fashioned kind of traps. These are effective, but there are better traps out there. This mostly does what it's supposed to do, catch mice.  These traps are lightweight. One of the traps was 0.75 oz. The other was 0.65 oz. That's light. The same weight as three quarters (0.6 oz) or four quarters (0.8 oz).  It depends on the size of your mice and strength of your mice and how they attack the bait piece. In order to release a caught mouse, you need to pull the U-bar back, so your fingers may touch or get very close to touching the killed or still alive pest.The entire trap is 4"" H x 1.75"" W x 3/16"" D (thick).  The bait block, which looks like cheese, is made of plastic, and has a small area to apply gel or peanut butter. Trying to set the trap does take a few tries to get it right. Sometime the pin just doesn't want to stay in the lock. But it does set, and once it does set, it stays that way until the bait block is triggered. And it's not completely sensitive as to undesirably trigger as soon as you put it down. You can move it around once the trap is set without it triggering. Once the trap is set, it requires very little weight on the bait block to trigger. It snaps quickly and will crush anything there.  The trap is durable and will last. The materials used to make it are good quality materials.These traps did work for me, and did catch a mouse. I use these as a third option in combination with the glue traps and the plastic teeth traps (heavy duty traps).It depends on how the mouse attacks the piece. If the bar gets the neck, the mouse dies instantly. The body or tail, it may be able to drag the trap away with it.  I don't normally use these kinds of traps because of the difficulty in setting, the light weight, and possibly having to touch the trapped pest when getting rid of the pest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R225RW8BT4E5VO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FCCZEM#wasThisHelpful","R225RW8BT4E5VO","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic faucet. Easy to install using the included instructions with full diagrams.  Looks great, functions smooth. Such a beauty to look at.  Everything needed to install is included. What you need to provide is your own screwdriver, wrenches, sealant, and thread seal tape. A stopper (drain plug) is also included. There's also an anti-vandal option that holds the stopper in place to prevent someone from taking it.NOTE: This faucet includes a deckplate for a single hole faucet replacement. If you current have three holes, you need to purchase the separately sold three hole deckplate: Moen Item: 147204.Build and Movement: The entire faucet has a thick, solid build. Very high quality. It has a glossy look, but it does collect fingerprints, so be sure to wipe it down to keep it looking bright and glossy.  The handle has some nice weight to it and requires a little effort. It's not loose, but it has the right amount of resistance. The handle is about 1/4"" thick. The head swivels halfway to the right or left for cold or hot.Measurements: From the deckplate, the faucet is 6"" in height, slightly less than 1 and 3/4"" wide and same amount deep (1.65"" wide and 1.65"" deep).  The handle is 3.75"" long. The spout extends 3.25"" long.  The hot and cold hoses are 26"" long.The design of the spout is completely level to the faucet. If you have this faucet level, after you turn off the water, a little bit of water may go under the spout. If the faucet is just a slight bit at an angle forward, this shouldn't happen.

"These mouse traps are quite effective at catching mice. The trap is 4"" long, 1.75"" wide, and slightly less than 2.25"" in height.  The whole trap is made of hard plastic. The teeth are molded into the plastic. It's very easy to remove the bait cup from the bottom of the trap, fill it, place it back in, and set the trap. Once the trap is set, it stays that way. It's perfectly sensitive to whenever anything steps onto the trigger tray. It snaps instantly and will do a great job of catching mice and anything else that tries to get the bait. And on the plus side, it's not overly sensitive, meaning that it won't snap while you are putting the trap down in its location. It will only snap when something steps on the trigger tray. These traps should last a while since they seem to be well-made.As for the weight of these traps, they weigh 1.45 oz each. That is just slightly more than seven quarters (1.4 oz).  So, depending on how big your mice are, they may be completely killed by this trap, or they may be hurt but still be able to drag the trap a little bit. It depends on where the trap's teeth fall on the victim.

"This soil is excellent. But understand what you are getting. The bag is very light, and it's because the soil density is not dense at all. It's very airy. It is similar to the Miracle Gro Seed Starting Potting Mix, but just a tiny bit more dense. Because of the airiness of the soil, water flows freely through it, and drains out. It will hold and use the water it needs and the rest drains out.  Because of the Miracle Gro in the soil, plants will grow bigger and faster. The bag is only 1 cubic foot, so it will be used up very quickly.

"This is a really good canister for storing ingredients, whole, powder or liquid.  It is definitely airtight, and provides a clear view of its contents. It is 1.5 Qt of space inside, with about 1/4"" room to spare between the top of the lid. And it's lightweight at 14 oz (or 0.88 lbs or 400 g).  The bottom portion is only 6 oz (or 0.37 lbs) and the lid is 8 oz (or 0.51 lbs). The instructions do say that these containers are intended for dry food storage.  They can't be microwaved, but they can be put in refrigerators and freezers. Due to the changes in temperature, the change in air pressure may cause the lid to lift. Make sure you understand that if you plan on using it in hot or cold locations.The measurements of the canister are (without lid) 5.5"" H x 6"" W x 4"" D.  The lid adds about 5/8"" in height.  There are feet on the bottom, which are protrusions from the bottom, so they are made of plastic (no rubber grip so the canister will slide easily if you need it to). But these feet recesses are not on the inside. The interior bottom of the canister is completely flat.As for airtight, I filled my canister with water, locked it, and turned it upside down. No water came out.  So it's airtight. The lid interior is made of plastic and a rubber gasket that seals the lid to the canister. Push down on the top button to lock, and push again to unlock. Easy to use, and smooth pressing.SIZE: It is indeed 1.5 Qt, with just a bit of room to spare (about 1/4"" or 0.25"") between the top of the ingredients/powder/liquid and the bottom portion of the lid.  QUALITY: The lid is made of plastic and a brushed steel layer (layered onto plastic it feels like), which gives it a nice look.  The canister is made of a medium thick plastic, clear plastic, but with a gray color. And it is very lightweight.  The canister can be squeezed in barely, and it feels like it would not break if dropped from low heights.  It will break if you dropped it from maybe 10 feet or higher.CLEANING: If you need to clean the lid, the pieces of the lid do separate to allow for proper cleaning. Twist the lid to separate. You can remove the plastic piece and the silicone gasket. The silicone gasket is dishwasher safe, but all other parts must be handwashed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10MJ27QELCPM4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZA0MAQ#wasThisHelpful","R10MJ27QELCPM4","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Winix Air Cleaner does an excellent job of cleaning the air. I own a smaller Winix cleaner and that one is still working. This Winix Model U450 is a large unit. It measures 26' H x 19"" W x 11"" D. There's a handle in the back to allow for carrying, but it is kind of a heavy unit for an air cleaner at about 15 to 18 lbs. The power cord is 6.5 feet long, two prong plug. Compared to my older model, the Winix PlasmaWave 5300, which I bought four years ago, this U450 model is bigger in size, nearly double. The air vents are about 1"" wide and cover the entire sides from top to bottom. The air outlet grid is bigger too. The CADR is roughly 300 to 340 for smoke/dust/pollen.  And for the amount of air moved, it has a rating of 300 CFM.  This unit is excellent at cleaning the air. I own a less expensive Winix 5300 and a similarly priced Rabbit Air cleaner and this U450 model does a great job of cleaning the air all day long, and instantly if necessary.SOUND and SPEEDS: There are four speeds to the fan. When it's on QUIET, you can barely hear it, even while sleeping. So QUIET mode is perfect for sleeping. And when the light sensor detects darkness in the room, it will dim the light panel. The light panel is minimal to begin with, but the blue light from the LEDs may be bothersome to some people in a completely dark room.  I keep it on QUIET all day long when I put it on manual mode, but even when it's on AUTO mode, the unit usually has it on QUIET.  The MEDIUM speed is a good speed for cleaning the air if you know you have pollutants in the air. The sound of MEDIUM is noticeable from across the room.  The HIGH speed is definitely noticeable from another room. It's definitely a fast fan speed. I don't ever use this speed. And then there's TURBO. This is ultra fast and the noise of the unit working to pull air in and release it is noticeable from two rooms away. I don't ever use this speed neither.FILTERS: The filter comes in one piece, as three parts attached together: the washable prefilter (screen), the TRUE HEPA filter (weaved filter paper with thickness of 1""), and a washable carbon filter (honeycomb grid). The three pieces snap together and should be placed into the unit at one time. The screen and carbon grids last forever and can be vacuumed and washed. The HEPA filter can also be vacuumed and washed, but it only lasts for a year (or more depending on use) until the filter paper looks too dirty to reuse. Check the pricing on replacement filters. For my old Winix, I usually went through one HEPA filter every two years. The filter assembly only fits one way, so if the two notches on the side don't line up flush, you have the filter assembly upside down. As for front to back, the screen is in the front facing you, and the carbon grid in the back facing the fan.PLASMAWAVE: This technology can be turned off if it bother you by holding the AUTO button for three seconds.  Same to turn it back on.  According to the manual, the PlasmaWave technology sends out OH molecules to combine with the hydrogen of airborne particles. The result is water molecules.  It only lasts for a nanosecond and you won't see or feel any water. And this technology DOES NOT produce any harmful ozone like the older ION technology cleaners used to.  Personally, I turn it off because I can feel something going on, and it makes me feel weird when I'm in the room. That's just me though because the other people in my house don't seem to experience anything.  Same goes for my other Winix and my Rabbit Air purifiers.For this purifier, the handle is in the back and because of the weight, the unit tilts forward when transporting. In my unit the filter inside moves forward. After placing it back down, I have to open the lid, and push the filter back into position. It only takes a few seconds, but consider transporting with two hands so it doesn't tilt forward.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20I6AMGNZ54MG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXV8KJ4#wasThisHelpful","R20I6AMGNZ54MG","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Item: Belkin N300 Wall-Mount Wi-Fi Range ExtenderThis extender really works. At first I had some trouble setting it up, but I figured out my mistakes. It sets up easily and definitely extends the signal.  First, this unit is small. It measures 2.5"" H x 2.5"" W x 1.5"" D.  It plugs into an outlet at the edge of your Wi-Fi network coverage area.  You will want to try a location in your coverage area that is 75% away from your wireless router.  If that doesn't work, then move it to 50% away from your router. The instructions are included in a PDF on a CD, and they are easy to understand. So far, this has been working without issues, and the signal is constant and reliable.My instructions on how I set it up:1) Using a laptop or wireless device, connect to your wireless network. Go to where the signal is only half a third of the full signal. Make sure you can use the Internet at this location.2) Plug in the range extender at a nearby outlet. It requires about twenty seconds to startup and then it will flash blue & amber alternating.3) Using the laptop/wireless device, connect to the wireless network called Belkin.setup (which is coming from the range extender).  Let it connect. It took a minute to connect, and even when I thought it wasn't connected, I just continued to the next step and it worked.4) Go to an internet browser and type in belkin.range to get to the setup process. It should bring up the setup screen in a few seconds if everything is connected. Choose your wireless network from the list, or if you don't broadcast your SSID like I do, then click on hidden network and specify the information there. After you enter your SSID and wireless network password, it should connect and complete.At the location I tested, I was getting 2 of 5 and 3 of 5 bars for my wireless signal. After installing the range extender, I get 5 of 5 bars, full signal. Using speedtest, Without the extender, with laptop at 75% away from the router in my coverage area, I went from 1.25 Mbps Download and 1.5 Mbps Upload speeds (using speedtest), to 11.5 Mbps DL and 5 Mbps UL.  Just as a frame of reference, when wired to my router, I get speeds of 18.5 Mbps DL and 5 Mbps UL using a cable modem and provider. And I'm using a 300 Mbps Belkin router, but I won't reach 300 Mbps for Internet traffic. When accessing other devices within my network and transferring files, I am able to get 200 and 250 Mbps speeds.The plug of the extender is a two-prong plug, both prongs the same size. And my range extender is not concave like the picture shows, but completely flat. The unit will not block both plugs. If you plug into the top outlet, the bottom outlet remains completely open to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BCU0WDCLGH22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6HKJKI#wasThisHelpful","R3BCU0WDCLGH22","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two of these Intermatic timers and both are easy to use and reliable. My first timer is about five years old now, and I've been using it about twelve times a year for a day or two each time, sometimes for a week during vacations, and it still works. My timer stayed in my outlets securely and never fell out. All my outlets are seven years old.  All lamps connected also stayed securely.The timer is made of hard, durable plastic. There are two sets of ON/OFF trippers (not three like in the picture), made of plastic, but they do the job well.  While the markings on the dial are half hours, the trippers can be set at any 15-minute interval due to the available slots.  The timer measures 3"" H x 3"" W x 2"" D. If you put it in the top outlet, it will block both outlets, but if you plug into the bottom outlet, it leaves the top outlet open for use.Instructions are very simple.1) Set the trippers at desired ON/OFF times. If you use both sets of trippers, you can do two completely different times of day/night.  Green tripper for start time, red tripper for stop time.2) Set the time of day by spinning the dial. The time of day is location at the top center of the dial.3) Connect your lamp or device to the outlet on the side of the timer.  The outlet is a 2-prong outlet with one prong bigger than the other. Make sure your lamp or device is switched to the ON position before or after plugging in, because when the timer switches to ON, the lamp/device will receive power supplied to it.4) Plug the timer into an outlet, and you'll hear a light ticking noise that signifies the timer is working. The plug on the timer is also a two-prong plug, with one prong bigger than the other. If your outlets are positioned correctly, the timer will plug in correctly (in an outlet, the left prong is usually the bigger of the two).There is an ON/OFF switch on top of the timer which will automatically turn ON/OFF based on the trippers, but you can use it as a manual override if you want to turn it ON/OFF regardless of the tripper locations.Always test the timer and your lamp/device the day before. You don't want to have a non-functioning lamp/device or the timer not work. But these timers are reliable. I've been using the same Intermatic times for the past five years.RATINGS: 125 VAC, 60 Hz;  15 A Resistive, 1875 W Tungsten, 15 A Inductive, and 1.3 HP motor load.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F0BW20J404F5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LBHBLEU#wasThisHelpful","R3F0BW20J404F5","ADFLPF6FI3W0O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLPF6FI3W0O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Went through half of the pack, and no issues at all with any of the discs. None of my drives write at 16X, so I usually burn at 8X or 12X, and I also run the verification process during the burn, and there are no errors. I've accessed these DVD-Rs a year later and the data was accessible without problems.  I also use these in a DVD Recorder connected to my satellite DVR, and they work  flawlessly. These are definitely consistent.

"Let me first say that Mackenna's Gold is in Widescreen, this is huge news since the original DVD release it's been very hard to find a Widescreen copy of the film.SONY did a pretty good job on this collection and selecting the films.

"I agree with few others, the quality of the video was better than some other reviewers and Blu-ray.com were talking about. The video is a lot better than the DVD and the audio sounds perfect. Now I haven't seen the special features so I can't review on that. I watched the whole movie and I had no problem with either video or audio looking or sounding different throughout the movie. I did think they should've done better on the opening credits in which the font didn't look sharper than other Blu-rays released.

"📌 Recently I have been visiting physical therapy due to pain in my shoulder and upper back, the physiotherapist told me that my whole back is very stiff due to the work and life style I follow. Usually the routing there starts with some warm up exercises and then finally electrical stimulation of upper back and shoulder muscles. Ohh what a relief to stiff muscles it provides.I have recently had a chance to try this Santamedical PM180 pulse massager and I straight away took it for a ride for the same relief and all I can say that this device works well, this is my first week of using it and I will update the review if the device gives me any kind of issues.🏁 All in all, I am impressed with the performance and usage of this device it works like a boon for people who don't get much time to exercise and need some relief from massage.📍 If I had 45 seconds to talk about this product to help making a buying decision I would say📤 light and small, which makes it easy to travel with this device.📤 portable device, works with battery which means you can use it anywhere and you don't need an outlet to use it.📤 powerful, with both pairs of electrodes I couldn't take the device to one third of intensity.📤 timer which can be set of multiple of 10 minutes to a maximum of an hour.📤 eventually you would need to replace the electrode pads after some time but this is something which is common with all massager / simulators.🏁 Neither I am a medical professional not I recommend this device to use as a solution for your long standing problem however if you need a portable massaging solution this is indeed a nice choice.📣 Final Recommendation : Small, portable & powerful pulse massager, such a relief !!🔮 ASIN : B00O9P2VLI📆 Tags : #trymeoncereviews, trymeoncereviews, #tmor, tmor, try, me, once, reviews, B00O9P2VLI,  #EZ_TENS_VIDEO📕 DISCLOSURE: A sample was provided for honest opinion and review.

" 1:35 Mins🎥 Detailed Video Review for product features & functions 🎥🏁 You will need this device if,- If your car/truck doesn't have Auxiliary sound or Bluetooth or USB input and you would like to play your own music via FM.- You can play the music without messing up the sound system of your car as this doesn't require any car specific installation.🏁 INSTALLATION- Plug in the car charging part of the device into the port.- Device turns on and displays the FM frequency being transmitted.- Turn on the bluetooth pairing mode by pressing the center button for about 5 seconds, blue light starts blinking.- Turn on bluetooth in your phone and look for H1, connect. Once done the blue light would stop blinking.- Tune your car FM radio to the frequency which is showing up in the transmitter display.- You're done!📍 If I had 45 seconds to talk about this product to help making a buying decision I would say :📤 Stylish construction📤 The FM transmitter also rotates to allow you to move it in appropriate position.📤 Red LED based display shows the volume and frequency.📤 Bluetooth range is appropriate to be used in car, so phone is not required to be kept next to the streambot.🔃 FM intensity is okay.📤 Connects to the previous paired device automatically so you don't need to pair your phone again.

"I was really hoping Amanita would glow.  Her skin is such a light, bright, luminous green it seems to glow – but sadly, she does not glow in the dark.  Amanita Nightshade is the Daughter of the Bad Seed of the Corpse Flower.  She is a bad seed indeed, and I think she has the strangest diary and personality of any Monster High Character.  Amanita speaks about herself in the third person, and she is selfish, greedy and vain.  She is her own BFF.  I have a feeling Amanita is poised to be the next big villain at Monster High.Her personality may be lacking, but her beauty is not.  As mentioned, Amanita has lovely green skin that is perfectly complimented by her long, shiny purple-blue hair.  In addition to her hair, Amanita has purple eyes, eyebrows, and lips.  Surrounding her eyes are a leaf decoration.Amanita is wearing a lovely dress made up of two separate parts.  The main part of her dress is a long dusty lavender-pink, wrap-around gauzy, ghostly dress.  The bottom portion of this dress is petal shaped and decorated with black twisting thorns and leaves, and the dress transitions in color from the dusty pink to green.  This dress is trimmed with black around the neckline, waist, and shoulders.  There is more trim on the front of the dress – dark purple ruffles that run vertically along some of the petal shapes.  Under this overlay she wears a mini dress with a black leatherette skirt and bright green top with a black thorny print.In her hair Amanita wears a black flower that looks like a twisted hibiscus bloom.  On her feet are black open toed heels with a leaf design.  The heel of her shoes is made up of a bulbous flower pod.  Amanita has ankle decorations that look like they are part of her shoes, but are not.  These accessories are flowing, green twisted vines that are decorated with a dark purple flower.  She also carries a black handbag with a flower petal design.Amanitas other accessories include an icoffin, a purple portfolio, her Diary (“The Unlife and Times of Amanita Nightshade Vol. 56), a spiky black bracelet, black dangle earrings, a thorny black necklace, a hairbrush and a doll stand. Amanita is the standard MH doll size, so she should be able to exchange clothing with most of the other ghouls.  Amanita has multiple points of articulation, so she can assume just about any pose.  Amanita is a very pretty doll, with a great color scheme.  I will look forward to finding out more about this unusual character.  (How she came to be sleeping in the DeNile crypt, and her feud with Medusa!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28ENX4CTSVV94/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MZ6OA62#wasThisHelpful","R28ENX4CTSVV94","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge Adventure Time fan, and was overjoyed when I discovered Hambo could be mine.  I love how much Marceline loves Hambo.  Well loved toys are always the best toys.Hambo is only about 8 inches high, so be prepared for him to be a bit small.  His details are perfect, with all of his boo-boo’s from the series.  He has patches, stitches, and stuffing that show his wear and tear.  Hambo’s stitching seems quite sturdy, but he is made of a light weight material and some of his patches are decals.  With this in mind, he will probably make a better collector’s toy than a “lovie” that is carried everywhere.Hambo is one of the most fun toys I have seen in a long time, and is definitely the greatest plushie.  I love my Hambo, and I’m sure you will too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHNXYMSVMP123/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPPH0LI#wasThisHelpful","RHNXYMSVMP123","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ginger Breadhouse is the Daughter of the Candy Witch (Hansel and Gretel), but has no interest in following in her famous mother's footsteps.  Ginger is a ""Rebel"" that would rather bake delicious cupcakes than think about"" luring kids to their candy coated doom"".  Ginger bakes the most wonderful sweets, and has the magical ability to bake secret spells into her food.Ginger has extra-long bright candy pink hair that she wears with bangs and two long pony tails.  Ginger's lips are bright pink and match her hair.  She has lovely cinnamon colored skin.  Ginger has light brown eyes (instead of purple like her animated version) and dotted makeup decorations around her eyes.  Ginger is all about candy and sweets.  She is wearing a tan and hot pink dress decorated with a print of ice cream sprinkles and gold glitter sprinkles. Her dress has a gold glitter train and over her dress she is wearing a short black bolo jacket.  Ginger's tights are the best part of her outfit - her tights are brown with light pink icing squiggles.Ginger has several accessories.  She comes with the glasses that she wears in the animated series - oversized round pink glasses that are decorated with lollipops.  Ginger has a really great handbag that is shaped like a black cauldron.  The handle of her bag is made of a golden spoon, and the top of the bag is bubbling over with gold decoration.  Ginger wears a black headband that is decorated with a cupcake.  The cupcake is in a golden wrapper and topped with hot pink frosting.  Ginger is wearing gold candy shoes with heels made of lollipops and ankle straps make of dripping hot pink candy and licorice twists.  Around her neck Ginger is wearing a large turquoise beaded necklace.Ginger comes with a doll stand, a hair brush, and a ""bookmark"" that tells her story.  Like all EAH dolls Ginger has multiple points of articulation and can be posed in just about any way imaginable. She is made for play, but has many small parts that can be fragile if handled roughly.  As a doll collector, I have been eagerly awaiting Ginger's release.  She is just adorable, and is a super sweet addition to Ever After High.(Please note:  my doll did not come with the pictured bracelet.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2218D9DBCE35T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QCBBHIU#wasThisHelpful","R2218D9DBCE35T","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lorna McNessie is the Daughter of the Loch Ness Monster, and a new exchange student at Monster High.  Lorna has striking bright blue-green colored skin that has a slight shimmer.  Her skin looks fantastic and perfectly complements her bright red wavy hair.  Lorna has bright aqua colored eyes and bright coral colored lips that show the fangs on her lower jaw.  Lorna has the best tail of any of the MH character.  Hers is attached (unlike other tails), can be turned from side to side, and is especially swoopy.  Her tail has multiple fins that imitate photographs of the Loch Ness Monster and her tail ends in a forked fin.  When changing her outfit you will notice that Lorna’s torso is embossed with a Celtic knot design.  This is a hidden detail – but so very cool!  I love it when Monster High includes this kind of surprise on a doll.  Lorna’s other monster attributes include scaled skin, webbed hands, fins on her forearms and lower legs, and ears that are finned shaped.Instead of a “diary” Lorna comes with a passport.  Her passport describes her life in “Rotland”, including details of her family life and her love of photobombing.  Lorna also has a small cardboard doll sized passport that fits perfectly into her handbag.  Her red handbag opens, and is covered with more Celtic knot work and the image of a lake monster.  Lorna is wearing a short sleeved red blouse with a black fish net print.  Her kilt/skirt has a lake monster print in colors of red, blue and black.  Lorna loves plaid, and she is wearing a plaid cap.  On her feet are high heeled shoes with heels made of stacked gray castle stones.  My favorite accessory Lorna has is the lake monster shaped earring she wears on her right ear.Lorna is a little smaller than most of the MH dolls.  She is 14 years old, so she is the little sister size of Howleen, Twyla, and River Styxx.  Lorna comes with the standard doll stand and hairbrush.  I am a long time Loch Ness Monster fan, so I was super excited to add the wonderful Lorna to my doll collection.  The designers did a great job of translating a famous lake monster into an adorable doll and Lorna McNessie is definitely one of my favorite Monster High characters.  Like all MH dolls she has multiple points of articulation so she can be posed in many ways.  She is made for play, but has small parts that could be lost or broken if she is not treated gently.Lorna is a great new character that will make a wonderful addition to any Monster High collection.  I won’t spoil it for you - you will have to read her passport to find out about the Three-Eyed Dusky Dragon Owls.  Look for her as part of the new “Monster Exchange” line of dolls.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P731M7L232LN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MZ6BYMK#wasThisHelpful","R2P731M7L232LN","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of Ever After High will be familiar with the Beanstalk Bakery Café – a favorite hangout for the EAH kids.  This playset has a storybook theme, and everything you need for a successful coffee shop.  A pastry display case holds some goodies – cupcakes, a croissant, and a slice of cheesecake.  The set also comes with a cup and saucer and a travel coffee mug.  Guest to the café can sit at a table with a top made of books on a purple chair decorated with vines.The daily offerings at the bakery are advertised with a “chalkboard” sign that hangs from a giant silver beanstalk.  The beanstalk is topped with a hanging purple lantern.  No coffee shop would be complete without an espresso machine (blue) and a laptop computer (gold).  Also included is a small book topped table with an opening cover.This is a great playset that will be fun for kids and collectors - perfect for play or display.

"Fans of Ever After High know that Ashlynn Ella (Daughter of Cinderella) is naturally obsessed with shoes.  She fuels her love of footwear by working at the Glass Slipper Shoe Shop.  The new playset is so much fun, and is a perfect accessory for your EAH dolls.The main part of the set is the shoe display.  This display is made of golden branches covered with twining vines and topped with magical woodland carvings that showcase a clock that is about to strike midnight, and a crystal chandelier.  The base of the display has an opening drawer, and on each side of the display is a small shelf with a cloche to display an individual shoe.Of course this playset comes with shoes – five pair of shoes.  The shoes are: a pair of purple heels with silver spikes (obviously for Raven Queen), red heels with gold bows (perfect for Apple White), pink heels with gold wings (just right for Cupid), a pair of purple boots, and a pair of translucent pink heels.  This playset also includes a gold ottoman/footrest that opens for storage and a gold foot sizing tool.The second display is a table made up of several parts – books topped by a pillow, topped by a golden shoe, topped by a table top, topped by a golden branch, topped by pink lovebirds.  Pure Ever After High.  Last, there is a magic mirror in a blue translucent frame where the dolls can see how they look in their new shoes.The Glass Slipper is a great playset for Ever After High that kids and collectors will recognize and love.  The set is made for play but has many, many small parts and pieces that could be lost or broken if it is not treated gently.  This set is for ages 6 and up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11X9C61J63GVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M5ATNP6#wasThisHelpful","R11X9C61J63GVY","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The new Monster High “Haunted” dolls are ghost versions of some favorite monster high characters.  This ghost version of Twyla is my favorite – her color scheme and styling are just perfect.  Twyla still has light purple skin and wispy smoke tendrils on her forearms and lower legs.  Her hair is mostly the same seafoam green color she usually has, but this time she has streaks of light lavender in her hair and it looks amazing.  Twyla has purple eyes and frosty pink lips, and in her ghost version she has a metallic seafoam green mask painted over her eyes.The “Getting Ghostly - Haunted” dolls, including Twyla, come with a doll stand that makes them appear to float.  The stands are made of a translucent blue plastic “chain” and the stand holds the doll beneath the arms instead of around the waist.  This is a bit different than the standard MH doll stand.  The hairbrush she comes with has also been restyled into a ghost theme.Twyla is wearing a sleeveless dress in mint green with a lavender cobweb and spider print.  The neck and waist of the dress have a sheer floaty lavender overlay.  Twyla’s high heeled shoes also have a cobweb theme, and the shoes are a ghostly translucent blue.  Twyla’s accessories include a silver chain belt, a silver headband and blue bracelet .  Like all Monster High dolls, she has multiple points of articulation and can be posed in just about any way you can imagine.  She is made for play, but has small parts that can be lost if not handled with care.I just love this version of Twyla.  She really does make the perfect ghost  - a great fit for the Daughter of the Boogey Man.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTNIY67Z601T3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MUT35MO#wasThisHelpful","RTNIY67Z601T3","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Gloom and Bloom floral theme is perfect for Venus McFlytrap, and this version of her doll really shines.  The Monster High ghouls are throwing a party to celebrate the blooming of the corpse flower - something that only happens once every 1,300 years. So, Venus is ready with her party dress and gardening tools.  This version of Venus comes with a vine covered watering can and a potted venus fly trap plant.Venus is wearing her signature colors of hot pink and green, and the theme of this doll is definitely the venus flytrap.  Venus has a flytrap hair ornament that is fixed to her high ponytail, and she also has flytrap ankle bracelets that look like they are part of her shoes.  The skirt and bodice of her dress are printed with open venus flytrap plants, in shades of pink, green, black and white.  This print is wonderful, and couldn’t be more perfect for this doll.  The dress also has long black sleeves, a black belt, and a twining vine decoration that reaches from her shoulder to her waist.  Venus’s other accessories include green vine bracelets, a black necklace, and black dangle earrings.  A “diary”,  doll stand, and hairbrush are also included with this doll.Like the other versions of her doll, this Venus has pointed leafy ears and lovely mint green colored skin.  Venus has her usual hair colors of hot pink and green.  She has a little bit of a conservative hairstyle with her hair pulled into a ponytail.  She still has part of her pink hair shaved and flocked, but this time her head is shaved on the back of her head and is mostly out of sight.  Venus has bright blue eyes with pink, blue, and green eye makeup.  Her multiple fangs are painted visibly on her hot pink lips.  Venus is a doll made for play, but has small parts that could be lost or broken.  Like all Monster High dolls she has multiple points of articulation and can be posed in just about any way imaginable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31XBHUTWSKG3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MUT329K#wasThisHelpful","R31XBHUTWSKG3G","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Werecat Catrine DeMew is one of my favorite Monster High ghouls, so I am always excited to see a new version of her.  Gloom and Bloom Catrine has a floral theme, and we see her in her signature color purple.  Catrine is wearing a purple sundress in shades of purple with a lily print.  Her hair and makeup are in darker shades than her previous dolls.  Her lovely lavender hair is in a long loose style, and has dark purple streaks that are almost black.  Her lips are also a very deep shade of purple.  Catrine is wearing a dark blue headband that is decorated with flowers.  Her blue high heeled sandals are decorated in a similar way, and around her ankles are large purple blooms that look like they are part of her shoes.Because this line of dolls has a garden theme, Catrine comes with a gardening claw and a green flower pot that holds a purple topiary shrub.  The shrub is blooming with little pink skull shaped flowers.  Catrine comes with a six page “diary” that is full of artwork and pictures of her.  It also mentions that a corpse flower is about to bloom.  This only happens every 1,300 years, so the ghouls are dressing up and throwing a party to celebrate the blooming of the flower.  This doll comes with a doll stand and hairbrush.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20C9K4X80G8K0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MUT32EU#wasThisHelpful","R20C9K4X80G8K0","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Monster High ""Inner Monster"" Spooky Sweet / Frightfully Fierce doll is so much fun with many innovative, playful features.  This doll has the same basic body type as many other monster high dolls, and is the same size.  She is a blue skinned girl, with an exposed purple brain.  Her brain is a toggle switch that will allow you to cycle through her eye colors/changes when the brain is pressed.  (She has pink heart shaped irises, green and purple flower shaped irises, and round dark blue irises.)  This feature is so much fun and really changes the look of the doll.  The eyes are well set into her head, change smoothly and do not look like they are obviously inset.The next fun feature of this doll is her changeable emotion filled torso.  The doll comes with eight different emotion charms and a transparent blue plastic torso that comes apart to hold the charms.  Those new to MH dolls might be alarmed by how easily the dolls come apart.  They are made to have removable arms, legs, hands, etc.  This helps with clothing changes, and modifications (there are many Create-A-Monster ""CAM"" sets with parts, heads, and clothing that can be swapped between dolls).  To change out the charms you need to remove the dolls arms at the shoulder and legs at the hips, and then gently pry the torso apart.  (My torso was quite difficult to open the first time, so parents might want to be present to help little hands the first time.)  When the torso is off the doll has a bright yellow spine, ribcage and pelvis with four round openings for the pegs on the back of the charms to fit into snuggly.This doll also comes with an extra face plate that snaps onto her head and can be used to change her look.  I thought the face plate might look bulky or obvious, but this is not the case.  The face plate fits closely and when she has her wig on you have to look very closely to even tell it is there.  There are two small depressions on the side of the dolls head near her temples, and the face plate has two small tabs that lock it into place on the head.This doll comes with quite a few accessories.  She has a bright blue wig that is a little different than the monster high CAM wigs.  This wig has tabs at the base of her skull that hold the wig in place, instead of on the top of the head like the CAM sets.  She has a dress made up of a halter top and peplum skirt.  She has two large accessories to change her look.  The first is a set of large pink bat wings that fasten over her shoulders and around her waist.  The next is a peacock tail with a matching peacock headband - the tail fastens around her waist.  She also comes with a hairbrush, handbag, saddle type doll stand, and two pairs of shoes.I was really pleased with all of the features on this doll.  I am an adult collector and I would have loved to have this doll as a child.  It is so easy for kids to change and customize the look of this doll, and I think they will appreciate the ability to do this.  I think kids will also love the ""Inner Monster"" concept that allows them to change the ""Monster"" from the inside with the emotion charms.I would highly recommend the accessory ""Mood Packs"" that are available for each ""Inner Monster"" doll.  Although all the Inner Monster parts are interchangeable, there is a pack for each doll that matches its skin color - so in this case a blue doll has an accessory pack with another blue face plate that perfectly matches the doll.  (The accessory packs come with a hard plastic wig, face plate, emotion charms, an additional outfit, shoes and other accessories).  The Mood Pack for this doll is the Monster High Inner Monster Spooky Sweet Mood Pack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QJWHFQ1SLFQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVFCO0U#wasThisHelpful","R1QJWHFQ1SLFQF","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lizzie Hearts is an Ever After High Royal, the Future Queen of Hearts and of Wonderland.  Lizzie feels a little misunderstood – she doesn’t know why everyone thinks she is a villain, and her friends Kitty and Madeline are “literally” the only people at Ever After High that understand her.  (I suspect like Madeline she speaks in a form of the Wonderland language “riddlish”.)Lizzie’s colors are black, gold and red.  Lizzie has long black hair with large streaks of red, and her hair has been styled into a high split beehive.  (Please note:  Lizzie’s hair is not styled as high and defined as in her promotional photos, but is still well groomed and lovely).  Lizzie is wearing dark red lipstick and she has bright blue eyes that have a heart shaped highlight on her pupils.  One of her most striking features is the large red heart shaped birthmark that surrounds her left eye.Lizzie is wearing a modernized Elizabethan collar – hers is red and the ruffles are edged with hearts.  (The collar is made of plastic.)  She wears a sleeveless peplum dress the top of which is black with a red and gold filigree heart pattern.  Like her hair, the heart on the bodice of her dress is split.  The layered sides of her dress feature a gold and red harlequin pattern that is covered in gold micro glitter.  Lizzie wears fantastic black tights that are patterned with red hearts bordered with gold.  Lizzie also wears black gloves with lacey heart trim.  Her gloves/hands are made of black molded plastic and cannot be removed.  She also wears red high heeled shoes that have gold playing card details on the front of the shoe.Lizzie’s most obvious and royal accessory is her gold crown with red heart details.  (Her crown is fastened on in several places with ties and bands).  Her other accessories include gold heart dangle earrings, a large gold ring with all of the playing card suits, and a heart shaped handbag.  Like all core EAH dolls Lizzie comes with a doll stand, key shaped hairbrush and a “bookmark” with more details about her and her story.Lizzie is a fun doll with all the right details.  She has huge crossover appeal for collectors of EAH, Wonderland and storybook dolls.  I was very excited about the release of Lizzie and she is a perfect addition to Ever After High.  Like all EAH dolls she is made for play, but has many small parts that can be lost or damaged if not handled with care.  She also has multiple points of articulation so she can be posed in just about any way imaginable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHXE2PMFU2R8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0RZKH2#wasThisHelpful","RHXE2PMFU2R8A","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Twyla the Daughter of the Boogey Man is ready for the new Scaremester at Monster High.  Twyla is a small ghoul with light purple skin and wispy silver smoke that travels up her arms and curls up her legs.  Twyla has pink lips and pink and purple eyes (this version of Twyla does not have the glowing eyes of her original release).  Twyla’s hair is styled with bangs and long locks of seafoam green and bright blue hair.  She is wearing the cutest minidress – it is purple and black and is covered with a pattern of seafoam green and metallic blue bedbugs.For her accessories Twyla has dangling cobweb earrings, multiple bracelets, a black and seafoam colored handbag with bug details, and high heeled seafoam and black mary jane shoes.  Her school supplies include a purple folio that is also covered with creepy crawlers.  Instead of a diary, Twyla has a day planner that outlines her schedule of activities and also shows a school map of monster high.

"Prince Dexter Charming is an EAH Royal that seems to have a thing for the Rebel girls.  He has had a huge crush on Raven Queen forever after, but lately Cupid seems to be gaining some of the attention she has been dreaming of.  Dexter Charming lives up to his name.  Here we have the handsome prince that spends most of his time hiding behind his glasses (they help to block his “enchanting eyes”.)  His eyes are vivid blue and he has brunette hair and thick eyebrows.Dexter comes with the aforementioned glasses that have thick black frames (with no lenses).  He is wearing a gold crown (the crown is attached to his head with small removable tags).  Dexter also wears a blue checked blazer with gold trim and hems, a blue and white striped scarf, gray jeans, an emblem print t-shirt and gray high topped sneakers.  He is wearing a gold medal on his lapel and has a gold wallet chain hidden beneath his blazer.  Dexter carries a black backpack/bookbag that has molding that features badges and buckles.Dexter comes with a doll stand and bookmark that has details of his royal story.  Like all EAH dolls Dexter has multiple points of articulation for posing any play.  It is so nice to have another EAH boy character doll available – and Dexter is perfect.

"Cedar Wood, the daughter of Pinocchio, is ready to attend Madeline Hatter’s Hat-tastic Tea Party.  The fairytale heroines of Ever After High are hoping this party will put the “wonder” back in Wonderland Grove.Just like Cedar’s initial basic doll, in this version her entire body is covered in a carved wood grain pattern.  The grain also extends onto her jawline and forehead but is much more delicate on her face.  A very nice detail that is included on Cedar is that her joints are made to look like they are held together with round wooden pegs.  Cedar has brown eyes, purple eye makeup and lips that are painted pink in the center (in a similar manner to EAH Cupid).  Cedar has wavy light brown hair with large streaks of lavender throughout.  The lavender in her hair is more prominent than on her basic doll.Because she is going to a “Hat-tastic” party Cedar is wearing a coral alpine hat that is decorated with a purple feather.  Cedar has several other accessories to go with the tea party theme.  She has a “wooden” teapot and two teacups with saucers.  The teapot has coral decorations and the wood teacups have coral colored saucers.  Cedar is carrying a black forest themed carved wooden handbag that has a lavender braided handle.  The earrings she wears are small golden buttons topped with a bow.Cedar is wearing a lovely little cocktail dress.  The top of her dress has short puffed black net sleeves and the peplum bodice is a coral faux bois pattern.  (One odd feature of this dress is a high black plastic collar, it looks perfect, but the plastic was a surprise.)  The skirt of her dress is made up of a purple floral print that is trimmed with a print of teacups and framed crickets.  Cedar is wearing lavender mary jane shoes with golden scrolling heels.  She also wears thin white mid-calf stockings that are trimmed in coral.  Finally, Cedar has permanent black decorated gloves (her hands are cast in black), with white lacey “teacup” cuffs.Like all EAH dolls she has multiple points of articulation for posing and play.  She is made for play, but has many small parts that need to be looked after so they are not lost.  Her hands are made so they can be removed for a change of outfit.  She comes with a hairbrush and doll stand.  This version of Cedar is sweet and adorable.

"Neighthan Rot is one of the new students at Monster High.  Neighthan is one of the new hybrid monster students – Neighthan’s father is a zombie and his mother is a unicorn – and as far as he knows, he is the only “zombicorn” in the world.  Neighthan likes to wear bright colors to camouflage his spills – he is a clumsy fellow.  Neighthan has a big heart, he loves studying Monster Psychology, his favorite foods are fried pickles and brain-puffs, and he has a huge crush on Frankie Stein.I was secretly hoping Neighthan would have some kind of cloven hooves hidden under his yellow shoes, but he did not.  He has regular monster boy feet, so he can swap footwear with the other MH boys.  Neighthan’s most striking features are his long mane and (rooted) tail and his translucent blue unicorn horn.  The horn is slightly flexible and his black mane and tail are streaked with bold chunks of blue, yellow and red.  Neighthan has horse ears, blue eyes, and gray zombie skin.  Neighthan seems to be missing skin in some areas and his musculature is showing.  The musculature shows prominently on the left side of his face, his left arm and hand, and his right leg.  Neighthan also has muscles that show on his torso and his torso is asymmetrical with different muscles showing on each side.Neighthan is wearing a shirt made up of primary colors that is printed with a ribcage and some internal organs.  One leg of his pants is black and the other has an abstract muscle print that is also in primary colors and matches his shirt.  Neighthan’s accessories are a ball cap and tennis shoes, both of which are bright yellow, but have tiny blue dots of color incorporated that can be seen under close inspection.  His cap has cut outs to accommodate his ears and his horn and the top of the hat is decorated with five spiral mini unicorn horns.  Neighthan also comes with a detailed diary, a hairbrush and a doll stand.Like all MH dolls, Neighthan has multiple points of articulation for posing and play.  His hands can be removed for clothing changes, but that is not necessary with this doll – his clothes do not fit tightly and have Velcro closures.  I am a huge Monster High fan, and a unicorn girl – so I was jumping for joy when I learned about Neighthan Rot.  This unicorn/zombie is my favorite of the Monster High boy dolls – he is the perfect doll for me – and I hope others feel the same way so this is not the only Neighthan doll that will be produced.  I hope all Monster High collectors, and zombicorn fans have the chance to add him to their collection!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3322AXJR3WY6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVFCM2U#wasThisHelpful","R3322AXJR3WY6V","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Werecat Toralei Stripe is the Left Wingback for the MH Soccer Team the Monster High Nightmares.  Her signature move is a tail flip (it is not illegal to touch the ball with her tail) that is “almost impossible to block”.  Toralei is at practice 5 days a week and she is up to speed on all the rules of “monster soccer”.  The Physical Deaducation booklet that comes with this doll details her career highlights, memories, practice schedule, rules, and her signature move.Toralei has her hair styled with bangs and a high ponytail.  There is an orange and black streak in her auburn hair, and this streak is twisted together and incorporated into the ponytail.  Toralei has bright green cat eyes with black cat-eye eyeliner to accent them.  She also wears some bold purple and aqua eye makeup and fluorescent red lipstick.  Toralei is ready for practice and has all the gear she needs.  Her best accessories are her shin guards – they are black studded cats that hug her legs.  She has an aqua colored soccer ball, a fluorescent red plastic net ball bag, and a cold blue drink.Toralei is wearing an aqua blue and white striped tank top that is covered with a black net half shirt with the number “9” on it.  She wears black shorts that have a pink and black checkerboard waist.  The short shorts help show off Toralei’s leg stripes.  She has one black (painted on) glove and tiny pink stud earrings in her pointed cat ears.  We will have to trust her that her footwear is appropriate for sports – her shoes are studded fluorescent red and look like high heels – minus the heel.Toralei can be one of the harder to find Monster High ghouls – she is something of a villain, but everyone loves her.  She has a removable cat tail, and multiple points of articulation for posing and play.  Along with her notebook, she comes with a hairbrush and doll stand.  Like all MH dolls she is made for play but has small parts that can be fragile so she should be handled with some care.  This Toralei doll is part of the new line of “Ghoul Sports” Monster High dolls.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O2FQDEG9OBS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVFCO78#wasThisHelpful","R2O2FQDEG9OBS9","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lagoonafire is the result of the fusion of Lagoona Blue (Daughter of a Sea Monster) and Jinafire Long (Daughter of a Chinese Dragon).  Lagoona and Jinafire are both well-loved Monster High characters, so Lagoonafire is an outstanding fusion with several elements of each ghoul’s traits shining through.  This doll has Jinafire’s dragon scaling on her body, her long dragon tail, well defined eyebrows, slit pupils and love of fashion.  She has Lagoona’s arm and leg fins, freckles, webbed hands, finned ears, and sweet expressive face.  Lagoonafire’s skin is the palest shade of blue gray and is covered with a gold luster that shines in certain lighting.  Lagoonafire’s fins and the flared part of her tail are all a shade of metallic gold.  She has yellow and green eyes, coral and gold eye makeup, and her lips are painted a bright shade of coral.  Lagoonafire’s hair is bright easter egg yellow and chartreuse with some unique styling.Lagoonafire has some amazing accessories.  My favorite is her large fluorescent pink jellyfish handbag – definitely one of the coolest handbags I have ever seen a MH character tote around.  Her next prominent accessory is her elaborate coral colored headdress.  The headdress covers most of the top of her head and encompasses a large piece of her hair that has been styled into a large (chartreuse) victory roll.  I can’t decide what this headdress is all about.  I’m not sure if it is some kind of kraken or mermaid gear – it has tentacle like appendages and what looks like pearl netting – this thing is just crazy.  Lagoonafire is wearing a bright coral colored top with a high collar and some black net detail on the sleeves.  Her mini skirt is black with a red and turquoise floating jellyfish print and green net detail.  She has hot pink heels to match her handbag and a large golden Jinafire inspired belt that covers her entire midriff.  There is something bold and bright to look at on every part of this unique doll.According to her bio – Lagoonafire is attempting to bring together her fire and water elements and this is presenting something of a challenge – but you would never know it by looking at her.

"Ever After Royal Blondie Lockes is a nominee for this years “Thronecoming Queen”.  The theme for Thronecoming is the “Enchanted Forest Masquerade” and all of the court have an animal themed mask and gown.  How could Blondie dream of anything but bears for her inspiration?Blondie’s mask is a golden bear, but there are many other bear details incorporated into her elaborate formal dress.  The top of her dress has “fur” shoulder straps and the blue satin overlay skirt of her dress is printed with golden metallic designs of bears with bows and heart-shaped flourishes.  The underskirt of her dress is two layers of buttercup yellow fabric and is printed with metallic gold dots and bows.  The dress is very princess/prom queen – perfect for Thronecoming – young doll collectors will go crazy for this dreamy design.  Blondie’s other accessories include blue dangle earrings, a blue and gold handbag, open toed heels, and a golden bracelet/corsage.  To match her dress, Blondie is wearing blue elbow length formal gloves.  (These gloves are not removable, her hands and lower arms are molded in blue.)  The gloves are topped with a lacey golden cuff.Blondie’s buttercup and lemon yellow hair has been streaked with golden metallic strands.  Her hair is styled with bangs and into two Princess Leia buns that cascade down to her shoulders.  Blondie has decorated her face with some blue diamonds and twinkles (all the Thronecoming girls have different face decorations).  She has bright blue eyes, bright pink lips, and light pink eye makeup that is highlighted with gold glitter.  With all of her glitz, glitter and bows Blondie makes a perfect fairytale princess.Blondie comes with a doll stand and a bookmark / storybook.  Like all EAH dolls she is made for play but has many small parts that may be lost or broken if she is not treated gently.  She has multiple point of articulation for endless posing and play.  Blondie is made for play but is so lovely I can’t image her anywhere but on display with other collectable dolls.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L83T0X98PK7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVFCRP2#wasThisHelpful","R2L83T0X98PK7H","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have some experience crafting felted dogs and I own several books and a felt dog making mold.  I am always on the lookout for a book with some new techniques and patterns.  I love this new book - Felt Dogs by Mitsuki Hoshi – it has great advice, instruction and inspiration and the dogs are very cute with their own unique look.The books starts out with adorable photos of the completed dogs that the book covers – the miniature dachshund, welsh corgi, miniature schnauzer, pug, chihuahua, labrador retriever, shiba, maltese, beagle, toy poodle (favorite!), boston terrier and miniature pinscher.  The books next covers the materials, supplies and tools that are needed to complete the projects.  Almost all of the supplies are common and available at most craft supply stores.  Next are the general instructions and techniques that are shown step-by-step with photographs detailing construction of a basic dog (the corgi).  The instructions are clear and easy to follow.  The last part of the book has a detailed page for each dog breed including specific material lists, ear patterns and notes that cover posing, attachments and detailing.This book has included some techniques that are new to me, and also some I don’t think I have seen in any other felting books.  Some of these are mouth embroidery, prepping clear eyes, nose attachments and using a loop yarn (instead of roving) for curly coated dogs like the poodle.  This little book is short and sweet and will make a great addition to the crafting library of those interested in felting, dogs and cuteness.  This book is probably best for those with a little previous experience creating needle felt projects.  But, everyone has to start somewhere – and why not start off with a cute little dog?","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LCYW146MVQSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780673396#wasThisHelpful","R2LCYW146MVQSD","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Where is the true Vampire Queen?  What secret is Robecca Steam hiding? Will Draculaura gain her vampire powers?  Who is Veronica Von Vamp?  All these questions will be answered in the new Monster High movie Frights, Camera, Action! – a movie filled with new friends, exciting mysteries and surprise destinations.The vampires have been without a queen for 400 years and Draculaura is surprised to learn that she has been chosen by an ancient jewel, The Vampire’s Heart, to be the next Vampire Queen.  Draculaura, Robecca Steam, Cleo De Nile, Clawdeen Wolf (and stowaway Hoodude) head to the castle of the vampire court in Transylvania in the company of the evil Lord Stoker to attend Draculaura’s coronation.  Once the ghouls reach their destination, Draculaura uncovers Lord Stoker’s plot to use her as a puppet queen so he can continue his villainous rule in the absence of the true queen.  Determined to stop Lord Stoker and find the rightful queen, the Monster High gang search the castle until they find a mysterious letter that holds the first clue in their adventure.From Transylvania the gang travel to Londoom and meet up with Clawdeen’s older sister Clawdia Wolf, who is there to study dramatic writing.  Clawdia soon joins the search and helps to find the next clue that will take them to New Gorleans.  While searching the ghost ship “The Bijou on the Bayou” in New Gorleans the gang meets Honey Swamp – who is onboard working on a student film.  Their next stop is Hauntlywood, and the gang continues their quest while being pursued by Lord Stoker’s minion Igor.  Hauntlywood is their final destination, and here the gang meets the makeup artist Viperine Gorgon who introduces them to the famous actress Veronica Von Vamp.  Veronica is the key to the mystery and has the final clues to help the Monster High ghouls solve the puzzle.While Draculaura and the others are on their journeys, back at Monster High there is a raging debate over which male lead of the Vampire Majesty movies is cuter.  Is it Edweird of Alucord?  The matter can only be decided in Cute Court with Twyla as the judge presiding over the matter.Like all Monster High stories, this movie is full of positive messages for the viewers.  There are themes of courage, selflessness, open mindedness and friendship throughout the story.  I believe this movie is appropriate for all ages.  Kids will love this movie; it is full of their favorite Monster High characters, including some of the minor players.  This is a movie made for kids, but will also be enjoyed by adult cartoon watchers.  (A couple of highlights are a few funny references to jazz hands and the movie director in Hauntlywood is named “Scarentino” who is looking to “dig up an old star and resurrect their career”.)  This movie runs 1 Hr. 14 Mins. and also includes three animated shorts – Crime Scream Investigation, Games Ghouls Play, and Monster Morphoseas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO8AQ6E5B8LRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IXE1LB2#wasThisHelpful","RO8AQ6E5B8LRP","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Takkiti is an adorable little ice unicorn creature.  I love to collect animal replica figures – especially the unique approach Schleich has towards unconventional unicorns.  Takkiti is pleasant departure from the traditional type of unicorn with a short face, painted deer like nose, thick winter coat and frosty blue accents.  This figure is on the small side - foal sized.  Like all Schleich figures it is well made and sturdy for play and collecting.  The photo is a good representation of the actual figure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYNTSALSVOEBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GVTCNGS#wasThisHelpful","RYNTSALSVOEBN","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Misamee is a long eared magical creature with crystal stones on her head.  This is a unique and beautiful little creature and will make a great addition to any animal replica collection.

"I like kitchen tools and recently became interested in making doughnuts at home.  I thought I would give this affordable doughnut maker a try.The construction of this dispenser is very lightweight – aluminum and plastic.  It seems like it will work for very occasional use, but I don’t think it could stand up to frequent use.  Overall, I think this tool is more trouble than it is worth.  The hopper that holds the batter is quite small and if you use it for pancakes you will have to constantly refill it.  This doesn’t seem worth the trouble considering the cleanup.  It did produce doughnut like shapes, but they were not uniform.  I tried the recipe for old fashioned doughnuts that came with the dispenser and it was completely off.  Even with tweaking the recipe so it could pass through the dispenser, the results were not doughnut like at all.  I would recommend skipping the included recipes all together.I am afraid this little gadget is destined to either sit on the pantry shelf or wind up in a garage sale.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XV0XHL85SP0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000CFNE9#wasThisHelpful","R1XV0XHL85SP0Z","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have reasonable expectations, I think you will be happy with this product.  It works very well on small pores, and really does make them appear to vanish.  It does not take much product for coverage and it feels very nice on the skin.  It will not cover large deep pores or blackheads.  Baby Skin is a nice alternative for those of us that cannot afford the more expensive department store products.

"I collect animal figure replicas. I bought this because I love dinosaurs, but also because I have recently read the excellent ""The Untold Story of Champ"" by Bartholomew and one of the monster hunters in the book is convinced that Champ is a surviving Tanystropheus.This is a fun little model with a wire reinforced neck that allows you to change his neck shape and repose him. I have the feeling that he is a tad fragile and his neck should not be moved repeatedly. I think frequent movement will eventually break down his neck and he will lose posing ability.  Overall very cool for collectors but might not stand up to play when it comes to kid collectors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLBBIB0UZY329/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Q0LUGC#wasThisHelpful","RLBBIB0UZY329","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a fairly large collection of plastic animal replicas, and this weedy sea dragon is my favorite.  Looking at it reminds me of when I saw a weedy at an aquarium and I will never forget it – the most beautiful aquatic creature imaginable.People that have seen the toy at my home have no idea what it is, which is not that surprising.  As I understand it, the Weedy Sea Dragon is endemic to Australia and is a near threatened species.  This makes me think that this replica would be a great teaching tool for kids that are interested in sea creatures.  As far as play goes – this seems to be a quite sturdy and well-made toy – as are most of these kind of plastic replica toys (Safari Ltd., Schleich, Papo).  This toy is a decent size – several inches long – I found that to be a surprising bonus.  I love my weedy sea dragon and I am sure others that collect and play with replica toy animals would be happy to add this to their collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HHOM9TA8L8M4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H6FMCS#wasThisHelpful","R1HHOM9TA8L8M4","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Operetta is all about retro glam.  This time she has traded in her rockabilly style for elegant art deco.  I know many collectors were excited for the release of this version of Operetta, and she is gorgeous in her art deco inspired ensemble.  Her dress is very unique - a metallic red halter bodice trimmed in lace, a wide black belt with printed piano keys and a black and white skirt of stylized art deco inspired piano keys over a red net petticoat printed with musical staves.  Operetta has light gray eyes with silver and taupe eye makeup and bright cherry red lips.  Operetta's hair is two tone - red and black.  She has black bettie bangs and a high black side pony tail.  The rest of her bright red hair is left long and loose.  She is wearing a fascinator that is a white dice/heart and is trimmed in black net lace.Operetta's other accessories include black cobweb peep-toe heels, piano key chandelier earrings, piano key bracelet, backstage pass necklace and a piano key fan shaped handbag.  Her forearms are covered with non-removable painted on opera gloves - one black and one white.  She also comes with a camera for taking pictures at the movie premiere she is attending.  This doll comes with a doll stand, hair brush and diary (detailing her romance with Holt Hyde).  This doll is a Walmart exclusive (I purchased for $19.99) so if you are not buying her there you are purchasing on the secondary market.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N09766DW7J3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5RLVGC#wasThisHelpful","R1N09766DW7J3K","AN7UFORUFW2BA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN7UFORUFW2BA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very beautiful flag, with vibrant colors.  I have been using decorative house flags for many years, and Toland's are some of the nicest I've ever seen.  Very pretty artwork, and nice quality flags.  I'm sure as some reviewers have said, they will fade over time.  But that is the case with any flag.  Trust me, I've used many different kinds of flags over the past 15-20 years, and when left out in the elements, they ALL fade from sun, wind, and moisture exposure.  Many of the ones that are sewn together will rip at the seams if left out on a windy day.  I like Toland's because there are no sewn seams to worry about; the art is printed on one solid piece of cloth.The only way to ensure that they last longer is to bring them in when it rains or snows.  That just got too much of a hassle, so now I just toss them when they get really worn out.My only real gripe is that the tabs that connect to the flagpole are not really long enough to attach to both ends.

"The chunks in this are way too big.  I've been using Soil Moist for years, and the smaller containers have finer chunks that work much better.  I tried to save money by buying a whole pail of it, and that wasn't a great decision.  When they get wet, these chunks billow out into very big gelatin hunks in your garden.

"Although the color is not as pictured (as stated by other reviewers), I was quite pleased when I opened my order. Both the blue and the green ones that I ordered arrived in perfect condition and the colors are beautiful. They are very bright though, not muted as shown. Definitely not the turquoise of 100 years ago, but still pretty.I cannot attest to their use for canning, as I don't intend to use them that way. I'll be storing seeds from my fall harvest in some of them, and some dry goods in my pantry with others. I don't think rust will be an issue in my dry pantry. I'll be storing the seeds with desiccants on a shelf in my cellar. It can get damp down there if we have a lot of rain or snow, but if the rust develops I won't really care because I'm not storing food in them. I can buy more caps next year, or use the jars for something else.All in all, I'm pleased with this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BL8GVUIPKHBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B80TJX0#wasThisHelpful","R2BL8GVUIPKHBN","A3P8WZ8E14G8SZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8WZ8E14G8SZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought many bags of this in spring '14. Repotted all my 20+ year old indoor plants with it, all my outdoor potted plants got planted with it, and I used a lot of it in my garden too.Instant infestation of fungus gnats everywhere!  I didn't know where these critters were coming from or how they were getting into my house. It took me months to figure it out!And those suckers BITE!  I had an allergic reaction to them and wound up with scarring from them, all over me!One day I lifted an opened bag and moved it with a wheelbarrow. The next day, my arms and belly had bites all over them. I tried to think of what I did different and BINGO - I had picked up a big bag of this!  That made me put 2+2 together and wonder if the MG potting soil could have anything to do with my infestation of gnats.I googled ""MG potting soil and gnats"" and discovered that the web is FULL of complaints about this!  I decided that I had to discard my plants. I had some very old, very large plants that were too numerous to repot. I was going through other stuff in my life and wasn't able to take on that huge project at the time. So I had to haul them all to the dump.I called the company to discuss it.  I was told by a representative that they had had ""many complaints"" about fungus gnat eggs in their potting soil. I told her about what I'd been going through and she offered to refund the money I'd spent on the soil and to put in a claim for the plants I'd lost. I told her the money didn't matter to me. How do you put in a claim for a gigantic 20 year old jade tree?  I told her that my body is covered in scars from these things biting me, and that they carry bacteria that can be transmitted to humans.  I told her that I am calling to INFORM them that my life has been a living hell thanks to these creatures and the agony for months of trying to figure out where they were coming from. I told her that what I hoped would come out of my phone call is that the company would FIX the problem and start sterilizing their soil to kill the eggs, so that no one has to go through what I've been going through all summer. She said she'd pass the suggestion along.I'm writing this review for the same reason. So that YOU don't have to live the summer of hell that I just lived.And forget about those yellow sticky traps. I had them in several places and only caught one fungus gnat all summer. However, like fruit flies you can trap them if you put out a little bowl of Apple cider vinegar with a drop or two of liquid Dawn mixed in. Sometimes I'd catch four or five of them overnight. (And yes I did give them to a pest control professional and had them identified.)Save yourself heartache and go to a nursery and get a good quality potting soil there. Check it for eggs and if you see any, return it. That's what I'll be doing from now on.Oh and BTW. I told the MG rep that I'd been buying their potting soil for all of my adult gardening life, and never had this problem.  I told her I've bought my last bag!  NEVER AGAIN!","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LM72CLSLFV12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTDI9OQ#wasThisHelpful","R2LM72CLSLFV12","A3P8WZ8E14G8SZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8WZ8E14G8SZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like to have dehydrated veggies on hand, to throw into an impromptu soup (when I don't have any fresh veggies on hand and I don't feel like going out to the store).

"I have bought this both in bulk from Amazon and singly. It is a delicious, clean quinoa. I love that it's USDA certified organic. I cook it in chicken broth, and I like to keep a finished batch in the fridge. I love it mixed into salads or warm veggies, stirred into a quick soup... And experimenting with it in different ways. I've been known to eat spoonfuls of it as a quick pick-me-up snack. I've even mixed it with egg and seasoning and fried it in a patty. Any way I've tried it, it's been delicious and nutritious.My only complaint is that Amazon's price is too high. I can get 32 oz of it around the corner at my local grocery store for 17 bucks.  I will use Amazon for the red and multicolor varieties that I can't find locally.I have also tried other brands of quinoa, including the bargain ""bulk"" ones sold at our local Mediterranean markets. They were full of grit and pieces of twig, and rather bitter. This is a problem you'll never have with Bob's Red Mill. Any price differential is due to the quality of their products. They are always perfectly clean, and never bitter.

"Used for the first time tonight, making a facial mask with the recipe provided online. I have to say, I'm not impressed. The product is very messy and hard to work with. When you finally manage to get some to stay on your face, you have to sit there for 20 minutes smelling low tide. The odor is nauseating. But I figured, ""hey if it works really well I can overlook these things.""Unfortunately, although my face felt refreshed, I don't think it did a better job than the avocado mask in a tube that I've bought at CVS. It didn't really tighten or clean my pores any better - and the avocado mask is less messy, more convenient to use, and doesn't smell like dead fish. And, I don't have to worry about the grainy stuff getting in my eyes because it stays put (I didn't even do my forehead or around my eyes).When rinsing off, the messy continues. At first I got some in my mouth and it grossed me out. After I finished rinsing, the bathroom, facecloth, and my skin all smelled like low tide.I am uncertain whether I will use it a second time, and I certainly won't buy it again.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GO95GD3AKUNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQP1SP6#wasThisHelpful","R2GO95GD3AKUNC","A3P8WZ8E14G8SZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8WZ8E14G8SZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The baking soda worked a lot better & faster, and is way more affordable. At eight bucks for this tiny bottle, this treatment could easily become expensive if you have a lot of very severe reactions like I do.Plus... It didn't give me instant relief from my symptoms. Baking soda does give me instant relief.So I guess what I'm saying is that I'll keep this bottle around for emergencies, in case I run out of baking soda... But I won't buy it again.Sorry, I wanted to love it but I just can't.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3372U5DMTQLNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058A9H6A#wasThisHelpful","R3372U5DMTQLNM","A3P8WZ8E14G8SZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8WZ8E14G8SZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know that others have had issues with this product (i.e., wires coming loose, screws letting go), so I waited a while before writing my review. I bought this at the end of May, and after almost three months of regular use, I am having no problems whatsoever.  I am careful how I handle it and care for it, though.  I wash my pizza stone with water only, use a plastic pot scraper to scrape off any burnt on cheese or toppings, and then allow the stone to air dry completely (overnight). Once it's clean and dry, I use this tool to buff it out in a circular motion, treating the entire surface of the pizza stone to a rub-down. The result is that the stone buffs out to a nice shiny patina and has developed a nice ""seasoned"" appearance over the past three months.So, bottom line is that I like this product very much and would recommend it!  One thing I should add is that I do inspect it before using, just to make certain that the wires aren't coming loose. A friend of mine recently got a piece of such wire (from a grill brush) stuck in her throat, and it required  trip to the ER and emergency surgery to remove it!  So better safe than sorry.I don't think my pizza stone would look as nice as it does, without this brush!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HPFYGYA2YYJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HU1GE2#wasThisHelpful","R1HPFYGYA2YYJS","A3P8WZ8E14G8SZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P8WZ8E14G8SZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't have a whole lot to add to the good reviews already written here, but I bought An Awesome Wave shortly after it came out and fell in love. I listened once, thought it was weird - listened twice and thought it was cool - then got hooked. It's been in my digital library on every device and I listen to it periodically ever since, while many other good albums have come and gone this one is enduring and fascinating. The new one had a lot to live up to and I have to say, if anything, it's expansive and builds on the first. There are some extremely simple, rolling and melancholy tracks, and upbeat and pounding tracks, and sort of epic tracks. One I absolutely love that doesn't seem to be mentioned much is ""Hunger of the Pine"".

"For the price and the Samsung name brand - and the premium tablet it's designed to work with - this is a big disappointment. I'll be clear about what I'm benchmarking, though. Not other ""folio cases"" and separate bluetooth keyboards, which are nearly identical in functionality but can be had for $70 less (than the Amazon price, $120 less than MSRP), but to other integrated keyboards, to wit, the Asus Transformer Pad series.In short, the Asus keyboard is just far, far superior in terms of integration. That tablet locks in to a keyboard base that really enhances its functionality, effectively turning it into an Android ultrabook. The hinge of the Asus Transformer allows it to close fully (like a laptop) and puts the tablet to sleep when it's closed. The keyboard contains a big battery that actually feeds the tablet, keeping it mostly- or fully-charged and draining the auxiliary battery in the keyboard first. Charging is also fully integrated; the same plug charges the keyboard or tablet separately, but when they're docked, you can only put the plug into the keyboard - and it charges BOTH units simultaneously. It is tightly integrated, probably using USB technology, and contains a track pad which provides you with a mouse cursor on the screen; you can also still tap if you prefer, but it works very well. Finally, the base contains a full-size USB port and SD card slot. Altogether, it is a well-thought-out instrument that extends the functionality of the tablet.The Samsung keyboard contains nothing but a keyboard. The tablet does not lock into place; it simply sits in the slot at top, at an angle (which is of course not adjustable), and so, it is very loose and wobbly and not useful on your lap or anywhere other than a table/desk - flat, stable surface. It is possible to close the tablet and clip it into place, but that's basically just laying one on top of the other and closing the spring-loaded clip on the outside edge. There is no hinge. The keyboard contains a rechargeable battery, of course, but it only runs the keyboard, and does not feed / integrate with the tablet or any other device. The devices can both be charged using the same charger, but must be charged sequentially; there is no power integration. It does not contain any of the other amenities - no track pad, no USB, no SD card slot or other media extension. It is, in effect, just an overpriced Bluetooth keyboard, nothing more. I also agree (although this is also not a feature of the Asus), that a backlight would be helpful and to a degree, expected in a premium product like this.The one place I can give the Samsung keyboard a clear edge over the Asus is typing quality. Key travel is smooth and substantial, so typing is comfortable and accurate. Nevertheless, I never had trouble typing with the Asus keyboard, it just didn't have quite as good key press feel.All of this is not to say it's a bad bluetooth keyboard; it is to say that with the nature of the device, the size / bulk it adds to the tablet, and what competitors have accomplished, even 2+ years ago, in terms of functionality extension / enhancement and integration with an android tablet, this really falls flat. It's a one-dimensional product, and not a very ambitious one. Coupled with the newest, most premium tablet in Samsung's consumer line, I'd expect a little more engineering, some 'gee whiz' features, something really special about it, really useful, not just a glorified bluetooth keyboard with a stand built in.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CPUGQ11V0XI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2XHZ2#wasThisHelpful","R1CPUGQ11V0XI9","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of my review says it all. I can offer a few reference points to draw some boundaries around what this thing is/does for folks who are looking for an audio companion that doesn't just blurt out a lot of noise, but actually makes very compelling, high quality sound.First is this thing relative to other bluetooth speakers. Although I can't say I've tested the other bigger brothers of this guy, SRS X7 and SRS X9, and similarly expensive, larger ""portables"", I have tested a long, long list of them, including UE Boom, Dre Beats, Philips, Jawbone Jambox, and a whole array of other smaller-brand speakers. I owned a Creative Soundblaster Roar, briefly, and returned it because the sound was just awful. The only real competition for this speaker is the Bose Soundlink III and Soundlink Mini. None of the others are worth considering. There's no bass, no soundstage, most of them have serious problems with phase, and of course, the real cover charge for considering a decent speaker is whether it produces bass. Good bass, bad bass, little bass, big bass, deep bass or shallow bass. Some produce SOMETHING down below 100hz worth listening to; most do not. And that leaves us with exactly three contenders we even need to discuss: Bose Soundlink III, Bose Soundlink Mini, and Sony SRS-X5.All three use passive radiators to move some air mass outside the brick and reach well below 100hz. None of them will project a bass chord, let's say, in the 20-40hz range, so forget that. They can make the noise, but you can barely hear it on any of these little speakers, whereas when you're sitting in front of a decent powered 10 or 12"" sub, the same chord will fill your ears and world, and ""press on you"", that there's a nice big, rich note there. That's only particular tracks, in particular types of music, where there's something that low, that is a prominent component of the music. I happen to listen to a lot of that music (electronic, alt rock, sadcore, Bristol sound, Ibiza, and so on). Some that will beat any of these three and leave the low end just petering out and unfortunately underrepresented would come from Esthero, Massive Attack, Yeasayer, Glass Animals.That having been said, there is a pecking order between the three. And before I make such bold claims, please let me issue an author's apology: they are all VERY, VERY good, absolutely competent and frankly incredible products. Don't not buy any of these on my account alone. But, the way it shakes out is this:#3: Bose Soundlink III. The lowest ""projected"", audible notes may even be a bit deeper than the SRS-X5, but bass-heavy tracks lead to really regrettable distortion even at reasonable listening levels. The distortion from lowest bass made this one a pass for me.#2: Bose Soundlink Mini. This is an absolute engineering marvel. If you want to get people at a party to say ""wow"", buy this one. It's small, it's slick, the enclosure is hard metal, gorgeous, feels great to hold, heavy, and SMALL. I may yet buy one just because the tuning is a little warmer, and as other professional reviews have cited, has a more pronounced mid-bass around low instruments and vocal depth that gives this an instrumental quality that absolutely should not be discounted. The phase is very broad for such a tiny box, soundstage is modest but present and really shines with something like accoustic guitar. I recently read a review that says, very aptly, that this speaker's sound bears the least resemblance to its size of any other speaker out there. True, true. It is a phenomenal feat. The very, very slight edge to the Sony is as follows: The Soundlink Mini does not include a speakerphone (irrelevant, when considering pure sound quality), and the bass peters out perhaps a bit higher, in the 70-80hz range.#1: Sony SRS-X5. This thing is the best of the best. The battery lasts all day. The treble is crystal clear and truly, when you listen to something, a movie or music that ""sparkles"", will make your jaw drop. And the bass is actually very, very good. It probably tapers off quite a bit after about 50hz but at and above that general range, it really has a good level of depth and projection, of ""voice"". Again, it absolutely isn't comparable to a powered subwoofer, but when you sit it on a kitchen countertop or bookshelf and play something, the reaction you'll get is: wow. Woah. Wait, that's coming out of THAT thing?? It plays loud and it plays distortion-free.Even then, it's not perfect. The unit goes quite a bit louder in the midrange and treble than the small subwoofer and passive radiators can keep up with; it's very good in that, if you want it loud, it goes loud. Not gymnasium-prom-loud, but louder than you'd want it at a party in your back yard. At some point, the itty bitty drivers just can't move enough air mass to make an equivalent dent in the space-time continuum with big, boomy bass. That's OK by me; wrong tool for the job. I want this for nice listening volume inside and outside and as such, it does just spectacularly well.It has a speakerphone that actually works very well, no echo, and is absolutely usable inside and outside. Not the way you'd USUALLY take a call, but it's in there, and it works.Lastly, it has reasonable sound quality, including depth of bass, when it's sitting out on the driveway, or on the railing of the back porch. When you really want to emphasize the amount of bass that comes out of it, the rear passive radiators are best about a foot away from a solid vertical surface to ""reflect"" the bass back at the unsuspecting listener. But, as an audio companion to, for example, go out on the driveway while you work on the car, or do some carpentry, or what have you - it actually sounds pretty decent. Wide open, outside, no reflection, but it still manages to produce quality sound.Now, lastly, I'd like to touch upon comparing this to another Sony product, the bigger brother's bigger brother, the Sony RDHGTK37IP ""Party Speaker"". It is big, heavy, it has blinking LED lights, it's a 2-way 2-speaker device with two piezo tweeters and two 8"" woofers in a sealed enclosure. It's big, it's neat-looking, and you'd think it's a beast with the bass just looking at pictures of it - kind of like a Ferrari looks fast sitting still. Well, I bought one. I thought it may have a kind of deep bass oomph comparable to a larger speaker system with the big drivers and ample amplifiers, where maybe I could sit it outside and enjoy home-theater type of audio while I'm working on a barbecue or turning wrenches. Oh, no. No, that didn't turn out to be true. It's a good device for loud listening, but... read my review for the rest. What is relevant here is that I did a side-by-side comparison between that monster, and the SRS-X5. The SRS-X5 won. It wins, comfortably. Inside and outside, this little brick produces deeper, more pronounced bass at low to moderate listening levels, more rich, full sound, better soundphase, better soundstage, and all-around, better sound quality. That is nothing short of miraculous engineering, and taken from Sony's own product line. Bigger is NOT better; unless you plan to fill a gymnasium with blaring-loud, thumping, blaring bass and dodgy treble and distorted midranges, you don't want a big thing like that, or like the Behringer Eurolive speakers. This little speaker wins, it simply wins.Those couple of things make this better than any competitor, even better than any other Sony. Someone may invent a better bluetooth speaker, and I certainly hope they do - we will all benefit - but right now, having listened to all of the best, listened to the rest, and even stood it up against something that should have blown it away, it wins. You simply don't need to buy anything else to be absolutely guaranteed an incredible listening experience in any space, any time, all day long.I'm an impartial consumer, not paid by Sony (or anyone else mentioned here), but after having written all of this, I feel like I should be! Anyway, I hope I've delivered a useful benchmark-based review. Target has these set up on a display, you can pair your phone and listen; Walmart, Best Buy and others may carry it. Sound quality is so subjective, I encourage you to go give a listen, but if you want to take the word of an amateur audiophile (who used to design and build speakers by hand!), and maybe wouldn't miss the price of the unit, you simply can't be disappointed by this SRS-X5, unless you'll be disappointed by ALL bluetooth speakers; this simply is the state of the art, as good as it gets in 2014 and heading in to 2015. Reputable professional reviews, fortunately, do agree with my conclusion.Happy listening!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KFR5XYDRFD2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I053ICY#wasThisHelpful","R2KFR5XYDRFD2D","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I may be a bit of a dissenting opinion here. It most certainly does deliver on the volume; it is LOUD. It's comfortably loud enough for a big pool party, gymnasium, what have you. It delivers decent, clean bass. It is definitely able to connect to Bluetooth very quickly and painlessly. Now for a couple of things that aren't great about it:- There is a VERY neat iPod/iPhone dock on it, with a little arm that swings down to hold it in place on the dock. Neat except if you don't have an iCult device. It turns out that other things, such as Android, also have bluetooth, and owners who want to stream music over Bluetooth. Great, but pointless for the 70%+ of the global market share enjoyed by Android devices. Does that strike anyone else as a little odd? It would be good if this at least had some capacity to clip in other types of devices, if not actually mount them (e.g., via microUSB). To be fair though, it does specify in the listing that it's an iCult port, so that's not really a surprise you just find out about when you unpackage it.- The crossover frequency is a little high. It's a two-way speaker, and what this means is, when the woofers are really moving, you get some ""muddy"" midranges, vocals and instrumentals. Not as much of a problem at lower volume, but...- It really only has passable bass when it's very loud. I'm virtually certain it's a sealed enclosure, and it's very much the sound of a 6.5"" or 8"" sealed enclosure speaker; the bass is very tight, ""punchy"", but the low-end is just choked off because the woofers can't move enough air. This has two negative consequences for day to day listening: first, I have a Sony SRS-X5 bluetooth speaker. Sitting in the family room, at the same volume (i.e., not super-loud), the bass response is very distinctly in favor of the tiny SRS-X5. That itty bitty thing has lower bass response. Still not the same as a 12"" ported, powered subwoofer, of course, but it has clearly, comfortably lower response. The second is that ANY discernible bass response is really only limited to very high power levels - volume. If you plan to listen to it as background music at a party on your deck, or at normal volumes for whatever reason inside or outside of the house (anything under, say, 35 or 40 volume level on the unit), the bass is just pathetic, inexcusable for this much power and woofers this big. Basically, it goes very loud, or you don't want to bother listening to it, get a little SRS-X5 or Soundlink Mini, and they'll have far superior bass range and projection.- There is not a wide phase; treble is crisp when standing directly in front of it but for whatever reason, they put little plastic louvers around it that look neat, but create a sort of ""laser beam"" of sound. Walk 45 degrees left or right and the treble is weakened and garbled; walk around to 90 degrees and it's a muddy mess of ruined sound.I'm not giving this a 1-star. For my purposes, it is a 1-star device, and I'm returning it, but for specific applications, I'm sure it's adequate, if not GOOD. To repeat, if you don't expect VERY low bass response, and you expect to use it primarily at very high volume levels, it's decent. I might still poke around at other ones that could deliver better low-end response, but when it's loud, it is punchy, even if not very deep. But, I just thought I would add these notes to help folks who might be expecting a different level of performance and/or who might be using it in some of the applications I mentioned above (which is just about all I would need it for) - it may not quite meet the need ideally.Cheers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KOXL6V2LJE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMNZ01C#wasThisHelpful","R18KOXL6V2LJE2","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not crazy about this. The predominant fragrance is nutmeg. The flavor is also unusually weak. I used it on fish and pork loin so far, and found that this added almost nothing to the inherent flavor of the meat, and the grill / skillet, even though both of those are relatively delicate flavors - especially the cod. Not crazy about this one.Update 11/14/14: Revising down to 1 star. This stuff is just awful. I tried it on pork loin (grilled), nice fresh cod filets (smoked), but then tried to load it up on some stuffed chicken breast and put that in the smoker. It is just awful, just an awful flavor. It's something... but not something good. You can very easily pick up cheap allspice, or nutmeg, but this is simply not in the family of spices called ""barbecue"" - not in America, not Indian, not Indonesian, not anywhere. It's simply not barbecue spice. It smells like allspice, is nearly flavorless, but if you load up enough to taste it, the taste is kind of sour, just 'off'. I STRONGLY suggest avoiding this if you're looking for actual barbecue spice.I also just tried the McCormick Grill Masters Pork Dry Rub, which is REALLY good. Tastes even better than it smells. I can strongly recommend that. I'm trying others to try and find the best on Amazon (or elsewhere), but for now, out of the half-dozen or so I've tried in the last few months, the Grill Masters Pork Dry Rub is at or near the top, and this Badia is easily, clearly at the bottom - and well below anything else I've tried so far.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PBMUCG7O30TP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003MQH4Q2#wasThisHelpful","R1PBMUCG7O30TP","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm quite in to my music, and I like trying and buying a range of well-regarded earbuds and headphones to make sure that whenever I listen, I'm getting the best possible quality sound. No need to waste my good years listening to sub-par sound, or missing depth and detail in my favorite music! All of which is to say, I have quite a few headphones and earbuds and I like listening quiet and loud, while exercising, mowing the lawn, working, cooking a nice meal, or at work. I like classical, jazz, alt-rock, acoustic ""sadcore"", and recently, mostly smooth electronic and EDM. Bonobo, Glass Animals, Martin Solveig, alt-J, that sort.I like full bass. Hearing the lowest bass merely mentioned in the range of sound isn't enough. It can't be blaring and distorted, but it can't be just a hint. Lots of cheap and mid-priced earbuds/headphones can make reasonably crisp highs, but the real trick is getting a full-bodied bass out of a little tiny driver.Now, down to the headphones. For reference, the most recent earbuds I've purchased and listened to extensively are Velodyne vPulse, Symphonized GLXY, Symphonized NRG, Xiaomi Piston, Panasonic RP-HJE450. Headphones are a separate category. I use my phone (Galaxy Note) and listen to the same tracks to compare apples to apples.I bought these Symphonized, as well as GLXY, on the basis of good reviews, reasonable price, and out of curiosity with the wood enclosures. Boy, did they ever hit a home run. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with using wood instead of plastic, but these things pump out deep, rich bass which at least to date, i haven't found any other earbud can match. Both GLXY and NRG are stellar. The primary difference is that the GLXY are sealed and NRG is ported, but both produce stunning bass. Furthermore, they fit comfortably and are well-balanced in the ear because the cords are attached to the enclosures closer to the ear, so they sit comfortably and do not fall out easily. This is easily a 5-star product. I'm sitting here listening to these, just amazed how deep the bass is, how warm and 'alive' the midranges are, and yet, crisp, clear, distortion-free treble. This is proper sound.It is incidental, but they also look great. The packaging is plastic and nothing to write home about, but the earbuds themselves are very classy looking. The NRG cord seems a little more solid than GLXY but both are tangle-free fabric cords which is just great for active wear.If you have similar expectations for the performance and fit of earbuds, the Panasonic RP-HJE450 and both Symphonized earbuds are simply fantastic and come highly recommended. Expect bass out of those comparable to pretty substantial studio over-ear headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32GCRO3Q5VAOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C30HUQ2#wasThisHelpful","R32GCRO3Q5VAOS","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm quite in to my music, and I like trying and buying a range of well-regarded earbuds and headphones to make sure that whenever I listen, I'm getting the best possible quality sound. No need to waste my good years listening to sub-par sound, or missing depth and detail in my favorite music! All of which is to say, I have quite a few headphones and earbuds and I like listening quiet and loud, while exercising, mowing the lawn, working, cooking a nice meal, or at work. I like classical, jazz, alt-rock, acoustic ""sadcore"", and recently, mostly smooth electronic and EDM. Bonobo, Glass Animals, Martin Solveig, alt-J, that sort.I like full bass. Hearing the lowest bass merely mentioned in the range of sound isn't enough. It can't be blaring and distorted, but it can't be just a hint. Lots of cheap and mid-priced earbuds/headphones can make reasonably crisp highs, but the real trick is getting a full-bodied bass out of a little tiny driver.Now, down to the headphones. For reference, the most recent earbuds I've purchased and listened to extensively are Velodyne vPulse, Symphonized GLXY, Symphonized NRG, Xiaomi Piston, Panasonic RP-HJE450. Headphones are a separate category. I use my phone (Galaxy Note) and listen to the same tracks to compare apples to apples.I bought these Symphonized, as well as NRG, on the basis of good reviews, reasonable price, and out of curiosity with the wood enclosures. Boy, did they ever hit a home run. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with using wood instead of plastic, but these things pump out deep, rich bass which at least to date, i haven't found any other earbud can match. Both GLXY and NRG are stellar. The primary difference is that the GLXY are sealed and NRG is ported, but both produce stunning bass. Furthermore, they fit comfortably and are well-balanced in the ear because the cords are attached to the enclosures closer to the ear, so they sit comfortably and do not fall out easily. This is easily a 5-star product.If you have similar expectations for the performance and fit of earbuds, the Panasonic RP-HJE450 and both Symphonized earbuds are simply fantastic and come highly recommended.

Headphones are a separate category. I use my phone (Galaxy Note) and listen to the same tracks to compare apples to apples.I bought these Xiaomi solely on the basis of the strong positive reviews on Amazon, and they were cheap enough to try. The bass is deep but underpowered. It's there, it's tight, it sounds pretty decent, but doesn't project as well as the Panasonic or Symphonized. It gets quickly overwhelmed with high-mids / treble. This could be adjusted with an equalizer but for practical purposes, earbuds have to sound the way they should sound 100% of the time for 99% of their users right out of the box. That's why I just test them with 'default' settings - no headphone amplifier for earbuds, no equalizer tweaking.They are, however, still far better than the Velodyne vPulse, which I just flayed in another review. They also aren't as poorly (physically, form factor) balanced as the Velodyne headphones, but nevertheless, they are not tremendously ergonomic and still do not stay seated well enough to use them for any activity. Also worth maybe 1/10th of a star is the fact that the Xiaomi earbuds come in some REALLY nifty packaging. When you first unpack it, you definitely believe you're holding a high-quality product. The machined metal of the buds themselves, the microphone/control, and the 3.5mm plug, is VERY nice, quality material that appears to be very well made and feels very nice to handle. Would that it were they delivered on the sound quality.I can't give these my highest recommendation, but also can't say they're altogether bad. They are better than a great many (most) earbuds, including more than a few that are more than a few dollars more expensive than these. They are GOOD. Especially at this price point, they deliver very clear, distortion-free sound and acceptable bass. I don't think you're making a mistake buying a pair of these. However, if you have similar expectations for the performance and fit of earbuds, the Panasonic RP-HJE450 and both Symphonized earbuds are simply fantastic and come highly recommended.

"Mae Ploy and Maesri make good curry pastes, especially red and green. There are two strikes against the Massaman curry here:First, this size of jar is available for around $5-$6 at your local East Asian market. I have to admit I was not able to locate Massaman in this size at two markets I visited, but they both had the 4oz tins.Second, the Massaman in particular is not very bold-flavored. We prepared a curry with all the goodies, chopped onion, chicken, potato, fresh lemongrass, fresh Thai basil, coconut milk and coconut powder, and kept adding spoonfuls of curry - never managed to get it to have a bold flavor. It's neither as sweet nor as spicy as a good Thai restaurant can make their Massaman. It IS good-tasting, but it is not comparable to a restaurant experience. With the rest of this container I'll be figuring out what else to add to it to make it sweeter and spicier, but part of the point of these curry pastes is that it's really a good approximation of a cooked-from-scratch curry, quickly. The more work I have to do to make it ""pop"", the less the curry paste is doing its job.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XJ6RIK9Y8YUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AOLH9U#wasThisHelpful","R2XJ6RIK9Y8YUN","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The powder itself is OK, not great. Fresh lemongrass is obviously better. The listing does not give you the size of the bag in grams or ounces and it features a larger bag prominently in the pictures. The product label also does not show the weight of the package contents.You have to note the shipping weight, 1.8oz, which includes packaging. This is a very small bag, about 1.5 inches wide and 4 inches tall and contains right around 1oz of lemongrass powder.

"Revising to 5 stars.I am fickle. I have tried so many excellent wired headphones, wireless headphones, and earbuds. And many that were not excellent. Assume the bluetooth speakerphone is useless, a feature that doesn't work. Proceed from there. My impossible benchmark is, which set of headphones can most closely replicate a decent 12"" powered subwoofer? (at least 200W in a 15x15 room). Leave aside the nuances of 10 and 8 inch subs, tight and punchy, or the 15"" blaring, loud, bleeding bass that shakes everything, including things you don't want to shake. BIG bass done well is a matter of preference and implementation between 12"" and 10"" drivers, depending on the cabinet, amp, and your listening style. Anyway, I listened to a movie that provides a truly unparalleled soundscape for examining bass performance ""The Fifth Element"". Available on Netflix and DVD. I listened on several very, very, very, very, very good headsets, and only one does the ""7.1 system powered with a 12"" sub"" effect... this one. Bluedio R+. This thing is, to date, without any wired or wireless peer. It is capable of pronounced, articulate bass down to sub-bass levels as low as 20-30hz, while also projecting adequate mids and treble. The treble isn't as sparkling as a Bose or B&O, but the details you hear below 60Hz, just pounding out with no distortion, is astounding, and at least in my limited experience, absolutely unparalleled at any price, makes this product best in class, IN SEVERAL CLASSES. If you can have a phone or tablet with bluetooth and you care how the bass punches, I know of no other headphone, wired or wireless, that competes with this. You absolutely have to hear it to believe it. right now, I'm listening to pulses below 30Hz, rich and pronounced, and the thing plays all day.It wins. Hands down. I've spent thousands of dollars figuring this out so that you don't have to. Wow. My only regret is marking this down a notch because the speakerphone doesn't work well. Screw that. You can not get better sound out of any other pair of headphones. CAN NOT. Spend $1000, that's easy enough - they won't make better sound than this. Congratulations. When this pair wears out or has a meltdown, I'll drop another $100 for another pair an instant later. This is it. Amazing!++++++++++++++The sound is very good. As has been noted many times, the bass out of the box is boomy and blaring. I read those reviews and thought, ha-ha! Surely you jest. Too much bass? What is this? I never heard of such a thing. Well, it turns out to be right on the money. What seems to hurt the worst is that the equalizer curve is a little funky. You can hear bass notes all the way down to the bottom end of the audible range, 20-30hz or whatever your particular hearing abilities permit. That's awesome, and it's actually good bass - tight, precise, no fluttering sound as the drivers struggle against the air pressure. However, the equalizer curve peaks at a slightly higher range, making mid-bass around 100-150Hz really loud and blaring, while the very lowest note levels are weaker, and a lot of the lower mids are just drowned out by the cacophony of ""upper bass"" range.So they are like a boom box for your head; it's at once great and terrible. It also depends a great deal on what kind of music you're listening to, as to whether it even has bass that low or prominent at all. Other than electronic / rock music, I found that the mids and highs are incredibly accurate and clear. There is no perceptible distortion; I agree with other reviewers that this is near or at the quality of much more expensive headsets.The utility is great; I wear my cell phone on my belt and the headphones run over Bluetooth. It has been a boon. Working on yard work, lawn mowing, car repairs, all just got a lot less frustrating. I can have my music, no wires, and listen to good sound all day.The battery life is excellent and I've had the chance to use them essentially all day, for periods of considerable volume, maybe a dozen times, and never had any complaint about low battery. The reception range does seem to suffer a bit when the battery is lower but that may only mean 15 feet instead of 25 feet. I did notice that it got choppy when going past 20 feet from the phone, even in a clear line of sight, with a full charge. So this is definitely not something you'll usually want to put down your cell phone and walk away from. If anything, you could put down the computer/phone if you planned to move around within the same room, but that's about it. Moving around between rooms or outside, you need to keep the source on your person.Now, there is a reference to equalizer functions in some reviews, but no specific instructions here, nor are the specific key press sequences available in any instructions or reviews that I can find online. I fiddled with pressing every combination of buttons, press-and-hold, and never got anything other than the button's primary function. The Bluedio website is Chinese and the internationalization is awful, so don't expect to learn anything new about these in English. I was not able to locate the Equalizer program that is referenced elsewhere on their website. After about half an hour of clicking, I gave up.We need to turn down the EQ setting at 100-150Hz, just blend that in with the low-mids, and we have a really excellent pair of headphones (bar none - Bluetooth or not). However, doing so will almost certainly generate frustration and, as I have, giving up in despair. The one thing that would make this a 5-star product is better English in the English instructions, more thorough step-by-step user guide, or at least, better documentation on the website (again, better English, better internationalization). Such as it is, I like it a lot, it's listenable, but better at lower volumes, and when you listen at higher volumes or to more bass-rich music, you just have to sort of forgive the blurting volume that is not at the bottom end of the headphones' response range, which is, almost unprecedentedly low, straight down to the bottom end of the human audible range. The amp in these is ample to drive these to incredible deep, rich lows.----------------------Update: I have to remove another star because of the microphone performance. I have tried taking several calls now using two different phones. This headset produces a great deal of echo for the caller. Everything sounds great to me, and they can hear me, but it echoes the caller's voice so badly that it's unusable for conversation. Every time I've tried using it, the caller has gotten confused by the bad echo and I end up having to disconnect the headphones and just talk on the phone. I tried with another phone to verify that it wasn't just my phone (Galaxy Note). It isn't. So, that's one function that is not really usable as such.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJIOB7P13FC06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H1XKDK6#wasThisHelpful","RJIOB7P13FC06","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are two parts of a useful review: what does the fragrance itself do, and what else is it comparable to. A third part, by far the most common and always completely worthless, is, ""do I like it?"". Here's my soap box rant: saying ""I love this!"" or ""My boyfriend/husband/wife/second cousin/alien examiner during an abduction really liked it!"" is worthless. You may also love a soiled baby diaper top note with a dry down of tar and nuclear waste. To each his own, but that doesn't help the rest of the world understand whether it's a fragrance they'd like.Please note that you may completely disregard the reviews that say, in 10 words or less, ""this is the best fragrance ever on the planet"" and assign it 5 stars. This is called social media spamming. The companies all spend a few grand paying folks who have 100 different Amazon accounts with 100 different email addresses to give a barely-legible, semi-inchoate review to whatever the company's product is, to artificially inflate the early star rating. More often than not, these reviews don't even mention the name of the product itself, they say ""the item"" or ""this is"", totally non-specific. So, take heart, this review is real.To place my tastes, I'm lucky to have an embarrassingly large and broad-spectrum fragrance wardrobe, numbering in several hundreds, representing all the major groups of fragrances - florals, fougeres, aquas, attars, woods, citrus, greens. I enjoy a variety of them from a few synthetic-based designer frags to the Montales, L'Artisan Parfumeur, and Amouages. I enjoy what's good and err towards high-quality aoud blends, quality chypres, orientals and greens. I don't like cloying, syrupy sweet fragrances. I despise bone-dry, cheap, astringent synthetic ""spice"" and ""wood"" frags. I like florals but I despise powdery smells. I'm geared towards, simply put, high-quality blends, creative and interesting.Now for Karen Low Exchange. It's a sickeningly sweet, cloying, headache-inducing, synthetic vanilla hot mess. Hanae Mori is at least a little dryer vanilla, not synthetic amber heaped on top of vanilla heaped on top of synthetic vanilla. If you want a truly sublime vanilla experience, go find a tester of Montale White Aoud. This is a potion of the most sickeningly, syrupy sweet synthetic chemicals known to man. I see no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It does resemble Hanae Mori but that manages to have a blast of vanilla, albeit synthetic, that isn't as offensively sweet. Givenchy Pi is also cloying and almost nauseatingly sweet but you get this blend of natural vanilla blended with some really mild florals. It's a decent fragrance. Karen Low Exchange is among the worst 100%-sweet, overpowering, syrupy fragrances I've ever smelled. It smells like vaporized artificial maple syrup. Warm and sticky. If you're a human being, and you don't want to offend the people around you, you don't want this on you. You'll fare better with stale cigarette smoke in your clothes and a bout of halitosis.Avoid it like the plague. You don't want to spray this on you. It smells strong and it lasts for an hour or two... but if you had a particularly violent session eating a tall stack of pancakes with a full bottle of artificially flavored high-fructose corn syrup maple syrup, and happened to spatter all over yourself, you'd smell this way... but you'd desperately want to wash it off. This doesn't smell clean. This smells like you got something on you whilst cooking or cleaning that doesn't belong, and you haven't had a bath yet.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R332LBF0TX8ZA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012MC9UO#wasThisHelpful","R332LBF0TX8ZA8","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just can't help but complain. This is an anthem of vapid, one-dimensional 1950s soda fountain pop drivel. Move over Drifters and Quotations, here's the next big band: Cults! Each track is stumbling out from the last, doused in a huge dose of echo, more echo, less echo, sometimes ""megaphone"" or ""PA system"" sound, but lots of low-fi echo, on every track... as if we're recording rock in the 1950s all over again! Elvis and Cults! Lots of cutesy-wootsey, syrupy sweet little girl vocals, echo, twinkly xylophone, doo-wop and teenybopper pop beats, more echo, more echo, more little girly vocals, and more echo.

It sounded interesting in samples but I listened through two, five times, then after a few months, I realized, I hate it - it's grating to the nerves. Vapid. It's a stunt, but there's nothing in this album actually worth hearing. First class ""happy idiot"" music.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S3PC47HZDU7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052BDVTY#wasThisHelpful","R1S3PC47HZDU7H","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are two parts of a useful review: what does the fragrance itself do, and what else is it comparable to. A third part, by far the most common and always completely worthless, is, ""do I like it?"". Here's my soap box rant: saying ""I love this!"" or ""My boyfriend/husband/wife/second cousin/alien examiner during an abduction really liked it!"" is worthless. You may also love a soiled baby diaper top note with a dry down of tar and nuclear waste. To each his own, but that doesn't help the rest of the world understand whether it's a fragrance they'd like.Please note that you may completely disregard the reviews that say, in 10 words or less, ""this is the best fragrance ever on the planet"" and assign it 5 stars. This is called social media spamming. The companies all spend a few grand paying folks who have 100 different Amazon accounts with 100 different email addresses to give a barely-legible, semi-inchoate review to whatever the company's product is, to artificially inflate the early star rating. More often than not, these reviews don't even mention the name of the product itself, they say ""the item"" or ""this is"", totally non-specific. So, take heart, this review is real.To place my tastes, I'm lucky to have an embarrassingly large and broad-spectrum fragrance wardrobe, numbering in several hundreds, representing all the major groups of fragrances - florals, fougeres, aquas, attars, woods, citrus, greens. I enjoy a variety of them from a few synthetic-based designer frags to the Montales, L'Artisan Parfumeur, and Amouages. I enjoy what's good and err towards high-quality aoud blends, quality chypres, orientals and greens. I don't like cloying, syrupy sweet fragrances. I despise bone-dry, cheap, astringent synthetic ""spice"" and ""wood"" frags. I like florals but I despise powdery smells. I'm geared towards, simply put, high-quality blends, creative and interesting.Now for Glenn Perri Unpredictable Night: this is a good fragrance. It's fresh and sweet. Heavy on the synthetic amber and I'm really not sure what else - a bubblegum accord, maybe some musky tobacco leaf. But it also doesn't have much depth to speak of. On skin you won't smell it after an hour, fabric has hints, whiffs, of something after 3-4 hours. Longevity is poor. Sillage is good... for 30 minutes, an hour on fabric. After that, it's only if you catch a whiff of yourself, but it's not a part of your wardrobe any more. When it's fully dried down, you may as well be wearing no fragrance. It's synthetic ambergris and some synthetic floral... I'm struggling to identify it... maybe some synthetic lilac and a touch of cedar? Or is it just an anonymous chemical not really associated with any natural flower?I will wear it and it is inoffensive and enjoyable to the family and around the office, but unexceptional. The reason I gave it 3 stars is simply that it IS good, pleasant, inoffensive, and unexceptional, and secondly (and this almost earns it a 4th star), it is poured from the same vat as Dunhill Fresh. Now, to be fair, there are any number of other mixes that are very similar if not identical - I think Yacht Man Metal - and an Adidas scent, but I can't remember which one. A light-blue or lilac-colored one. Team Sport or Fresh Sport or Footballist, who knows. But I have and used a bottle of Dunhill Fresh (wrote a review as well) and this is absolutely, perfectly indistinguishable from that fragrance, at less than half the price. There are doubtless many others which are also poured from the same tank.There's the conundrum. This is a part of a race to the bottom. It's clearly better than any dollar store fragrance but it's clearly worse than any quality designer fragrance, and two orders of magnitude worse than any proper perfume house, all-natural, high-quality blend. It's a race to the bottom... and you're as likely as not to get an identical synthetic fragrance in a different bottle for $50 as this one for $15. You can't even compare the ""Afrag Black"" to the ""Bfrag Black"", or the ""Cfrag Night"" to the ""Dfrag Night"". They play musical chairs with Black, White, Metal, Night, Sport. They have all the same six or eight but in Karen Low it may be White, in Thallium it may be Black, in Glenn Perri it may be Metal, in Dunhill it's Gentleman's Odor, and in Adidas it is Team Orgy. They are all purely and simply identical. So, go to a department store, walk up to the fragrances, close your eyes and grab one. You have about a 20% chance that it's this fragrance in a different bottle.This one is so inexpensive and so absolutely OK, in a nice, heavy bottle with a decent spray, that it's hard to fault it. It's probably $18 worth of fragrance but it only costs $15. (Not kidding.) But it is anonymous and forgettable and for me, as a collector, I will not replace it. That is why it got 3 instead of 4 stars. In my system, I give 4 stars to any fragrance I like enough to replace once the bottle is empty - a permanent member of my wardrobe (assuming that they still make the frag when the bottle is empty). Five is a sort of top-25-of-all, king-of-the-hill fragrance that competes with any and every bottle up to $350 in value. There are many in the $50 to $100 range that clearly swings with the high-value, high-cost fragrances. This one is simply... OK. Not bad. Not offensive. Not cloying. Not exceptional. It's OK. It's most likely a Coty blend that's pennies per liquid ounce at cost.You can't go wrong if you want something that's rock-solid, unimpeachable, alright. If you want something special, attractive, or unique (unique as in, when you get in an elevator with 10 other people, there's a 99% chance that nobody else is wearing anything like it), this won't do. It's good. Not bad. Not great. A rock-solid, 100% perfect, good. Good with a capital ""G"". I expect to write nearly identical reviews for a variety of other Glenn Perri and Karen Low and other fragrances I'm trying out right now.Happy days! :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I3EZ7RFDTOZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FCAN8W#wasThisHelpful","R2I3EZ7RFDTOZ1","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this to replace the Goodyear hose that was also supposed to fit the LS400. The Goodyear just bowed out in such a way that it contacts the nut holding on the power steering pump pulley.This one is wildly not for the LS400 of any model year. Mine is a '99 but this will not fit ANY LS400. It is not possible to see from the picture but there's about a 30-degree bend in the hose right where the insulating sleeve is, perpendicular to the view you have of the hose. The net effect is that the hose cuts about 1"" into the path of travel of the mechanical cooling fan when installed. This will NOT FIT ANY LS400 (and may not fit any 1UZ-FE application with a mechanical cooling fan, which I believe is all of them), this inaccurate fitment is not subtle - the first time you start your car with this hose installed, it will shred the hose into rubber chunks right through the middle (if you're lucky), or just burn out the fan clutch in a deafening smoky plume (if you're not as lucky).Amazon's applications are dramatically wrong at least for the LS400 here. Please save yourself the time and frustration. My car has been laid up for a week waiting to try this... and will be for another half week until an OEM hose arrives. Please take my advice, I'm just writing this to save other shoppers the frustration!Happy motoring...","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IWUSOLI19H68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044A7776#wasThisHelpful","R3IWUSOLI19H68","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My application is a '99 Lexus LS400. The rubber seal leaks. I bought two of these. The first one that went on started leaking oil all over the place at highway speeds, blowing all over the control arms and so on, after about 500 miles of driving after the oil change. I put another (new) one on and started the car, and boom, the seal started leaking again. I put on a Fram extra guard filter and it's perfect.

"I purchased this from Amazon. Just installed. After a few days of driving I found that the molded hose sort of 'bows' when the cooling system is under pressure, in such a way that the hose presses up against the bolt holding on the power steering vane pump drive pulley on. The net effect is that this bolt head started grinding a hole through the hose. I had to raise the car for another reason but it was very, very lucky that I noticed that before it blew out on the highway. The hose didn't touch the pulley when it was initially installed.So, caveat emptor: it does NOT fit a LS400 properly, at least, not a '98-'00, not sure if clearances are any different on earlier revisions. Also, it very well may fit other applications with the 1UZ-FE. Steer clear... there are other options. I've ordered another lower hose from Amazon, this one is a ""Mackay"". I'll update this review when I find if that fits better (the picture of the Gates hose shows a much sharper 90-degree molding at the lower end of the hose, precisely like OEM). You can also special order a Dayco from Advance or Autozone, although the picture of that one looks like it has kind of a 'wide arc' at the lower end, like this Goodyear.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MUTRJPYZP34I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UOEIAO#wasThisHelpful","R2MUTRJPYZP34I","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a recent Sleigh Bells convert/addict. The new album, Bitter Rivals, is more lyrical, slow, methodical, and perhaps ponderous. I have to admit that I liked the sort of menacing or foreboding heaviness of the percussion with Alexis's easy, lyrical vocals juxtaposed on the hard-hitting noise. Several tracks on both (Kids, Riot Rythm, Infinity Guitars / Comeback Kid) really nailed it. I was hopeful that the new album might take it up a notch - more energy, more soft vocals, more shouty guitar and heavy bass. It's actually a little more in the other direction - a little more melodic, but more subdued. It IS good and if you like the last two you will almost certainly like the new one. But if I were to recommend Sleigh Bells to someone, I certainly wouldn't start with this album.Also - Dear Amazon: the MP3 album costs more than a printed CD?

"I'm a pretty enthusiastic collector of fragrances. I buy one for my wife now and then but she's not tremendously adventurous with fragrances and has ended up ignoring about a dozen I've given her in favor of one of the very first I bought her, a long time ago, D&G Light Blue. It's a pleasant but thoroughly unexceptional fragrance.Well, I recently got her Kenzo D'Ete and that sort of sparked something. I guess I'd done a poor job selecting. She likes that one. Kenzo, Issey Miyake and Success de Paris are some of my own favorites, bar none (including my various high-end bottles from Amouage, L'Artisan Parfumeur, Le Labo, Montale and so on). She liked the Kenzo Summer. So I picked up Kenzo Flower. She likes it a great deal... and I have to admit, I LOVE it. I think this fragrance is going to put a new spark in our marriage because a woman smelling like this... yum. Yum yum, scrumptious!Ok, aside from waxing poetic (and failing, miserably so in fact), the fragrance itself: I can't speak to top/mid/base note differences. But I can speak to the base note. It's a syrupy flower. Flower syrup. It's in the same vein as Kenzo Power for men... it's a kung-pow punch to your nose of impossibly pleasant flowery serum. It's sweet but not cloying, so when I say ""flower syrup"" I mean something more like a finely crafted attar. It has a clear, bright, 'watery' rose note very similar to Le Labo Rose 31, but there's iris, chrysanthemum. My wife thought it was powdery but she says that about every floral scent, and to my nose, it's not the least powdery. It has a perfectly reasonable balance of ambergris. So it's sweet, but not cloying. It's appropriate, and the sweetness is a background to this one-two knockout punch of delightful and just... ugh... sexy bouquet.OK, I'm sold. I think she likes it a great deal, and it's my new favorite for her! Our 11th anniversary is coming up and I may make a special request for this fragrance to be part of her wardrobe on our special night! :)As a husband smelling this on his wife, I'm giving it a 5-star rating, and if I could give it 6, I would. I speak for no one but myself, but for a household with many hundreds of fragrances in circulation, for a new one to have THIS distinctive and impressive impact really kind of stands for itself. Consider yourself... warned? Informed? Encouraged? Well whatever it is. Get yourself (or your spouse) one if romance is in the air.

"The keyboard is a nice size (100% scale), sits at a slight tilt towards you, and has REALLY nice, solid keys with plenty of travel. It's actually a lot more comfortable to type on than most ultrabook keyboards and is as good as the chicklet/island keyboards in most full notebooks.I haven't used this one extensively because of the layout. I bought it along with a Perixx Bluetooth keyboard (see my the product and my review here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005F7RO20/), which does have its own challenges, to replace an old Amazon Basics keyboard that would eat through a new set of batteries in a day. Because I haven't used this Targus keyboard extensively I do not know what its battery life is like. However, it lacks some good features of the Perixx keyboard (and others):1, there are no shortcut keys. On the Perixx there are shortcuts for switching applications, navigating to the home screen, and 'esc' matches the 'back' button in Android. The Targus just has standard 'esc', function keys, and no shortcuts. The net effect is that navigation requires you to use the mouse a lot more for Android devices that have the standard back / home / switch application soft keys, or for Samsung phones that have actual buttons on the device for back / home / switch application, requires you to tap on the device to perform basic navigation in the operating system.2, and this just kills me, the ""Delete"" button is where ""Back Space"" should be, right beside the ""+ ="" button. On ANY other standard English keyboard int he world, the key immediately to the right of the ""+"" and above the \| key, is a backspace. On this Targus keyboard, it's a full-size delete key. I have no idea how a mistake this big could have made it into an actual finished, market-ready product, but it's not a matter of preference - it's just plain wrong. The ""backspace"" key on this keyboard is a small button in the top-right that can't be reached without taking your fingers off the home key area.Between these two deficiencies, I turned off the keyboard after two days of trying to get used to it and put it on the shelf. As I mentioned, it's a full-size, solid, comfortable keyboard, which makes it a shame that such obvious shortcomings are built in to it. These are physical defects, design errors, not just firmware - so the product is, unfortunately, bad. Unless you're wanting to get accustomed to a different keyboard layout and deal with a lot more hands-off-the-keyboard navigation, you will simply want to move on and find another keyboard that is better matched to the Android OS and that has a standard English keyboard layout.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QC8D6D16TFPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W8EICW#wasThisHelpful","R2QC8D6D16TFPZ","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this keyboard to use with a docked Samsung phone via Bluetooth. It replaced an old Amazon BT keyboard that drained two new AAA batteries in a day.This keyboard is attractive and comfortable to type on. It is compact but they letter/number keys are 100% size. The battery life is great; I have not yet drained it so I don't know its maximum life but it has gone for two weeks of all-day use without needing a charge. I also really like the Android shortcut keys; F1 toggles the ""switch application"" function on the Android device; hitting it again returns you to the desktop. There's also a ""search"" shortcut (F2), volume up, down and mute, play, fast forward and reverse. There's a button that connects the keyboard to a device once it's paired. All very handy.The downsides: it has a few reproducible firmware bugs that make it somewhat annoying to use with Android (not sure about iOS or any other OS).First, holding shift then hitting ""space"" or any other button keeps sending a command to the phone that sets the language to English (US)... again and again and again. That's not a problem except that the shift key is 'laggy', in that when you're capitalizing ""I"" or typing anything in all-caps, then release the shift key, the phone still thinks that the ""shift"" is pressed. The software does not indicate that the shift is released for about 1s after you actually release the key. That makes it very annoying, since you either get this ""English (US)"" setting and it ignores the space keystroke, or else you have to stop yourself after every capitalized letter to make sure the firmware recognizes that you released it. Shift + other letters (meaning, the phantom 'shift', after you've already released the shift key) are either ignored or bring up a special-characters dialog. All in all, the functionality of the shift key and the capitalization on this keyboard are very choppy, very buggy. You should not have to type slow and plodding to make the keyboard recognize keystrokes accurately.Secondly, there are two problems when the keyboard is sitting for a few moments. It seems like it's in a 'hibernation' or 'timeout' state after 1-2 minutes. After a later period, maybe 5 minutes, the BT radio in the keyboard turns off. You hit a key and it re-connects with the phone. So far so good. The problems occur when it's in this low-power state between 1 and 5 minutes (roughly - my times may be off).The first observation is between about 2 and 3 minutes of idle time. When you hit any letter or number, the keyboard repeats the keystroke 7 times. Exactly 7. So you hit ""S"" and you get 7 of them. If you hit 'i', you get seven 'i's. The next keystroke is recognized and registers properly without repetition, but the repeating-keystroke is another thing that slows you down immensely when you're chatting or browsing and not constantly on the keyboard. It happens so often that I've just left the extra letters in place, and folks I chat with recognize that it's just the keyboard being wonky when I send messages like, ""WWWWWWWhere is the hammer?"" or ""IIIIIII am just about finished."" (In the latter case, after the repeating ""I"", I have to wait for 1-2 seconds or you run into the 'phantom shift' problem described above, and the space bar keystroke will be ignored.)The second bug occurs perhaps between 3 and 5 minutes. In this case, the first keystroke depressed registers in the phone as a long-press on the soft keyboard, so a dialog opens up to show special character sets (foreign language) associated with the letter on the keyboard. When this occurs, you have to wait for the foreign character dialog to open and become available, then hit 'escape' to close it and continue typing. If you don't realize that the dialog has opened, while you type you inevitably end up selecting one of the foreign characters and that replaces the letter you actually wanted. Again, it requires you to either go back and correct it, or to pause for a few seconds to get back to normal typing mode.All of these things have to do with 'wake-up' when the keyboard is idle for a few minutes. Once it is awake and responsive, typing is comfortable and accurate. However, a normal, usable keyboard can't be this finnicky and sensitive to short timeout periods. Any time you have a keyboard sitting on your desk, table, in your lap, or whatever, this is perfectly normal, mainstream usage. All of these things would be corrected with an updated firmware and I'm hopeful, but perhaps not optimistic, that the company will release fixes for it. As it stands now, though, the keyboard has a great form factor and great battery life, but is very annoyingly buggy, which makes it difficult to use smoothly. I can no longer send it back to Amazon but I may just put this one on the shelf and plug a USB keyboard into the phone dock until I see a firmware release for this keyboard.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ADOWDJFGCWZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005F7RO20#wasThisHelpful","R1ADOWDJFGCWZ6","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's made of fairly heavy-gauge steel, pretty strong. Installation is no easier or harder than any other wall mount. We've had an old-ish 55"" LCD (not an LED - so it's about 4"" thick, even 5"" at the base, and about 90lbs) hanging on this for almost 3 years, and so far, there have been no problems. I will add that we have some serious bass in the room, and that the kids stomp on the floor upstairs from this room all day every day (jumping off beds, chairs... dressers... what have you) so this is about as much abuse as you could imagine a wall mount experiencing, other than being placed on a boat or in a camper/RV.

"Wow. I'm a big fan of Fujiyama Homme. I had not tried Private Number until another customer asked me to write a review and I realized I hadn't even opened the box yet! (I have a huge fragrance wardrobe... love collecting!) I also have Fujiyama Black Label and Sport. Both ""OK"". Now for Private Number.Wow.The spray starts light, happy, only BARELY sweet. As the vetiver, grass, iris top note dried away quickly I thought I smelled mid notes that were pointing directly at a ""Polo Double Black"" type of solution, which is GOOD. Mango, dark chocolate, ambergris, still a floral I can't pick out, but it never even got quite a sweet as Double Black and I never consider that one cloying, by any means. But it kept right on drying. What you end up with, is sublime. I'm having a hard time drawing an analogy with another fragrance. It might be closest to Creed Silver Mountain Water. It's a bright, but dry, pleasant formal fragrance. The basenote keeps vetiver, and maybe lilac. There could also be the most subtle hint of tobacco, but it would be very subtle if it's there at all. Nothing whatsoever like Tabarome, if you're familiar with that scent.Sillage is great, it's not overpowering but a very pleasant amount to share with someone standing immediately beside you. Intensity grows the closer you get. So you wouldn't need to dump it on. It is ever so slightly powdery, but I don't want that to be off-putting. I really do NOT like powdery fragrances but this isn't the typical ""powdery"", I just mean, the base note has a VERY dry floral / green aroma.I wish I'd known it was this good! For something at this price point to be that interesting and dynamic, it's just hard to go wrong. I could wear this both for formal and informal occasions, although, in my mind, the fragrance is more to share with, and enjoy, being close with someone... so... wear it when you want to take a walk in the park, have a nice dinner, go to a movie. Something to be shared and enjoyed intimately.It's an easy 5 stars. For the price, the value is incomparable. I'd need to do a side-by-side to figure out if I like it better than Fujiyama Homme or not, but they are both VERY good fragrances.

"My wife and I both own a bottle of this. This clearly errs for women but a man can pull it off. It is a good, simple, extremely clean scent that focuses on green tea, a clearly synthetic vetiver, perhaps a hint of lilac. It is light and fresh. Although it is errs on the side of a feminine fragrance, it is enough of a green/vetiver to be usable, and enjoyable, for men, in the right circumstance - in fact, in most circumstances when you'd wear any light, fresh vetiver or aqua. I wouldn't wear it to work or to a formal evening, but for a day out at the park with the kids, it is great. So I don't use it as an everyday scent, where it very well may be that for a woman (at least when it's warm outside)! It also obviously requires a man who has a wardrobe, and a personality, that can adjust to the mood of the event. Perhaps it goes without saying, but for a man who needs to smell like saddle leather and gun smoke all the time to maintain a persona or self-image, this won't be relevant! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NFDOIRVRK21C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000C237B0#wasThisHelpful","R1NFDOIRVRK21C","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm glad this has shown up on Amazon, as I wrote an in-depth review that was filtered out from numerous Chinese-wholesale websites because it isn't positive. Hope someone can benefit from all of this info!IntroductionI am not a professional tester, but a `real enthusiast' for Android tablet hardware. I have owned many tablets; my current benchmark comparisons are: Google Nexus 7 and 10, Acer Iconia A500 and A700, Asus Transformer Infinity TF700T, Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1. I like these non-US-market options to compare against current offerings in our market. I am currently evaluating against these benchmarks a Vido N90 FHD, Nextway NX9, and Cube U9GT5.Physical Form FactorThe N90 is fairly well-constructed with not much creaking. It is solid and feels good to hold. The buttons are convenient when at top-left (portrait) or top-right (landscape). The front camera is nested in the corner which creates an odd, offset angle for video chats. The ROM is programmed such that the tablet's natural orientation is upside-down, meaning that some programs that orient themselves to ""default"" and ignore auto-rotation leave you with the buttons at the bottom, right on top of your lap / desk. The the power charging, Micro-USB, headphone and Micro-SD slots are all along the same edge as the power button. If you hold the power button near the top, your headphones, USB and/or power cord would also stick out of the top. This could be good or bad depending on how and when you typically use these ports.ScreenThe screen is of course a 4th-Generation iPad doppelganger. The resolution is stellar; the screen is bright and crisp and offers minimal edge-lighting effect (barely visible on black screen). There are no dead pixels. The surface sits perfectly on the frame - perfectly smooth with no warping - and there are no Newton rings on the screen. It is high gloss, attracts smudges, and reflects everything. The brightness is ample but perhaps not QUITE comparable to the best panels out there. The colors very good but are not quite as extraordinarily saturated as a Samsung panel, and the display is clearly not as bright as the Asus Transformer Infinity's Super-IPS display. For viewing photos and reading books this ""retina"" display is simply stellar. The challenge comes with the hardware and OS; neither appears to be equipped to take advantage of, or even cope with, the resolution available for games or movies.SoundThe sound is very good. It produces good stereo sound that is comparable with the best of the list above. The only better sound may potentially be delivered by the Google Nexus 10, which sports extremely high quality front-firing stereo speakers. The placement of the speakers on the N90, however, are such that you would typically have your palms around the area when in landscape mode, (i.e., watching movies) which creates a sort of `reflection' off your palms and simulates the direct-firing sound quality of the Nexus 10 or Samsung Galaxy Note.Battery and ChargingOn opening the box and turning on the tablet, the battery was at 83%. My first goal was to get it charging up. I found that the tablet cannot charge from USB. The standard 2.5mm, 2A / 12V charger must be firmly seated in the port or charging will not commence. I left the tablet on, but idle, and charging overnight. The tablet had only charged from 83% to 92% after 10 hours. In the morning, I found that the tablet had deadlocked. I had to perform a hard shutdown (hold power button for 10+ seconds) then re-start. The re-start sequence appeared to hang and took over 3 minutes to bring up the Android desktop.It dropped from 92% back to 83% no more than 5 minutes of usage (primarily, just configuration and installation of apps). After about 20 hours of uptime including about 8 hours of light use, including a handful of benchmark tests, downloads and installs, web browsing, messaging, and a few minutes of streaming video from Netflix, it finally went down to 15% and warned me; after another half-hour of Kindle reading, it went slowly down to 13% and I plugged it in. I may have gotten another hour of kindle reading from the single charge.Recharging had it back to 100% within 2 hours which is obviously not correct (given that overnight charging with the same charger only reached 92%). I left it to charge overnight. I unplugged it around 7am and it indicated a 100% charge. Within half an hour it nose-dived back to 83% or so (same as before), but after a full day of intermittent Kindle, web browsing, downloading apps, multiple restarts, all with the screen at full brightness, the battery sits at 45%. It is now after 9pm. The enormous battery indicated by specifications (10,000mAh) bears out in real world application even if the OS doesn't appear to be fully in touch with the voltages of the battery cell.After several recharge/discharge cycles I have found that it would reach 100% charge, but drops very quickly to the low-80% range. There must be some defect or error matching the voltage of the battery with the OS's battery monitoring firmware.ConnectivityThe signal strength of the WiFi card is excellent with it consistently reaching 3-4 bars in areas where other devices only reach 1 or 2. This is essentially a useless observation because download speeds are absolutely abysmal. Downloading an 8MB program from Google Play took over 2 minutes. Overall, simply with anecdotal observations, the WiFi card has consistently high signal strength but simply cannot download anything from any network at an acceptable speed. It is, in fact, so slow that I would assume this is a hardware or firmware defect.CamerasThe cameras are very good. Although the rear camera isn't the highest quality it takes pretty good pictures in good light. The front camera delivers pretty good quality and frame rate. On the rear camera, focus indoors, even in relatively well-lit areas, is not very good. There is also no LED flash. Although the front camera is great for video chats, the rear camera is unexceptional and would not rival the high-end offerings.SoftwareThe tablet unfortunately is not certified by Google, and so, none of the games and few of the other apps I've purchased are available in Play Store. Only those apps without device filters are available. Google Play Movies & TV is not pre-loaded on the device and is not available for download from Play Store. Netflix App is available in Play Store, and Amazon Prime Instant Video can be played via a web browser. The streaming resolution is very poor even with excellent connections and the frames skip regularly. Part of the challenge may be the high-resolution panel; a well-known issue is that the Android OS and most apps are not programmed to cope very well with the super-high-resolution panels that have become available in recent months. However, it appears that the maximum supported resolution basically doubles the pixels - so each `pixel' in the movie is actually a 2x2 block of pixels on the screen. The pixellation effect is pronounced and ends up in a video quality that is worse, in fact, than the same movies playing on a 1280x screen. This may have something to do with the particular Android ROM configurations loaded on the tablet.PerformanceThe processor is incredibly slow and requires considerable time to open apps that open almost instantly on any other tablet from the US market. Kindle requires 10 to 15 seconds to open. Netflix requires up to a minute to open then another minute to load the movie thumbnails. The tablet itself takes up to 2 minutes to boot and become responsive. Despite the specs for this tablet, the performance is abysmal and truly seems like it's being run by a very outmoded, underpowered CPU rather than a 1.6GHz Cortex A9 dual-core Rockchip CPU. Android System Info confirms that it is a Rockchip CPU.The WiFi seems to get a strong signal, but is abysmally slow. Some apps that are less than 1MB still require 2 minutes to complete downloading from Play Store. A 166MB game has taken 10 minutes and is still only 75% done.RAM is a real problem on this tablet. The OS requires some 400-500mb just to boot and run at idle. Simple tasks such as Settings take 2 to 3 times the memory footprint of the exact same programs running on a certified version of Android. Although the specification states that it has 1GB DDR3 RAM, it in fact only has 804MB available, which means that there is a problem either with the ROM or with the hardware itself. The tablet therefore runs out of memory frequently and kills cached processes because every app (and I do mean, every app) opened ends up with the system running out of memory. Frequently, after a few apps (Settings, Browser, Play Store) have been opened and the system has started killing cached processes, new apps or switch-to apps end up freezing or crashing. Settings and ""All Apps"" screens crash often after a few minutes of normal use. When any background task is underway (such as a file downloading or a web page rendering) the notification window is unresponsive; you cannot swipe to remove notifications, nor switch to another task, until the background task has completed, freeing up system resources. Occasionally the entire system locks up and the only way to correct it is a hard shutdown (hold power button for 10 seconds) as all soft keys and the physical ""escape"" key are unresponsive. I have tried three different memory management applications, including the TaskMan app that is pre-loaded and running on the device by default, and none appear to make any difference in the device constantly running out of memory, causing app crashes, slow open/re-open of all apps, or with the entire system hanging. In HD mode, these issues only seem to be worse, as the high-resolution icons add even more RAM consumption to the idle footprint, and creating an even bigger mess as the system trips over itself to kill cached and even active background processes to make space for running apps.I know this is from a bad ROM or bad hardware (not sure which) because even on my old Acer Iconia A500, which has a 1GHz single-core CPU and 512MB of RAM, Android 4.0 opens in about 30 seconds, runs with an idle footprint of about 200MB, and can open any number of apps including browsers, movies, and 3D games, and run them VERY smoothly and stable. In theory, the N90 is a vastly more powerful device but it chokes itself even on basic tasks like checking email, installing apps, or browsing the web.The AnTuTu score was deceptively good, at 9395, but the 3d renderings were choppy. This is irrelevant if you cannot access desired games (such as Captain America, HEAT 7, Dark Knight Rises, etc) anyway. I managed to load GTA III, but the app requires over a minute to start; upon ""Click to Continue"", the app crashes after attempting to validate the license. The respectable AnTuTu score also does not reflect in the performance of starting the tablet, opening apps, or playing video.ConclusionOverall, this device is not recommended. There are other offerings even in the overseas markets with the same excellent panel but far superior ROMs that are far more stable and effective at managing memory. Because of the filters in Android Market, none of the common games and relatively few of the most useful apps in the US market are available. Although some of this tablet's competitors in the Asian retail markets share some of its deficiencies (such as the excessive RAM consumption by the OS, very slow boot time) none so far have the same challenges with stability of the OS or the ability to run common tasks. When looking for an acceptable role for this tablet in day-to-day life, this may be good for checking email or reading e-books (not at the same time). It is capable of playing MP3s, even streaming MP3s. It is not recommended for taking videos, video playback, gaming, or any `active' user who would want to multitask on the tablet quickly and efficiently.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F2EINAALH3JV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AJOPNXQ#wasThisHelpful","R3F2EINAALH3JV","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never came back and reviewed this, but I played this game last year (2012) and enjoyed it thoroughly. It's creepy, well made, an engrossing demented adventure! It is definitely an adult game and was a little too memorable in the few clips my (at the time) 3-year-old son watched me play. For grown-ups, or near-grown-ups, this is worth it.

"This was great out of the box, quiet and very warm. It replaced another space heater we'd had for years. On the old ceramic heater the fan was loose (bad bearings) inside the unit to the fan 'rattled'. I was very happy with this new one, especially at its price point, but found that after only about four months of intermittent (light) use the fan has come apart in this one. It now rattles miserably - going in the trash. The old heater was just an ordinary K-Mart one, and lasted for the better part of a decade before it just wasn't usable. This one only lasted for a few months. Unacceptable. I don't know what other type to recommend but the basic point is, you would likely be better served buying any common space heater from Walmart or Target, or buying a more premium one from Amazon. No need to waste money on this unless you really only expect a few months' useful life out of it.----------------------Update 1 year later: the second space heater. For just a few weeks of use last season and a few weeks this season the fan bearing is bad, and the fan is annoyingly noisy. These fans are not intended for regular use. If you're looking for something that will heat a room you use often - daily, or even weekly - this is a waste of your money. If you only intend to use it for 20 or 30 hours, that's about it's useful life, so you should be fine.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KDX0TUIZ45C2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TKDQ5C#wasThisHelpful","R2KDX0TUIZ45C2","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought three of these to put LED strips under our kitchen cabinets. After three weeks of relatively frequent use the power supply died. I think a transistor or relay went bad. I had to order another one (which worked) and toss the broken one. I do not know how long any of them should be expected to work, but certainly more than 75 to 100 hours of use.

"I went from an old entry-level GT (Aggressor 2.0) with aluminum hard tail frame, caliper brakes, etc. Gears were getting worn. This was on sale around Black Friday so I sprung for it rather than having a new gear set installed. WOOPSE!The old bike has a LOT of mileage and a LOT of thrashing on it. Warp in the front wheel, bull bars, scratches, dirt, everything is worn. Last couple of years I've primarily just used it for taking the kids for rides in a trailer. But it's an old trooper.This Mongoose is just an embarrassment to itself. Let me enumerate the unfortunately lengthy list of things that are wrong right out of the box, and some inherent design flaws:1. One of the tire tubes (rear, as it turns out) was leaky from new. A 3-mile ride and the tire is down when I pumped it up just before I left. (Fixable, but should not be the case.)2. The front brake caliper's inner brake pad rubs against the rotor when the axle is properly seated in the fork. (Fixable, but should not be the case.) (Update: Adjusted the inner brake pad, cable tension, but it appears the front rotor is warped as well, it squeals in cycle with the front wheel rotation while riding.)3. The crank shaft squeaks and creaks, sounds like dry or just bad bearings.4. The derailleur is either mismatched or improperly adjusted; the chain derailed three times during my inaugural ride. (Update: further riding indicates that the gears just don't shift quickly/smoothly relative to better sets. Adjusting cable tension helped only incrementally but still could no solidly land a gear, especially when moving across several sprockets quickly.)5. The gears are either misadjusted or mismatched and could not be shifted when under load; the chain could not slip even when the derailleur was tugging at it. Only shiftable under light load or freewheeling. If you either do any real riding or have to haul along 80+ pounds of trailer and children, don't plan on shifting while climbing.6. Gears are mismatched to bike/wheel size. The climbing gear (first) is clearly in a ratio designed for a 24"" or at most 26"" bike. It's utterly useless. Of course, on my old (26"") bike I could go up seriously steep climbs with the trailer attached, this thing was just utterly hopeless. I would not even attempt to take a real ride (i.e., trail or mountain) with this thing. Overall, please understand the gearing is a total mess, a colossal catastrophe on this bike. It's not ""designed""; it's a set of mismatched, cheap components welded/bolted together without any overall rhyme or reason.7. This is a mere matter of preference / performance, but the bike is VERY heavy. At 46 pounds, it's a full 10 pounds heavier than my Aggressor, even though it's supposed to also have a welded aluminum frame. I'd not be surprised if the frame only has one aluminum pipe and the rest is made out of chro-moly (and filled with lead?).In general, if you're a light/occasional, casual rider, you could order this, take it to a bike shop for a full tune-up, and be OK. Even as a casual rider, you won't want this thing if you're in an area with a lot of hills/mountains. As a serious or semi-serious rider, this thing is a pretender. It LOOKS cool and the feature list SOUNDS good, but in practice, it's just... well, it's what you'd expect for <$300. Garbage. It's a mess of low-quality frame and assembly and mis-matched components that end up in a disastrous riding experience.I will readily admit, I probably had too high hopes/expectations. GT bikes (as with many other high-end manufacturers) are high quality, great bikes. I've had three GTs and loved them all so for my purposes, I'll likely just fork out what I have to to either replace the complete gear set on my old frame or just get a new GT. As I said, if you aren't a 'serious' rider and live in a relatively flat area, this bike may be OK for you with some adjustments. But for anyone who puts any real load on the bike, really rides, what you pay is what you get. Just take my review as a cautionary tale - caveat emptor - for folks who might, as I was, think: maybe you really CAN get a steal, get all the features and functions of a high-end bike for an entry-level price!No. You cannot.UPDATE:After a couple more rides it is clear that this thing is just very heavy and geared improperly. I can't get nearly as much torque in first gear with this thing - maybe half as much.Also, the frame ends up being about 16"" (center of crankshaft to top of seat tube). I have the seat extended to its absolute maximum height and it's still about an inch and a half shorter than it should be for proper posture. I'm only 5'11 and with the seat at maximum height, my knee is still bent when the pedal is fully extended. You can see how downward-sloped the top tube is. If you're 5'10 or shorter this should be fine but it's simply not big enough for anyone my height or taller.The lack of lockout on the front and rear suspension is a killer. With 29"" tires and spongy suspension it obviously soaks up rocks and roots really nicely as long as the trail is relatively flat. But when you need to climb a hill, the efficiency on this bike is just abysmal. True torture! No need to put yourself through it. Rather than upgrading all of the components as an earlier reviewer recommended, you could just buy an entry-level hardtail Specialized or GT for $100 more.Update 2:Note that the frame has a 16"" (small) seat tube and that there are no size options available. I am 5' 11"" and cannot get the seat high enough for a proper riding posture. This bike is not made for riders over 5' 9"" or so unless you don't mind a very inefficient posture (I.e., seat is too low relative to handle bar, leg is not fully extended on power stroke, have about 4-5"" of stand-over room). Just another way it has proven an ill match for me...","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPU5RKGUUDULI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006Y5GIF6#wasThisHelpful","RPU5RKGUUDULI","A3MUO47CT6EQF8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MUO47CT6EQF8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh, is this thing fun!That is, now that I have figured it out and learned from initial mistakes.I am an artist and crafter who loves to design and create unique and one-of-a-kind items.  I also hail from Germany, and so far I have had to write sentiments and such by hand because there is no such thing as a pre-fab stamp.When Amazon.com offered this Brother ScanAndCut machine for review I was at first a bit hesitant.  I own the original Cricut but don't use it anywhere near as much as some people, so would this machine also be a bit of a waste?  I went on YouTube and other sources to see what sets this machine apart.Ta-Daaaa!!!!!  I can hand-write a sentiment in any language, scan it into the machine, and get a perfectly cut paper image the quality of a very dainty die.  How cool is that?The mistakes I referred to earlier have been getting the correct placement to minimize waste, and the correct size and thickness of pen used so as to not over-tax the machine's capabilities.  Once those little glitches were ironed out this machine has become major fun for me.Oh, I know that the possibilities are endless, and others have written about them and also the setup in detail.  I just wanted to highlight what it has done for me personally.  Of course it can fuzzy-cut, so having to buy expensive dies to match certain stamps just to cut the outlines is a thing of the past.  You can use ANY stamp in your collection and get the ScanAndCut to cut it out perfectly.If this machine is on your wish list for Christmas, move it to the top of the list.

"When it comes to pictures, print quality matters a great deal to me.  I used to be a die-hard Canon fan but was put off by the ridiculous ink cost and printers gobbling it up during each start-up cleaning cycle (should have been labeled ink eating cycle).Then I got introduced to an Epson printer and was sold.  Not only was start-up time cut down to a mere few seconds, print quality was also true to what I saw on the screen.  There is nothing worse than seeing one thing on the computer screen and getting something entirely different upon printing.None of my current printers feature double trays, however, so printing pictures requires a lot of manual setup.Enter the Epson PictureMate.  Ready when I need a picture, and fast for what Iam used to.  Print quality is impressive.  Colors are true, no more wasted ink and paper.  The prints are supposed to last 200 years, something impossible to prove unless I reincarnate a few times.  But given how terrible some prints from 10+ years ago have deteriorated I have high hopes that Epson's pictures will hold up to the test of time.In a nutshell, for pictures up to 5x7"" this printer is ideal.  Prints are crisp and clear and true to what the camera saw.  Cost is a little high, but since I have no waste from off-color prints and can count on each print to be a success the cost per print is definitely worth it.One request, however:  Epson, please offer matte and satin paper in your sets. I would much prefer those over high gloss any day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F5OA3KBLRQNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KU0RIA#wasThisHelpful","R3F5OA3KBLRQNX","A1XR58IRKP3HEZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XR58IRKP3HEZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Downgraded my rating from 4 to 2 stars:Battery life has been horrible, not even 3 hours and the watch is dead!  I wonder if Huawei reads these reviews and acts on them or if I have to jump through hoops for more of the same.  I had been so excited over getting this watch and am now so terribly disappointed!  I cannot in good conscience recommend this watch based on such a lousy battery life.  I can't even take it shopping with me because it will be dead halfway through.  Talk about a fun killer...I am new to smart watches, so unlike some other reviewers  I really have nothing to compare this watch to.Setup was super easy, and while the watch was charging I played with it and then read the instructions.  Pairing the watch with my phone was easy as well, just download the app and follow the instructions.The reason I am giving it four stars is that there are no instructions on how to add more apps.  They show up in the app's menu, but since they are already installed on my phone the only options I am given are Open or Uninstall.  If anyone knows how to add them to the watch, please comment!No read glowing screen so far, so hopefully mine is not a dud.  I love the Google Now feature, talking to my watch is kind of fun and nerdy all at the same time.Since I am still learning all this watch can or can't do I will probably add to this review later on.  First order is to figure out how to get the Music app to play decent music and not that weird stuff the watch has selected thus far.It is a gadget for sure.  Hopefully the Fit feature will get me to walk more...","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36JAGXFWRUZDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013LKLIB0#wasThisHelpful","R36JAGXFWRUZDO","A1XR58IRKP3HEZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XR58IRKP3HEZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In my family the women tend to be ""blessed"" with way too much unwanted hair.  I have never shaved, rather, Ihave always gone after the roots of the hairs to thin out regrowth.  I have also tried NoNo but found it to be useless for me in that this device truly DID burn off the hairbut did not reach below the skin surface which made for stubbles the next day.  So, back to the epilators.This device intrigued me.  It promises permanent hair reduction (note that it does not promise that no hair will grow back).  The booklet is detailed and spells out the Do's and DON'Ts as well who should not use this device.  (If you have a pacemaker or other item implanted, do NOT use this device.The other reviewer reported burned hair.  Maybe she missed the part where it says that hair must be removed first before using this device.  iluminage goes after the hair follicle, not the hair itself.Protocol is once a week for 7 weeks, then touch-ups as needed.It is way too early to review the EFFECTIVENESS of this device.

"It just so happens that recently I searched through all my older microphones to see if one might fit my cell phone and had no luck, none had a 3.5mm plug.  The wind noise this time of year can really interfere with videos.  So when the mind readers at amazon.com offered up this microphone for review I didn't hesitate.I tried it out immediately upon receipt.  It was very windy this afternoon with lots of dry leaves rustle as well.  The microphone performed beautifully with my voice being clear and easy to understand.  This will also come in super handy when I film in my noisy rehab room.Monitoring a recording via a headset is super easy because the microphone's plug has a built-in headphone jack, so there is no need for constant plugging and unplugging.

"My nose is hypersensitive when it comes to colognes and perfumes.  If someone bathes in that stuff it gives me an instant headache.  Also, I can't wear colognes around my wildlife so as not to spook them.  I do, however, like a classy, light-on-  the scent hint of scent.This Eau de Toilette hits a home run on all counts.  It is not sweet.  It does not give me a headache.  It has a pleasant, fresh scent that strikes me as a mix of wood bark and dainty flower.My husband judges a cologne by how long the fragrance remains detectable for his nose.  I just sneaked in the bedroom and sniffed his wrists without waking him up.  It's there, whisper light and pleasant.  I could sniff on this all night...But the deciding vote lay with my husband, and with the simplicity of a guy he declared that he likes this.Oh goodie, I am married to the best smelling man in town!Very highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I5G479ES0LCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DKMY1UK#wasThisHelpful","R1I5G479ES0LCN","A1XR58IRKP3HEZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XR58IRKP3HEZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So we had to step it up to the better food which costs a fortune, but at least they eat it.  Now that both are stable I am searching for alternatives I can sneak in to cut down on the cost a bit.

"I had bought its predecessor a while back when my Eureka didn't quite bite the dust but broke off an essential clip so now the pads can't be attached anymore.  I love the Bissell line in general for their quality, performance, and ease of use.  Their carpet steamer for pets is exceptional.This newest machine is no exception. What I love about it is that the tank part is detachable and the unit come with a long steam hose and plenty of attachments to do above-floor cleaning.  Great to get the scum off and behind faucets where it is hard to reach with sponges.  The machine also heats up fast and leaves the floors merely damp.  They dry within minutes due to the residual heat.Best of all,  this Bissell uses the same pads as its predecessor, so I didn't have to jump online and buy a bunch of new ones.  The pads are high quality and will last.  As far as I know. there are no generic pads available.  The generic ones listed with the predecessor did not fit.So now the predecessor is in the wildlife rehab room  (a lot quieter than the old Eureka and does a better job), the Eureka went to recycle heaven, and this new baby cleans all my floors and kitchen and bathrooms upstairs.

"My first impression of this head lamp is ""Wow!""  I have several by now, for different applications.  In the house I love my Petzl Tikka which is perfect for crafting and lightweight enough to not give me a headache.  For outside at night I use either my Northbound Train or Energizer when I need a green or red light.  The Energizer is the least comfortable because it is front heavy and needs to be strapped tighter = headache.In fact, weight is a major factor for me, so when I got the chance to review this Maxcraft LED Mini Headlamp I jumped at it.This is indeed a lightweight.  It does feel a bit weird at first because the front part of the little flashlight is a bit heavier and that is noticable when I first put it on.  The light has five modes:  it starts with the highest beam, then medium, next click fairly low, then fast flash, then SOS.  The end cap absorbs light and helps locate the light in the dark, but the light has to be exposed to good light during the day for that to happen.  The head band is large enough to accommodate the biggest noggin' and adjusts very easily.There are no hard plastic parts digging in my forehead, another big plus.  The part that holds the flashlight is soft silicone, and that wraps around the back where it touches the forehead.  It might feel a bit sweaty in hot weather, but that is a minor concern since it is a narrow strip.It is too early to comment on longevity, so I will update my review later on if something should malfunction.  I hope the light will last a long time.I think this light will join my list of favorites.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FI53U9F9LSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LGILGW6#wasThisHelpful","R1FI53U9F9LSM","A1XR58IRKP3HEZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XR58IRKP3HEZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I first paired this speaker with my phone and heard the voice that it had paired, I didn't expect too much.  Then I turned on Pandora.Call me a blue tooth speaker junkie, I just love those things and have them everywhere:  in my purse, in my car, in the kitchen, in the bedroom, in the living room.  One is not portable (needs to be plugged in) but packs more Ummphh, so this is the one I will compare the Braven to.This speaker really rocks!  Clarity of sound is very high end for such a small unit although this is no lightweight.  You can boost Bass (EQ) by holding the Power and +Volume button simultaneously, cancel it out holding Power and -Volume button.  And it does work without distorting the sound.The Braven is also a Speakerphone AND a charging unit.  If your phone fizzles out during play you just plug it in via its USB cord and recharge directly from the speaker.Without using it as a charging unit, the speaker provides 15 hours of run time.  I haven't verified this, it is still running, and it's been well over 10 hours.  I love that thing!The speaker weighs 830 grams, well over 1 1/2 pounds.  Not bad, at least it won't get blown off the table that easily.  It does, however, have a narrow base and no kick stand.  Size is a little larger than my Grundig YB 400PE radio in that the Braven is a bit thicker and maybe 1/4"" longer.  Dimensions of the Braven are 8 3/16"" long by 5"" tall by 1 13/16"" wide (or thick).I like that it has a battery check light, this prevents running out of juice when least expected.The unit is waterproof against rain, splashes, and water jets.  I don't think they mean you should throw it in the pool, though.  But I will have it playing on a table when I am in the hot tub for sure!  I wouldn't do that with other speakers...Another nice feature is that this speaker will remember the last 8 devices it had been paired to, so no constant manual reconnecting.Well, I have to go and hang up some laundry, to the tunes of my Braven...Very highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34PF5G5ZAV3WH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0102ONELA#wasThisHelpful","R34PF5G5ZAV3WH","A1XR58IRKP3HEZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XR58IRKP3HEZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a licensed wildlife rehabilitator and have rehabilitated and released probably over 1,000 squirrels over the years.  This is a terrible box to buy.Cedar fumes are toxic to rodents, so any squirrel that lives in such an environment will eventually die from lung cancer.  I am shocked that this company doesn't know that.Size is way too small for a gray squirrel.  Which is probably the reason birds decided to make use of it, and they probably built up half the depth with twigs  Not a bad use for it in the end.I have developed and used with great success my own squirrel box and am now offering them up for sale as a kit or fully assembled.  Please check them out on my FB page Sigi's Wild Tails.  Since I am fully loaded with wildlife in my care, I can't do a big production as would be needed for Amazon.com.  My boxes work.

"I own two other laser measure made by Bosch, but Stanley TLM99s has set a much higher standard by having the Bluetooth connected Floor Plan app.  It makes me feel like I am a professional builder or an architect.  What could take you hours or days to measure and carefully draw, you can get it done in minutes.  Amazing!I have no problem connecting this laser measure with the app on my tablet using Bluetooth. The manual doesn't help with how the Bluetooth connection works until I saw the video on Youtube (the company should put that video here.) All you have to do is to tap on the line you are measuring on the tablet and the TLM99s transmit the measurement to that line.  This way, you can adjust the floor plan to the precision in minutes.This is a very serious and time saving tool for anyone who is trying to come up with an accurate floor plan, even a complex one.  It's not just a simple laser measure for those who want to replace a tap measure.  It does require you to be a little bit tech savvy. Not much, but a little bit, as to follow the video instructions.This is the state-of-the-art technology on measuring, and it is cheap!  Yes, you have to pay a few buck for each floor plan, but it's still cheap.  This is a high end professional tool at a basic consumer price.I recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16QTUVQ5Y4RA3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBOPB86#wasThisHelpful","R16QTUVQ5Y4RA3","A2DXENZNO2JT4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DXENZNO2JT4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I own several sports watch like this and most of them are too premature to be on the market because they don't work properly.  Others are great but only useful during certain workouts--not as feature rich.  This TomTom Spark Music + Cardio is the best and feature rich.  I replaced my regular watch because this watch takes care of my needs 24 hours. It tracks my steps, calories burned, sleep, workout time, running distance, and heart rate. It literally covers every activity that I need to track including swimming.  And it shows the date and time without having to press any buttons.Now, you might be curious why I deducted one star if it is so great.  First of all, I didn't receive the headphones, even thought this is supposed to be bundled with headphones (I've contacted Amazon about this).  In the mean time, I paired it with my own LG Tone Pro HBS-750 Bluetooth Wireless Stereo Headset and it paired immediately and smoothly.  I'm very happy to have music without an additional product to carry during workout.As for transferring music to the watch, the Windows app allows you to set up a directory for the watch to search each time it is connected, but it never worked.  It scans the entire computer and after finding the songs, you have the option to either transfer all of them or none.  There are only 3GB of space in the watch, and I don't want all my music to be in there since not all of them are good for workout.  I figured out a simpler way.  I dropped the music I want using the PC folders directly into the watch's folder.  I know the app was to make it easy and foolproof, but it's just too premature to release.The manual is quite poorly written, and it has very little information in there but in many languages, so it looks thick.  It was obviously written by a non-English speaker. It says, ""Move LEFT to open the activity tracking screen.""  I tried to move the watch left, but it didn't work.  I stepped left wearing the watch, but it didn't work.  I swiped the screen to the left, but it didn't work.  I slid my finger on the square block, and it still didn't work. Well, after a long time of looking stupid, I figured out that it means PRESSING the left edge of the square block under the watch screen.  The word PRESS and MOVE are a world apart.  They should have hired a professional technical writer, or produce a video.The manual does tell me that by covering the watch with my hand, it turns on the back light, so that I can see in the dark.  That's very nice.I'm not satisfied with the sleep tracker.  It tracks how long I slept, but not the quality of my sleep.  I have another watch that tells me not only the length of my sleep but also how deep I sleep.  That's important information because sleeping doesn't always mean sleeping deeply, which is a key for health and wellness.The phone app is not user friendly (I use the Android app for the phone) . I am often lost as to how to make it show the latest information.  I hope they will improve the app soon.Hardware wise, it is very well built and sturdy.  It's very easy to remove the watch from the strap.  At first I felt that the strap appears cheap and flimsy with those spikes, but it turns out to be quite well designed in a way that it keeps the heartbeat sensor constantly stay touched with my wrist.One amazing feature that I like most about is its battery life. I can easily get through a week without recharging.  I have seen no other watch in this category could do that.It's a great watch with the above and other minor bugs.  Of course, the shipping department should not have left out the Bluetooth earphones.  I'm ready to restore the missing one star when these problems are corrected.Bottom line, I recommend it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G83J7TEOCYLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01603Y830#wasThisHelpful","R3G83J7TEOCYLT","A2DXENZNO2JT4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DXENZNO2JT4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used many projectors and I still own four other projectors in addition to this one--Epson VS240.  Among all projectors I've owned Epson projectors are my favorite because of their light weight, portability, and brightness.  The one I always carry with me lately is Epson EX7235 Pro (WXGA).I deducted one star because their built quality has not been my favorite.  For the sake of weight and portability, they often chose the light plastic material that often feel cheap.  But, this turn out to be not really a big problem because most of these projectors either die or become outdated before the plastic shells wear out.  I've never broken any of them due to their flimsy container.As for Epson VS240, it is very bright.  The color is very vibrant.  The only disappointment is its being SVGA (800x600), but surprisingly it doesn't compromise much of your presentation.

"I was curious about this Seagate ""Grame Drive"", and wonder what makes this special for PlayStation.  It turned out to be that this is just a smart marketing, targeting those who want to upgrade their PlayStation hard drive.  It's the same ""Laptop SSHD"" as it is clearly printed on the hard drive itself, but the box is labeled for PlayStation.That being said, I think it gives the those who are not sure what drives are compatible a peace of mind knowing that they are buying a product that will work on the PlayStation for sure, as some information I found online said that they were not sure if SSHD would work with PlayStation.  Even thought this drive is priced a little more than other packaging, you are at least paying for a drive that is guaranteed to work on PlayStation.As for the drive itself, I have exactly one like this on my ThinkPad for three years now, and it has been running beautifully ever since I put it in.  It's way cheaper than buying a 1TB SSD, and much faster than a regular 7200rpm hard drive.  The integration of SSD caching and magnetic hard drive is seamless.  So the quality of this drive is proven, at least for me.As for using it on PlayStation, the upgrade process is reasonably easy, even for a non-tetchy.  Upgrade information is available readily on the net as well as on PlayStation website.  So I won't repeat it here.In summary, I am glad the see that SSHD works for PlayStation.  It's a much cheaper option than SSD.

They seem to love the fish dish better.  If I were to order only one flavor, I'll choose fish.  I wish they have a variety of fish, but so far I see only Tuna.I recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKTF9BB41GISU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WEIQ0AU#wasThisHelpful","RKTF9BB41GISU","A2DXENZNO2JT4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DXENZNO2JT4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a dry late summer in North Jersey, and now the early fall hasn't shown more than a couple of rain drops that doesn't even wet the ground.  The Watersmart Plus Coating technology of Scott’s Turf Builder Grass Seed becomes a very helpful feature as we reseed our lawn because even though I try to water it carefully after seeding, any assistance in retaining water during dry season is a plus.After being advised by the experts, I make sure the seeds have contact with the ground, and water lightly twice a day, or sometimes three times if someone is at the house during the day.  In spite of the advanced technology used on these seeds, overseeding is still hard work.  I hope they can come up with an easier way for grass seeds to grow.My yard, both front and back, is about 5000 square foot, and this 40lb bag can cover 8000sqft.

"Growing up in Chinese family, goji is a staple ingredient in soup, snack, and herbal drinks.  I never appreciated the value of it because it was cheap and we used it wastefully.  Now maybe because the Westerners have caught up with the benefit of these berries, they suddenly become very expensive.I'm glad to see these USDA Organic goji berries.  The packaging I receive is good.  These berries are big and reasonably fresh, unlike some of those negative reviewer said.  They are not supposed to taste very good by themselves, as they are supposed to be an herbal ingredient of a dish or drink. When put in hot water, or hot herbal tea, it becomes soft and sweet within a few minutes.My parents and grand parents believe goji berries are good for your brain, eyes, and libido.  Well, having a healthier brain is the most important for me.  I can't tell the immediate effect of eating these goji berries because I am also taking other nutritional supplements for my brain and eyes.

After removing the screw, I still couldn't easily remove the battery compartment cover.  The battery compartment cover on the controller is also very flimsy and difficult to work with.  But, I don't want this to be the deal breaker, since, after all, it is just a toy for kids; rather expensive toy, that is.Ignoring the built quality, the toy is quite entertaining.

"iHealth seems to have cutting edge idea on health devices using the latest smartphone technology, and they are beautifully designed.  However, the functionality and accuracy are poor.  They must be very well funded to keep producing these poorly executed devices.First the device is very sleek in design.  The quality of the plastic is very high.  It comes with a case that holds the meter, the lancet pen, and the test strip bottle, plus a space for other related things such as alcohol pads and extra lancets.The instruction manual is very poor.  I use an Android phone, but the instruction manual mentions only for iOS.  I am technologically inclined, so eventually figured out how to set it up.I was happy to see it worked well and the test results were quite accurate at the beginning.  But, yesterday, I got a very low reading of 79 mg/dl, so, out of suspicion, I took it again and got 178.  I took another test and it gave me 139.  That would make it very hard to judge which number was the true result.Another problem, I have is the app crashes quite frequently.  I assume that if they are serious with their products, we will see a future update that stops crashing.In the same way, they might be able to release a firmware update to improve accuracy.The feature I like most is that it records my test results in my smartphone for easy access and study.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31YQTPL6NMODG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1IRZTW#wasThisHelpful","R31YQTPL6NMODG","A2DXENZNO2JT4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DXENZNO2JT4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After some serious disappointment with another device I've tried, I feel Nuyu is deserves three stars because at least it works.  The negative part of this device is the appearance and the small letters.First, I don't like the design.  Whoever designed it must be of an older generation.  It's funny that the other device I had was very beautifully designed but didn't perform.  This one performs okay but looks ugly.Syncing with the smartphone is fairly smooth.  The manual doesn't tell you which device that shows up on the Bluetooth is the Nuyu.  Unless you have all other Bluetooth devices turn off, you would not know that it shows up as HNY----.  It took me a few second to figure out thta H is for Health o meter, and NY for Nuyu.  But after the first time syncing, it connects smoothly each time.Performance wise, it records my steps and distance quite accurately.  It also knows when I go to sleep, when I wake up, and tells me the quality of my sleep.  Measuring my sleep quality is what I need most from this device because I have other sports devices that measure my workouts that do great jobs for that purpose.  I like the graph that shows my sleep cycle.  Sleep quality is important because it determines my daytime energy.I hope the digits are bigger, it shows date in addition to time so that I can replace the watch.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34X4QUURKXLHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XRPT6Z0#wasThisHelpful","R34X4QUURKXLHH","A2DXENZNO2JT4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DXENZNO2JT4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the device I've been waiting for a long time.  It is a very complete and versatile set of HDMI to VGA converter with sound.  I've bought a HDMI to VGA adapter from another brand (Cable Matters) previously for connecting my computer to a projector using HDMI.  However, that adapter doesn't adapt my computer's 1080p resolution to the projector's resolution, so it keeps projecting off the screen, and it's impossible to make it work properly.This adapter, however, tells the computer that the connected projector is a different resolution (mine being SXGA) so the computer automatically sends the right aspect ratio to the screen, and the PowerPoint and videos appears nicely as if it comes right out of VGA cable.The best part is that now you can wirelessly stream video audio through Chromcast or Apple TV to a projector.

"Mackie Freeplay is made of good quality sturdy plastic.  It was a pleasant surprise to see the battery pack when I opened the box because I thought it was an optional accessory that you have to buy separately, which would add quite a bit to the cost.  I think it is a wise decision to include the battery.  I wish the carrying bag comes with it too, since I will be carrying this baby to my club presentations.  I found out that the bag is not even on the market yet.Freeplay is feature-rich and well supported with a series of YouTube videos telling you how to use its features.  BlueTooth and the Freeplay Connect App, that function flawlessly, makes me decide to give it five stars even though I feel the volume is a little lacking when I connect it to a wireless microphone.  I have to crank both input and output level to the max to make it loud enough to address a room of about 70 people.  Freeplay promises a crowd of 100.  So if there is such an option, I would have given it 4.5 stars.With two one-inch high frequency drivers and an eight-inch woofer, Freeplay produces a wide range of sounds depending on how you want to use it.  You can adjust it to your satisfaction using the app, or the built-in settings.  The BlueTooth connection is very straight forward and works immediately.  Playing music from your smartphone or tablet for a roomful of 100 people is not a problem (unlike the use of wireless microphone).My usual set up is for PowerPoint presentations.  The wireless microphone goes into line one, and the sound from the computer goes to Bluetooth so that the speaker is completely wireless (with battery pack in it), and it can be place closer to the audience, or even among the audience, to compensate the volume.  The battery lasts about ten hours, so it's more than you need for most presentations. Freeplay serves this purpose perfectly, with the exception of mic volume.  If I had the bag, that's complete.I recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUOKT9W1ZYSUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RBQV2XK#wasThisHelpful","RUOKT9W1ZYSUW","A2DXENZNO2JT4F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DXENZNO2JT4F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The watch looks very cool, and that's it.  The user manual also looks cool, but totally useless.  After some attempts to get my phone to recognize it, I found on iHealth website that there are only 8 Android phones listed as compatible. My LG G2, and my wife's LG G3 are not part of it.  After an overnight charge, I gave it another try, and suddenly it got connected with my phone.The first thing it asked you to do after the successful connection was to update the firmware.  It took me 30+ attempts to get the firmware completely installed.  With each attempt, it made about 2% or 3% progress, sometimes none, before it got disconnected from the phone.Yet, the rest of the story is still similar.  The watch stays black and blank until you make a recommended move to make it show the time, but it is erratic, sometimes it will show but sometimes no matter how much you shake it or tap it, it stays blank. It is also impossible to see it in the sun.I wanted a watch like this to track my sleep quality.  I have other watches for heart rate and exercise.  I woke up yesterday morning, to check how I slept, it showed that I slept for zero minutes.  Disappointed.  Then I drove to church, had a big lunch after church, came home and took a nap--a lazy Sunday. After waking up, the watch told me that I had accumulated 3,300+ steps and burned 856 calories.  What a deal!  I love this watch!

"I've been an Oral-B user for over ten years and this is the first time I tried Sonicare, even though I've seen it at the dentists office very often.  My first impression is that the built quality does not appear as good as Oral-B.  Even the brush tip looks cheaper, compared to that of Oral-B.Brushing with it is a different experience.  Because it vibrate many times faster than Oral-B, it feels quite strange, making you wonder if it is really brushing at all.  It has three speeds, and the fastest one really tickles my cheek--you know that uncomfortable itchy feel when you touch something vibrating extremely fast.  It also has a whitening mode.The after brushing experience is different also.  My teeth feel smooth and polished, while Oral-B makes my teeth feel a little rough and clean.It seems that I can't compare them as which one is better because they each does their job in their own way to make your teeth clean.  My dentist cousin recommend Sonicare because it is less abrasive on the teeth. My personal impression is based on the product quality--Oral-B has much quality look, from packaging to the charger stand.  The box that comes with Sonicare is so toughly sealed that you have to have a pair of strong scissors, or a box cutter, to open it--totally lack of creativity.It will take a while to convince me and convert me, but I can say I am happy with both for their own unique technologies.  While the brush tips are more expensive for Sonicare, I found a third party maker selling here on Amazon very cheap.  I've ordered a 20 pack to share it with the family if they want to try.If you are still using manual toothbrush nowadays, it's time to choose an electronic one.

"This SOL Republic Shadow Wireless In-Ear Headphones is very well made with rubbery coating throughout and the cables to the ear pieces feel strong and durable.  It's also waterproof, which is a big plus.The sound excellent, with good bass to enjoy.It should be a great pair of earphones.  Unfortunately, I happen to own a pair of LG Tone, so I ended up comparing them.  LG has a smart feature of allowing you to hide the ear pieces magnetically parked in the neck piece, so the head phones are virtually invisible when you don't need to use them.  I miss that feature on Shadow, even though Shadow has better sound output.Another problem is Shadow is not designed to stay put on the neck and more likely than Tone to fall off your neck if you are active.  If you take this to a theme park of some active adventures, you would likely to lose it.  LG Tone is not so easy to fall off.In general, I still like the feel, style, and sound of Shadow and ignore its weaknesses for the enjoyment of the music. Those weaknesses can be major or minor depending on how you want to use Shadow.  One star is deducted for those weaknesses.For its great sound, I recommend it.

"The recorded legacy of Soviet pianist Sviatoslav Richter is a tough nut to crack.  For one thing, it’s spread over so many labels, and it’s not always clear which recordings were issued with the pianist’s approval.  For another, some of the best performances have some of the worst recorded sound – such as the 1958 Sofia Bulgaria recital, poorly recorded before an apparently tubercular audience but with some of the most stunning pianism you’ll ever hear.  Sony’s new 18 CD set (originally planned for 21 CDs, until negotiations over Richter’s Well Tempered Clavier recording broke down) captures Richter mostly in his prime, preserving the live recitals as Richter actually played them, correcting numerous errors and omissions which appeared in earlier releases.There have been several versions of how the Columbia Records live recordings of Richter’s concerts came to be recorded and then withdrawn.  According to Jed Distler’s excellent liner notes, Columbia’s Artists & Repertoire man, Schuyler Chapin, contracted with two rather shady representatives from Mezhdunarodnaya Kniga (International Livre), an agency for Soviet artists touring abroad.  The MK agents forbade Columbia from using their own equipment – Carnegie Hall’s own microphone was used, resulting in rather murky mono recordings.  Chapin was suspicious enough to ask for Richter’s personal approval, and received a telegram purportedly from the pianist – but originating from Washington, DC at a time Chapin knew Richter was in New York.  Some of the recitals received limited release, but Richter begged through an intermediary for their withdrawal, saying he hadn’t played well, and the records quickly became collectors’ items.  (The label Doremi issued them on CD several years ago.)  Meanwhile, RCA had released three stereo LPs – all studio recordings – with additional live LPs released in 1965.  Richter’s statement that he didn’t play well during his 1960 tour is utterly belied by the recorded evidence,  both studio and live, which goes to the question of whether performers are always the best judges of their own work.Richter’s recording with Leinsdorf of the Brahms B-flat concerto was the first I ever heard, so I was somewhat imprinted with this version for years.  After a relatively sedate opening from Leinsdorf, Richter launches into the initial outburst with vigor, an energy level that’s maintained until the end of the Scherzo despite relative metric flexibility. The slow movement features a lovely cello solo from Robert LaMarchina and moments of unearthly stillness from Richter and the orchestra.  The performance as a whole is stripped of the flab that all too often accompanies Brahms’ works.  Over five decades later this recording more than holds its own.Thirty years after I first heard it, Richter’s recording of Beethoven’s C major piano concerto with the Boston Symphony under Charles Munch remains my go-to recording of the work.  The pianist clearly plays the opening movement as a virtuoso piece – which is appropriate given that the young Beethoven conquered Vienna as a virtuoso pianist.  Richter’s rendition of the first movement cadenza (he uses a slightly cut version of Beethoven’s more extroverted cadenza) is staggeringly brilliant.  But there’s also welcome poetry in the central movement, which brings to mind Garrick Ohlsson’s remark that hearing Richter perform slower movements was a revelation.  Richter was so pleased by Munch’s accompaniment that he kissed the conductor’s hands, to the displeasure of the pianist’s Soviet handler.Richter’s debut recital consisted of five Beethoven Sonatas – a bold choice when most pianists would have performed a variety of music to demonstrate their versatility.  Richter’s Beethoven – replete with bold tempo choices (the finales of Opp. 26 & 57 have to be heard to be believed), pointed phrasing, and rhythmic vitality with Richter sometimes stabbing sforzandi – grabs the listener by the throat.  There is a sense of conviction to the performances that the music MUST be played this way, which compels the listener to abandon preconceptions about the music or comparisons to other performers.  Three of the Sonatas, Opp. 26, 54, and 57, are duplicated in studio recordings – still remarkably inspired, more accurate technically, and in far superior sound.Haydn’s C major Sonata, Hob XVI: 50 is presented three times here.  Each performance, nearly identical, is brilliant but a bit tight and charmless for my taste.Richter’s Debussy and Ravel are largely old-school, with beautiful pianissimos and chords that rise out of the piano like clouds of steam.  Clair de Lune is played with heartfelt poetry that removes all hackneyed associations from the piece, while “Mouvements” and “L’Isle Joyeuse” whirl like dervishes.Scriabin’s 5th Sonata mixes a frenetic eroticism with languor – the coda in simply beyond description.  This performance is far more fiery and inspired than his later DG recording – which was pretty amazing on its own terms.  You can actually hear Richter start walking away from the piano before the audience has even had a chance to begin applauding.The key to convincing Schumann interpretation lies in balancing and contrasting the “Florestan” and “Eusebius” sides of the composer’s personality.  As one of the greatest Schumann pianists of all time, Richter was unafraid to explore the dark-side of Schumann’s world.  The livelier sections of the Novelettes are played with a drive that borders on the possessed.  The opening movement of the C major Fantasy has the ardor the composer calls for, while the March bursts forth with rollicking energy, ending with a final slow movement of almost heartbreaking poetry.  I’m somewhat less convinced by Richter’s Chopin, which is very hard-nosed and devoid of the vocally inspired line which is necessary for these works.  His approach works better for the Etudes than the E major Scherzo or A-flat major Ballade.Richter once said that Prokofiev despised Rachmaninoff – which Richter felt was because Prokofiev was subconsciously influenced by the elder composer; a provocative theory borne out by Richter’s playing of the two composers.  Richter brings to Prokofiev a coloristic sense usually reserved for more Romantic composers – but it’s worth mentioning that Prokofiev himself played in much the same manner.  At the same time, Richter’s rendition of Prokofiev’s more virtuosic passages, such as the last movement of the Sixth Sonata, will make your hair stand on end – while the soaring phrasing of the slow movement is classically Romantic.  Conversely, Richter’s Rachmaninoff is imbued with a strong sense of rhythm.  Some of the Preludes are played with an almost barbaric thrust, while the melodic and harmonic content are also presented in proportion.  In those respects, Richter’s playing resembles that of the composer himself.There are two “outlier” discs in this collection that were recorded in 1977 and 1988.  These include a vigorous and pointed performance of Brahms’ Piano Sonata No. 1, a poetic Liszt Harmonies du Soir, and Schubert Ländler played with a lovely lilt.  On the other hand, the Beethoven C major Concerto is saggy, soggy, and lacking the qualities that made Richter’s earlier recording with Munch a success.As mentioned, the sound of the Columbia recitals has never been optimal, and still isn’t.  While much of the distortion heard on earlier releases is no longer present, the dynamics are still constricted, there are instances of tape flutter, and the high frequencies are somewhat muted – probably a side effect of overly zealous noise reduction.  Despite that,  Richter’s intense magnetism comes through clearly.  As for the RCA recordings, the 1960 concertos sound markedly better than on the original LPs (which I still have) and are far superior to the RCA’s early Papillion series CDs.  The hard-edge that accompanied the studio Beethoven Sonatas has largely been tamed, and the sound overall is fuller and warmer.This is one of those “original jacket” style collections, although the covers have been slightly altered to list the additional works.  In addition to Distler's essay, detailed recording information is included.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AHRPQP8HQKPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFLVFFK#wasThisHelpful","R2AHRPQP8HQKPL","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mozart in the Jungle.  There's a title that grabs your attention.  I haven't read the book this series is based on, and knowing that filmed adaptations of books are rarely complete, be advised that any commentary herein is directed at the series.MitJ follows a young female oboist named Hailey who, after a disastrous rehearsal with the ""New York Symphony"", stumbles into a job as the assistant to brilliant but unreliable conducting sensation, Rodrigo.  The interactions of these two characters with each other and various members of the cast is the primary focus of the plot.  MitJ is well paced, directed, and acted.  The story lines (usually the standard three per episode) are skilfully interwoven.Some have taken offense at the way Classical musicians are portrayed here., including scenes of drug use and sexual promiscuity.  But much of what occurs in MitJ rings true - as they say in police shows, ""the names have been changed to protect the innocent"", but there are very few innocents here.  After 30 years of observing the Classical ""scene"" in Boston and Cleveland, none of the character types here surprised me: the bewildered student, the past-his-prime elder statesman conductor, the ruthless fundraiser, orchestra players more focused on protecting their turf and union benefits than on making music.  Gael Garcia Bernal is said to be based on Gustavo Dudamel, but the real-life example seems to be more focused on making music than the fictional version, who can't even decide on repertoire.One thing that perplexes me is the almost total lack of LGBT (only a token gay couple appears in the last episode), Jewish, or Asian characters on the show - when they are the lifeblood of any arts organization, at least in the United States.  If that constitutes a stereotype then it's one based on fact.  If MitJ renews for another season, here are a few characters and plotlines based on real-life which could be entertainingly utilized: the self-important but musically illiterate blogger; the Pulitzer Prize winning local newspaper critic whose reviews incur the wrath of the conductor, only to find himself replaced by a critic who knows nothing about music; and the aging conductor whose predilection for jailbait is an open secret.The most serious shortfall here is Gael Garcia Bernal, an actor whose work I usually admire.  He gives his character a distracted charm, but can't mime conducting an orchestra to save his life, and appears to be unaware of how to hold a violin or even a baton.  Garcia Bernal should be placed in front of a television screen and forced to watch video of a number of conductors from Toscanini to Karajan to Bernstein - so he could assimilate a plausible conducting technique.MitJ is primarily entertainment - and holding the audience's attention means offering titillation - not lectures on the great composers or their masterworks.  For those wanting a more flattering example of Classical musicians in action, there's always Carnegie Hall.  The best parts of that film are the long stretches of music presented by real-life masters.  The rest is a crashing bore, and doesn't offer much in the way of plot, acting, or character development.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBG5K5QHPWPVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3MPM6O#wasThisHelpful","RBG5K5QHPWPVX","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I'd heard him play a note, I knew of Charles Rosen from my own piano teacher, who'd attended Princeton at the same time as he.  According to my teacher, Rosen could sight-read a previously unseen orchestral score hot off the presses (Bartok, say) and play it on the piano as if it were a Mozart sonata.  A polymath who learned languages as easily as he learned music, he was also a gourmet chef.  Rosen was also known for his sharp tongue and strong opinions.  When my teacher told Rosen he was going to see Furtwangler, Rosen shot back ""Everything will be too slow!""Despite his early training by Liszt's own pupil Moritz Rosenthal, Rosen was the antithesis of the Romantic Pianist.  As heard in this 21 CD set, much of the playing could define the word ""literal"".  And ""playing"" is the right word, as one never gets the sense that the music is being ""performed.""  The pianism, however, is technically impeccable - there's not a wrong or smudged note to be heard in the entire set.  Nor is there a sense of tonal allure, or even a unique or interesting sonority.  This approach will appeal to some listeners more than others - and the results vary depending on the repertoire.A highlight of this set is the late-Beethoven.  The Hammerklavier and Op. 110 Sonatas appear twice in this set.  The conceptions are similar in both performances but the sound is far superior in the later performances, which also include Opp. 90, 101, and 109-111.  The Hammerklavier is authoritative, Rosen taking Beethoven's metronome markings for the outer movements at face value.  There are numerous touches here which are unique without being eccentric, including the projecting of some inner voices in the last movement of Op. 109.In Bach, Rosen makes no attempt to make his piano sound like anything other than a piano, while exercising restraint in the use of pedal and dynamics - moderation is the watchword.  Rosen's performances of the Goldberg Variations and the Art of the Fugue (with two of the pieces in four hand versions overdubbed by Rosen himself) rank with the best (I will admit that Gould's Goldbergs were never to my taste).Rosen's performances of Ravel's Gaspard de la Nuit and Le Tombeau de Couperin, and Debussy's Etudes, Images, and Estampes, are the antithesis of the ""piano without hammers"" approach championed the Walter Gieseking.  Instead, they revel in clarity and straightforward rhythms.  This approach works in some pieces better than others.  Scarbo  from Gaspard is about the most stunning playing in the set, but L'Isle Joyeuse is about the most sexless performance of the work you'll ever hear.The opening movement of Schubert's Sonata D. 959 (the big A major) is offered in a performance that melds a solid sense of structure with tighter than usual phrasing - without sounding harsh or over driven.  The second movement is played as a true Andantino, with little foreshadowing of a wintry death as is often heard these days.  The advantage of this tempo is that the movement's turbulent central section sounds more like part of the whole - rather than an ""episode"".  The final two movements are brisk and untroubled.  The Mozart Rondo, on the other hand, is rather drab and sluggish.  Also included in the set are polite renditions of three sonatas from Haydn's sturm & drang period.Rosen's straight-laced way with Schumann's Davidsbündlertänze robs the work of both its whimsy and moments of pathos.  This version is no match for the highly contrasted recordings by Kempff and  Perahia.  It's ironic that Rosen, who was known for throwing memorable parties, should turn Carnaval into such a dull, pedantic and unmemorable affair.  Another issue with this disc is that the upper register of the piano is poorly tuned.Given Rosen's performing style, it's ironic that he would record an album of virtuoso transcriptions.  He delivers the notes with uncommon fluency, as in Rachmaninoff's treacherous arrangement of Mendelssohn's Midsummer Night's Dream scherzo.  But there's something missing here.  Case in point, the Schubert-Liszt Soirees de Vienne Valse Caprice No. 6 is lacking the waltzing lilt that, say, Horowitz brought to the piece.  In essence, Rosen plays it as Schubert - not Schubert-Liszt.  There is no sense of sorrow in Liebesleid, little joy in Wine, Women, and Song.Least successful is the album of Chopin solo music, which is lacking a sense of vocal or dramatic line, which is essential in this repertoire.  The F minor Ballade and selection of Nocturnes are delivered as if by rote - you can almost hear Rosen counting the beats.  The Polonaise in A-flat major is lacking any sense of the swagger Rubinstein brought to the piece, while the Mazurkas are embarrassingly plunked out.  Somewhat more convincing is a capable Chopin F minor concerto, coupled with a superb Liszt E-flat Concerto with the New Philharmonia Orchestra under John Pritchard.  Rosen's perfectly paced rendition Liszt's fantasy on themes from Mozart's Don Giovanni is one of the high points of the set - musically virtuosic playing that recalls his mentor Rosenthal.  The Hungarian Rhapsody No 10 seems to stimulate the pianist, with the glissansi tossed off with effervescent ease, but the shifting poetry of the Sonetto del Petrarcha 104 evades him, resulting in a sectionalized rendition.Rosen also recorded a good deal of 20th Century music, including works by Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Carter, Kirchner, Boulez, and Webern.  I am unable to comment on the performances because the music is largely unfamiliar to me, although they seem convincing on their own terms.The recordings were made from 1959-1972.  With the exception of the Ravel, all are in stereo.  The sound is variable but leans toward the dryish side, as was common for Columbia's recordings during this period.  The CDs duplicate the programs as presented on the original LPs - with the exception of the late Beethoven Sonatas, which were released on three LPs now condensed onto two CDs. The liner notes for most of the recordings, some of them by Rosen himself, are reproduced in tiny print on the backs of the jackets.  There's also an essay by Jeremy Siepmann which contains this howler: ""Strange to say, in 1962, when Rosen first recorded the Debussy Etudes, directly inspired by Chopin, he was the first to do so, beating even the great German pianist Walter Gieseking.""  In fact, Gieseking recorded the Debussy Etudes in 1954, and was dead by the time Rosen made this recording.  Rosen's first recording of Debussy's Etudes was made in 1951 for the EMS label, although he still wasn't the first pianist to record them - that honor belongs to the South African pianist Adolph Hallis, in a recording made for Decca in the late 1930s.Recommended for fans of Rosen, or those seeking the Beethoven Sonatas or 20th Century music featured on this set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14GG7Y0QYVXC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M16B51O#wasThisHelpful","R14GG7Y0QYVXC9","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vladimir Horowitz's early recordings, believed by some to be his finest, have been reissued numerous times since their initial appearance over 80 years ago.Although Horowitz’s recording career began at RCA’s Camden New Jersey studios in 1928, from 1930-1936 he concentrated his recording activity in Europe (RCA's European affiliate, HMV, had not been as decimated by the Great Depression as its American counterpart). The recordings in this collection date from that period, and also include four brief items recorded in London during Horowitz’s 1951 European tour (his only appearances in Europe between 1939 and 1982).This reissue contains some classics. The Liszt Sonata has never been equaled and is a must for any serious collector, as is the Funerailles. It's hard to imagine in this day and age of endless repertoire duplication that Horowitz's version of Haydn's E-flat sonata was a world premiere recording, but indeed it was. Its relaxed elegance continues to charm, and it remains more musicologically ""correct"" than Horowitz's 1946 and 1951 live versions. Horowitz was also an early champion of Scarlatti, and the four sonatas included here beguile with feline grace, while the B minor Sonata is quietly contemplative. The pianist preferred his Bach ""un-pure"", and the Choral Prelude as transcribed by Busoni is a miracle of line separation and clarity. Horowitz's early foray into Beethoven, the 32 Variations in C minor, is more straightforward and successful than many of his later attempts with this composer.Horowitz's early Schumann, though technically impeccable, did not quite plumb the depths as in his later recordings. So much the better then, that the pianist limited himself to recording shorter works, including an Arabeske with unmatched legato, an effortless Toccata (superior to his spliced 1962 recording), and whimsical Traumeswirren. Originally intended as the finale for Schumann's G minor sonata, the Presto Passionato was rejected by the composer's wife as unplayable. Horowitz makes it sound like child's play. (A clumsy 78RPM side change is a major distraction in this recording.)Horowitz once referred to Chopin and ""the only truly great composer for the piano"" and he invariably included a selection of the Polish master's music in his recitals. The sampling here includes four technically impeccable Etudes, four Mazurkas, and a remarkably up-tempo Scherzo in E major. Also included is a beautifully contoured opening movement from Chopin's B-flat minor Sonata, a project which was never completed due to Horowitz's first retirement. Had fate not intervened, this would have been one of the great recordings of the piece. (The booklet and Amazon’s listing refer to this as the Marche Funébre. Trust me, it’s the first movement.)Horowitz also championed ""modern"" composers like Rachmaninoff and Poulenc, who praised his playing to such an extent (as did Prokofiev and Barber) that it belies the notion that Horowitz was a violator of the composers’ vision. His 1930 recording of Rachmaninoff’s Third Concerto was the world premiere recording of that piece, and earned high marks from the composer himself. It’s easy to hear what impressed the composer: the lithe, panther-like attacks in the virtuoso sections; the melting poetry and perfectly gauged phrasing in the lyrical passages; the dramatic-through line that unifies the conception – despite the disfiguring cuts that were sanctioned by the composer. (However, the legend that Rachmaninoff stopped playing the concerto after hearing Horowitz in the piece is patently false, as the composer performed it no fewer than 24 times between 1928, when he first heard Horowitz play it, and his death in 1943 – and of course he also recorded it with Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra.) Surprisingly, Rachmaninoff’s G minor Prelude is disappointingly sloppy, while the Poulenc Pastourelle and Toccata are by turns gracious and dazzling. A thrilling Prokofiev Toccata and Russian Dance from Stravinsky's Petrouchka is also included.Warner now manages EMI’s old classical catalogue. The error in the Chopin, Op. 35 track listing can be chalked up to the work of interns. While the opening movement of the Op. 35 Sonata has been newly remastered, the remaining items are in previously issued remasterings and sound compressed and tinny. So those of you who already have the Pearl, APR, or Naxos versions of these recordings may want to hang onto those. Otherwise, this is an affordable way for newcomers to acquaint themselves with one of the greatest pianists of all time in his youth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CAQF70OTF1QB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8AQZE0#wasThisHelpful","R2CAQF70OTF1QB","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If there ever was a man born to conduct an orchestra, it was Lorin Maazel.  He was leading orchestras while still in childhood, and as a prodigy had impressed the likes of Monteux and Toscanini.  A photographic memory enabled him to learn scores at site, and he mastered multiple languages with similar ease.  But as an adult his interpretations ranged from uninvolved, to deeply committed, to eccentric - and one never knew which Maazel was going to step onto the podium that night.  In a sense, learning music was almost too easy for Maazel, the lack of struggle sometimes leaving him bored, at which point his negative characteristics came to the fore.  The board of the Cleveland Orchestra stepped into controversy when they chose Maazel to succeed George Szell as conductor, overriding the orchestra players' preference for István Kertész.  Some players in Cleveland never warmed to him, a few even left, while others came to love his work.  Matters weren't helped when a local dance critic was assigned to review the orchestra and repeatedly referred to him as ""child Lorin"", a snide reference to his days as a prodigy.  Maazel's tenure in Cleveland was rocky and lasted ten years - as opposed to 24 for Szell, 18 for Christoph von Dohnányi, and a projected 20 for Franz Welser-Möst.  After Maazel left, he never returned (a planned guest appearance was cancelled at the last minute).  Yet, on balance, Maazel's time with the Cleveland Orchestra had a positive effect: he maintained the high technical standards of the orchestra, brought to it a warmer sound palette, and expanded its repertoire to include works Szell would never have touched.All three Maazels are on display in this 19CD set, his complete Decca/London recordings with the Cleveland Orchestra.  (He and the orchestra were also recorded on the Columbia Masterworks and Telarc labels.)On the positive side: The Pines of Rome and Roman Festivals heard here have never been equaled, let alone surpassed.  It takes a special musician to elevate works which are essentially potboilers into something greater, and Maazel had a knack for bringing out the best in ""orchestral spectaculars"".  Take the opening and closing parts of the Pines of Rome: Under most conductors, the opening sounds like a toy shop on crack cocaine, while the closing march sounds like bad movie music.  But Maazel's molds the orchestra so that there's a sense of genuine playfulness among the Borghese children in the opening, while the troops of the Appian way move with sense of Roman grandeur.  I only wish the Fountains of Rome had also been recorded.  Debussy's La Mer luxuriates in Maazel's tone painting, with each orchestral section balanced perfectly.  Maazel carefully paces the finale, milking each turn of phrase and adding more forte to each climax, until the end where he lets the orchestra loose in stunning fashion.  (I'm reminded of an admonishment by a famous actor: ""Never show an audience your top, because once you do, you've got nowhere else to go.""  Maazel holds his top in check until the very end.)  Maazel's Scheherazade is exceptionally precise and balanced.  If this sounds like damning with faint praise, there are times when less is more, and it's a welcome change of pace to hear clarity in a work where too often conductors mistake passion for sloppy playing.Maazel's recording of Porgy and Bess was the first complete version based on Gershwin's original score, including material discarded during rehearsals for the 1935 premiere.  In championing the work as a legitimate opera, not a tin-pan-alley musical, Maazel helped reestablish the work as an American masterpiece.  Nearly four decades later, this remains the Porgy to hear, beautifully sung and with authentic details like a perfectly ""detuned"" piano at the beginning.  Ivan Davis is featured as piano soloist in the ever-popular Rhapsody in Blue, performed in a manner that recalls what French listeners dubbed ""le style hot"" when they first heard Gershwin play.  This ranks with Earl Wild's rendition as one of the great recordings of the piece.Brahms' Symphonies are a tough nut to crack, as the conductor has to tread the line between Brahms the Classicist and Brahms the Romantic, maintaining a continuity of line yet remaining flexible - all while coping with orchestration which can sound murky and thick.  As far as technical matters go, the orchestra here sounds as transparent as for any Mozart Symphony.  Interpretation is another matter.  If there's a way to make these craggy works sound overly smooth, even slick, then Maazel has found it.  Save for the opening movement of the First Symphony - where Maazel takes the introduction at a rather slowish tempo (similar to Bruno Walter in his late recording), before whipping the proceedings along at a brisk pace for the movement proper - the cycle is an exceptionally fluent, tepid walk through.  The Academic Festival and Tragic Overtures are both performed uneventfully  - with no sense of seniors hectoring freshmen for the former nor any sense of struggle in the latter.  The ""like butter"" approach works better for the Haydn Variations which are given a lithe reading which clearly outlines to structural continuity of the work.There are also discs of overtures and ballet music, the highlight being the complete Prokofiev's Romeo & Juliet, which remains a reference recording.  Ravel's Daphnis & Chloe also holds its own, although I marginally prefer the more spirited (but less precise) Munch recording.The works have been resequenced to maximize the playing time of each CD, so this is not one of those Original Jackets presentations - either in cover art or programming.  In place of the liner notes, there is a perceptive essay on Maazel's Cleveland recordings with Decca.  (Nor is there a libretto for Porgy & Bess, although that can be found easily enough online.)  All performances in this set were recorded from 1973-1979 at Cleveland's Masonic Temple, instead of Severance Hall - which can be tricky to record in.  The sonics are uniformly excellent - naturally balanced, transparent, with a wide dynamic range - and in terms of pure sound are some of the best recordings ever made with the Cleveland Orchestra.  This set is a must have for Maazel, Cleveland Orchestra, or fans of any of the major works in this collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO3HNPIUDVELN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M14IEQA#wasThisHelpful","RO3HNPIUDVELN","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Decca/London introduced Phase 4 Stereo in 1961.  For classical music, the Phase 4 approach was based on miking every orchestra section individually, along with mics for selected instruments – up to a maximum of 20 channels, which were then mixed via a recording console.  This resulted in a dynamic, in your face sound with relatively little hall ambience.  The quality of the sound mostly depended on how skillfully the recording engineer balanced each channel – and the results were not always consistent.  Thus, the Phase 4 sound was the antithesis of the minimally miked, “simplicity is wisdom” approach of the RCA’s early Living Stereo and Mercury’s Living Presence recordings, along with Telarc’s early digital recordings.Phase 4 recordings tended toward orchestral spectaculars and light classics, although there were exceptions.  As for this 41CD set, the performances are highly variable.  I frankly doubt if some of them would have been released if the Phase 4 technology was not a consideration.  For example, Rhapsody in Blue and American in Paris, as performed by Stanley Black and the London Festival Orchestra, are easily the worst performances of these staples I’ve ever heard.  Likewise Israela Margalit’s bumbling, stumbling (and audibly edited) rendition of Prokofiev’s Third Piano Concerto would never have been released had not her husband, Lorin Maazel, been the conductor on the recording.  On the other hand, Ivan Davis’ renditions of Liszt’s Piano Concertos are superb, with an almost Horowitzian frisson.  Antal Dorati was always reliable and the performances here, from Dvořák’s New World Symphony to Orff’s Carmina Burana, are well worth hearing.  Dorati also helms Prokofiev’s Peter and the Wolf and Britten’s Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra, featuring sly narrations by Sean Connery.  Arthur Fiedler’s Strauss Waltzes and excerpts from Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker are surprisingly idiomatic.  Charles Munch offers rollicking performances of the suites from Bizet’s Carmen and L’Arlésienne, and Offenbach’s Gaté-Parisienne, alongside relatively sober renditions of Respighi’s Pines and Fountains of RomeOf all the conductors in this set, Leopold Stokowski seems to have made the most effective use of the Phase 4 technology.  He’d become expert at seating the orchestra for recordings during the 78rpm era, and his early recordings were some of the best sounding of their era.  His interest in recording technology continued to pay dividends during the stereo years.  The performances captured here include a riveting but sectionalized rendition of Berlioz’ Symphonie Fantastique, a Scheherazade which is a bit more precise yet not as lascivious as his RCA version, and his own gorgeously gaudy orchestration of Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition.Ilana Vered is featured in a lovely rendition of Mozart’s Piano Concerto, K. 467, along with the Yellow River Concerto, which was apparently composed by a committee of Chinese composers.  It sounds like the background music in a cheap Chinese buffet restaurant.  There’s also a solo disc of Beethoven’s Waldstein Sonata, Schubert’s Wanderer Fantasy, and Stravinsky’s Three Scenes from Petrouchka.  I don’t know why one would apply a Phase 4 approach to a piano solo recording, but the sound is quite fine.  Her Beethoven and Schubert playing remind me of Kempff, while her Stravinsky sounds is a mite labored – no match for the fiery Rubinstein or the icy hot Pollini.There are also several discs of music which is decidedly off the beaten track for a classical label.  Flamenco guitar virtuoso Paco Peña is featured in a live concert, which is quite simply the greatest and most staggering Cante Jondo recording I’ve ever heard.Especially appreciated are three discs of film music.  Bernard Herrmann’s own performances of music from his collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock – North by NorthWest, Marnie, Psycho, and Vertigo – are included here, as well as music from Journey to the Centre of the Earth, The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad, The Day the Earth Stood Still (which, sadly, does not include the Theremin used in the film), and Fahrenheit 451.  Herrmann conducts the music in a very different manner that when it was tailored to accompany the films, with relatively expansive tempos, and it’s wonderful to have these works conducted by the composer in stereo.Miklós Rósza’s rousing score for Ben-Hur is featured here – and it’s one of the best sounding discs in the collection.  I only wish his recording of Quo Vadis had also been included.The final disc is devoted to “Battle Stereo” - essentially sounds of gunfire and explosions accompanied by famous anthems and overlaid with orations.  Worth listening to once, but I had to use headphones after the cacophony scared the heck out of my dog.The series is presented in the Original Jacket format.  In most cases, additional material has been included, but some discs are the original LP programs with playing times as short at 35 minutes.  Most of the jackets have the original liner notes on the back which can be read with a magnifying glass.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HLQQMPQWCPSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LP298NC#wasThisHelpful","R3HLQQMPQWCPSQ","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the exception of one recording made in 1982, all of the recordings in this 7CD box were made between 1967 and 1970.  I must admit that Nelson Freire largely slipped under my radar when I was a young piano student in the 1980s, even though I worked in a Classical record store.  By the time I was building a CD collection, he was more well-known for his two-piano collaborations with Martha Argerich.  But Freire made something of a splash in the late 1960s when a leading critic referred to him as a “cockeyed sensation” (whatever that means) and went on to compare him with Horowitz.  Freire does have an element of the “frisson” that was associated with the younger Horowitz, along with the elder pianist’s emphasis on harmonic inner voices – usually played with the left hand.  But Freire is entirely his own man when it comes to interpretation, and never gives the impression of imitating anybody.Freire made his Columbia recording debut with a two-LP set which included Tchakovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1, Liszt’s Totentanz, and the ever popular Grieg and Schumann Concertos in A minor – all accompanied ably by the Munich Philharmonic under Rudolf Kempe.  Freire’s treatment of the Tchaikovsky is reminiscent, in the more virtuosic sections, of prime Horowitz – not just in the sizzling octaves but also the sensitive handling of voices I mentioned earlier.  The central andante emanates a lyrical simplicity.  The Liszt is given a flat-out, hell for leather demonic performance.  Freire imbues the “Dies Irae” theme in the left hand with a particular sense of menace.  Never in my experience has the work sounded so terrifying – with the possible exception of when I heard Jean-Yves Thibaudet perform it at the open-air Blossom Music Center accompanied by a thunderstorm.  The Grieg and Schumann nicely balance extroversion and lyricism, without descending into schmaltz.The opening of Schumann’s Carnaval has a full bodied quality that reminds me of Rachmaninoff’s legendary recording. Freire adopts a relatively free approach to tempo, which allows him to portray a rather wild, drunken party – all while maintaining absolute technical control.  In some of the more lyrical sections, Freire liberally brings inner-voices to the fore, so you may hear parts of this work you hadn’t noticed before.  I followed the score while listening to the recording and, trust me, the notes are there.  Like most pianists, Freire does not play Sphinxes.Freire brings a dark tone to Schubert’s D. 899 Impromptus, with a full dynamic range and bracing tempos in the faster works.  This is neither chocolate and whipped cream, nor the wintry syphilitic approach to Schubert – but rather pure music.  He adopts some of the subtle harmonic changes introduced by Hans von Bulow in his edition of Schubert’s G-flat impromptu, but does not transcribe it into G major as Bulow did.The opening movement of Brahms’ Op. 5 Sonata is played with a sense of broad line and structural continuity – it is neither impulsive like Rubinstein’s two recordings nor dissected like all too many others.  While the two slow movements unfold with some ravishing pianissimos and a sense of unforced poetry, the central movement surges with controlled fury.  The last movement is well played but comes as something of an anti-climax – but I feel that’s a problem with the composition rather than the performance.  Freire nicely contrasts the gusto of the Rhapsody in E-flat’s outer sections while keeping the central episode quietly moving.Chopin’s Op. 28 Preludes are a tough nut to crack.  I’ve heard even great pianists fall short in these little masterpieces.  In performing a complete set, the trick lies in capturing the individual mood of each piece while maintaining its context within the whole.  In the final Prelude, in D minor, Freire almost seems ready to burst beyond the capabilities of the piano.  The opening movement of Chopin’s B minor Sonata starts off briskly, with plenty of rubato in the more ruminative sections.  Freire’s use of the pedal is notable as he allows bass notes in the opening movement to be sustained for longer than is usual, while the textures remain clean – so I suspect he uses the sostenuto (middle) pedal, which didn’t exist in Chopin’s time.  By contrast, the faster parts of the Scherzo are played with no pedal at all.  The Largo is delivered at a more flowing tempo than is usually heard, which clarifies the structure but also drains some of the emotion from the movement.  The finale is somewhat anti-climactic, with neither the big-boned extroversion of Rubinstein nor the hot fury of Kapell. Performing from an edition based on Chopin’s manuscript (which is slightly different from the Fontana version one usually hears), Freire’s rendition of the Fantasie-Impromptu is delivered at a brisk pace, with little slowing down for chasing rainbows during the work’s central section.  Freire’s Mazurkas have an authentic sense of swing, resulting from the extended 2nd beat which is a characteristic of the dance form.  The A-flat Polonaise is less successful, somewhat bogged down and earthbound, although cleanly performed.  The B-flat minor Scherzo is more fiery and one of my favorite recordings of the piece.  Here and elsewhere, Freire occasionally amplifies bass lines by moving foundational notes an octave lower, beyond the range of the pianos of Chopin’s time.The key to successfully performing Liszt’s B minor sonata lies in balancing the structural, narrative, and demonic elements.  The opening motifs are played with little sense of menace, so that the octave outburst that follows is truly startling.  From there Freire takes the listener on a fairly wild but controlled ride through the Sonata’s many moods.The sound is consistent with Columbia’s sonics during the period: close up and somewhat dry.  The concertos sound best.  As with Sony’s other Complete Album Collection issues, this set replicates the covers and playing times of the original LPs, with the exception that the original 2LP debut is packaged in separate covers instead of as a gatefold.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OG8NIKSTUNLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMNO65O#wasThisHelpful","R1OG8NIKSTUNLA","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jorge Bolet made relatively few recordings for RCA and Columbia, with most of his output via Decca/London.  This 10 disc set includes his complete RCA and Columbia recordings, including two recordings that were originally made in Spain for Ensayo and later released in the US by RCA.Bolet was one of the great Lisztians of the 20th Century.  That his recordings of the Transcendental Etudes (the box contains one partial and one complete cycle) are technically fabulous goes without saying, even when measured against younger technical titans who can play the heck out of these pieces.  But how many can play them as musically as Bolet does, so that each work has a narrative flow?  Likewise with the Consolations - presented as a cycle on one track - which contain some rare poetry and a ""line"" that is beautifully suspended over the accompaniment.  Many of the arrangements on ""Franz Liszt's Greatest Hits of the 1850s"" (the tackiest and most cumbersome title I've ever seen on a Classical recording) have fallen out of the mainstream repertoire.  The elegant phrasing of Reminiscences of Donizetti's ""Lucia di Lammermoor"" elevates this above the usual operatic transcription.  Beautiful coloration and phrasing also inform Bolet's performance of Schubert's ""The Trout"" and ""Hark! Hark! The Lark"".  (But I prefer Zsolt Bognár's more straightforward treatment of the latter.  I suppose it comes down to the difference between being a Schubertian and a Lisztian.)""Bolet ReDiscovered"", an all Liszt album recorded in 1972 but not released until 2001, is sonically the best sounding recording in the set.  There are a number of missed notes and split chords in the Wagner-Liszt Tannhäuser Overture, which may account for the delayed release.  But there are many felicities to be heard: The rolling arpeggios of Un Sospiro are wonderfully articulated and perfectly balanced with the melody.  Bolet even manages to inject a sense of dignity into the Grand Galop Chromatique.I especially enjoyed Bolet's album of Rachmaninoff transcriptions.  There is a sense of unhurried, aristocratic virtuosity throughout that reminds me of Moiseiwitsch, particularly in the Scherzo from Mendelssohn's Midsummer Night's Dream which was a specialty of the elder pianist.  Bolet's treatment of Kreisler's Liebesfreud and Liebesleid is considerably freer metrically and more relaxed than Rachmaninoff's own recordings, and in line with Kreisler himself.Bolet's Carnegie Hall concert from 1974 is presented here on two CDs.  The Bach-Busoni Chaconne which opens the concert is presented in a big boned, full blooded style, with no attempt to tailor the music to its original version for solo violin.  Chopin's Op. 28 Preludes are considerably less successful - an overall lack of color and a leaden quality sabotage all but a few pieces in the set.  There are numerous better versions on CD, even by lesser pianists.  Bolet is much more successful in the transcriptions, where the trick is melding the acrobatics inherent in the arrangements into a convincing musical statement.  Bolet's rendition of On the Beautiful Blue Danube is permeated with delightful rubati and dynamic shifts (although Josef Lhévinne's historic recording will always hold a special place in my heart).There are no concerto recordings in this box.  But Bolet is partnered with the Juilliard String Quartet in two discs of chamber music, including Franck's Quartet in F minor, Chausson's Concerto to Violin, Piano and String Quartet, and Wolf's Serenade.  These are all lovely, seamlessly integrated performances, and the sound is well balanced between the piano and strings.The sound quality generally is in line with what was usually heard from RCA and Columbia during that time.  But there are some rather startling pitch changes - at 4:37 in Liszt's arrangement of Wagner's Spinning Song from the Flying Dutchman (disc 2, track 5) and at several points during the Bizet-Rachmaninoff Minuet (disc 3, track 4).  I am deducting one star based on these issues.This is one of those Original Album sets, so the sequencing duplicates the original LPs, resulting in generally short playing times.  The original liner notes are reproduced in tiny print on the back jackets - best to use a magnifying glass.  Jeremy Siepmann's cloying essay is more annoying that enlightening.  Fortunately, Harold C. Schonberg's review of Bolet's 1974 Carnegie recital is also included.  My copy included a promotional sticker slapped right on the cover, instead of on the shrinkwrap.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ALC26VFUCJG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J57KHUC#wasThisHelpful","R2ALC26VFUCJG3","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There have been so many documentaries on the three Roosevelts -  Theodore, Franklin, and Eleanor - that when Ken Burns' documentary was announced I wondered what more could be said.  Well, there's plenty to see in this sprawling 14 hour work, including many previously unseen photographs and moving pictures.  A thread of tragedy runs through the saga.After a brief recounting of the first Roosevelts in America (Nicholas Roosevelt, the last common ancestor to the three ""great"" Roosevelts, died in 1742) the story picks up in 1858 with the birth of young Theodore.  Teddy, of the Oyster Bay Roosevelts, was an asthmatic, sickly boy who willed himself into vigorous action - both physical and mental.  He also was susceptible to depression, and tried to conquer despair by outrunning it.  But negative feelings catch up with one, and there was a streak of rage that ran through the man, sometimes resulting in explosions of temper - as when he shot a dog that barked at him.  In the course of one day when Theodore was 25, his daughter Alice was born, and his wife and mother both died.  Theodore left the daughter in the care of his sister and fled to the west to conquer his grief.  When ""rancher Ted"" returned it was a quick rise up the political ladder until he became President after William McKinley was assassinated.  As President, TR was at his best when he was able to channel his zeal into constructive action, like reforming the food industry, busting trusts, and preserving America's natural heritage. But in many ways he was, to coin a phrase, a ""bully""- who thought nothing of invading other nations, and betraying William Howard Taft (who did more the continue his predecessor's policies than he's given credit for).Franklin, of the Hyde Park Roosevelts, born when Theodore was 23, was a lonely boy: tutored at home, with only a small circle of friends who were all from the same social class as he.  Young Franklin spent most of his childhood in the presence of adults, always wanting to please and never annoy them (particularly his father, whose health had been fragile from the time he suffered a heart attack when Franklin was eight).  FDR grew up in his distant cousin's shadow.  He admired and emulated TR to the point where, when he learned he needed glasses, he ordered ""pince-nez"" spectacles, and he was fond of using TR's patented terms ""bully"" and ""dee-lighted"" - and then there was his decision to marry Theodore's favorite niece, Eleanor.  He emulated TR's rise up the political ladder, where he struck many as capable but superficial.If there was ever a member of the Roosevelt clan who was shaped by personal tragedy, it was Eleanor.  She was born in 1884 - the same year as Theodore's daughter Alice.  Eleanor's mother was a cold woman who died prematurely, her father (Teddy's brother) was a severe alcoholic and unstable even when sober.  By the time Eleanor was ten, both her parents and one of her brothers had died.  She never knew parental love.  It wasn't until she went to a finishing school in England that she gained a sense of self-confidence and a conscience to help other people - to be loved by  being useful.  It was her depth that attracted Franklin to her - beyond her famous uncle.Franklin and Eleanor's complex marriage is discussed without being dissected.  Franklin's relationship with Lucy Mercer is examined from a psychological, rather than a salacious point of view.  After Eleanor learned of Franklin's affair with Lucy, they led increasingly separate lives in a partnership that was more than merely political, yet less than a conventional marriage.  Eleanor's lesbian friends are mentioned, but it is left to the viewer to decide if Eleanor ever returned their affections.  Eleanor doesn't seem to have felt threatened by Missy LeHand's increasing role in Franklin's life, and Franklin was friendly with Eleanor's companions, both male and female.  The marriage was largely Laissez-faire relationship, but when the going got rough, as when Franklin was diagnosed with polio, the inner strength of their bond was proved.Various members of the Oyster Bay and Hyde Park branches of the Roosevelt family pop-up from time to time - in particular FDR's mother Sara, and Theodore's daughter Alice. It's ironic that Theodore's family became so bitterly resentful of Franklin and Eleanor.  Franklin essentially carried out much of Theodore's 1912 Bull Moose platform, and I wonder if the Oyster Bay branch's opposition to Franklin was based more on a clash of egos than philosophy - or perhaps they never grasped that FDR and TR basically stood for the same things: a social safety net, shared prosperity, and the projection of American power.  (Indeed, one wonders what Theodore would have thought of Alice's 1940 remark that she'd ""rather vote for Hitler than vote for Franklin"".)  Chronologically, the story ends in 1962 with the death of Eleanor Roosevelt, who had become known as ""First Lady of the World"" and the conscience of the Democratic party.What really astonished me in this documentary is the large amount of previously unseen (by me, anyway) footage. I had no idea there was film of the assassination attempt against FDR - but here it is. There are also a few frames of FDR throwing his arms around his son's and another person's shoulders as they lowered him to his wheelchair at the 4th inaugural - and the home movies that are included as a bonus feature. Almost 70 years after his death, and there are still new discoveries.I had a mixed reaction to the voiceovers provided by Paul Giamatti (Theodore), Edward Herrmann (Franklin) and Meryl Streep (Eleanor).  Giamatti's voiceover for TR sounds the same as his John Adams portrayal and doesn't sound anything like Teddy's voice, for which recordings exist.  On the other hand, if Teddy's squeaky voice had been accurately recreated, it would probably have been unintentionally funny.  Peter Coyote's measured narration won't be to everyone's taste.For all the depth of the production, there were items that were missing.  No mention of the Newport Scandal, which almost sank FDR's career.  Nor any mention of FDR's uneasy relationship with Joseph Kennedy, who helped FDR secure the 1932 Democratic nomination, but later blamed ""that crippled sonuvabitch"" for the death of his oldest son during the war.  Little mention is made of what became of various Roosevelt family members, including Alice Roosevelt Longworth and Franklin and Eleanor's children, after Eleanor's death.The DVD contains a number of special features, including deleted scenes, a making of feature, and a segment with Geoffrey Ward discussing Daisy Suckley - whose diaries and correspondence were discovered in the 1990s and shed new light on FDR.  The Roosevelts may be 14 hours long, but is mandatory viewing for those interested in learning more about one of America's most influential families.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R355S1DI0YRN7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKJ13EY#wasThisHelpful","R355S1DI0YRN7M","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first became aware of Lazar Berman when, as a teenager, I borrowed his early LP of Beethoven’s Appassionata and Liszt’s Sonata from my local library.  Despite the murky recording and out of tune piano, I was bowled over by the bearish Russian’s virtuoso playing.  Not long after that, I heard a broadcast recording of Berman’s 1976 recital from Cleveland’s Severance Hall, which left me perplexed by the sloppy, disjointed, banged performances of Clementi’s B minor sonata and Chopin’s B-flat minor sonata.  Were both performances really by the same pianist?  This boxed set, his complete recordings for Deutsche Grammophon, presents yet a third Berman: one of controlled virtuosity and relatively sober interpretations.Disc 1 - Chopin Polonaises:  Berman’s Polonaises are studies in contrast.  While the extroverted sections are brought off with flair, he brings a meditative quality to the central sections - where the polonaise rhythm is treated with a great deal of freedom.  Here and elsewhere throughout the set, Berman uses expressive devices, including preceding his right hand with his left, that were frowned upon during his time.Discs 2-4 - Liszt Years of Pilgrimage: From the delicate tone-painting of the Bells of Geneva to the thundering octaves of Orage, Berman’s performances balance the poetic, picturesque, and virtuosic elements of this masterful triptych in a way I’ve never heard from any other pianist.  There are certain individual items where I prefer other renditions (Horowitz in By the Source and Petrarch Sonnet 104; Arrau in The Fountains of the Villa d'Este; Bognár in the Dante Sonata), but Berman’s remains my “go-to” set of the complete cycle.Disc 5 - Liszt Concertos: Berman and Guilini appear to be striving for a measured, rather than thrill ride, approach to these warhorses.  The benefit of this approach is that it highlights the structural ingenuity with which Liszt (drawing on Schubert’s approach to the Wander Fantasy) composed the First Concerto.  But with every benefit there’s a drawback, which in this case means performances lacking the sense of “oomph” brought by Richter and Hough.  Berman’s treatment of the sustained trills which lead to the entry of the triangle part (for once, not spot-miked) is especially musical.  Guilini draws fine playing from the Vienna Symphony.Disc 6 - Prokofiev: Many pianists have an unfortunate tendency to bang Prokofiev, but Berman’s performance of the Romeo & Juliet suite is notable for its crisp pedaling, dry humor, and restrained emotional pathos.  Berman never forgets that the suite derives from a ballet score, and many of the faster pieces move with a bouncing rhythm.  There is a pronounced lack of adrenaline in Berman’s rendition of the Second Sonata, with the outer movements both lacking in tempo and propulsion, and no sense of conclusion at the end of the work.  Graffman’s recording remains my preference.Disc 7: Prokofiev’s 8th Sonata is not a pyrotechnical work like the 6th and 7th Sonatas.  Berman focuses on structural cohesion, and delivers a straightforward reading with a sense of dramatic through-line.  At the time Berman recorded the Rachmaninoff works in this collection, the composer’s reputation was at low-ebb – particularly in the Soviet Union, where he was equated with Gershwin.  Berman refuses to sentimentalize Rachmaninoff’s Moments Musicale, with the central march section of the B minor played in a very deliberate fashion.  Instead, Berman focuses on balancing of primary and secondary lines and structural cohesion.Disc 8- Rachmaninoff: In my opinion, Rachmaninoff’s Corelli Variations is one of the composer’s crowning achievements for solo piano.  Berman’s approach is to allow the variations to unfold at a natural pace, highlighting the work’s architectural strength (an area where critics and musicologists have taken the composer to task)  without indulging in virtuosity for its own sake.  But I am missing the rhythmic snap of Watts and the almost lurid tone painting of Pletnev, and don’t plan to turn to this recording often.  The same is true of a selection of Preludes: clear presentations of the text; but lacking in spontaneity, color, and a sense of line.Disc 9: There is little sense of the picturesque in Berman’s rendition of Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition, nor is there much contrast between the contemplative and extroverted sections. Truth be told, I’ve heard few performances of the original piano version that hold my interest, and Berman’s is no exception. If you want to hear the original version, it’s still best to go with Richter’s “go for broke” live recording from Sofia – despite the dim sonics and tubercular audience.  There are also several recordings of Horowitz’s skillful arrangement which make for excellent listening and are my preference.  Berman’s performance of a selection of Shostakovich’s Preludes is blessedly non-bombastic, yet characterizes the mood of each piece, from humor to tumult, most effectively.Disc 10: The Tchaikovsky Concerto with Herbert von Karajan plods along limply - a far cry from what one would expect from Berman, who recorded a sizzling Rachmaninoff Third with Abbado.The recordings were all made between 1975-1980.  No documentation is provided regarding remastering, but the sound is fine.  If there’s a complaint about this set, it’s the presentation.  The original cover art has been discarded in favor of the same plain graphics on the box.  Given that the CDs duplicate the contents (and short playing times) of the LPs, I cannot fathom why this was done.  Thus, the liner notes are gone, replaced with an essay that has less to do with the recordings or Berman’s playing in general than with his emigration to Italy after the Soviet Union collapsed.  I hope Sony will also issue a box of their CBS and RCA Berman recordings (including the Melodyas they distributed).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R162T8OQ78SQWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRK0BZ8#wasThisHelpful","R162T8OQ78SQWP","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It has been one hundred years since that riotous night in Paris when Stravinsky's ballet, Le Sacre du Printemps was premiered.  Today it is a repertoire staple, and far better known as a concert piece than as a ballet.  This ten CD set includes ten recordings of the work, each with its' own point of view.Stokowski's 1929-1930 recording is typical of what one would expect from the conductor during this period.  He alters some of the brass writing so that Stravinsky's repeated notes are turned into tremolos.  There is quite a bit of rhythmic flexibility - some of Stokowski's extreme tempo changes are similar to what he did for the Fantasia soundtrack - although at least he conducts the piece in sequence.  This version is very well recorded for the time.Stravinsky recorded Le Sacre three times - the two later recordings, from 1940 and 1960, are included here.  The composer's approach is the antithesis of Stokowski's voluptuousness.  Tempos are straight, and textural transparency is favored over tone painting.  Neither version is perfect technically - in the earlier recording, the orchestra has some difficulty playing together during the Sacrificial Dance; in the later recording, the woodwinds suffer from a whiny, nasal tone.  Both recordings are rather drily recorded, with audible tape splices in the stereo version.Pierre Monteux led the premiere of Le Sacre in 1913.  This 1951 recording, with the Boston Symphony, has long been considered a classic - but I beg to differ.  It may have been great in its' day, but that day has passed.  It was Monteux who persuaded Stravinsky to reduce the tempo marking on the final dance to make the piece easier to play, and there is a sense of caution in some of the more extroverted material.  Further there is some seriously out of tune playing by the brass - particularly in the higher notes (this was a recurring problem with the BSO at the time).Many consider Eugene Ormandy to be something of a ""hack"" outside the Romantic repertoire, but his Sacre is peppered with brisk tempos (perhaps too brisk - this is the fastest Sacre I've ever heard), bracing rhythms - and the Philadelphians' playing is spectacular.  Under Ormandy's hands, one never forgets that Sacre started as a ballet score.  This is the most persuasive of the four mono recordings in this set.Ozawa's interpretation with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra is middle-ground - if there can be such a thing with Le Sacre.  Metrically, this version is very ""straight"", balances are clear and - as is common with many Chicago recordings since the Reiner era - the brass and winds are quite prominent, which allows the listener to clearly hear parts that are sometimes obscured by the strings.  I've never heard the percussion parts struck with such clarity.  The overriding feeling is one of ""control"", which has its merits but prevents this recording from achieving the ultimate in excitement.  This disc also includes Stravinsky's Fireworks.Of the recordings in this set, the 1969 recording with the Cleveland Orchestra under Boulez is my favorite - striking an excellent balance between savagery, structure and textural clarity.  The pacing is well-nigh perfect.  But I'm a Clevelander and grew up with this recording so I may be a bit partial.  I find the Boulez/Cleveland recording from the 1990s (not included here) far less persuasive.Bernstein recorded Sacre at least three times - the first recording eliciting an excited ""WOW!"" from the composer.  This is the second recording, from 1972.  The interpretation is a good deal more straightforward than the earlier set, with less inflection at climactic moments, and greater variety of lower-level dynamics - but there is a notable falloff in energy in the Evocation of the Ancestors before things pick up during the Sacrificial Dance.  The big snag here is the unnatural sound, which remastering has only partially addressed.  Primarily, this can be attributed to multi or ""spot"" miking, with sections fading in and out as if the recording engineer was constantly riding gain - it's especially noticeable when wearing headphones.Salonen begins The Adoration of the Earth rather languidly, moving to an unusually brisk Augurs of Spring - from whence there's no letting up.  Throughout this performance of Sacre the ""faster"" dances here are played very quickly.  As a whole, the performance is not on a large scale, dynamically - this is the most chamber music-like Sacre I've ever heard.  The Philharmonia's playing is dazzlingly precise.  (The Symphony in Three Movements is similarly taut and propulsive.)Michael Tilson Thomas' recording with the San Francisco Symphony bestrides an interpretive middle ground - tempos are at the norm and there is little inflection, except for the climaxes of Spring Rounds - where ritardandi have become somewhat common.  The recorded sound is spectacular which will make this a go-to recording for many.  The couplings that originally appeared when the disc was issued in 1999, Fireworks and Persephone, have been deleted - an unexplained and disappointing decision.There are many fine Sacres that are not part of this set.  A particular favorite of mine is Benjamin Zander's recording with the Boston Philharmonic, which is coupled with a piano roll that was supervised by Stravinsky himself.If you have a magnifying glass (or really good vision) you can decipher the liner notes from the recordings.  Stravinsky's essay that accompanied his own 1960 recording is included in the booklet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R274IA34A55SY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BXQ3KXY#wasThisHelpful","R274IA34A55SY6","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once upon a time, when I was newly acquainted with Emil Gilels' playing, I asked a pianist friend for his opinion.  He referred to Gilels as a wonderful, ""life-affirming"" pianist.  At that time, I had only heard a few off-label live issues that didn't show Gilels at his best, and my response was ""In that case, I prefer `death-affirming' pianists"".  But the recordings in this 4 CD set show Gilels in mostly splendid form.There are two recordings of the Tchaikovsky First Concerto in this set, and they make for fascinating comparison.  The Tchaikovsky with Reiner and the Chicago Symphony strikes a nice balance between the ardent, poetic, and virtuosic elements of the work.  Much the same can be said of the Brahms Second here. Gilels' rather plush, deep into the keys sonority is a nice contrast to Reiner's whip-crack accompaniment. But the conductor allows individual players time to shine, as in the cello solos during the slow movements of both the Tchaikovsky and Brahms.  One odd thing about the early Tchaikovsky: the orchestra/piano perspective seems to change whenever the orchestra comes in for a big tutti, as if the volume levels are constantly being adjusted. For all that, the sound on the old analogue recording is far superior to the digital version with the New York Philharmonic under Mehta.  Here, the strings have a glassy edge and the orchestra is poorly mixed.  Gilels' contribution is fine, but some poor intonation from the winds and substandard sound quality disqualify this recording from being a favored choice.The Brahms Second Concerto is presented in a more extroverted performance that one usually hears. Both Gilels and Reiner are ""on the same page"" with brisk tempos and tight phrasing in the first two movements, welcome relaxation and flexibility in the Andante, and a breezy finale.  The sound problem in the Tchaikovsky is not present here.Chopin's First Concerto is presented with a nice sense of pacing and flexibility, with a slow movement as intimate and hushed as any I've heard, and a discreet bounce in the finale. Ormandy and the Philadelphians provide a sympathetic accompaniment.Schubert's Sonata D. 850 is not exactly a repertoire favorite.  I've only heard three other recordings, by Kempff, Curzon, and Brendel.  Gilels easily outclasses all three technically (Schubert's piano writing is surprisingly clumsy and difficult) but there are questionable interpretive decisions.  The opening movement is unusually brisk and fluid; while the slow movement is more expansive than usual - Gilels' tempo would have rendered the movement incomprehensible on Schubert's piano, with its lack of sustaining power; the third movement is presented as a true Scherzo, but Gilels puts the brakes on for the Trio - throwing the structure off kilter; Gilels is back on form for the Rondo.  But the overall effect is like looking at an object in a funhouse mirror - the relative weight of each movement is distorted.There are three basic approaches to Liszt's mighty sonata: Demonic, Narrative, and Structural.  The best performances balance those three approaches.  In many ways, Gilels recording reminds me of Arthur Rubinstein's, except that Gilels has a greater range of lower-level dynamics and better overall technical control.  Overall, this is a very ""straight"" performance, the Sonata played as a SONATA - without programmatic implications.  It does not have the diabolical qualities of Horowitz's legendary 1932 recording; nor the ineffectual mooning of Watts' unfortunate 1985 version; nor, thankfully, is it study in sterile perfection, as is Pollini's recording.Both the Bach French Suite and Shostakovich are given straightforward performances, although to my ears the Shostakovich sounded like warmed over Prokofiev and I really couldn't muster enthusiasm for the work.Despite the lack of liner notes, these budget boxes seem to sell quickly.  If you're interested in hearing Gilels at his best, snap it up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRMU5CHKHYSH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CG1HRO#wasThisHelpful","RRMU5CHKHYSH0","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 14-CD set includes all of Wilhelm Kempff's concerto recordings made for Deutsche Grammophon and Decca.  There are doubtless more recordings deriving from radio broadcasts and the like.After Schnabel, Kempff, who studied with Karl Heinrich Barth, was the principal exponent of the German school of piano performance.  Like Schnabel (and unlike many later exponents of that school) Kempff had a beautiful, individual sound. While he was generally faithful to the score, he did not get caught up in details and was not a purist (he occasionally eschewed repeats and doubled bass notes). In these respects, but few others, Kempff was similar to another Barth pupil: Arthur Rubinstein.Kempff was primarily a pianist of poetry, introspection, and understanding. His technique was reliable, but he was not a virtuoso and never thundered. Kempff appeared to take Terence's dictum to heart: Moderation in all things. Thus, faster movements are never rushed, slow movements are never dragged. This works especially well in Mozart and most of Beethoven - but less so for Liszt.Kempff recorded nine Mozart concertos and the Concert Rondo, K. 382, in which the pianist skillfully kept the music on a small scale without resorting to the porcelain doll approach.  Most of the performances here are beautifully fluid and flexible, reminding me of Mozart's dictum that the music should ""flow like oil"".  However, Concertos 21 and 22, recorded in 1977, suffer from notably tired sounding rondos.  Kempff plays his own cadenzas in Concertos 8, 20, 21, 22, & 24, and Mozart's cadenzas in Concertos 9, 23, 27, and the Concerto Rondo, K. 382.  Kempff plays his own cadenza in the opening movement of Concerto 15, and his arrangement of Mozart's cadenza in the finale.Kempff recorded two complete cycles of Beethoven Concertos (although he did not record the Triple Concerto or the piano transcription of the Violin concerto), and 78rpm versions of all but the Second Concerto.  Kempff's first recording of the C major Concerto, from 1925, was the first ever made of that piece.  It was recorded using the old acoustical process and is primarily of historical interest.On balance, I prefer the middle cycle with Kempen to the later one.  Some will disqualify it since it's in mono, but the piano tone is more robust and Kempff's playing is freer and more imaginative.  Still, there are lovely moments in the stereo cycle with Leitner, especially the pacing of the slow movements of the Third and Fourth Concertos.  Kempff also plays his own cadenzas for the Beethoven Concertos (except for the Emperor concerto, where Beethoven forbade a cadenza) and his own arrangement of Beethoven's cadenza in the opening movement of Concerto 1.Kempff recorded the Brahms D minor concerto only once, in 1957.  Even under the best of conditions, this is a difficult piece to pull off: the piano writing is clumsy and not well balanced with the orchestra.  There are several issues with this performance, including poor balance within the orchestra, and weak & out of tune winds.  The high point is the slow movement, where Kempff's flowing tempo and straightforward phrasing clarify the structure. But this is undone by a finale lacking in energy and an ending buried in a haze of pseudo-reverence.  He's no match for Rubinstein/Reiner or Fleisher.Kempff recorded Schumann's Concerto twice.  The earlier version, from 1953, features an ardent opening movement, followed by a mellow middle movement and beautifully balanced passage work in the finale.  The later version, from 1973, is permeated by a sense of caution throughout the outer movements, while the middle movement has a lovely, simple poetry.  While Kempff's conception is beautiful in its' way, one gets the impression he's husbanding his strength - a common issue with Kempff's post-1970 recordings.Apart from the composer's later, impressionistic works, Kempff was not temperamentally suited to Liszt's music.  Both the Liszt concertos are lethargically paced, flabbily phrased, and lacking in rhythmic verve.  Also, there is a slight but distracting pitch change at 3:16 in the opening movement of the A major Concerto.  Better to go with Richter or Hough in these works.The recordings in this collection date from 1925-1977, so there's quite a variance in the recording quality.  The 1925 acoustic recording sounds like it was made with a toy orchestra.  But for the most part the sound is clear and natural, even in the 78rpm and mono recordings.  The stereo Beethoven Concertos sound far better than they did on the Galleria CD issues from the 1980s.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4Y75XVL9E9XO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANDVNAU#wasThisHelpful","R4Y75XVL9E9XO","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Byron Janis was one of several American pianists whose performing careers were curtailed: he, Gary Graffman, and Leon Fleisher all suffered from hand ailments.  The greatest of all, William Kapell, died in a plane crash in 1953.  This 11 CD set covers Janis' recordings for RCA from 1947 until 1959.At age 16, Janis performed in a concert with the Pittsburgh Symphony conducted by Lorin Maazel - then aged 14.  Vladimir Horowitz was in the audience and immediately invited Janis to study with him - their studies lasted four years.  It's easy to understand why Horowitz took a shine to the young Janis.  The nervous energy that informed much of the younger Horowitz's playing is evident in Janis' early work.  (For decades, there were rumors to the effect that Horowitz's interest in Janis was more physical than musical, and that the two pianists were lovers.  But as Janis revealed in his autobiography, he actually engaged in a brief yet intense affair with Horowitz's wife, Wanda.  When Horowitz learned of the affair, Janis' studies with him were terminated - although they reconciled several years later.)To his credit, Horowitz never tried to impose his sound on Janis, and he encouraged the younger pianist to seek out his own style and ""make your own mistakes"".  Nevertheless, Horowitz's shadow hangs over several of the recordings in this collection, most notably Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, where Janis makes a number of textual emendations similar to those made by Horowitz.  That may be the reason the recording sat unreleased in the vault until now - I can think of no other, as it's an outstanding performance in excellent sound (it is the only stereophonic solo recording in the set).  Janis has never been known as a Beethoven specialist, but the Tempest, Waldstein, and Op. 109 Sonatas are straightforward and stylish.  Janis makes a convincing case for playing the glissandi in the Waldstein's last movement as prestissimo octaves - at least for him as I doubt many other pianists could pull it off.  Janis masterfully holds the structure of Chopin's B-flat minor Sonata together - which is not easy even for old masters.  There are a number of bon-bons in this set, including Schulz-Evler's arrangement of the Blue Danube Waltz.  Janis makes these works seem more than encores, but miniature masterpieces - which is what they are.Janis had an excellent working relationship with Fritz Reiner - who was not an easy collaborator.  All but one of the concerto recordings in this set feature Reiner at the podium.  Their recording of Schumann's Piano Concerto was inexplicably held back from release until 1983.  The performance is ardent, poetic, virtuosic, and belies the comment that the work is a ""ladies concerto"".  Janis is one of the few pianists to record Richard Strauss' Burleske for piano and orchestra.  One wonders if he learned the piece, which is neither pianistic nor particularly interesting, at the behest of Fritz Reiner - who was recording loads of Strauss.  Janis is light years ahead of Rudolf Serkin technically, the Chicago Symphony under Reiner wound tight as a drum.  Likewise for Liszt's Totentanz.  Janis' recording of Rachmaninoff's First Concerto remains, along with Zimerman's and the composer's own, my go-to recording of the piece.  The solo passages in the outer movements crackle with electricity, with Reiner drawing sparks from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, while the middle movement has an aristocratic, non-mushy poetry worthy of the composer himself.  Janis' recording of Rachmaninoff's Third Concerto (accompanied by the Boston Symphony under Munch), was bound to invite comparison to Horowitz, yet Janis more than holds his own - and this version is sonically far superior to any of Horowitz's recordings.  This is a ""dry-ice"" version of the Rachmaninoff Third, which burns while coolly holding something back in reserve.  Only several cuts, which were customary at the time, prevent this from being a first choice - at least for me.When Van Cliburn's career skyrocketed after the 1958 Tchaikovsky Competition, RCA shunted Janis aside in favor of Cliburn.  Making lemonade out of lemons, Janis signed with Mercury Living Presence and rerecorded much of the repertoire heard here, along with numerous other works.  Generally, those recordings are even more noteworthy than these.As is common with Sony's Original Album issues, the original front and back covers are included.  The sequencing is also replicated - which means short playing times.  (It also means a disparity with the Rachmaninoff 1st/Strauss Burleske album, which is listed as ""LM"" indicating mono, but is in fact in stereo.)  A caveat: For reasons unexplained, Sony has not included Chopin's Nocturne, Op. 27, No. 2, which was included on one of the LPs.  The sound varies considerably, which is understandable given the advance in recording technology from 78RPM discs to stereo tape.  The Mussorgsky, Rachmaninoff Third, Liszt Totentanz, and Schumann Concerto sound the best, while the Rachmaninoff First and Strauss Burleske suffer from harsh fortes and a papery piano tone.  A booklet includes details on each album and an appreciation written by Richard Dyer.  Also included is a DVD documentary.  The price point is significantly higher for this box than for similar sets, doubtless because many recordings are being issued on CD for the first time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GEYNBPQCV5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AK3X3DI#wasThisHelpful","R1GEYNBPQCV5Y","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many books about the Roosevelt era focus on either the first 100 days or the last 100 days of his administration.  Perhaps because the period between the start of World War II in September 1939 and America's entry into the war in December 1941 was marked by fog like confusion and contradictory public opinion, most accounts of the pre-war period in America haven't sorted out exactly who said what - on and off the record - and what the machinations and their motivations were.  With the dearth of credible information, rumors poured over the decades.  I vividly recall the day my 8th grade history teacher told our class, with great fervor, that Franklin Roosevelt ""knew all along about Pearl Harbor - he wanted us in that war"".  (Of course, that same teacher regularly dropped questionable bombshells, such as the whopper that Hitler was a monotesticular homosexual. After a while I stopped accepting her comments at face value.)  Lynne Olson's ""Those Angry Days: Roosevelt, Lindbergh, and America's Fight Over World War II, 1939-1941"" goes a long way toward clarifying the era and its protagonists.Far from the revisionist portrait painted by my 8th grade history teacher - which has become accepted in some circles - FDR is not painted here as a Machiavellian schemer determined to engage America in World War II.  Instead, he's portrayed as timidly tiptoeing with public opinion - sometimes behind it.  FDR once said ""It's a terrible thing to try and lead people, only to look over your shoulder and find no one following"".  But the evidence presented in Those Angry Days paints Roosevelt as a [Bill] Clintonian figure: bound by polling data and reluctant to take a stand on any controversial issue which may cost him votes.  A rare moment of political courage comes a few weeks before the 1940 election, when FDR approves and presides over America's first peacetime draft.  But once the election is over, FDR pulls back - unwilling to do much beyond sending Britain some outdated war materiel and talk tough against Hitler.The portrait of Charles Lindbergh is even less flattering.  The pilot emerges as an Asbergerian figure: supremely knowledgeable about everything related to aviation, enamored of silly notions about Eugenics, anti-Semitic without acknowledging it, and clueless about much of the real world - political and non.  Used by America First, Lindbergh ignores his wife's advice to tone down his rhetoric - damaging his reputation to the extent that decades later, his daughter was shunned by classmates.  Lindbergh's moral blindness is such that he cannot differentiate between a few American soldiers desecrating a Japanese corpse and the monstrous evil of the Holocaust.  In a lengthy epilogue, the author recounts Lindberg's bizarre last decades: a distant yet controlling husband, fathering seven children with three mistresses, and surreptitiously visiting the Smithsonian to gaze at the Spirit of Saint Louis.  But even here, Lindbergh is not a villain, but rather a self-deluded lost soul.If there are any villains in this book, they are the supporting players: Senator Burton K. Wheeler and General Harry ""Hap"" Arnold, who conspired to leak classified information to the Chicago Tribune's Chesly Manly; and Tribune publisher Robert McCormack - whose decision to publish Manly's trumped up article on ""FDR's War Plans"" (in reality a ""just in case"" scenario of the type governments often create) was an egregious breach of national security.It's Wendell Willkie, FDR's opponent in the 1940 election, who emerges as the true hero.  By quelling the isolationists in his own party, Willkie essentially ended isolation vs. intervention as a campaign issue in the 1940 election.  By doing so, he may well have swung the election to Roosevelt.  Although he declined to serve in FDR's administration, he became a roving ambassador, championing both Britain and internationalism.  Ironically, Willkie died in October 1944 - several months before Roosevelt.  Willkie's running mate, Charles McNary, died in February 1944.  As there was no mechanism for appointing a new Vice President (as was done with Gerald Ford), under the old method of succession, Willkie's Secretary of State would have become President.  One can only guess who that might have been.Roosevelt held Willkie in high esteem.  Upon Willkie's death, FDR referred to Willkie's ""tremendous courage - his dominating trait"" and chastised an aide who spoke negatively about Willkie: ""Don't ever say anything like that around here again.  Don't even think it.  You of all people ought to know that we might not have had Lend-Lease or Selective Service or a lot of other things if it hadn't been for Wendell Willkie.  He was a godsend to this country when we needed him most.""The isolationist movement in the 1940s was a diverse group: parents who were fearful of their childrens' futures; disillusioned World War I veterans; members of the America First committee - who were themselves touched by various individuals who were either anti-Semitic, anti-British, anti-Roosevelt, or all of the above.  Reading Olson's book, I realized the spiritual children of the isolationists range from Pat Buchanan (who continues to write that Hitler was never a threat to the United States) to Green Party members who have told me that America should have ""turned the other cheek"" in response to the 9/11 attacks.  Today's anger may be heard in different issues, witness the ridiculous Obama is a Communist/Fascist Muslim and/or Kenyan meme.  But it has the same roots in the provincial, the bigoted, the fearful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M6NBGSVZNQ6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400069742#wasThisHelpful","R3M6NBGSVZNQ6E","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vladimir Ashkenazy burst onto the musical scene when he tied John Ogden for gold medal at the 1962 International Tchaikovsky Competition.  The very different paths their careers and lives took would make an interesting case study.  Decca immediately signed Ashkenazy to a recording contract, and he has remained mostly faithful to that label.  Over the years, Ashkenazy became something of a one man industry, recording huge swaths of the piano repertoire which would have made even Rubinstein and Arrau shudder.  To the best of my knowledge, Ashkenazy is the most recorded Classical pianist in history - at least in terms of authorized recordings.Ashkenazy became the par exemplar of piano performance style in the latter half of the 20th Century: his technique was fully up to every challenge; his tone was beautiful without being particularly unique; his repertoire was exceptionally broad; his interpretations tended toward the norm.  Ashkenazy seldom deviated from the composer's text (the only exception that comes to mind in this set occurs just before the coda of Chopin's 4th Ballade where he pedals through the rest - and he's not the only pianist to do this).  Although Ashkenazy was born and raised in the Soviet Union, his playing was representative of neither the Russian nor the Soviet schools (and they are different); instead, Ashkenazy was and remains highly cosmopolitan - despite the prevalence of Russian composers in his repertoire.There is a fine line between a normal interpretation and a generic one.  Ashkenazy's approach means one is guaranteed of a capable, faithful rendition of the composer's score.  But the uniqueness that one sometimes seeks - which often marks the difference between having a recording to do one's dusting by, and having one's ears pinned to the wall - is largely missing here.  Some people prefer it that way.  But for me, few of the recordings on this set could warrant a first recommendation - but often a second one, which is pretty impressive given the multitude of recordings of these works.In recent decades, Ashkenazy has scaled back his activities as pianist and become more active as a conductor.  It may be sacrilege, but I prefer Ashkenazy as conductor to Ashkenazy as pianist. Highlights of these include Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony; Ashkenazy's own orchestration of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition; Prokofiev's Cinderella; and Rachmaninoff's Symphonies 1 & 3, Symphonic Dances, and The Bells.  I've long held Ashkenazy's Rachmaninoff set in high esteem.  Ashkenazy's respect for Rachmaninoff - never poisoned by the Soviets, who equated the exile with Gershwin - shines through in every bar.  The performances are richly emotional without dwelling in treacly goo.  On the other hand, Beethoven's Symphonies 5 & 7 are given rather anemic and uninteresting readings - particularly the finale of the 7th which lacks the dancing energy required.Given the different recording locales and evolving technology, the recorded sound varies considerably.  For the most part, it's never less than acceptable.  One exception is a disc of two-piano music with Malcolm Frager, where the instruments are unnaturally separated as if they'd been recorded in different rooms.  The piano sound is still slightly ""tubby"" - a consistent issue with Decca recordings - but less so than in earlier issues.  It is not representative of the sound I heard from Ashkenazy when he played in Boston around 1990.As is becoming commonplace with these big issues, the original front covers have been reproduced.  However, additional tracks have been added and the back covers reflect that.  The original liner notes are not included, but there is an essay by one of Ashkenazy's record producers.Ashkenazy's omnivorousness makes a complete reissue of his recordings a daunting prospect, and these 50CDs only skim the surface.  But what a surface it is!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WE1ZT4EH5FKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AMUONT2#wasThisHelpful","R1WE1ZT4EH5FKN","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Franklin Delano Roosevelt has been portrayed by many actors in productions of many kinds. Ralph Bellamy (on stage, in film, and on television), Edward Herrmann (on television and in a Hollywood musical), Ralph Vaughn, Jon Voight, David Ogden Stiers, and Kenneth Branagh have each brought their own skills to bear in interpreting this complex man - a figure at once tangible and elusive.Of course, many films have dealt with historical figures and or situations. Some have used historical events as backgrounds for a fictional story, usually Romantic - such as Titanic and Pearl Harbor. In those cases, real-life figures are relegated to supporting roles. Others have placed the historical figure dead center in the production - dead usually being the operative word. Too often, historical biographies are like animated wax museums: the Important Events in a lifetime are recreated in the span of a few hours with little insight given into the person's character, into what drove these flesh and blood people. The miniseries on John Adams is the finest example I've seen - the seven hour running time gave the writers and producers adequate time to flesh out the characters.Sadly such is not the case with Hyde Park on Hudson, which is neither a biographical film nor a historical melodrama. HPoH isn't merely the weakest film I've ever seen on FDR, it's the worst film on a U. S. President I've ever seen, period. How bad is HPoH? Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter, and FDR American Badass - neither of which was intended to be taken seriously - are masterpieces by comparison.Whether a play, TV show, or film: if it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage. With a strong script, nearly any production's flaws can be overlooked. When the script is weak, ""all the kings horses and all the kings men..."" - and the screenplay for HPoH is God-awful. It makes no attempt at a dramatic through-line, with no sense of a beginning or ending, nor character development. Indeed, the characters are two-dimensional and, frankly, uninteresting. Then there are the ""liberties"" taken with history.There is so much outright falsehood that it's hard to know where to begin. But let's start at a central plot element, the film's portrayal of FDR's ""affair"" with distant cousin Margaret ""Daisy"" Suckley. A typical scene has FDR driving Daisy in his manually controlled Ford, waving off the Secret Service, and then parking with Daisy in a field - whereupon she provides her own ""manual"" service to the President.FDR was no plaster saint, he had a multitude of character defects: devious, manipulative, and ruthless. FDR was also an unfaithful husband. He had an affair with Lucy Mercer and more than likely with Marguerite ""Missy"" LeHand. Both Lucy and Daisy were with FDR in Warm Springs when was stricken by a fatal stroke - Missy had died the previous year. (The idea that Lucy and Daisy both had affairs with FDR and then spent time together as if they were aging sorority sisters boggles the mind.) HPoH's portrayal of Daisy's relationship with FDR as anything more than a friendship between a magnetic, complicated man and his spinster, sixth cousin is not only fanciful, it's defamatory. HPoH bears no resemblance to Daisy's diaries of their time together, which were published after her death in 1991. If there was any special aspect to FDR's relationship with Daisy, it's that he revealed more of himself emotionally than he did with the rest of his circle - it was to Daisy alone than he confided what a burden the Presidency was becoming to him, how much he wanted to retire, and his worries about his health. His trust in Daisy was such that two of the very rare photographs of FDR in a wheelchair were taken by her. There were dozens of women, and not a few men, whose lives revolved around doting on FDR. There was a certain effervescence about him that made people want to spend time with him. Indeed, Winston Churchill wrote that meeting FDR was ""like opening your first bottle of champagne"". Adoration does not necessarily equal sexual conjugation.I would also add that Daisy was nowhere near as attractive as Laura Linney, an actress I have to feel sorry for after seeing HPoH. I've followed Linney's career with interest since she first appeared as Mary Ann Singleton in Tales of the City back in 1993. More recently, she did a compelling star turn as Abigail Adams. But here she has little to do but hide behind a veil of demure coyness. If Linney's agent recommended this movie for her, he should be fired.Bill Murray neither looks nor sounds like FDR. Worse, he makes little effort to look or sound like him, from the way he wears his pince-nez, to the angle of his cigarette holder, to the timbre and accent of his voice.  Nor is Murray able to recreate the halting walk FDR taught himself after becoming paralyzed in 1921. (The only actor I've seen recreate FDR's walk convincingly is Edward Herrmann.) The man whose crippled legs were masked by the determination and iron will that allowed him to guide America through the Great Depression and World War II is nowhere to be seen here. As portrayed by Murray, FDR is merely a cocktail swilling, dilettante and bon-vivant who happens to be President of the United States - when he's not too busy soliciting ""favors"" from the women in his life. I have to wonder whether Murray has read even one of the many biographies about FDR before taking this role.Olivia Williams is entirely miscast as Eleanor Roosevelt. Nothing of the real vitality that attracted Franklin to her is here (shortly before his death, FDR told his son that even after 40 years of marriage, Eleanor was still ""the most fascinating woman"" he'd ever met), only hints that she sought companionship from other women. Nor is the passion for social justice that fueled Eleanor from her adolescence until her death. Here, she's merely an irritatable quasi new-age ditz.Not everything about HPoH is completely terrible.  Samuel West and Olivia Colman turn in excellent, perfectly timed, performances as England's King and Queen. Elizabeth Wilson is fine as FDR's mother, although why she uses a slightly foreign accent when the real Sara Delano Roosevelt was born in New York is puzzling to me.  The propmaster does an excellent job recreating the look of 1939.But HPoH suffers from a split personality: for the most part, it's a comedic culture clash about the British Royals' visit to America; then it becomes a clumsy, angsty drama about a philandering President's multiple affairs.  The latter plotline could have been entirely dropped and the film would have been much stronger.The exterior of Springwood looks nothing like the real thing (I've been there). I can certainly understand why the Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park would decline to allow this tripe to be filmed on location, but couldn't the filmmakers have created a CGI version?In short, Hyde Park on Hudson is not historically accurate. Worse to some, it's not entertaining - not even as a low-sex comedy, as it's too slow moving. The writer, the producers, and Murray himself should be embarrassed they ever committed to this project.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39CLD9AXHQCWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B4ZN3XQ#wasThisHelpful","R39CLD9AXHQCWC","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The material here combines RCA's Kapell Edition issued in 1998, and Kapell ReDiscovered from 2008.  If you already have those, there's no reason to get these as there has been no further improvement in the sound and this budget set lacks liner notes.  Otherwise, read on...Leon Fleisher: ""Willy was beyond a doubt the greatest pianistic talent this country [United States] has ever produced"".No small compliment coming from another great pianist. America has seen its share of pianistic careers cut short for varying reasons: whether due to burnout (Van Cliburn), hand injuries (Fleischer, Gary Graffman), or other ailments (Byron Janis). Even Murray Perahia, arguably the best American pianist active today, has battled stress related hand problems over the last 15 years. No piano career ended more tragically than William Kapell's, who died in a plane crash in 1953.It is a tribute to Kapell that, although he died at the age of 31, he was already a mature artist. One does not have a sense of unfulfilled potential, ala James Dean, for there is fulfillment in plenty on each of the eleven discs in this boxed set. I know of no other pianist who gave so many first rank performances in such a short time. But the sense of tragedy, of what might have been if Kapell had not perished in a plane crash in 1953, hovers over this set.The Chopin Sonata in B Minor, Op. 58 is easily the best this listener has ever heard, either on record or in concert. The same can be said for the twenty-odd Mazurkas, which carefully balance the dance elements of these small jewels with their tone poem qualities.  It's a pity Kapell never lived to complete the set.Both the Rachmaninoff Second and Third Concertos and the Paganini Rhapsody eclipse nearly all other recordings, even those of the composer - who certainly knew how to play the piano.  Kapell's pianism had several commonalities with Rachmaninoff's - aristocratic yet restless.  Also like the composer, Kapell unfortunately employs the cuts in the Third Concerto that were common at the time. Kapell's sparse pedaling and sec touch prevents these works from falling into the sentimental mush one too often hears.  Two other Russian concertos, by Khachaturian and Prokofiev, were early staples of Kapell's repertoire, and the performances are again a perfect balance of poetry and fury, which is exactly what this music requires.A recording of Kapell in recital from March of 1953 (including another indispensable performance: the Copland Sonata) reveals that Kapell's extraordinary technique and musicianship are not the result of recording engineers and tape splicing - this is the real thing.Much has been written about the ""new"" Kapell that emerged in the last two years of his life, one less focused on keyboard pyrotechnics and gravitating toward the traditional German masters and a more contemplative style. Kapell's performance of the Bach Suite points toward the future in that his approach has similarities to Glenn Gould's, minus the Canadian pianist's insufferable vocalizing. The Mozart Sonata is played with clarity, tasteful phrasing, and a discreet rhythmic snap. It is poles apart from the Rococo, porcelain doll approach which was already falling out of favor.It's neither inaccurate nor demeaning of Kapell to note that the pianist was somewhat under the spell of Vladimir Horowitz. Nearly every American pianist of the time was. (Kapell wanted to study with Horowitz, but the elder pianist demured, stating there was nothing he could teach Kapell.) Both the Prokofiev Seventh Sonata and Chopin B minor Scherzo have Horowitzian touches, including interlocking octaves at the end of the Scherzo.Whatever his similarities with Horowitz, Kapell was his own man in Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. The pianist plays the work, which was seldom performed as a piano piece at the time, pretty much as written. His performance is easily on par with Richter's famed Sofia account.Also welcome is a disc including alternate takes and a twenty minute interview with Kapell, which reveals a profundity and maturity, both as human being and musician, far beyond his years.The sound varies considerably, which is understandable given the various sources and locales.  The RCA recordings sound remarkably clean - if a bit harsh - with clear highs and no sense of excessive filtering. The items from Kapell's Australian tour were recorded off the air by an amateur using a home disc cutting machine.  There is a great deal of static, clicks, and pops, as well as what sounds like cross talk with another radio station (audible during quieter pieces). Signal to noise ratio is poor, and a few moments have had to be patched from other Kapell recordings. Kapell fans will not be fazed by this, but audiophiles may find their enjoyment of these remarkable performances impaired.This set is an absolute must for piano fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZR2YEA4HPYDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AK3X32O#wasThisHelpful","R2ZR2YEA4HPYDS","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Complete Album Collection contains the complete recordings than Van Cliburn made as pianist for RCA, plus a documentary on DVD.  It does not include his sole recording made as a conductor (issued in 1965 on a limited edition LP), nor recordings that have turned up on other labels.By the time I became aware of Van Cliburn he had already retired, and my co-workers at the Classical record store where I was employed dismissed him as a ""burn out"".  It wasn't until some of his recordings were issued on SACD hybrid discs that I began to listen to his recordings.Despite Cliburn's All-American, apple pie loving boy from Texas image, his musical training was solidly in the Russian School.  It's not for nothing that his teacher was Rosina Lhévinne, doyenne of Russian piano teachers.Listening anew to these recordings, it's also easy to see why he won the Tchaikovsky Competition in 1958.  Cliburn had technique to burn, but never felt the need to get into a speed race - even when he played such warhorses as Rachmaninoff's Third Concerto.  Yet it's Cliburn's recording of that concerto which brings a lump to my throat at the final statement of the third movement's ""big tune.""  Cliburn was among the most sincere of interpreters.  He didn't feel the need to drown his performances in eccentricity, yet one can instantly tell it's Cliburn performing.  His temperament ran warm, but not hot like Rubinstein's and certainly not molten like Horowitz's.  In many ways, Cliburn resembled Benno Moiseiwitsch, the master of relaxed virtuosity.  Also, Cliburn's ringing sonority reminded many of Rosina Lhévinne's husband, Josef.  (Vladimir Horowitz once remarked that he and Arthur Rubinstein together couldn't match Cliburn's tone.)Let's get one thing out of the way, Cliburn was a good musician - not a one hit wonder.  There is a misconception, mostly centered in the Germanic circles, that one has to be a great Mozart and Beethoven interpreter to be a great musician.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Much of this stems from Artur Schnabel's statement that he limited his repertoire to music that was ""better than it could be played.""  There are plenty of Romantic works that are ""better than they can be played"".  Fact is, there have been plenty of pianists who turn in fine performances of various Beethoven and Mozart works - including Cliburn for the most part.  (There are also plenty of pianists who have been lauded for their Beethoven, Mozart, and Schubert interpretations for no good reason.)  There are not many pianists who can hold together the Liszt Sonata, or make as strong a case as Cliburn does for the original 1913 version of Rachmaninoff's Second Sonata.As with any recorded legacy, there are high, middle, and low points.  The Rachmaninoff Third Concerto, a warm, lyrical performance that proves the piece is more than a pianistic warhorse, belongs in every record collection - despite a rather lackluster accompaniment from the Symphony of the Air.  Cliburn makes the best case I've heard for the heavier, chordal cadenza.  The Prokofieff Sixth Sonata and Barber Sonata rank with the best - and the Brahms Handel Variations is one of my favorite versions.  Many of the other recordings, including works by Chopin, Liszt, and the impressionists, rank as solid but seldom first choices - of course, the same thing could be said about the bulk of Vladimir Ashkenazy's copious output.  The low point for me was the opening movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, played rather loudly and lacking in atmosphere.Cliburn was wise enough to know his limitations and be selective in the music he chose to present to the public. Chronologically and stylistically, the repertoire here starts with Mozart and ends with Barber's Piano Sonata.  Cliburn didn't embrace serialism or twelve-tone because music without a ""line"" didn't speak to him.  Nor did he play much chamber music.  Instead, he concentrated on the core Romantic solo and concerto repertoire - and he played it very well.While many know-it-alls crowed over Cliburn's retirement, at least he knew when enough was enough.  That can't be said for many of the intellectual crowd's pantheon of musical heroes - including Claudio Arrau and Rudolf Serkin, great artists who should have left the stage years before they did.  Then there are those who shouldn't have begun in the first place.As with many of their recent reissues, Sony has organized this set to match the original LPs - which means short playing times - and included the original cover art.  A perceptive essay by Jed Distler is also included.  The recordings do not sound newly remastered, but Cliburn got better sound at RCA than many of his contemporaries at that label did - everything is acceptable sonically.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EZ7C0D4TWAJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009EJSUBY#wasThisHelpful","R2EZ7C0D4TWAJX","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently went on a long road trip with my dog where we were in varying situations that were new to him: long drives, hotels, staying with family - including their cats and dogs.  Added to that was the change of climate from wintry Ohio to Florida.  To say nothing of walks in Savannah, Georgia and Washington, DC.  Naturally, he faced some anxiety and had trouble sleeping at night, with unfamiliar noises.I brought Pet Naturals Calming treats along and they really did the trick.  About 20 minutes after taking these treats, he began to calm down - he was less possessive of toys, and less apt to pine for attention.  Yet he never seemed ""out of it"" and would still give and be open to receiving affection.

"This six DVD set gathers most, but not all, of Vladimir Horowitz's filmed and videotaped performances.  The timeline for these performances is brief: 1982-1987 - along with a few snippets of Horowitz playing in 1974 for an abandoned documentary.  So, we only see Horowitz in the late stages of his career.Paradoxically, the earliest of these is the weakest.  Horowitz's May 22, 1982 recital from London's Royal Festival Hall (billed as A Royal Concert), is little short of a regal disaster.  Horowitz had recently begun taking the anti-depressants that would suspend his career in 1983, and it shows.  The Scarlatti Sonatas are lacking the grace he usually brought to these gems.  Both Chopin's Polonaise-Fantasie and G minor Ballade are fragmented, incoherent, and technically sub-par - the Ballade's coda is just plain banged.  There's little sense of childhood - even a memory of childhood - in the Kinderszenen, with fussed phrasing and drawn out ritardandos that border on the bizarre.  Only in the Rachmaninoff Sonata does the playing improve - although it's nowhere near the level of his 1968 and 1980 recordings.  To make matters worse, Horowitz looks as bad as he sounds: slack jawed facial expression, overweight to the extent his coat looks about to pop open, his lower teeth discolored to the point of blackness.  Even the interview (shown at Intermission but taped weeks earlier at the pianist's New York townhouse) shows a nearly incoherent pianist rambling along with stories of his childhood and early success.  By the way, this DVD includes all three of Horowitz's encores from that day - the last had been deleted from all previous VHS and LaserDisc issues.Given Horowitz's condition in 1982 and '83, it's all the more remarkable that he returned to playing in 1985.  The Last Romantic documentary, filmed by the Maysles brothers, was conceived as a way for the pianist to ease himself into performing without the stress of a big return concert.  Horowitz looks remarkably well here: relatively trim and vigorous (and free of that ridiculous comb-over he'd worn since the 1970s).  His playing is on a higher level than in London, although there are moments of caution in Chopin's B minor Scherzo and A-flat Polonaise.  The hand held camera work is often too close and shaky (ala Blair Witch Project) and becomes a distraction at times.  Incidentally, the 15 minutes of outtakes that was released in 2003 is not included here.Horowitz's 1986 return concert in Moscow was undoubtedly the high point in his career - at least in terms of publicity.  The pianist was performing in his native land for the first time since 1925, and thanks to technology, in front of an international audience of millions.  If there was any nervousness on Horowitz's part, it's not evident on this DVD.  Who can fail to be moved when Horowitz (unseen by the audience, but visible on television) gently pats his piano as if it were a beloved companion?  The audience's reaction to Horowitz's performance, some seen openly weeping, belies the contention that he was an emotionally uncommunicative performer.  The concert is shot-through with nostalgia, a commingling of joy and melancholy - all punctuated with virtuoso thrills remarkable for a pianist of any age, let alone an octogenarian.  This version includes all three of Horowitz encores, which was not always the case.Horowitz plays Mozart is another Maysles brothers documentary - this time of a recording session for the K. 488 Concerto with Carlo Maria Giulini and the La Scala Theater Orchestra.  In the course of the session, the concerto is covered in toto, and part of the finale is redone.  The behind-the-scenes look at the work that goes into making a classical recording, from tuning the piano, ironing out disagreements between soloist and conductor, and working the press, is enlightening.  In between takes, the pianist spends time mugging for the camera, flirting with his (male) page turner, and arguing with Wanda - some of which is embarrassing to watch.  Some moments are out of context: Just before the session, Horowitz removes his jacket and hands it to his manager, commenting ""All my money is in here.""  Without reading Harold Schonberg's biography of Horowitz, none would know that the pianist's hotel room was robbed during the sessions, causing him to feel justifiably paranoid.Horowitz's May 1987 recital in Vienna's famed Musikverein was the second-to-last of his career - and the last visual document of his playing (he continued to record until 1989).  The sense of repose that marked his later playing is most in evidence here - particularly in the Andante of Mozart's K. 333 Sonata, and Schubert's G-flat Impromptu - a remarkable demonstration of Horowitz's ability to sustain a melodic line even at a slow tempo.  Schumann's Kinderszenen is remarkably simpler than the 1982 London performance, and more poetic by far.  Horowitz brings a sensual flirtatiousness to the middle section of Chopin's B minor Mazurka, while the octaves of the A-flat Polonaise are as bouncy as ever - if a bit slower.  Incidentally, there is no extra-musical program here: Horowitz simply walks on stage, performs his program, and leaves - to tumultuous applause, of course.1993's A Reminiscence will rekindle memories of all the familiar moments - the collaborations with Toscanini, the 1965 return to Carnegie Hall, the 1986 Moscow concert - but offers little that is new.  Aside from some grainy home movies and excerpts from an abandoned 1974 documentary, the footage of Horowitz duplicates the other DVDs in this set.  There are no interviews with other musicians, collaborators, or members of the Horowitz inner circle. The only figure shown, aside from Horowitz himself, is the pianist's widow, Wanda Toscanini Horowitz. She recites the usual anecdotes, prompted by an off camera Peter Gelb - Horowitz's manager during the 1980s. Hence, this doc is the ultimate inside job.  Wanda, who arguably knew Horowitz better than anybody, avoids delving into certain aspects of his non-musical life - she is even sketchy as to whether the pianist's 1953 crisis, which brought on a 12-year retirement from public performance, was a nervous breakdown, or colitis, or both. Other aspects of Horowitz's life, ranging from his homosexuality to the tragic fate of his Russian family (aside from his sister, no one in Horowitz's immediate family survived Stalin's reign), to his disastrous 1983 concerts are not mentioned at all.  There are a few moments of insight here, but one cannot escape the impression that this material was thrown together by Sony Classical for one purpose, to sell records.  Only the inclusion of a stunning performance of Scriabin's Vers la Flamme raises this doc above typical PBS fundraising fodder.  Another disappointment: the performance of Chopin's Introduction and Rondo that was included as a bonus on the VHS and LD issues in the 1990s is not included here.Now to the question on the minds of many Horowitz collectors: Does the picture quality of this set improve upon previous issues? On balance, I have to say NO - and in some cases, it looks worse. The Pioneer DVD issues of The Last Romantic and Moscow concert were head and shoulders above this issue. The Last Romantic and Mozart Concerto documentaries (which were shot on film) look very grainy and washed out - it's obvious the producers did not go back to the original film elements but used an existing tape copy. The Mocsow looks identical to the Sony DVD issue (not to be confused with the superior, Pioneer issue - which was unfortunately missing the final encore) which looks like it came from a 2nd generation videotape. The Vienna concert is curious: The picture alternates between the high quality seen on the DG DVD, and a fuzzy version seen whenever Horowitz begins a piece. I suspect this is the result of an effort to delete the blue title cards seen on the DG issue (although a German title card can be seen for Mozart's Rondo in D major).  There is a continual problem with ""interline twitter"" which is most evident during close-ups of VH's hands.  The only exception to the above is the London concert (which has been previously issued on VHS and LD, but never DVD). The picture is noticeably improved here - much better contrast and sharpness. Even the sound has been made more palatable than the clattery original.Another small nit: Whatever language I pick for the main menu, the disc defaults to German subtitles - easily correctable with a few flicks of the remote.So, on balance, this is the typical half-hearted (but full priced) job we've come to expect from Sony. The packaging, with excellent liner notes by Jed Distler, is certainly nice.  But with the poor picture quality, it amounts to lipstick on a pig.  I would not recommend this for those who already have these in other formats. For a newcomer to Horowitz,  perhaps this should be considered if the price drops.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29UZGZ0G2XKWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064GKEXC#wasThisHelpful","R29UZGZ0G2XKWE","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has become so common to see the Grieg and Schumann Concertos coupled together on CD that this Liszt - Grieg compilation comes as a surprise.  The Grieg - Schumann combo makes a certain kind of sense, in that both concertos are in A Minor, primarily lyrical, and start with an orchestral hit followed by a cadenza-like passage for piano.  But the Liszt - Grieg makes historical sense because Liszt was among the first to see this concerto before it was published, and was notably enthusiastic.Critics tend to compare pianists with legendary elders (Volodos is the new Horowitz; Brendel was the new Schnabel, etc.). Stephen Hough reminds me not so much of any pianist as of a conductor: Arturo Toscanini. No, Hough is not temperamental like the Italian Maestro. But his approach to music interpretation seems to be to discard traditional tempo changes, rubatos, and the like (which Toscanini derided as ""the last bad performance""), study the score as if it were being played for the first time, and make any interpretive decisions on that basis.Hough's rendition of the Liszt E-flat Concerto effectively melds virtuoso fireworks in the outer movements, with melting poetry in the second.  I've seldom heard those first movement octaves tossed off with such sharpness.  Too often, I've heard pianists play the second movement flatly, passing time until they can move on to the ""fun"" parts.  Not here - Hough makes it seem like we're encountering this music for the first time.  The finale is given at a steadier tempo than customary, so the structure of the piece emerges clearly - not something Liszt often gets credit for.  Those tricky repeated note passages are played to perfection, unlike Arthur Rubinstein's two recordings where they sound garbled.  A note on the orchestra's contribution: it's nice to hear the triangle solo in proper perspective: discreet - not garish as in too many recordings.In Hough's hands, the opening of A Major Concerto is epic, as if it springs directly from the Years of Pilgrimage, building to an enormous climax at movement's end.  As with the first concerto, the lyrical second movement is given its due.  For me, part of the secret of great music making is that it leads from note to note, phrase to phrase - taking the listener on an emotional journey.  That's how Hough makes sense of a concerto that is too often the excuse for shallow virtuosity - rather than the musical virtuosity Hough brings to the fore.Many have, and still do, treat the Grieg Concerto as ""cheap stuff.""  Here, the lines of the first movement emerge clearly, thanks to Hough's sparing use of the sustaining pedal.  The second movement is permeated with a sense of restrained longing, while the finale effectively melds the extroversion of the outer sections with the poetic central interlude.  Hough's playing is backed up by particularly fine orchestral playing from the Bergen Philharmonic under Andrew Litton - this is the clearest string playing I've ever heard in this piece.The sound is focused without being overly immediate, with an excellent balance between piano and orchestra.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RAJEF36TSE8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OCES4I#wasThisHelpful","R3RAJEF36TSE8Z","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems that the public's fascination with all-things Kennedy is in no danger of fading away. Between mini-series, conspiracy theories about President Kennedy's assassination, and various books, the family is still in the news - even though their political influence has waned. The latest news concerns this book written by Mimi Alford, who had an 18 month liaison with President Kennedy.I remember the reference to Mimi in Robert Dallek's superb biography of JFK. Personally, I don't think these revelations amount to much of a controversy. It's been known for decades that the marriage between John and Jacqueline Kennedy was not particularly faithful.As documented in Once Upon a Secret, the relationship between the President and Mimi Beardsley - as she was then known - was certainly not a love affair. Yet, based on Alford's recounting of several incidents between them, it became more than just a sexual liaison. Kennedy seemed genuinely interested in her life, confided to her his fears during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and wept in her presence while reading condolence letters following the death of his infant son, Patrick. It was around this time, August 1963, that JFK and Mimi stopped having sex, although they continued to see each other.  To use modern parlance, they were ""friends with benefits"" although given the disparity between their ages and job titles, it was a very unbalanced friendship.It's clear that Alford doesn't feel she was psychologically damaged by her relationship with President Kennedy. Rather, it was the need to keep it a secret that was destructive to her later in life. The demand for secrecy started with the affair itself - but the events of November 22, 1963 brought things into stark relief. When she learned of President Kennedy's assassination, Alford broke down in front of her fiancé, Tony. When Tony questioned her for being upset, Mimi confessed to the affair. She relates that Tony's reaction to the news was ""violently explosive"", and included an ultimatum that she was never to mention the affair to anyone. At that point, Mimi shut down emotionally, entering into a 26 year long marriage that was mostly unhappy.  Mimi seldom allowed herself to think about her time with JFK and sold or destroyed gifts he had given her.  By the 1980s, her marriage was crumbling around her, and she found solace in running and a brief affair with another runner.  By that time, Mimi had revealed the JFK affair to a few close friends and relatives.  After the divorce, she dated several men, but found her need for secrecy impaired her ability to communicate on many levels.  As she tried to break through these barriers, she experienced a triumph.  After a rather uncouth man suggested a second date, she bluntly replied ""Let's not"" and walked away, pumping her fist in triumph.  It was only after Dallek's book appeared, and she was revealed to be ""the Mimi"", that she met a man she could be totally honest with.Dallek has stated that he's astounded by some of the seamier information in Alford's book. Dallek's astonishment comes from the dichotomy between JFK's personal behavior and his obvious intellect - along with the measured, sober decisions he made as President. But after many years of reading history, I've come to the conclusion that there is no correlation between private morality and public leadership. George Washington married Martha for her money and his false teeth were not made of wood - they came from his slaves' mouths. Thomas Jefferson slept with his slave - who was also his wife's half-sister. No one serious has ever questioned Washington's or Jefferson's capacities as leaders. On the other hand, there have been numerous presidents who honored their marital vows, yet were disasters in office - no need to name them here.  Whatever the revelations about JFK's extra-marital hijinks, he was certainly the better alternative in 1960 than his opponent, Richard Nixon - a pathologically dishonest, secretive man who was nevertheless faithful to his wife, and who had no known sexual compulsions.This is a short but eventful book.  Alford's writing is crisp and to the point, her recollections of her liaison with JFK blunt but never lascivious.  Ultimately, the message of this book is not political or historical, it's personal: Secrets destroy the soul, and often radiate fallout far beyond the initial protagonists. That's the lesson of the JFK-Mimi story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTB0PEJ833QYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400069106#wasThisHelpful","RTB0PEJ833QYI","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans have been waiting for a long time to see Star Trek: The Next Generation on Blu-ray.  After years of rumors, CBS/Paramount has offered this teaser disc.Some background: TNG was shot on 35mm film, then converted to video tape for editing.  For this Blu-ray, the producers have gone back to the original film elements and reassembled the footage.  Most of the visual effects are newly composited from the original elements.  Some effects which originated in video (e. g, phaser shots) or were originally done in CGI have been recreated in HD.  In some ways, the reconstruction here is more difficult than for the Original Series, where everything was done on film and the effects were simply replaced.The visual improvement here is striking: colors are much more vibrant, reds do not bleed and blacks are deep.  The number of details I noticed in HD are too numerous to mention, but just a few: colored piping on the trouser legs, text on computer consoles and door labels, texture on carpet.  In the SD opening credits, I noticed a person walking in the Observation Lounge just before the Enterprise's warp out - in HD, I can detect two people, and see the uniform color.  Previously, I'd felt the TNG lighting style was flat, but in HD, I can see the subtlety of each shot.  As with the original series, the improved clarity also highlights bloopers, including a stuntman version of Data, and flaws in Brent Spiner's makeup.  Also, in HD the bridge set seems strangely spare and cavernous - I can easily see why it was beefed up with additional work stations for Generations.  The producers have not gotten carried away with digital scrubbing, and several shots have a reasonable amount of film grain.The sample episodes are well chosen here: they each come from different times in the series life, with their own distinct dramatic tone, sporting diverse looks - Sins of the Father in particular has al dark, gritty feel during the Klingon homeworld sequences.The producers were up front enough to place a disclaimer that 13 seconds of Sins of the Father is upconverted from SD due to a missing film element - one can plainly see the difference, although even here the picture quality is superior to the SD DVD.Some have criticized the producers for not converting this set to 16:9 widescreen.  Having seen an attempt to convert Gone with the Wind to widescreen that ruined the composition of that film, I want to commend the producers' decision to maintain the integrity of the original production.  TNG HD is in 4:3 as was originally filmed and intended.  If you don't like it, hit the zoom button on your remote, or don't buy the disc.The audio has been upgraded to 7.1, and sounds better than the 5.1 DVD, but not by a whole lot.  Of course, either are head and shoulders above the original 2-channel broadcast, which was compressed when aired.  Audio options also exist for Spanish, French, German, and Japanese, and subtitles are in a plethora of languages.  The extras consist of a few short trailers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CZ1OLJ2D71UQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064NLQYG#wasThisHelpful","R2CZ1OLJ2D71UQ","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The recordings of Arthur Rubinstein have been well treated on Compact Disc. Some of RCA's first CD issues of analogue recordings were devoted to Rubinstein, although the early remastering left much to be desired. (I worked at a classical record store on Cleveland's Shaker Square when a Tchaikovsky/Grieg disc was issued. The manager said it would never sell because it originated as an analogue recording - in fact all our copies sold within two days.) Most of Rubinstein's stereo recordings have received multiple CD issues, a testament to the pianist's continuing popularity with the public. The mono recordings have not had such broad distribution which has contributed to a distorted picture of the pianist's legacy. RCA's Complete Rubinstein Collection, issued as an expensive box in 1999, gathered together all of Rubinstein's recordings for RCA, HMV/EMI, and a single recording he made for Decca/London - it also contained a two CD set of interviews and previously unissued recordings. Now we have this Original Album Collection. Contained herein is everything from the 1999 box, except for the 1964 Moscow recital, which is available elsewhere on CD and DVD. This set also includes three CDs of previously unpublished live recordings (more on those later) - making for a total of over 100 hours containing a huge swath of solo, concerto, and chamber repertoire - at a fraction of the price of the 1999 box.With the exception of a 78RPM disc made for the Polish Favorit label in 1910 (never transfered to a modern format), Rubinstein refused to record during the pre-electric era - he complained the old acoustic recording process made the piano sound ""like a banjo"". So the earliest recording here was made when Rubinstein was already 41 years old. It's fascinating to trace Rubinstein's evolution as an interpreter over a 48 year period.In general, Rubinstein's earlier performances of shorter works, such as Chopin Mazurkas and Nocturnes, are freer and more imaginative than the later remakes. The younger Rubinstein also has greater control of pianissimo, which can clearly be heard even in the earliest recordings. Conversely, Rubinstein's sense of structure, particularly in larger scale works, improved with advancing years. The pianist's stereo remakes of Beethoven's Opp. 13, 31, No. 3, and 81a sonatas, Chopin's Op. 35 sonata, and the Brahms Op. 5 sonata, are head and shoulders above the earlier versions. The flip side is that, by the 1960s, Rubinstein had become conscious of his role as an ""elder-statesman"" of the piano and that he was recording ""for posterity"" - resulting in a loss of spontaneity. Also, his recordings from the mid-1960s onward are increasingly marred by the lack of a true pianissimo in his playing - possibly a result of deteriorating hearing. Many of the pianist's mid-period recordings, such as the Chopin Polonaises from 1951, marry the best of both worlds.We are doubly blessed that many of Rubinstein's best performed recordings (especially in concertos) were also made during RCA's ""Living Stereo"" era - when that company's recording engineers were putting out their best work. By the mid-1960s, RCA's engineers were experimenting with multiple-miking which marred his later concerto recordings, despite digital remasteringNow to the newly issued material: These stem from the 1961 series of ten Carnegie Hall recitals given by Rubinstein (truly ""given"", as he donated the entire proceeds to charity). Four works are new to Rubinstein's recorded repertoire: Falla's Dance of the Miller's Wife; Debussy's L'Isle Joyeuse; Scriabin's Nocturne for the Left Hand, and Stravinsky's Petrouchka. The Scriabin is proof that Rubinstein's left-hand technique was secure, despite an inconsequential wrong note at the beginning. The Falla and Debussy have an orgiastic brio that allows one to forgive the many missing details. Performances like these must have led Harold Schonberg to write that ""Rubinstein played with the great pelvic thrust"". The Stravinsky is most interesting, as it was written expressly for Rubinstein (with the pianist's assistance) and the composer gave Rubinstein carte-blanche to make any changes he felt appropriate. The most significant change is that Rubinstein reinstates the ""drum-roll"" interludes between the three scenes. The Russian Dance starts out roughly, with several wrong notes and some unsteadiness, before settling down for the scene in Petrouchka's Room. In the Shrovetide Fair scene, Rubinstein throws caution to the wind and gives a full throttle, adrenaline fused performance - overwhelming in its savagery. This is the Rubinstein that music lovers over a certain age reminisce about - one never heard in the more cautious studio recordings. The remaining works have been recorded elsewhere by Rubinstein, but when performing live, the pianist was notably more flexible, poetic, and exciting than in the studio.The set also includes two DVDs: Rubinstein Remembered, a 1987 documentary hosted by the pianist's son, John Rubinstein; and Recital for Israel - a 1975 performance at Ambassador College in Pasadena, California. There is also a CD only version of this recital, although the playing is far from Rubinstein's best and I have no doubt the pianist would be displeased by its release.This set uses the best existing transfers of each recording, which in most cases means the superb 1999 remasters by Jon Samuels. A few exceptions include SACD hybrid remasters of selected Living Stereo items. Of course, the three discs of new material are newly remastered, but the source material (monaural cassette tapes owned by John Rubinstein, and RCA tapes recorded using an AMPEX noise reduction curve that flattened Rubinstein's tone), is less than optimal. Still, these remain eminently listenable. The sound in the Ambassador College DVD has been sweetened and is more palatable than previous issues - though still far from ideal.NOTE: After I received the set, I realized that my box was missing disc 11, had two copies of disc 13, and was lacking disc 94 (and jacket).  I checked online forums and found several others had similar experience.  I advise those who order this set to check it thoroughly to make sure the proper discs are there.The quality control issues prevent me from giving this a five star review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QXO6EI505ZH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005G0ETV0#wasThisHelpful","R1QXO6EI505ZH1","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If there's one good thing that's happened in Classical music over the last few years, it's been the plethora of bargain priced box sets. Such is the case with The Decca Sound, a retrospective of some of that label's most famous recordings from the early stereo era onward.Space doesn't permit me to go into detail on the individual performances here, and I refer the reader to Stephen Worth's review for the full contents of the set.  Suffice it to say that there isn't a bad performance to be heard in the set, although a few are less than stellar.  The repertoire and performers have been carefully selected so that the individual discs add up to an uncommonly well balanced collection - truly the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  The collection is organized alphabetically by primary artist.  Some performers appear on more than one disc.  For example, Vladimir Ashkenazy appears as pianist (in the Rachmaninoff Third Concerto and Second Sonata) on one disc, then as conductor (in Sibelius's First Symphony and Ashkenazy's own orchestration of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition), and Andras Schiff appears as both accompanist and solo pianist.The original front album covers are reproduced for each disc, and most discs are filled out with bonus tracks.  The original liner notes are not included here.  In their place is an illustrated hard-bound booklet which goes into detail how the Decca Sound was achieved - essentially it amounted to the selection of the proper microphones and a simple but carefully placed setup.  The sound of these recordings, some over 50 years old, holds up really well, particularly the orchestral recordings.  I would describe the Decca Sound as warm without being fuzzy, clear without being clinical, all frequencies audible with a deep, resonant bass that doesn't call attention to itself.Highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CBRMXJCCL5I9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005D51II0#wasThisHelpful","R3CBRMXJCCL5I9","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite the title, Spartacus is nowhere to be seen in Gods of the Arena, a prequel season to Spartacus: Blood and Sand. The non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma which ultimately claimed the life of title character Andy Whitfield necessitated this season, which served as a filler between the first season and the third - Spartacus: Vengance - with Liam McIntyre re-cast in the leading role.Gods of the Arena deals with behind the scenes intrigue as Quintus Lentulus Batiatus attempts to emerge from his father's shadow and secure a higher position for the house of Batiatus in the Roman city of Capua.  Of course, the historical events portrayed in both seasons of Spartacus are used as a springboard to propel the story, and are only peripherally linked to the real-life events that lead to Spartacus' revolt in 73BC.John Hannah and Lucy Lawless clearly relish their roles here, chewing on every scene of dialog as if it's their last meal.  The supporting performances are also suitably hammy and over the top - sublety has little place here - although Jeffrey Thomas brings suitable gravitas to his role as Titus, Quintus Lentulus' father.The show is filmed in a heightened visual style reminiscent of graphic novels, with some of the backgrounds looking painted rather than organic.  Much has been made of the copious nudity in the series.  While there is plenty of flesh to be seen here, both male and female, it is considerably less, um ""in your face"" in season two.  The fleshly attraction here is in watching it abused in the fight scenes, complete with Matrix-style slow motion and CGI injuries of all sorts, including impalement and dismemberment.As history, this is on a level somewhere below, say, Gone with the Wind and Titanic.  As pure guilty pleasure entertainment, it holds the viewer's attention.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14F8PMK3ZB4BQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HW7JMO#wasThisHelpful","R14F8PMK3ZB4BQ","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a child, I watched both The Six Million Dollar Man and its spinoff, The Bionic Woman, but quickly became more enthusiastic about the latter. While I was entertained by Steve Austin's derring-do, I cared about Jaime Sommers.  However, by the time the final seasons of TBW and 6M$M came along, my interest in each series had declined.  So with a few exceptions, I am seeing these episodes for the first time.  With the exception of a few episodes, including The Bionic Dog and On the Run, season 3 is a bit of a letdown.Much of the success of TBW must be credited to Lindsay Wagner. She brings a combination of charm and intelligence unseen on television since Elizabeth Montgomery's turn in Bewitched - adding hints of sadness and vulnerability. As the series progresses, Sommers matures and becomes more confident.  Richard Anderson brings a fatherly quality to Oscar Goldman - a contrast with his more hard-nosed portrayal in 6M$M. These qualities were utterly lacking in the unmemorable and mercifully short lived 2007 remake.Producer Kenneth Johnson's involvement in TBW was ended in season 3, and that may be why many of the episodes are flat, paint-by-number affairs.  The ""insider"" references seen in the first two seasons are largely missing - although there are a few pointed moments, such as when Oscar chides a Senator for mispronouncing Jaime's name. Jaime's work as a forward-thinking teacher is mentioned, but never seen. In some ways, this reminds me of the third season of the original Star Trek, where a new producer altered the tone of the series in a negative way.  There is the usual recycling of plot elements, such as the Fembots in Las Vegas episode, which ends with an interesting twist.Since TBW was moved from ABC to NBC for season 3, there are no crossover episodes with 6M$M.  There are a few interesting guest stars including Evel Knievel (as himself), Brock Peters, and a very young Helen Hunt.  My favorite semi-regular is Bracken (along with several stunt dogs) as Max, the bionic bog. The visual style is in keeping with the Universal Television look of the 1970s: simple camera setups, with establishing shots transitioning to two-shots and close-ups, very little camera movement beyond the occasional pan or zoom, and numerous stock footage. After the hand-held camera style of today's series, this simplicity is a welcome relief.Both picture and audio quality are improved over previous seasons, although there few seconds of muffled sound effects in Sanctuary Earth.  The sound is two channel mono, and high-end frequency response is improved over the first two seasons, with clearer dialogue.The bonus features include episode commentary with writers James D. Parriott and Steven E. De Souza, a Q&A with Lindsay Wagner, and a photo gallery.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVU10WUB468VA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EVY8NA#wasThisHelpful","RVU10WUB468VA","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The days are long gone (except among a few pseudo-intellectuals) when Rachmaninoff was written off as a lightweight, pops composer - as an old edition of the New Grove Dictionary of Music& Musicians notoriously did.  Grove's statement that the popularity of a few of Rachmaninoff's compositions would not last has been resoundingly disproven.  Not only are the old warhorses - the Second Symphony, Second Piano Concerto, and Paganini Rhapsody - as popular as ever, but many of Rachmaninoff's previously obscure works have entered the standard repertoire.  But this set from Brilliant Classics marks the first time a complete edition of Rachmaninoff's works has been released.  It's long overdue.To put something front and center: as with many complete editions, very few of the performances in this edition can be considered reference recordings.  But nearly all are on a high level and in acceptable sound - and a few works in this collection have never been recorded before. I will parenthetically suggest alternative recordings to those in this set that are not fully satisfactory.Concertos: All four concertos and the Paganini Rhapsody are from Earl Wild's renowned set with the Royal Philharmonic under Jascha Horenstein - recorded in the 1960s for Reader's Digest. Wild was a pianist of virtuoso technique coupled with a disciplined temperament (as was the composer himself).  His performances are appropriately exciting and ardently romantic, without resorting to gushing - they never cross the line from emotion to sentimentality.Orchestral works: All the symphonies here are conducted by Rozhdestvensky.  The 1st & 3rd stem from live concerts with the USSR Ministry of Culture Symphony Orchestra.  The disastrous premier of Symphony No. 1 plunged Rachmaninoff into a depression which required hypnosis to cure.  The leading critic of the time condemned the work as too dissonant - and many performances of the symphony sound bombastic.  Here, the work emerges as more yearning than vengeful, marking Rachmaninoff as the true successor to Tchaikovsky. Despite some out of tune woodwinds at the start of the 3rd Symphony, the piece is presented with ardor, the balance often highlighting the modern aspects of the work, which most performances try to gloss over. But 10 minutes into the first movement, there's a sudden reduction in volume, where it remains for the rest of the symphony.  The last movement is noteworthy for the extreme variations in tempo between the dramatic and lyrical sections - at times things come to a near halt before speeding off again.  The composer's own recording of the 3rd Symphony, with the Philadelphia Orchestra, is mandatory listening.  The 2nd Symphony is played by the London Symphony Orchestra, a step up technically from its USSR counterpart.  The sound is unusually clear without being overly immediate, so listeners can hear Rachmaninoff's interweaving harmonic-polyphonic lines.  The snag here is the scherzo, where the conductor's rather sluggish tempo prevents things from getting off the ground.  But the slow movement redeems everything thanks to a particularly loving clarinet solo - making the performance worthy of recommendation.  I also recommend Pletnev in this symphony.)The Symph0nic Dances and the Bells - both masterpieces by any reasonable measure - are with the Russian State Symphony Orchestra under Polyanskii.  In the Dances, the conductor takes his time in the ghostly waltzing second movement, which is unusually flexible and evocative here.  The soloists in the Bells are spot-miked, and their placement changes, which is distracting.  But the four movements are presented with a straight interpretation, the orchestra plays with refinement, and both solo and choir singing is fine.Piano works: The bulk of solo piano music is played by Santiago Rodriguez, and in many ways represents the high point of the set.  That point's peak is the Corelli Variations - once a forgotten work but now common among Rachmaninoff players.  Rodriguez's performance captures the works rapidly shifting moods (reverent, mysterious, sardonic, virtuosic, warmly romantic) more effectively than many other recordings I've heard, including Grimaud, Laredo, Pletnev, Thibaudet, and Watts - yet structural continuity is never sacrificed.  Both sets of Preludes are appropriately brooding, lyrical, or stormy - as the music requires.  What impresses me most about Rodriguez's Preludes is how he's able to broadly characterize them without allowing them to descend into schmaltz.  He's less successful in the 2nd Sonata, which comes off as sectionalized, but the 1st Sonata sweeps all criticism aside.  All of Rodriguez's contributions are exceptionally well recorded.  In the Etudes-Tableaux, Nikolai Lugansky eschews virtuoso fireworks in favor of pathos and meditative reflection.  This works for the lyrical pieces, but the more dramatic ones lack thrust and drive.  There is also a disc of miscellaneous short piano works that's a mixed bag, with some rather colorless run-throughs by Michael Ponti that are poorly recorded.  The piano duet pieces are given in warmly expressive, unhurried performances by Julien Thurber and Ingryd Thorson.Chamber music: Rachmaninoff's entire output of chamber music can easily fit onto two CDs.  The two Trios élégiaque are offered in ardently poetic performances by the Borodin trio.  The Cello Sonata is in a serviceable performance by Daniil Shafran and Yakov Flier - unfortunately recorded in mono sound.  Surely, Brilliant could have licensed a modern recording of this piece.Opera & Vocal music: I will confess that I am not a great fan of opera, and I have never heard these works before, so I can't compare them with other renditions.  All of Rachmaninoff's four operas (including the unfinished Monna Vanna) are on the brief side, fitting onto one CD each.  The performances in this set are well sung and accompanied.  The vocal highlights here are the performances of All-Night Vigil (Vespers) and Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom - the latter was condemned for its ""spirit of modernism"" and fell into obscurity until it was reconstructed in 1988.  Both works, acapella, are performed with purity and transparency - the perfect antidote for those who label Rachmaninoff as a ""Hollywood"" composer (whatever that means, as Rachmaninoff was well established long before Hollywood was).  The three discs of songs are a mix of solo and multiple voices, with either piano or orchestral accompaniment.A slight caveat here: This set could be regarded as not quite complete, as the Third Concerto is cut and the Second Sonata is presented in the shortened 1931 revision.  For a more complete performance of the 3rd Concerto, I recommend Horacio Gutiérrez.  Van Cliburn made an excellent recording of the original version of the 2nd Sonata, but neither the original nor the revised really works as well as Horowitz's fusion of the two versions.)The set totals 28 CDs, and there is an additional CD-ROM which includes the liner notes.  There is an alternative version of this set which adds historical recordings by Horowitz and the composer.  But due to the cost differential, I recommend this set, with the additional items obtained separately.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKY74QNM65OAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PARX72#wasThisHelpful","RKY74QNM65OAT","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This CD documents Arthur Rubinstein's final of three recordings of Brahms D minor Concerto (there is an additional, filmed performance with Haitink).  After Chopin, Rubinstein recorded more of Brahms' music than that of any other composer.  It is fitting, therefore, that the first and last concertos he recorded were by Brahms.  This Concerto is a difficult work to pull off successfully: the piano part is ungrateful, and often drowned out by an over-orchestrated accompaniment.  Also, many pianists - most notably Glenn Gould - tend to drag the tempos beyond all reason. Rubinstein, who was ten years old when Brahms died, would never have considered such a nonsensical approach.  The Concerto was written early in Brahms career, and was the work of a young man. In essence, ""Brahms without the beard.""Rubinstein was at a disadvantage when he made this recording in 1976.  Extreme old age had robbed him of much of his hearing, macular degeneration had left him almost totally blind.  While the 89 year old pianist gives his best effort, the performance suffers from numerous missed notes, clotted chords, and rhythmic distortions.  In addition, tempos are unsteady, phrasing is tentative, and the performance as a whole lacks Rubinstein's usual structural continuity.  Occasionally, a sense of nobility comes through, but this is in no way of the same caliber as Rubinstein's earlier recordings (from 1954, with Reiner and the Chicago Symphony; and from 1964 with Leinsdorf and the Boston Symphony Orchestra).  Matters are not helped by the poorly voiced piano Rubinstein uses in this recording.  Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic furnish a committed but not totally polished accompaniment.The recorded sound is fine, but the performance problems and lack of any filler pieces will disqualify this issue for all but the most fanatical Rubinstein enthusiasts.I have not heard the Katchen items.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I40TXD0ZR56H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00002DF2C#wasThisHelpful","R2I40TXD0ZR56H","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Three caveats about this set: With the exception of the Scarlatti Sonatas, most of the pieces here are longer works, and Vladimir Horowitz was generally at his best in miniatures.  Also, Horowitz was very particular about programming on his recordings, taking the listener through a series of contrasts in mood - so his recordings as originally sequenced added up to a fulfilling experience.  Finally, Horowitz recorded some of these works several times, and Sony has chosen stereo recordings over mono regardless of performance quality.At a time when Scarlatti was rarely performed on any instrument, Horowitz was regularly programming his short binary Sonatas.  It's no exaggeration to write that Horowitz did more to put Scarlatti on the map than any other pianist.  The Sonatas here include the twenty or so he recorded for Columbia in the 1960s and the group he played at his Met recital in 1981.  They document a gradual shift in Horowitz's playing from a straight yet sassy approach to a more Romantic interpretation.  By the time of his last recitals, Horowitz's Scarlatti almost sounded like baroque Chopin.Horowitz recorded relatively little Mozart before he was in his eighties.  One can see why here.  The F major (from 1947) is large scaled and tense - except for the middle movement which is phrased like an opera aria.  Maybe the pianist was trying to shatter the porcelain doll image of Mozart, but the outer movements sound positively brutal.  The A major (live, 1966) is precious, in the negative sense of the word - every little harmonic flower is paused at and sniffed over.  It's a pity that the elder Horowitz, by then more attuned to Mozart, never returned to these works.Horowitz was more at home with Haydn than with Mozart.  Something about Haydn's rapid mood shifts and changes in pianistic texture agreed with the pianist.  The F major (from 1966) and E-flat (1989) Sonatas are all wit and charm, while the first movement of the C major (1968) is mock seriousness theme & variations before letting loose with virtuoso fingerwork in the finale. Sadly missing from this collection is the Beethovenesque Sonata No. 52 that Horowitz recorded several times in the mono era.It was Horowitz who revived interest in Mozart's great rival, Muzio Clementi - although unfortunately few pianists have followed Horowitz's lead as they did with Scarlatti and Scriabin.  His 1954 recording of Clementi Sonatas re-established the composer's importance, but it's not included here: instead we get the Sonata Quasi Concerto in C major (live, 1980) and isolated sonata movements from 1963 and 1972.  The 1980 performance is probably larger scaled than Clementi envisioned - although Horowitz's own cadenza in the slow movement is lovely.  The earlier fragments are to-the-point and some of the straightest playing you'll hear from Horowitz.VH was never considered a great Beethoven interpreter.  His performances of these six Beethoven sonatas are respectable and respectful - maybe too much so.  In certain pieces, like the finales of the Moonlight or Appassionata Sonatas, one wishes that Horowitz would just ""let go"" and be his virtuoso self, instead of soberly playing the notes to fulfil his recording contract.  Of the Beethoven Sonatas here, Op. 10, No. 3 is the best, where Horowitz captures the composer's humor in the first movement and pathos in the second.  The Pathetique fares well, too.Horowitz recorded only one Schubert Sonata, the great B-flat, D. 960.  The recording here comes from Horowitz's 25th Anniversary recital at Carnegie Hall in 1953.  The pianist, who does not play the first movement repeat, performs the work on a Lisztian scale, particularly in the last movement, where he uses dynamics that would have destroyed Schubert's piano.  He also tends to push the tempo in parts - particularly the last two movements.  (Contrary to popular belief, Horowitz was not a rusher - his tempos were generally within the norms of the era - but he does seem in a hurry here.)  The slow movement, surprisingly, is strongest in this performance - a true andante sostenuto that's beautifully sung.  Still, one is much better off with Kempff, Perahia, or Pollini in this work.Chopin's Second Sonata was a semi-regular on Horowitz's concert programs.  The recording here (1962) is one of the most structurally cohesive I've heard from Horowitz in a longer work.  He gives us an opening movement (sans repeat) that artfully balances detail and outline, and his sparing use of the sustaining pedal results in clear textures that belie Wagner's remark that Chopin was a right-handed (i.e., melody only) composer.  The funeral march, too, is given in an uncommonly crisp rhythm.There are several printed editions of Schumann's F minor Sonata (sometimes called the Concerto without Orchestra).  If you're trying to figure out which one Horowitz plays, you'll need scissors and tape - because he mixes and matches parts from each.  Uptight musicologists will be driven up a wall by this sort of deconstruction/reconstruction, but I posit that each of Horowitz's decisions (playing the four movement version, discarding the rarely played first Scherzo, and reinstating harmonic suspensions from the First Edition) are to the Sonata's advantage.  It comes across as an emotional whole - which is something for a pianist who was accused of sectionalizing everything he played.Sony has included Horowitz's 1977 (or 1976, depending on your sources) recording of Liszt's B minor Sonata.  The pianist had not played the Sonata in public since 1951 and it does not seem to have been completely under his fingers when this remake was done.  It does not compare conceptually or technically to either Horowitz's 1932 studio or 1949 live renditions.  If you like your Liszt tortured, dragged, agonized over, and banged in places, this is the version for you.  (It's a pity RCA didn't record Horowitz's March 1978 Carnegie performance of the work, where he was in form and white hot.)With the Rachmaninoff & Scriabin Sonatas, we reach the high point of this compilation.  Rachmaninoff gave Horowitz carte-blanche to create a fusion edition of the original and revised versions of his 2nd Sonata, and the resultant version is the best compromise between the rambling original and eviscerated revision.  It doesn't hurt that Horowitz simply plays the blazes out of this piece, particularly in the 1968 performance heard here.  Horowitz adeptly navigates through the ""soul-states"" of Scriabin's 3rd Sonata, the orgiastic revelry of the 5th, before leading us into the sulphurous labyrinths of the ""Black Mass"" 9th and rebirth in the 10th.The Barber, Kabalevsky 2nd, and Prokofiev 7th Sonatas included here are all world-premiere recordings.  After hearing Horowitz's recording of the 7th Sonata, Prokofiev sent the pianist a signed copy of the score with the note ""To the miraculous pianist from the composer.""  One can be confident Kabalevsky and Barber felt the same way.  Surprisingly, Horowitz's shattering live performance of Kabalevsky's Sonata No. 2 is not included here.This is another of Sony's ""bare-bones"" reissues.  There are no liner notes, just the discs with simple slip covers, program information, and recording dates - and there is no remastering beyond what's previously been done.  (The sound varies from cramped mono, to dryish early stereo, unlistenable Liszt, and surprisingly spacious Scriabin 5th and Schumann.)  Horowitz fans will already have these recordings in their collection, but for the budget conscious newcomer who wants to hear how Horowitz played large-scale works, this set is a great bargain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MVGGUIX2OG09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056K4V2M#wasThisHelpful","R2MVGGUIX2OG09","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although they shared many personal characteristics, Arthur Rubinstein was surprisingly ambivalent toward the music of Liszt.  I don't think Rubinstein ever loved Liszt the way he loved Chopin and Brahms, and as he grew older the Hungarian composer's music gradually began dropping out of his repertoire.  Rubinstein's vast stereo discography contains only three Liszt items, and he made no Liszt recordings after 1965.  Rubinstein best Liszt playing has all the brilliance of certain Liszt ""specialists"" without the vulgarity one often hears - but not everything in this collection represents him at his best.Disc one contains all of Rubinstein's stereo Liszt recordings.  Rubinstein's version of Liszt E-flat Concerto suffers from technical bluffing and general sloppiness - for example, the passage of repeating notes in the finale.  To an extent, one could get away with this in concert, but it just doesn't pass muster in a recording designed to be heard repeatedly.  Adding to the problem here is some crude microphone placement, with the infamous triangle passage spot-lit beyond all reason. Remastering has not been able to solve this problem and the sound remains excessively dry, although the piano tone is more natural than in the early CD issues. Wallenstein and the RCA Victor Symphony (mostly made of members of the New York Philharmonic) do a reasonable job of accompaniment.  (When it comes to this Concerto, it's hard to do better than Richter/Kondrashin - and you get the A major Concerto as well.)  Although Rubinstein performed Liszt's mammoth Sonata virtually from the beginning of his career, he did not record it until 1965, when he was 78. There are three basic approaches to this work: Demonic, Narrative, or Structural. Rubinstein unhesitatingly chooses the latter course, with just a dash of the previous two. This performance does not have the frisson or diabolical qualities of Horowitz's legendary 1932 recording. Nor does it have the ineffectual mooning of Watts' unfortunate 1985 version.  Rubinstein plays the Sonata as a SONATA, not as a balancing act between orgies of speed and sentimental interludes. (It must be admitted, however, that there are a few bluffed passages and even a misreading of the text on Rubinstein's part.) Liszt's Valse-oubliée is given straightforward performance that lacks the mysterious quirkiness Horowitz brings to the piece.Disc two consists of mono items recorded from 1950-1955 - so some of Rubinstein's most scintillating Liszt from the 1930s is not included here.  This is middle period Rubinstein, when virtuosity was still in abundance, but was more responsibly presented than in earlier years.  The Hungarian Rhapsody No. 10 was a Rubinstein specialty. Apparently, he recorded the work as far back as 1910. That recording, on the Polish Favorit label, has never been issued in digital format.  Rubinstein performs the glissandi passages with rare control, carefully balancing them with the left hand passages and building an effective link to the coda. The Hungarian Rhapsody No. 12 is beautifully phrased and the build-up in the lassan is compelling, but the friska is lacking the last ounce of Rhapsodic fury the piece requires.  Rubinstein's healthy approach serves the Funérailles well, creating a sense of private loss, rather than a public oration.  The Mephisto Waltz, while lacking the last ounce of necromantic diablerie, goes with great gusto and flair. Another recording of the Valse-oubliée, from 1953, is much the same as the 1965 version.Liszt's more contemplative works are also served well here. This is particularly true in the Consolation No. 3, as well as the Liebesträume No. 3 - which was one of Rubinstein's favored encores.  The Valse-Impromptu is one of the more rarely played Liszt works, and almost sounds a precursor to the set of Valses-oubliée - a mysterious introduction gives way to a rather humorous waltz, and Rubinstein effectively captures the mood.This compilation is pleasantly enough recorded.  The stereo items have more body, but the balance problems in the Concerto prevent this from being a top recommendation.  As much as I love the best of Rubinstein's playing, in a year chock full of Liszt bicentennial issues, this is not a top contender.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN6N1P954ZBWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004O9Q66U#wasThisHelpful","RN6N1P954ZBWT","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

What I missed were the subtle clues that the imposters were not ""real"", including a slight alteration of the voice and an overly smooth, made up appearance.There is some ""insider"" humor here that went over my head when I as a child:  Jamie describes one address (on Vermont Avenue NW) as being in a ""seedy"" part of Washington, DC when in fact  it's one of the more expensive parts of the city and within a three minute walk of the White House.There seems to have been a slight change in the writing between Seasons One and Two.  The first season was focused on establishing and developing the Jaime character.  The second season was straight out action adventure with occasional turns to camp humor and showing skin.  Then there was the recycling of plot elements such as the Return of Bigfoot episode.An array of distinguished guest stars can be seen in Season Two, from John Houseman to Vincent Price (Houseman vigorously chews the scenery during his turn) . The visual style is in keeping with the Universal Television look of the 1970s: simple camera setups, with establishing shots transitioning to two-shots and close-ups, and very little camera movement beyond the occasional pan or zoom.

During the slow motion effects sequences, there is some jumpiness in the image, which I don't remember seeing during the original airing (but that was a long time ago and TV screens were a lot smaller then). One consistent problem is that the fade outs before commercial breaks seem to have been altered, so there is a distracting cut-off effect. Some damaged elements seem to have been covered by using freeze frames.  The sound is two channel mono, the dialogue volume inexplicably drops for the first ten minutes of ""Deadly Ringer"", and several episodes are seriously lacking in high-end frequency response.  Also, the intro for part 1 of Kill Oscar uses alternate music.The bonus features include a documentary, episode commentary with creator Kenneth Johnson and Lindsay Wagner, and a photo gallery.I understand that the audio problems have been corrected and replacement discs issued.

"Back in the 1980s, my friends and I would flock to see any film or television show, or read any book that touched on homosexuality.  It's not that these were all great works of art (although some were), but that the paucity of available material made any LGBT related material noteworthy.  We would surely have devoured and debated Michael Bronski's A Queer History of the United States then, but there is little to warrant such indiscriminate attention these days.This scope of this book is certainly ambitious, covering LGBT history in America from 1492 to 1990.  But in his effort to cover 500 years of American LGBT history, Bronski leaves gaping areas uncovered: such as the saga of President James Buchanan, whose homosexuality may have altered the course of history, and the situational homosexuality of the Old West.  Further, Bronski's writing style leaves much to be desired.  He frequently darts from subject to subject with little narrative through-line.  At times, I thought I was reading a bad college dissertation.Bronski's writing clearly reflects his radical leftist bent, as when he makes the distinction between the gay ""community"" and gay ""activists.""  I would counter that any LGBT person who is out of the closet is, to some extent, an activist.  More straight minds have undoubtedly been opened by ordinary, out, gay Americans than by professional activists - whose behavior is often so grating that it does more harm than good.  I also take issue with Bronski's equating of advocacy of same-sex marriage with cultural conservatives who oppose gay rights.  No one who favors same-sex marriage rights is saying that gays should be compelled to get married or enter into monogamous relationships.  It is, in the end, about freedom of choice.The book is heavily weighted toward lesbians, non-whites, and the transgendered.  In itself that's not a bad thing, as these groups are too often neglected.  But Bronski seems to have a problem with white men - gay or straight.  Ironically, Bronski does not touch upon the issue of discrimination against LGBTs of color by their white peers (as when some nightclubs require multiple forms of ID from non-white patrons, but none at all from whites).  And Bronski completely whitewashes (pardon the pun) the historical and continuing prevalence of homophobia in minority communities.  The book also overemphasizes LGBT people in large cities, as if LGBTs didn't live openly in the suburbs or even rural areas.The fact is, most members of the LGBT community are not Queer, we are simply ordinary people trying to make a living and win our rightful place in society.  If Michael Bronksi hadn't been bent on obscuring that fact, his book might have been more noteworthy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YTA8RLJPQ0WS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807044393#wasThisHelpful","R1YTA8RLJPQ0WS","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If anyone expected a book about America's sex scandals bearing the name of the publisher of Hustler magazine to be a salacious affair, those expectations will be dashed in the first chapter.  This is neither a sex tome nor a dryly scholarly work, but one that combines the best of both worlds.  Most of the scandals and sexual peccadillos here, dating back to before the founding of the United States, have been written about elsewhere, but this book brings them all together.Thomas Jefferson's liaison with his slave, Sally Hemings, was well known in his own time, became forgotten (or intentionally obscured?) during the 19th Century, and has resurfaced.  But Dolley Madison's penchant for hearty partying was something I'd never read about.Long before gay identity politics, there were same-sex inclined people in military and political circles.  Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, credited with getting the ragtag Continental Army into fighting shape, traveled everywhere with his young male companion, and was eager to travel to ""the Colonies"" to escape a sex scandal in Europe.  Benjamin Franklin (whose reputation among the ladies may have helped the American cause in France) was aware of Steuben's inclinations, and nevertheless wrote a highly padded letter of recommendation to General Washington.  Following America's victory in the Revolutionary War, Congress avoided further scandal by procuring a small farm in upstate New York for von Steuben to retire to.  Given von Steuben's inclinations, how ironic that the United States was one of the last holdouts in the western world to bar open homosexuals from the military.James Buchanan was America's first homosexual president (although modern-day gays are loath to admit it since he did such a terrible job) who was unable to cope with Southern secessionists because his lover, William Rufus King, was a pro-slavery. Their long term relationship was the talk of Washington for many years, where they were derided as ""Miss Nancy"" and ""Aunt Fancy"".  Evidence about Abraham Lincoln's unusually close friendships with Joshua Speed and Captain David Derickson are presented, without drawing conclusions - which puts this book in a more credible position than C. A. Tripp's The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln.The chapter on Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt has a number of errors and questionable suppositions that are presented as fact: Lucy Mercer was hardly ""buxom"" as she is described here; It remains unknown whether the Franklin/Lucy affair was ever consummated; Eleanor ended sexual relations with Franklin before, not after, his affair with Lucy because she neither enjoyed sex nor wanted any more children (she bore Franklin six); the evidence for Eleanor's lesbian relationships is inconclusive.The chapter on J. Edgar Hoover, on the other hand, is unusually balanced.  His relationship with Clyde Tolson is unsensationally presented, as is Hoover's persecution of people of color along with his fellow homosexuals (unless they happened to agree with his politics, as with Roy Cohn) but the cross-dressing rumors are put to rest.  It seems that Hoover and the Mafia (the importance of which he denied) played a game of mutual protection, while the FBI director's dealings with several presidents were on a darker, more threatening level - like scorpions in a bottle.The book ends, chronologically, in the Clinton era, although there are passing references to more recent scandals.  Covering Lewinsky-gate, Flynt is more interested in presenting a psychological portrait of President Clinton and less interested in the salacious details dwelled on by prosecutor Ken Starr in his infamous report.There are some glaring errors in this book.  For example, 1989's Escort-gate, which involved Barney Frank's former roommate, is referred to as the first gay congressional scandal.  In fact, the 1980 affair involving Congressman Robert Bauman's attempt to solicit an underage male prostitute preceded this, as did a 1983 page scandal involving Gerry Studds.Although there was little in this book that was entirely new to me, new aspects and angles were revealed in nearly every chapter.  This is a not as much a book about sex, as how hypocrisy and sexual repression twisted powerful people into destructive behavior, while those who were more open and liberated sexually became the supreme achievers of their times.  Perhaps that why post-Presidential Bill Clinton is treated like a rock-star, while no one comes to J. Edgar's posthumous defense. One can be certain that, as long as there are politicians who will resort to sexual McCarthyism, there will be sexual scandals.  I am uncertain as to whether Larry Flynt or David Eisenbach was the primary author of this book.  My guess is that Eisenbach did most of the research and writing, then Flynt rewrote Eisenbach's draft and added a forward.  Both deserve kudos for a strong work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W5AB4GT3IEN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0230105033#wasThisHelpful","R3W5AB4GT3IEN0","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This five CD set includes all Robert Casadesus' stereo Mozart Piano Concerto recordings with George Szell, as well the Concertos for Two and Three pianos with Ormandy.  (Casadesus also recorded monaural versions of several Mozart Concertos with Szell, which are not included in this set.  Hopefully they will form a separate release.)Casadesus clearly saw Mozart as part of the Classical tradition, not as a proto-Romantic.  The performances here are emotionally reserved (an earlier generation would have called them ""aristocratic""); the sustaining pedal is used sparingly; outer movements are brisk and slow movements are never dragged - nor are they embellished.  At the same time, this is not the rococo, porcelain-doll approach to Mozart that was popular among 19th Century players.  Incidentally, Casadesus plays his own cadenzas in K. 365, K. 467, and K. 482, and utilizes the Saint-Saens cadenza in K. 491.Szell's accompaniments with the Cleveland Orchestra fit hand-in-glove, never crossing the line between the ""chaste warmth"" that Szell favored in 18th Century music and the more Romantic approach favored by some of his contemporaries.  By the way, all of the recordings with Szell do indeed include the Cleveland Orchestra or ""members of"", including those that list the Columbia Symphony Orchestra as the players.  For contractual reasons, in some cases the Clevelanders did not record under their own name.  (I recall a music critic who lamented Szell's use of the Columbia Symphony, but marveling how Szell got them to sound like the Cleveland, evidently unaware of the ruse.)Ormandy, always a sympathetic accompanist, draws fine playing from the Philadelphia Orchestra, especially from the woodwinds - although some may not care for the somewhat ""heavier"" orchestral sound.  But at least the Philadelphians get to play under their own name.  In the Two Piano Concerto Casadesus is joined by his wife Gaby and in the Three Piano Concerto their son Jean participates.  Family music making, of course, was something that Mozart himself enjoyed, and as the three Casadesus were fine pianists, this is entirely appropriate.Also included is a rather colorless performance of the Sonata in F major, K. 332, (to hear the real potential of this work, listen to Horszowski).  Rounding out the set is a relaxed reading of the Quintet for Piano and Winds, K. 452, with the Philadelphia Woodwind Quartet.Most of the items on this set have been issued numerous times on LP and CD, with varying sound quality.  The set uses the best existing transfers for each concerto, and they sound quite good: the piano/orchestra balance is well judged; dynamics, which were constricted on LP, have been opened up; the strings have lost their aggressive edge heard on earlier CDs and have a sweeter, more natural character.  In the multi Piano Concertos, the sense of separation between the pianos is slightly exaggerated but palatable.  The sound in the Sonata, however, is so one dimensional that for a moment I thought it was mono.  The Quintet, also, is subpar, with a closely miked piano contrasting with more atmospheric winds.  As is customary with the Masters series, this is a budget priced, bare bones release.  There are no liner notes, but one can always look up information about the works on the Internet (Wikipedia has articles on each work in this collection).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SRAP99CR3IAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H6P2KQ#wasThisHelpful","R3SRAP99CR3IAV","AEV640MKB3I9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV640MKB3I9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In her debut novel, Letters To Loretta From The Radio Shack, author Laura Lynn Ashworth provides the reader with a glimpse into the friendship and romantic relationship between teen sweethearts Sal and Loretta through their letter correspondence during the World War II years of 1943-1945.Sal and Loretta's story is broken down into three parts that corresponds through the years of 1943-1945.In January of 1943, nineteen year old Sal joins the Navy and is stationed at the US Naval Training Station in Farragut Idaho. While there, the readers follow the first part of Sal and Loretta's relationship via Sal's letters to fifteen year old Loretta, who was back at home in Chicago, Illinois. In this first part of the book, the reader follows Sal's correspondence to Loretta from January to May 1943, there aren't any of Loretta's letters to Sal included. From the one-way correspondence, the reader gets a glimpse in the War, Sal's training, the popular music and movies of that time period, and the social scene of their Chicago neighborhood.Part two continues the correspondence between Sal and Loretta starting in July of 1944 when the readers are introduced to Loretta's letters to Sal. From her letter dated July 11, 1944, the reader finds out that there was a year and a half of silence between the two due to a misunderstanding while Sal was on home on a three day leave. During 1944, Sal is based in San Francisco and Honolulu, and then is transferred in October to the USS Signet, a minesweeper based out of Pearl Harbor that goes out to sea on missions from time to time. Sal is a radio man, who is responsible for translating Morse code messages that come into the radio shack from US ships and Radio San Francisco. Sal and Loretta continue to correspond regularly to each other, but sometimes the arrival of their letters is delayed. The letters contents are typical of teens / young adults, where they tease each other, request recent pictures of each other, and swap information about their daily lives, in addition to talking about the popular music and movies of that time period (this continues in every letter).Part three of the book consists of Sal's time on the USS Signet in 1945, the crew conducts minesweeping practices and maneuvers around the Hawaiian island region until they are deployed to the Pacific war theater of Japan and surrounding islands in that region. From February through December, the USS Signet minesweeps the region and provides support during the battle of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. During these months, the correspondence between Sal and Loretta are delayed to the hit-n-miss receiving of the letters while he at sea in the combat zone. The book concludes with the USS Signet departing the Pacific region homeward bound on December 11, 1945. The ship and its crew has earned 4 battle stars for meritorious participation in battle. The reader is left with a cliffhanger ending as the only communication between Sal and Loretta is a western union message from Sal to Loretta dated November 30, 1945, stating that he will be home soon. This abrupt ending leaves the reader wondering if Sal went home on leave after the ship docked in Pearl Harbor, and if he and Loretta ever hooked up.Letters To Loretta From The Radio Shack is an interesting non fictional historical romantic account between two young people during the World War II time period. I have to admit that I did not like the letters only style of the book, I would have preferred to read about Sal and Loretta's story with a balance between the backstory of their lives and friendship in Chicago interwoven with the blossoming romantic relationship via the letter correspondence. I found myself getting bored while reading their letters, their teenage / young adult ramblings tended to make me roll my eyes quite a bit. However I did find it fascinating following the USS Signet and Sal's deployment in the Pacific theater during 1945, the author does a fine job of interspersing historical war accounts from the USS Signet's movements during that time period.Disclaimer: I received a copy of the book from the author in exchange for my honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2URJ1FB23YISD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PRFK2NI#wasThisHelpful","R2URJ1FB23YISD","A1NJLDT5WDKD84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NJLDT5WDKD84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I first got Echo setup, I was having fun giving it commands such as what's the weather, play a radio station, and of course music from my library or Prime music.  My kids joined in, and had fun with asking math questions, Wikipedia questions, and add their favorite candies to the shopping list for me!  They also asks questions like: Alexa, when were you born, who is your mother, do you have any siblings, and even make statement that kids make among themselves like ""Alexa, you suck"".  Each time they laugh and happy at the response from the Echo.  I even then joined in with questions such as ""Alexa, are you better than Siri?"" They of course love to play their favorite music, which my wife hates.Then my wife came in, heard the music, and say ""Alexa, Shut Up!""  Alexa, of course, complied.  That made her smile.  She hates voice technologies, so naturally she also tells Alexa ""You are stupid.""  The response made her laugh again.  Then we asks Alexa to play her favorite song, which wasn't in my library or Prime music. Echo played a portion, and gives opportunity to buy it for $1.25.  Of course my wife says yes as it's out of my wallet!After that, my wife uses everyday and overrides any music or radio stations the rest of the family puts on! And she begin to tell all her friends about the Echo and get at least 10 of her friends to sign up to buy one. Now this is someone who NEVER recommends tech to anyone. It's ironic how a voice product can be sold by handling negative remarks. Kudos to the Echo team.Now after using it for more than 6 months, Echo still the most popular item in our kitchen / family room where we ask for weather, play music or radio stations, and ask to answer questions (found on wikipedia).There has always been a concern about whether Amazon is listening to our conversations, but I did a test on network. Unless you say ""Alexa"", none of the conversation are transmitted... So that's good..for now...I highly recommend this gadget as it's very useful.

"I bought this to protect GeChic 1502i, which has the extra width. This cover, at first, seems 1 inch shorter in the longest side. But with its elastic material, it was able to fully cover the 1502i. I was also able to flatten the stand, and hook it to the long side and include it in the cover!Since the title also mention other 15.6 laptops, I gave them a try. Fitting a Macbook Pro 15 is easy with room to spare. For my Lenovo Thinkpad W530 and W540, which both have 9 cell battery that protrudes out, still manage to fit.

"I purchased this to switch a PS3, PS4, XBox One, XBox 360, and a mini PC (Intel NUC) to a 4K HDTV and another 720p native monitor capable of doing 1080i.  So it's a good test of signals. I'm happy to say the game consoles, especially the older ones like XBox 360 and PS3, did auto detect and adjust to HDTV at 1080i on both just fine.The 4K display from my mini PC is detected and shown. However, the minute I go to browser the screen starts to blank and reappear. Sometimes once a minute, sometimes continuously on/off for few minutes!!! this drives me crazy!  After research it appears the likely cause is support for HDCP pass-thru. This switch, from web descriptions, appears to not handle that.  So this means hooking up a PC to HDTV via this switch is not going make you happy.For 4K, only 30Hz will be supported since it's not HDMI 2.0In a nutshell, I do like all the cool features including ARC (can be turned off), Optical audio and analog audio thru 3.5mm socket. Switching from 4 inputs to 2 outputs, and share same inputs on both outputs are cool and seem to work good.

However, I add a computer capable of outputing 4K to one of the HDMI input, and my 4K HDTV starts to flicker with browsers.

I also connected a PS3, PS4, and XBox One to the input and they all switched beautifully with 1080p detection while 4K from the Intel NUC mini PC.

"After decades of using DVRs from Dish and AT&T U-verse, I finally plunged in to this DVR after switching to Comcast/Xfinity. I did use X1 for a day before switching.I choose the Roamio Pro because of the following:* I wanted maximum storage inside, and expanded add-on storage* I wanted multiple non-DVR receivers where I don't have to pay for them monthly (TiVO mini with lifetime)* 6 (dynamically assigned) tuners is needed in my household, especially we do record 4 shows simultaneously on certain nights* Descent UI, but I really like the ""What's on Now?"". Season pass recording across multiple channels is very useful also* TiVO app allowing to watch outside of house (supported by Xfinity). Works on ipad, android, but not last gen Kindle HD 8.9* RF remote - I missed this badly with AT&T U-verse that only use IR* Option to go to the Slide, with keyboard and backlit* Option to get stuff from PC (separate software)The only thing negative I find is the guide is missing details on sports. In particular football playbacks in Pac-12 network do not have the teams info so I have to record all and delete those I don't want. SEC network has team info however.So because I wanted my DVR to be more open, less costly (DVR + lots of receivers), this is the best choice for me at this time.

"I'm one of those that usually don't make lots of stuff from total scratch, especially baked goods. I recently decided to make my own breads, because I just love when bread is freshly baked, and my local bakeries cannot guarantee consistent time to bake the bread i wanted for me to pick up.The recipe book that comes with my bread machine (Zo), has measurements in volume and in weight. Following volume for the first few bread always resulted in issues with bread with consistency, and always seem to be ""off"".  With reviewers of bread machine suggest a scale and point to this one, I grabbed one to try.Boy did it make a difference! there is HUGE difference of measuring by volume versus weight, especially when it cans to heavier amount. For example, the recipe book that says 4 1/4 cups of flour also list 416 grams if measured by weight.  If I use the scale to measure 416g, I get only 3 1/2 cups of flour in a measuring cup! I think it's because the weight of the flour push down and make it denser with higher volumes. So, my original 4 1/4 flour would've come out to over 600 grams!PRO: Features I really like about this scale:1. big surface - big enough to fit bowl or big measuring cups2. Quick reset: I first had to put empty cup on the scale and remember its weight, then subtract it from the total weight. But then I found out I can hit the on/off button to ""reset"" to zero including the container! Then I can just measure the content.CON: things that inconvenienced me1. Timer too short. It shuts off many times before I dump content in a measuring cup on the scale!Anyway, great scale! Made me a better baker!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P7NHFCEP8EVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002UG4UM6#wasThisHelpful","R1P7NHFCEP8EVW","AFNG8O2DXRCUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFNG8O2DXRCUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

All my life I've been told it's not possible to recharge the copper tops and the pink bunnies, and I do have couple of medium-sized boxes of these drained which I just don't have time to disposed them properly.I will only comment on recharging the alkaline batteries, as there was no need for me to buy the Ni-MH and Ni-CD the minute most of my dead alkaline batteries were charged and put back in service! This thing does work! I can honestly say, within 3 days of recharging 12 drained C and 8 D copper tops and put them back to use, this appliance paid for itself!Couple of notes on the recharging:1. If a battery still have some juice in it, the charger will light up green and say it's OK. So I drain them using devices such as spare flashlights and electric toys.2. The advertised performance (70-905), as vouched by reviewers, is similar to the fully charged rechargeable batteries.

"Wow, what a game. Movie-quality cinematic with compelling story that inspires a good controversial discussion. Graphics is top notch, the weapons are solid, and the character movement AI(especially the sidekick/partner) is one step closer to being more human-like.I have played through many action games, and the ones I liked the least always involve battling zombies. I don't know, just not a fan of them. But it's different for this game! It's difficult for me to articulate, but somehow I enjoyed battling the 4 stages of the infected. Maybe is I'm able to control the actions better.The game is linear, which is good as the focus is on playing through and feel part of the story. However there is plenty of freedom to roam and explore the surroundings.The ending sequence with Joel's course of action was unexpected (and therefore inspires a lot of debate).  *SPILER ALERT* However, because the main characters are intact, it's a foregone conclusion that a sequel will follow!This game ranks up there with UnCharted in playability, and in my opinion is unrivaled in playing through a movie-quality story.

I know it's not a fair comparison, but no one is expected to put a cover on the Helix tablet portion, since when not using it's covered/protected like a laptop. Overall it feels like a solid slate with slightly larger screen at 11.6""* Love the quick detach and re-attach of the tablet/screen. It's fun to show off to others, but the real appreciation comes when I am using it as an ultrabook on the desk or on my lap, and then snap it off in 1 second and proceed to lie on couch/bed to browse in tablet mode! It's just not web surfing, but working through spreadsheet, redlining a word document, and even video editing.

I get about 85 words per minute, while I get 90 on the regular keyboards.* Trackpoint - this is a must for me. More productive than trackpad and I don't have to carry a separate mouse.* Once docked, it's a real ultrabook - so can actually work in my lap (hard to do with Surface Pro)* Flip for TV watching/demo mode. It feels real good to work on free hand sketches on the desk as well.* Pretty good battery life for an i7 with 8GB RAM at around 5 hours with tablet, and 9 full.

"As vibrating your hands is not enough, Sony decides it fun to knock our heads around! Playing shooter like Black Ops II was a head-pounding experience! Not only the background explosions vibrate my head, but so does some gun shots. Machine gun does a pretty good job at knocking my head semi-automatically!The headset can be in various modes, from game to specifics like shooting and racing, to movie. The differences are subtle to me, especially my head is being a ""shock absorber""...All these are in wireless bluetooth mode with PS3. Wired with audio cable is not bad. The option to use audio input on the USB stick is clever, but the sound is ordinary stereo...and disappointing since my head doesn't get the ""massaging"" action.I have the first generation PS3 bluetooth wireless headset as well. Besides the head vibration sensation, the other major sound difference is this one can do 7.1 effect on blu-ray and streaming movies as well if I recall. The previous one can only do stereo for non-games sound effects.I haven't ran out of battery on this one, with my longest session being 3 hours. Of course, I think that's all my head can handle before needing some quiet times!Headset is classy looking, with good blend of chrome/steel in frame. The leather-wrapped ear cushion is stiffer in this model, so the whole headset feels snugged and firmly ""gripping"" my head without feeling tight.  Firm ""gripping"" also helps in kicking my head around!Anyhow, enough of me describing my simulated migraines (without pain).

"I have an elder who is in senior center and needs a phone. Normal mobile phones are too small, so I got a land base module (Verizon Wireless) and this phone to try.The dial buttons are big, and sound is loud, and most features are all well thought out for seniors. There is just one not very well thought out feature, and that's the one button dial. Having the one button dial is great and the reason why I wanted this phone, but the buttons are too small for most ""older"" seniors to see! As you can see in the picture, the number pad (1-9, * and #) are huge, butthe quick dial buttons above are small..like 1/3 in size! The whole point for seniors reaching the stage where they need such a big dial button, is also the age where they won't remember phone numbers and will rely on the one button dials. It's the memory buttons that need to be BIG! For my senior, the handset will be attached to his wheel chair, so the charging will not be near.Perhaps we need to classified seniors: those that are young seniors (65-75), to middle-aged seniors (75-85), and senior seniors (86+). The phone I was buying is for an 87 year old senior. He can see the big number pad on this phone, but cannot see the writing on the memory buttons nor the labels on the base, and he definitely can't remember phone numbers to manually dial. I ended up returning this phone and is continue my search.But for young seniors, I think this phone is very good choice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23HNU3ZK5T45C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050WWCSG#wasThisHelpful","R23HNU3ZK5T45C","AFNG8O2DXRCUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFNG8O2DXRCUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you love white and want smaller system then PS3 Slim model this is a great choice. The console white is glossy with ribbed middle but the controller is matte white. The materials are made to be lighter than other previous PS3 consoles, but the plastic also feels a bit cheap if you are used to the previous PS3s. But if you are new to PS3, you wouldn't know it. The top loading is good if you are setting the console on top of some table, instead of in one of the home theater shelves.I already have 2 PS3 slim consoles used with two different TV/entertainment centers. I decided I wanted to stay with another PS3 for a third room over other devices. This is because not only PS3 offers the best and upgradable blu-ray player, but also upgradable streaming apps (Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, etc), and bluetooth remote (I have a lot of problem with Infrared remotes in my setups).The bundle price is a good deal. The Playstation Plus membership is worth it in my opinion. For just $4 (and change) per month, you get to build up library of free games. Overtime, you library of free or discounted games can exceed hundreds of games. Well worth it  especially compared to other monthly recurring subscriptions.

Android 2.2's bluetooth does not support dynamic pin number that some bluetooth device requires (e.g., newer bluetooth keyboard).As for communication, connecting to bluetooth and establish OBD II connection both takes about 2-5 seconds simultaneously from Android app. It sends info to my app on both Android 2.2 and Android 4.2 devices just fine (using Torque).However, Torque is reporting some communication errors over bluetooth, but it's like 1% of times. That is acceptable to me, especially for an wireless mini adapter at this price range. It's almost a no-lose situation to take a risk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B94OEFR9UDE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008U1MOM8#wasThisHelpful","R1B94OEFR9UDE4","AFNG8O2DXRCUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFNG8O2DXRCUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought the ""Honey"" cover. So I'll address the color first. It's NOT honey. Doesn't look like any honey I have ever seen, but the color is identical match to that of regular yellow mustard. Yes Mustard would not be prude for marketing, but honey color is flat out lie. They could've come up with some fancy yellow color name, like paint for cars these days.As for the cover itself, turning Kindle on automatically while opening, and automatically off/sleep while closing is just GENIUS. It's my favorite part of handling Kindle. Always in awe and never gets old! That itself is worth extra premium to comparable covers.The cover is a perfect fit - obviously since it's from Amazon. The cover flips outward to become a stand, and it's pretty sturdy and also doesn't slip on gloss polished wooden tables.The leather is hard leather. It's more like the material you find on a European car door panel (e.g., BMW), then the plush ones you find in a luxury Japanese car panel. So if your expectation of leather is the plush luxury type, then you'll be disappointed. I personally think it's meant to seriously protect, rather than let dig your fingers and palm into it.All in all a very functional case.

I'm able to take a hand vacuum cleaner and suck things right up. For dusts generated by the treadmill overtime, it's easy to just wipe it off.My only gripe is the horizontal strength. During installation of the new treadmill, we (stupidly) attempted to pull the mat with treadmill on it in order to shift the machine couple of inches into position.

"My DC31 handheld vacuum usually just sits on some stand waiting to be used. The charger is always plugged in, and is unplugged explicitly each time I use it. I bought a DC44 that comes with its own wall mount. I loved it and decide to find one for my DC31.This mount has the all important power tip entrance, allowing the tip to snap in place so that when DC31 is returned to this dock, the power tip slides right into the DC31 without any drama, and charging starts!This mount practically is good for facing up, where the vacuum rests in it. It cannot be facing down like DC44's dock. It may work on the 3 or 9 clock position, but the screws must drill into the studs very well.All in all it's a good mount to have for DC31 since I want it mount on the wall.

"This power pack/charger was included in my Motorola Razr Droid smart phone package. It is quite thin and lightweight, with the size similar to a typical smartphone. Because it's so thin, the built-in battery doesn't hold that much power. So it's not likely to do a full charge of a typical device. I was able to charge from 10% to 50% of my Razr Droid Maxx, which lasts extra 2 hours with GPS tracking turned on.There are a lot of power pack with much higher capacity, but they may not be comfortable to charge on-the-go.

"I bought this to play early versions on Windows, of the current/recent sequel titles on PS3 and XBox 360. These games just not the same using keyboard, or anything other than console-caliber controllers. This Xbox 360 wireless controller was a logical choice since it's the same controller for XBox, and of course both XBox and Windows are from Microsoft.The package comes with the controller that is identical to the one that comes with XBox, and a wireless receiver plugging into the USB port on the PC. It also comes with two AAA batteries and a CD to install driver.After driver installation, the receiver and the controller runs without hitch. The issue then is the games. Most games will not function like this, and will require third party software/driver, and both vendor-contributed and public-contributed configuration files. This is where it requires time on your side. For example, the original Mass Effect game for PC may have multiple user-contributed configuration files, some work better than others. More recent Mass Effect 2 have better support.So your mileage may vary depending on the game you wish to play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UG4F5TQ6Z8OV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QRKWKQ#wasThisHelpful","R2UG4F5TQ6Z8OV","AFNG8O2DXRCUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFNG8O2DXRCUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"70+ hours over 3 months period. That's what the game gave me as a summary report when I finished the game - once. I've only sporadically played games throughout my life. My recent playing has all been FPS or action games in straight campaign linear mode to get through-and-move on. ME2 is a role playing game that needs to build up a team and build royalty while excavate minerals. The game like this usually turn me off after few hours as I refuse to put so much time in it (Dead Island for example). But this game is highly addictive, and I keep coming back to play. It was worth the money for sure.The only thing I find repetitive (but still wanting to do) is mining all the planets for minerals. This at the end wasn't necessary for 3 out of the 4 elements. The mining probably took me a good 1/4 of the time. I give 4 (instead of 5) stars for fun because of this time waster. In Me3 they simplify this which is good.The other complaint is the reloading time after getting killed. It can take up to 30 seconds to restart a section each time, which is a real downer. I have a 7200RPM hard drive and it's a real drainer. I strongly suggest using one of the faster SSDs if you want to play at more difficult level to deal with the slow reloading time.This edition comes with most of the DLC content, so lots to explore. That's a huge value! I think there is only one DLC that is not part of this and can be downloaded separately.My only major complaint is loading time after getting killed. Typically can be 20-30 seconds. On some very challenging battles, the loading-before-restarting can really drag the gaming session on. (I have a 7200RPM HDD, and may need to try SSD)All in all, it was a GREAT game that really had an effect on my work productivity and cut into my sleep time!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27G5OHP9AF5C3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I0J5YW#wasThisHelpful","R27G5OHP9AF5C3","AFNG8O2DXRCUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFNG8O2DXRCUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my 9 year old on his birthday. He loved building stuff using Lego (especially cars), so this was next step in understanding the internal workings.All in all it took 5 hours. He was good doing himself 2/3 of the instructions, but got stuck. I did have to help. Unless the builder reads instruction carefully, and also look at the pictures carefully, mistakes bound to happen (e.g., reverse one of the main engine blocks). The screws are nice alternative to glue, but the screw driver worn out at the end.One of the final steps involve distributor/spark plug adjustment, and the instruction doesn't work. The way to adjust is to move the crank shaft's pulley until the spark plug light goes on.The valuable part is learning the terms of various engine parts while building. For example, the builder will say and repeat the parts piston, rocker, camshaft, timing belt, water pump, fan, fan belt, pulley, distributor, spark plug, and my favorite - oil dip stick! Then of course at the end when the whole thing working.As for the quality, I can definitely believe the issues reviewers here have identified. The motor can work pretty hard and can easily burn out.

"As background, I've been making Belgian waffles for my family for almost two years now, for average of 3 times a week. We tried many cheaper ones on the market, but settled on Waring Pro double waffle maker for the last 18 months. The cooking surface has worn so I decided to replace with a new one. This product caught my eye with its features and stellar (but few) reviews.First the waffle maker. The countdown timer is very nice, although not intelligent. It sets on 2 minutes when sufficient batter is on the iron, regardless of whether I finished pouring it or closed the lid. Overflowing channel is easily cleaned.  The separate control for crispness is cool. I especially loved the method of making it non-stick: simply add some water and steam it off instead of spray with oil.The actual waffles baked (4 squares) are crispy at the time cooking is done, and it remained crispy when cold. The reason is the ridges / walls separating the holes are super thin. There is no ""meat!"" The Belgian waffles I'm used to have 1/8"" width between holes and therefore can become soggy if the filling is ""eggy"" or not properly exposed during heat dissipation. The waffles made with this machine are also thinner between the top and bottom side, so they are less ""breaded"" if you will.I personally not too fond of less-meaty waffles, and it turns out my family members are more vocal on this - boths kids and wife. They are used to ""meatier"" waffles like me.

"""The Battle of San Pietro"" (1945) is a compelling documentary that places viewers in the line of fire.  Directed and narrated by John Huston, the 32-minute film remains a groundbreaking study on the humanism of war.  Like the best documentaries, it is a deeply affecting work. An examination of the U.S. foot soldier in combat, ""The Battle of San Pietro"" was filmed in December 1943 during some of the worst fighting of World  War II. The matter-of-fact poignancy of Huston's narration adds a sobering, ironic undercurrent. During his career as a screenwriter and director, Huston excelled in his understanding of the human condition. Nowhere is this quality more evident than in the harrowing chronicle of San Pietro. Even today, much can be learned from Huston's intelligent exploration of the human spirit under fire.

"Paramount's second ""Road"" escapade finds Bob Hope elevated to second billing above Dorothy Lamour while solidifying his lighthearted rapport with Bing Crosby. Slighty overlong, ""Road to Zanzibar"" (1941) is a pleasant jungle romp — mixing sight gags, reflexive one-liners and rather forgettable songs. As a musical-comedy team, Hope and Crosby didn't hit their stride until the following year with the classic ""Road to Morocco.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B6WY91TDXZD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6302510147#wasThisHelpful","R3B6WY91TDXZD2","A1J03J0HZ7KU5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Check and Double Check"" (1930) was the first — and last — ""Amos 'n' Andy"" feature. The novelty value of seeing radio comedians Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll on the big screen made the film a box-office smash. However, the team was dissatisfied with RKO's poor visualization and rejected any cinematic encores. Melville Brown's static direction emphasized the clumsiness of Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby's padded script. Political incorrectness and all, this creaky piece of celluloid holds some historic interest — notably a memorable appearance by Duke Ellington and His Cotton Club Orchestra (with off-camera vocals from Bing Crosby and The Rhythm Boys).","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D8AJHI8KIDVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W90JEQ#wasThisHelpful","R2D8AJHI8KIDVU","A1J03J0HZ7KU5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Columbia squanders the second pairing of Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre on a low-budget ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" knockoff. Largely devoid of humor, ""The Boogie Man Will Get You"" (1942) wears out its welcome at the halfway mark. The claustrophobic wartime farce relies heavily on Karloff and Lorre (who have great rapport) to prop up weak material. In retrospect, the Masters of Menace needed a comedic assist from the Three Stooges.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJZR9308BY014/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009VAH2WO#wasThisHelpful","RJZR9308BY014","A1J03J0HZ7KU5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The bag has a nice amount of space inside - plenty for all of my things, however the bag itself isn't too big for my taste. It's similar in look and feel to a Coach bag I was using last year. This bag, however, is not leather. But the surface seems like it will wipe easily for clean up. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 was that there is a crease in the back of the bag from how it was packed in the box for shipping, and that crease will NOT come out....so I need to be cognizant of which side I have displayed on the outside.

If at any point in time we end up in the car together or somewhere where there's only one charger, we run into a problem. He can only use a micro USB cable and I can only use a regular apple charger for my iPhone.  These cables work very well and the 2in1 feature saves us from arguing and from storing multiple cables in the car. I have not experienced any problems with this cable and it looks very sleek. Overall, I am very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend to give it a try.

"This dress took some time to arrive and when it did, it turned out to be very different from what I expected. First, let me just says that the material is very thick and even though this listing says it's rayon/cotton/spandex blend, it's not. The dress has no label with the materials listed and it feels very rough and synthetic and not pleasant at all. I'm not exactly a pro at telling apart different types of material, but this feels similar to 100% nylon or acrylic.Also, I suspect that the dress in the picture is a completely different product cause even though the product I received is similar in design, it looks nothing like what's in the picture. First, the dress in the picture doesn't look like it has a seam between the torso and the skirt. The skirt part is shorter and not as flowy and the torso part is very strange and doesn't really sit right. The dress in the picture has a pretty deep v shaped neckline that should reveal some cleavage and a long torso that should go down to the hip bone. The dress that I got has a very short torso part which ends at my lower ribs and that's where the skirt starts. The part where my boobs are supposed to be ends up between my boobs and my neck and the waist part of the dress goes over my boobs. The skirt is sectioned and has seams going down which is also not visible on the picture.At first I thought that it might be small on me, but it seems to be just right width wise. The only thing I could come up with is that maybe this dress is made for petite people. I am about 5'5, 185 pounds and a size 14 and I ordered a XXL. The only good thing about this dress is that it's pretty well sewn together and there are no loose threads. To be completely honest, I've seen similar dresses at the local discount store which were better made, out of better materials and for a better price.I received this product as a sample in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VSK0ZG3JFS92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015H3MSS6#wasThisHelpful","R3VSK0ZG3JFS92","A1ESFI5GNCRLZH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ESFI5GNCRLZH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried other similar products in the past and the one major problem I have with all of them is that they are severely uncomfortable and they either fall off or it's impossible to get them off. In most cases you will end up with something poking you or not fitting you right....These wraps are not the most comfortable that I've ever tried, but they're not too bad. I did have to put on high waisted leggings to keep this thing on, but it does stick to your body so if you sleep in it, you won't lose it as you toss and turn. They are pretty soft and stretchy and they do not poke or pinch you anywhere. I applied it to my stomach and was very pleased to see that the patch covered the problem area perfectly and from the first try without having to fiddle around with it. After about 5 minutes I could barely tell that I was wearing it at all.I slept in it for about 8 hours and it stayed on just fine. When it was time, it came off easily and I just rubbed the remaining gel into my skin. I did noticed that my skin felt a little softer and more moisturized and definitely more toned. I will have to use more of these to be able to tell if it has any kind of permanent slimming effect because for now it seems to be temporary. Overall, this seems like a good product and while it doesn't give you very drastic results, it does work.

"I got this product for my mom who uses her laptop a lot throughout the day and takes it to bed with her at night. Her laptop gets really hot at times and she's already burned up a couple previously so this product seemed perfect for her. This product is very quiet and seems to be working really well. This cooling pad is very well made out of good quality materials and very sturdy. It is very slim and not at all bulky. What I liked most is that it's very comfortable to use and has little pop out legs that elevate it if needed and also little pop out pieces on the front that keep your laptop from sliding down. The fans are powerful, but almost silent and provide a lot of air circulation for the laptop. She's been using this pad for a little while and it definitely makes a world of a difference. Her laptop still gets warm, but does not overheat to abnormal temperatures.

"This is a really gorgeous palette that offers a variety of shades, but unfortunately there's only a few of them that I'll personally be able to use cause the colors don't really match my skin tone. This palette is very presentable and would make a fantastic gift and if you don't know hat shade to get, this palette will have a t least one for everybody. The quality of this product is wonderful. It goes on smoothly and evenly and blends really well. What I liked most is that it's not too dry or too greasy and it doesn't feel heavy on my face.

"Very nice box that looks very presentable and is perfect for gifting. There's definitely a lot of nuts in there and they're all really good quality. There is one thing that I would change about this product. There is a section with mixed nuts which is basically a mix of whatever is already in the box, but I would prefer if this section had another type of nuts in it. If you switch out one of the mixed section for hazelnuts, then this tray will have more variety and I'd be that much more likely to buy it. With that said, this tray does offer 5 types of nuts and they're all very tasty. The nuts are not too salty or too blan and fresh. This tray is perfect for snacking and is much healthier than chips or pretzels. Overall, I think this is a wonderful product and there's not a single negative thing I can say about it.

"I've have taken the full bottle of this probiotic and I really like it. I did not have any obvious issues and only took it as a precautionary measure so I can't really comment on how well it fixes a specific problem. I did notice that it helped me with digestion and made me more regular. The pills are on the bigger side, but they're not coated with any junk so they were super easy to swallow. I hate veggie caps and coated pills cause they get stuck in my throat and these tablets did not. I did not experience any side effects or bad reactions and felt great the whole time I took them.

"I was really excited to receive this ashtray cause I've been wanting one for some time now, but I am really disappointed at the quality. The product is really flimsy and cheaply made and while it does work, so would a soda can. First of all, It is slightly smaller than I expected. Second, the lid is hard to open and when you do, it feels like it'll break off. Third, the light is pretty bright, but it flickers unless you position the lid just right and that can be very irritating while driving.

" 2:59 MinsWhen I got this diffuser I could not wait to get it open and see what it was all about. I have had many different kinds of these and love them all for the ability to make my rooms smell great with the aroma of whatever oil I put in them. However none of them had the style this one does! I am keeping this one in my bedroom because it looks just like a perfume bottle! It goes in there with my decor perfect! This would also go perfect in my bathroom. Another thing that I would like to point out is its real glass. The globe portion of the ""bottle"" is frosted glass and heavy. Its going to take quite a bit to knock it over because its stable. It looks like the smoke/steam comes out of the bottle cap. What a neat idea! Another thing that I have never had the option to do before is use a setting that allows me to have it omit scent every 30 seconds. The time settings are also for the normal continuous time of 3 hours but if you pick the setting for every 30 seconds you will get 6 hours time which is double.

"I love this Womans Dual Heart Necklace! I saw this and had to have it! I really like the fact that the manufacturers are coming back out with the option of rose gold in jewelry again. The contrast between the white stones and the rose gold is perfect. The stones are all the way around this heart. Even has two stones side by side at the back where the necklace is strung through right in between. They left no room for error. The stones are side by side, all the same size and are sparkly. The stones are set apart or spaced so close they are almost touching. From a distance you cant see the space between them which means it just looks like shine and sparkle. They are well set with no prongs. The chain is a boxchain and is fluid. It will not kink easily. Boxchains are known to be used for their strength. It has a lobster clasp. One side of the chain at the top makes it easy to put on and take off because the chain is normal link ( an inch or so long ) so its easy to decide where you want to wear it length wise.

"I am always needing some sort of light when I need to work on the car or go in to the attic to get that long lost box of Christmas ornaments but I always come across the same issue. Where can I place my flashlight where I can see where I need to go and not block the light when I find what I'm looking for. Now I have a solution! This headlamp from Capper is just that... A headlamp that you wear on your head. The elastic strap is adjustable and very comfortable. When I got it out of the box I didn't even have to adjust it it just fit. This takes 3 AAA batteries and as its LED it wont eat threw your batteries one after the other. There is even 4 modes to use, bright, medium light, solid red, and blinking red. And to access each one just cycle threw by pressing the easy to find green button. The angle of the light is also adjustable so if you need to see up under a car as you try to pull off the old oil filter you just click it to the proper angle for you and go on your way.

"This will be a life saver for sure and I plan to keep it on me anytime I go camping or hiking. This has a 550 rated paracord that is is tired up in to the wrist band holding everything together. I have heard so many stories about people getting lost while on a hiking trip and some times having something to make noise to attract attention . So to help with that this comes equipped with a whistle, all I have to do is blow and you get a high pitch whistle that can be heard from a long distance. And to help prevent against getting lost in the wild wilderness this has a compass attached. Even better the clip is also a fire striker with a blade on one end and a flint on the other. Keep in mind that the striker does not work very well the first few usages as the paint needs to be scraped off. But after you get the flint cleaned off you get a awesome spark to help ignite your pile of dried leafs and get your kindling going to have a warm fire at night. The blade for the striker can also be used as a small cutting tool if you are in dire needs.

This also helps keep all my cords organized and in one area instead of one or two by my computer another in the bedroom another plugged in behind the couch (which mind you  is not easy to get to). The charger actually charges my devices much faster than being plugged in to my pc and even the wall outlet. This even comes with a stand to keep the charger upright.

" 0:57 MinsI wanted to bring to everyones attention that these are not just for the shower curtain rod. I use them on my patio for my patio curtains. They work for curtain rods too. Typically when you are in Florida and you have a sun-room, lanai, patio or porch. Blinds are used for the huge windows and not curtains. The blinds that came with the house were name brand well made blinds that did not reach the bottom of the window and at night we had no privacy out there with the lights on. So I set out to find blinds that covered the whole window so we had privacy if we wanted it. As I began shopping I saw the prices and the number of windows I needed to cover was going to put me in the custom windows prices. I very quickly decided 2 grand for blinds on my patio was out of the question. So I had to figure something else out. I decided that normal size would work with anything that I am going to do with the windows just as long as I hung them down about a foot from the top of the sills. That way I still have privacy, but not the bid dollar cost of custom window treatments. Which brings me to my next point. I love the sunshine and thats why I have the patio. These tab top curtains not only were murder in trying to open and close them daily, But also took away half the sunshine in the room. I hated that. Knowing that they make my shower curtain almost disappear when I push it to one side of the rod I thought why not use these for my curtains? They solve both problems I had. I am able to push them almost non existent to bring in the sun and they roll on the rod so easy that I can open and close them with ease now. I am so happy with these Outop Heavy Duty Roller Curtain Hooks! I recommend them 100%!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36MEZSMCESZ6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168ZEEBG#wasThisHelpful","R36MEZSMCESZ6J","AWBN5XRG9MKQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBN5XRG9MKQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a new sink that I need to install and needed under sink mounts to be sure I can support my sink with out damaging my counters. I got these as it says I wont need to cut in to my counter tops causing more work and a possibility cracking or damaging the existing counters. Both something I don't want to happen. These did not come with any instructions how ever I think I figured it out. The round parts have holes in them so you can epoxy them to the underside of the counter top. I can let them set about 12 hours and make sure they are completely set. The bracket simply sits on the wing nut when you install the sink. This way you can give your sink the support it needs, the wing nut allows for a perfect adjustment and a snug fit to your counter top and allows for any adjustments you need in the future. And when you are ready to change the sink out you can just take off the wing nuts letting the brackets loose then pull out the old sink to install the new one. I plan to install my sink soon but if anyone has any input or instruction to how these work I am willing to take suggestions. The mounts are very durable and will support any sink I'll ever need to throw at it.

"These are the perfect fit. My waist size is a 34 US size. I got the xxl in hopes they would fit and they do. The fabric they are made out of is super soft and comfortable. I like how long the strings are that are put through the waistband. I tied knots at the end of them but did not need to. They are plenty long enough. I just know that my washing machine eats socks and I did not want it to make one side of the string to end up inside or get pulled out altogether. The length is just right and the pockets on the side give them the 100% harem look for sure. These being in style right now I would actually wear these out and not look like a slob. I think that ""regular"" sweat pants elude to that. They are comfortable too so it does not matter if I am sitting all night like at the movies or standing like at the races, they are in fashion right now.Well made, all the seams match and there are no stray strings needing to be trimmed off. Which means quality right from the store shipped to you. No worries there and I can be confident that in gift giving they will be happy. I wont be embarrassed.

"These are so pretty! I am so happy I got these and can now wear my Fit Bit again. Fit Bit is a great idea but quickly after I got the bracelet I had trouble getting the nubs on the band into the holes. I would literally put my wrist on my desk trying to get them through the holes by applying pressure. I was hurting my wrist so since I could not get the thing on I put it in my jewelry box and forgot about it. I was very disappointed. Its a great concept but If I cant get it off and on then its of no use to me right? Well I am glad I did not throw it away because now I have these that have an actual buckle on it to strap it on and take it off with no pain of the old style. It was easy to put in and take out the unit on the band as well. These are made of durable material that allows the design on it to really have beauty. On the original band the window that allows you to see the information was smoked out. I did not like that either,.This is made with clear window so its so much easier to see my information. There are plenty of choices of size as well. This will fit the smallest wrist and the largest wrist. And I like the tab around the band itself that holds the strap in place once its on my wrist so its not flapping around.

" 2:59 MinsWhen I got this diffuser I could not wait to get it open and see what it was all about. I have had many different kinds of these and love them all for the ability to make my rooms smell great with the aroma of whatever oil I put in them. However none of them had the style this one does! I am keeping this one in my bedroom because it looks just like a perfume bottle! It goes in there with my decor perfect! This would also go perfect in my bathroom. Another thing that I would like to point out is its real glass. The globe portion of the ""bottle"" is frosted glass and heavy. Its going to take quite a bit to knock it over because its stable. It looks like the smoke/steam comes out of the bottle cap. What a neat idea! Another thing that I have never had the option to do before is use a setting that allows me to have it omit scent every 30 seconds. The time settings are also for the normal continuous time of 3 hours but if you pick the setting for every 30 seconds you will get 6 hours time which is double.

"Oh How I do love these Townpeak Space Saver Vacuum Bags! I am now sporting new space in my hallway closet from these. I live in a small home and do not have a garage or basement  for storage so its up to 2 closets and hallway storage for the entire house. I have a guest room so when I have guests here I have a separate set of bathroom towels and bedding with comforter that I need to store for it although its not being used all the time. I now have taken sheets and comforter ( 1 bedding change ) along with 2 extra pillows and have them freshly stored in one of the bags. What used to take up a whole shelf now takes up 3 inches. Also, I took the guest towels and shrunk those to about the same from another shelf. And the last bag I took all the winter throw blankets and space saved those as well. I have 3 times the room now for things sitting out that should be behind closet doors. Made my countertop way less cluttered. Simple to use too, Just get out the vacuum after your satisfied with the things you have in the bag, zip lock it closed , put the vac nozzle on the hole and vac out the air. plug it and your done!

"Love my new necklaces!!! I have needed some with this length for some time now. The chain is just right to fit most of my charms that I have not been able to wear in forever. Jstyle chains are Stainless Steel so I never have to worry about them rusting or needing polish like silver does and I do think that when people wake up about the high cost of gold or silver , the paranoia of it being stolen and out lots of money they will start buying this jewelry for just those benefits alone. This is no maintenance low cost jewelry that looks like you spent more for. Unless you were to tell someone they would never know that the gold chain was not 14k. and the silver chain was not silver that tarnishes. I will never go back to spending tons of my heard earned money on either of them again. This take the worry out of packing it for a trip and when I get to my destination and find the airline baggage guys are greedy and stole it, I wont be out hundreds if not thousands of dollars.

"These gloves are fantastic! Bluesky Dream gloves are extra thick so the heat is not felt as fast as other gloves. I gotta tell you that now that the weather is cooling down outside I am baking much more than I was inside the house that I was in the summer months. I actually can take a pan out of 450 degrees and stand there with it for quite some time before my hand even begins to feel warm through the glove. No way I will ever end up burned that is for sure. I love the fact that they have fingers and its not a mitt. I have total control over the item this way. I can pick up my pie tins with my thumb down in the tin for more stability in taking it out of the oven and then placement on the stovetop or counter. These have  handy tab on the side of both of them so I can hang them were they are easy to get to in my kitchen in case of an emergency. These are also great to use for the BBQ.

"This is a nice headphone set. They plug in to your 3.5mm phone jack on your phone or mp3 player. I like how the around the ear part is adjustable to fit around your ear so you can adjust your comfort anytime you need. Even the extra sizes that come with the earbuds are a nice added touch. These are meant for sports but I find using them in everyday applications is just fine to. The headphones have a built in remote so I can change songs, pause, or even turn the volume up and down while I'm doing any work or exercise. The sound quality is great too and wont blow out your earbuds or for that matter your ears if you turn the volume all the way up.

"When I first decided to get RFID to protect my bank/credit cards I was not sure what I wanted to carry them in. I have a regular wallet that I know degrades due to it being leather every few years and it costs money to buy a new one. Then I came accross this one! My biggest problem now was picking out what color I liked best. Did I want to match my favorite lipstick? Or my handbag? All the colors are vibrant and I know with all of them I will have the protection I need from a thief. So I picked the bright pink one to go with my bling bling brush I carry in my purse. All my cards fit perfect too. I was using an old cigarette pouch I had for easy access but that didnt provide any protection and it was not meant to carry cards anyway. I had to pull the whole stack out and go through them all till I found what I needed. With this I dont need to do that which saves me time because the holder itself has 7 sections in it to keep the cards separated.I can see what one I need without touching the others.

"Other than the fact that this has amazing sun protection of 40 minutes, I love the way it smells. Its white when you put it on so its easy to see where you are not getting it on your skin. Which is important for all over coverage and no sun damage. It goes on smooth and feels just like my other lotions to me. My skin soaks it right in an does not leave me greasy. I have decided since I live in Florida and we need protection all year round I am going to get out of the shower and skip my lotion and go strait to this. This is my new lotion to wear all day every day from now on. I will be protected for 40 minutes when out in the sun lets say going from the store to my car and back again. However, If I am going to go to the beach or the pool I will be re- applying every 40 minutes as this is what is needed to keep being protected from sun burn.

"This is just what the Dr. ordered! The ALEKO 4x 25 Feet Blue Privacy Screen is perfect for my patio that sits on the side of my house. The neighbor is only feet away and its their bedroom window at that. I have some lattice up there now and tried to grow a hearty vine to weave in and out of it for some privacy but 6 years later its just not enough. So I wanted to see if this would do the trick and yes! it does! I like the fact that Its breathable so when the winds are high it will not act like a sail and get ripped from the wind. This also cuts down on the wind on a daily basis from my patio as well. We have open fires back there in a pit and sometimes cook on it and the wind was most times a pain. So not only do I have privacy now but also wind reduction for sitting out there.

"I am elated at how easy this is to use! I can tell you now that this beats the old style that has to go under the tongue. First of all it had to stay under there for a few minutes until the mercury reached the temp and even then had to wait a little longer to know if that was where it was going to stop for a correct read on it. It was kind of a guessing game. This is perfect. It just takes a second and its done. Its digital display on it makes it easy to read not only for the large numbers it shows but also its lit up. There are 2 ways to do it, either on the forehead or in the ear. Its all one unit so all you do is uncap the white cap on it to expose the ear canal mode to take the temp that way. Forehead is easy by pressing number 1 on the thermometer and within seconds have a read on your temperature. Both ways only take seconds.

"Yes! At first I was going to give these 4 stars because they were so hard to unclip the lever that goes through the ear out of the ear ring loop. After I got them on and they were so comfortable I thought about not wanting to loose them. I guarantee these are not going to come unclipped on their own and fall out of your ear to become lost. They have an extremely tight open and close mechanism at the top. Being made out of stainless steel they are not going to rust or pit like real gold or other metals will. If you have allergies these are safe as well. They are shiny and beautiful larger than a quarter dollar hoops. Gold, Rose gold and silver in colors that will match with anything in your wardrobe. These are also easy to pair with other jewelry like rings, bracelets and belts. One of the most important things about jewelry is durability.

I love the size of the mat is really big and sufficiently covers the entire front of the kitty litter box with room left over on both sides.

I love him so much that I will not get rid of him because of his phobia. Instead, I found that he would seek out the same throw rug and poop on it. Daily, I take a plastic garbage bag , turn it inside out and pick it up, tie it and throw it in the garbage. I thought about it and wondered if he would go on this type of mat instead of the throw rug. He did!

"I love this flag pole and it is the first I have ever owned. One of the key features of this pole is that it wont get all tangled up into its self when it gets windy outside. The pole where the flag attaches will roll ensuring that it stays fully extended and not wrapped around the pole. The two rings that come with this and attach the flat to the pole slip over the pole and screw tighten while holding the flag in place. The pole comes in the box in two parts which easily screw together to give you the full length. As you can see from the photos I took the pole works and looks great especially with old glory on the end flying high. In short this pole is hassle free and stress free. Oh and the pole is a 1 inch thickness so be sure you have the right pole mount on your home, rv, or car.

"Another great product by Aukey. I just like most people with their smartphones always have to worry about where I can plug my phone in to before it dies. We are so dependent on them in our daily lives at I have seen friend go in to a panic if their phone dies because they cant connect with their friends. This portable external battery charger is the perfect cure for that battery warning on your phone of 1% charge meeee!. The charger is nice and thin so it will slip in to a bag with out being in the way of anything else that might be in there. The battery is very light and easy to charge and charge your device. Just use the USB charger that comes with your phone and plug it in to the charger then your phone. The battery will start charging immediately. And to charge the battery if you don't have a USB wall charger just plug in to your computer. I take this charger with me everywhere as my phone shows its age when it only holds a charge for half a day. And I like to have my phone charged in case there is an emergency or I just want to watch a video on my lunch.

"Purple hangtag to go with my purple scrubs! Now when going in and out of the Hospital going through the metal detector I wont have to be bothered with the metal from my old hangtag with the metal clips that used to sound off the machine when I walk through it. You see, This hang tag or Wisdompro 2 sided Vertical Style PU Leather ID holder has the ability to be metal free. It does come with the classic metal clips that hooks on yes but its also got the ability which is what I am going to do with it also to remove all the metal and just clip it together with the black plastic clip with the loop string that is provided with this. Its the same type of loop that is used with most cameras for attaching the carry band to the camera. I just removed the metal rings , looped the plastic clip through both loops. One on the leather ID holder and attached it to the ribbon at the bottom that goes around my neck and viola ! No metal to be detected. Because the plastic clip has the ability to be detached I can just hand my ID bottom right to anyone that asks in seconds. I love making life easier.

"This set is very comfortable. The top and bottoms fit perfect. I am short under 5' now due to age shrinkage. I like my pants too long so when I put on shoes the bottoms of them meet the floor from the height of the shoe. These are perfect for normal height people. The shirt fits my shoulders perfect as well. great fit on the body which if things fit me on the shoulders, generally they dont in the body of the shirt. So I end up with too tight and uncomfortable in the body and fitting me on the shoulders or falling off my shoulders to fit me not too tight in the body. Due to this I have to make sure I try things on before I buy them. These coming from the internet and not being able to try them on first, I was not able to know that but was relieved when I put them on and they fit so well. I am sitting at the desk typing this and even sitting now there is not tightness making me uncomfortable at all. I am not a nurse or in the medical field either. I live in Florida and am in shorts all the time. With winter coming I wanted comfortable matching outfits to lounge around the house in and if someone like the mailman came to the door I wouldnt be in my nightgown or pajamas.

"I have always loved bambooware and this just adds to my collection. These are super easy to clean as they come apart completely and can dry in pieces instead of in one piece that could cause bacteria to grow. These will work perfectly for serving my large Greek and Italian salads. You know the ones that have loads of big veggies and feta cheese with great dressings. Yea those are the ones. The forked end will let you dig in to the salad and spooned end will grab and give you better control of what you have pinched between the tongs. Now ideally these are tongs but if you remove the silicone you can use the spoon and spork separately to stir or toss the salad easier. The tongs are light weight and are able to be held nicely with out worry of dropping due to a slick handle, The silicone end acts as added grip for the tongs.

But I often find myself fighting with my pillows to get them in a spot that's comfortable.

"First off, let's dispense with the polite fiction that these are meant for cooking.

"I am not normally one to write reviews like this, but I'm making an exception for this shampoo, for reasons I will explain shortly.  First off, it's great shampoo.  It lathers really well, so you don't have to use that much of it.  It also smells great, without being too perfumy.  And it somehow keeps your hair from getting tangled.  I don't know if they put conditioner in it or what.  All I know is it works.I bought this back around 2007-2008.  I was solo backpacking through Indonesia.  Obviously, I had to travel light, which is why I got the travel size.I was staying mostly in hostels with communal bathrooms, and the Fructis went with me everywhere.  Then, on my last couple days on Wowoni, I must have left it in the bathroom in a hostel.  I don't know the exact day.  But it was almost definitely the second or third to last day of my stay.  It was at one of two hostels-- one was called the Tropical something or other, and the other one I think used to be a banana plantation.By the time I got to Wangiwangi, I couldn't find it, so obviously, I left the Fructis in one of the above-mentioned bathrooms.  It was about half-full.  It also had my name-- RAY-- clearly printed on the bottom.I checked with both of the hostels shortly after returning to the states.  One of them said they didn't have the Fructis (though I'm not totally convinced they knew what I was talking about, due to the language barrier) and the other place straight-up refused to check (wtf?).If anyone picked it up, I would REALLY appreciate its prompt return.  If you used a little bit, that's okay, since I know a lot of people assume the shampoo in those hostels is communal.  But obviously, mine was not communal because it had my name on it.  If it's a lot more than half used, I'm not going to be thrilled.  Not that I'm looking to get anyone in trouble.  I just want my shampoo back.I know it's been a little while.  I meant to post about this earlier, but to be honest, I've got a lot of other stuff going on.  I can't devote my entire life to tracking down this shampoo.  Nor do I think I should have to.  This is pretty cut and dried.To recap:  Fructis, 3.4 oz. bottle, half-used, in a hostel in Indonesia around 2007-08.  Please, leave your information in the comments section.

"Greetings from the South Pole!I am thrilled to be spending the winter here, observing an isolated colony of Emperor penguins from my tiny shelter.  Think of it-- the only human being on this vast, vanishing terrain--just me and the penguins.  I will learn things about their winter behavior patterns that no one has ever known!  Humbling.I was able to recover the supplies from the airlift the other day.  Can't believe that's the last contact I'll have with civilization for three months!  Thanks for all the canned peaches and the brownies.  No doubt they will give me cheer during the long, sunless winter.  Am I crazy to be looking forward to this?BTW, something is wrong with the toothbrush you sent-- it makes an annoying sound when you try to brush with it.  It works, though, so why am I complaining?*****(Week 2)Hi, again.  South Pole here.Boy, they weren't kidding when they said it gets dark down here.  Almost no light at all.I've been studying the penguin colony through infrared goggles.  It seems the females have transferred the eggs to the males, who are huddled around them.  They stand in a big circle, sheltering themselves from the wind.  It's cold as f#$! down here, that's for sure.I finally figured out what was wrong with the toothbrush.  It's apparently ""music"" coming out of the darn thing-- a woman singing what sounds like a nursery rhyme, only more repetitive.  I tried wrapping the handle with gauze to muffle it, but the sound keeps coming out.  The singer refers to herself as ""J.B.""-- remind me not to listen to her when I get back!  Ha ha.Anyway, am continuing to use the toothbrush, as I have been very much enjoying the brownies and canned peaches!  They are keeping my spirits up.  And if I can discover anything to help this penguin colony increase their reproduction rate, it will have all been worth it.*****(Week 3)South Pole here.  The blackness is total now.  The cold, bitter.I can barely make out the penguins, even with the infrared.  They keep their backs to me, as if protecting some dark secret.Have stopped using the toothbrush.  It's not worth it.  Still enjoying brownies and peaches, though.Just ten more weeks to go.*****(Week 4)South Pole.I have a terrible toothache, probably from the brownies and canned peaches.  I tried to start brushing again, though it is terribly difficult.  Even when it is not playing, the song remains in my head for hours-- perhaps days.  No way to tell in this dark hell.  Her voice haunts my dreams.The penguins appear menacing.*****(Week 5)The tooth has gone septic.  The pain is excruciating.I have been forced to use the toothbrush again.  It is my only contact with the human world-- yet the voice seems to not only lack humanity, but to mock it.The ""music"" is insipid to the point of actual cruelty, as if you paired a ringtone of elevator music with a Hallmark card translated from Japanese.  A computer has tried to keep the singer within the proper key, but her horribly reedy, flat and lifeless voice is, if anything, less human than the computer.  It drones on and on like a mockingbird from an apocalypse.I fear for my sanity.*****(Week 6)I have buried the tooshbruth-- is that the right word?  Wait, no, toothbrush.I have buried it, thrown away the brownies and peaches, and will last the winter on penguin meat.  I think this is the right thing to do.*****(Week 7)Penguins running low.  Dug up the toothbrush, and have started listening to it again.  I kind of like it.*****(Week 8)Penguins gone. Have made a coat from their hides.  I am the Penguin Emperor now.Have been listening to the song over and over and over and over.  I will fly to the Land of Summer where the Toothbrush Lady lives.  I love you, J.B.  I la la la la la la la la love you.The time is now.*****(Coda)Capt. Marvin Gillespie's body was recovered 50 yards from his encampment on the Larsen Ice Shelf, his body draped in a horrific moo-moo of penguin pelts, his hands still clutching the toothbrush, which continued to play Justin Bieber's ""Love Me.""

"I just put down Ann's latest manifesto, and I am trembling with a heady mix of rage, indignation, and conservative ire (itself a combination of indignation and rage). Once again, Ann has brewed a steaming cauldron of truth, into which she gleefully tosses socialists, teachers, underly-conservative conservatives, overly-conservative conservatives, bleeding-heart firemen, pre-K freeloaders, race-baiting non-whites, gay supremacists, Santa-bashers, and those most cynical of media-seeking crones--the 9/11 widows.  Reading this stream of semi-consciousness is like listening to the rants of a recent divorcee, or sitting next to a madwoman on a bus-- incisive and hilarious!Here at last is a lawyer willing to stand up to the special interests of lawyers; a pundit who lays bare the vapid gravy train of punditry; a political intellectual who tirelessly attacks the political intellectuals who only know how to attack; a New York media millionaire who isn't afraid to expose the New York media millionaires' hypocrisy. By being the very thing against which she rails, Ann holds up not one but TWO mirrors to the liberals' extremist hellscape, creating an infinite fractal of self-perpetuating hate-thought. What a gift.These meticulously re-published screeds are classic Coulter. Whether she's roasting FDR for his bungling of national security; bravely naming President Clinton's obvious homosexuality; or skewering the Canadians for their disastrous invasion of Vietnam, Ann is always in command of the facts. She practically invents them.Some have questioned how a cocktail-swilling 50-something spinster has become a champion for traditional family values. These are the typical ad hominem attacks spewed by anti-American baby-hating liberal fascists. The only thing keeping Ann from her dream of maternity is the mirthless sarcasm she mistakes for wit, serrated vaginal teeth, and breast milk that is genetically indistinguishable from cobra venom. While these traits have kept her from suckling her own pit of wriggling youngsters, they didn't keep her from serving as wet-nurse to the Cheney family, when a young Liz was angrily demanding the teat.For those brainwashed by the ""facts"" of the liberal lamestream, the America Ann presents will be hardly recognizable. You will probably look back with as much embarrassment as I did at the good will you used to feel toward your fellow Americans, and cringe at the optimism of our shared struggle to create a more perfect union. Was that really me? Yikes!Thanks to Ann, I've learned to mistrust those who I'm told have ideas different from the ones I've been told to have. I turn a deaf ear to those too arrogant to listen to my point of view, and whose minds are filled with a hatred and suspicion that I can hardly comprehend. I imagine the things I would say to these people, had Ann not warned me against talking to them.The left-wing hate machine will never understand the simple but profound beauty of Ann's message, but we on the right know that Ann is a gift, all too fleeting in this world. Souls like hers appear only once in a millennium, if that. Someday, she'll shed her mortal coil, claim her reward and vanish into a warm, glowing hereafter. But until then, she's our own little piece of hell on earth.**********Hey team!  And by team, I'm not including Democrats, who would never play on a team unless it was a team playing against itself because they hate themselves and are totally STUPID and terrorists!  LOL!  Plus they're gay (ske-dooosh!)But seriously.  I took some totes justified heat for not including enough specific facts from Ann's book in my rave review.  It's just that there are so many of them, and unlike Ann, I only have a normal-sized brain (twice as big as a Democrat's, though!  Zing!)Anyway.  So here are a few real parts of history that I learned from reading Ann's AMAZINGLY well-researched, informative book.  Like, remember Republicans' Southern Strategy, where they took advantage of the fact that Johnson had signed the Civil Rights Act to woo angry Southern white voters who didn't want black kids attending their schools, drinking from their fountains, and swimming in their pools?  And how the parties subsequently realigned, and the formerly Democratic South has been solidly Republican ever since, catered to by Republicans through racist dog whistles like ""states' rights""?  Well, neither does Ann!  Cuz it DIDN'T HAPPEN, STUPID!!  Invented by liberal ""historians.""  There is NO RACISM left in the South!  All those people died AGES AGO!!!  Except for racist Democrats, of course.  So why do blacks vote 90% Democratic?  Because they're STUPID, STUPID!!!  They'd have to be-- they're Democrats!!  Snap!Or here's something I learned.  The National Rifle Association was started to protect blacks from Democrats-- and the only reason Democrats want gun control is so that blacks won't be able to protect themselves from racist homicidal Democrats!  That's a fact!  Don't believe it?  Then you're STUPID!!!By the way, the book is full of HILARIOUS slams on blacks and latinos, and how if Ann had her way, we'd only let Europeans into our country.  But that DOESN'T MEAN ANN'S A RACIST.  CUZ THEY'RE JOKES!!!  Get it?  If not, you're a stupid Democrat!  Pow!Oh oh oh, before I forget.  Here's an AWESOME joke from Ann about racism.  She says the O.J. verdict made us even for slavery!!  Isn't that clever???  OMG, I was laughing so hard when I read that!  (It's even funnier the way she tells it-- BUY THE BOOK!!!!)Ann also totally rips the lid off every Democrat's favorite Democrat-- John Edwards! Too soon?  Think again.  This ripped-from-last-decade's-headlines story gets a fresh take from Ann, who thinks he was wrong and dishonest.  Take that, Democrats!  Still want to run him in 2016?  Kaboom!!!And speaking of timely commentary, Ann devotes several chapters to why you should have voted for Romney.  Why are these articles relevant in a book published one year after the election?  BECAUSE SHE TOLD YOU SO, STUPID!!!  What are you, a Democrat?  LMAO!!!!Also, I didn't know until I read this book that Reagan was actually mean, just like Ann-- that's how he destroyed the Soviet Union.  It had nothing to do with a collapsing oil market that drained the coffers of an over-extended and horrifically managed ideological dinosaur, causing it to collapse under the weight of its own stifling oppression.  It was Reagan's mean-face!  And his one-liners!  If you don't know that, you're a STUPID DEMOCRAT!!  Ha ha!!Oh oh oh, another thing.  Ann points out how Occupy Wall Street hooligans were STUPID and smelly and ugly and didn't know what they wanted.  On the other hand, Tea Partiers are super smart and polite and politically astute.  So TRUE!!!!  You never saw shockingly stupid, racist, uninformed people at Tea Party rallies.  NOT ONE!!!!  And if you ever want cogent political analysis and smart, workable solutions to complex political problems, just turn a camera on one of these tri-pointed patriots.  They want the government out of Social Security.  Who doesn't?!  They want their taxes lowered!  And don't tell me taxes under Obama have been lower than they ever were under Reagan.  That's totally missing the point!  The point is that Obama WANTS to raise your taxes!  How do we know?  He's a DEMOCRAT!!!  Read the book, STUPID!!!!This is just the tip of the iceberg-- there are so many amazing facts that you will NEVER hear anywhere else.The dummy Democrats are always trying to put their spin on Ann--as an intellectual snake oil peddler, pandering to the prejudices of a sinking lower middle class; a scorned high school nerd trying to break into the mean-girl crowd three decades too late; or an aging blond barfly, telling off-color jokes for the dwindling attention of the 2 a.m. set.  But that just shows how STUPID you are, Democrats!She's not really blond!!  SKEDOOOSH!!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F6YRJSKPGLA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1621571912#wasThisHelpful","R2F6YRJSKPGLA8","A2Q14JXZX4R807","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q14JXZX4R807?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thank you, Jeanette!  What a lovely sweater.  I haven't worn one like this since George and I were in Ireland, right before Dennis was born.  That was our last trip abroad, wasn't it George?

My goodness, you ARE giving that a good shake, aren't you?  Why don't you open it?  Just open it, Dennis.  All right, don't throw the paper, Dennis.  Watch the elbows--Aunt Jeanette is sitting right next to you.  That's better, okay.  What did Santa bring you?  That's right, it's a Peepee Doll!  Just like the one from the birdyplane.....Because it's what he wanted, George....Well, you're not the one who has to spend 16 hours a day listening to him scream ""Peepee Doll"", are you?....Well, I don't think any of us knows ""how this is going to end"", and you're being needlessly negative.Jeannette, Dennis saw it in SkyMall and became a little obsessed.  And now you have it, don't you, Dennis?  Your very own Peepee Doll.Now let's see what old Kris Kringle brought for Aunt Jeannette... Dennis, what are you doing?  Dennis don't do that.  Not in front of guests, Dennis. Not ever, and especially not in front of guests.  Yes, you have one too.  Now put it away.  Of course yours is bigger-- because that's a doll baby and you're 42.  Put it away, Dennis.  All the way.  Jeannette does not want to see it, Dennis.  Look at her face, look at the cues.  Does she look happy?  I think she looks frightened.  Put it away.  There we go.  Good choice.Okay.  Now let's see what old Kris--Dennis, don't do that.  Don't put those in your mouth.  Those are not for putting in your mouth.  Dennis?  No one cares how many you can put in your mouth, Dennis.  It's not funny.  If you're the only one laughing, it's not funny.  Put them back in the box.  Don't throw those at Aunt Jeanette.  I don't think she's enjoying it.  Dennis, if you can't play nice with the Peepee Doll, Daddy will have to take it away...George, you most certainly WILL get in the middle of this...because you are his father...Dennis, put the penises back in the box.  Dennis!  Do not throw the penises into the fire.  Dennis?  Dennis!  That's it.  That's enough.  George, take the Peepee Doll from Dennis.  Right now.  You just lost the Peepee Doll, Dennis.  No more Peepee Doll for Dennis.  Grab it, George!  Both arms, dear, hold on with both arms.  Let go of it, Dennis.  Let go.  Let go.  Let your father have the Peepee Doll.  Good...okay.  Are we all calm now?  Dennis?  All right, that's good.Now, let's see, what did old--Dennis!  Put down the tree!  Dennis, you put down that Christmas tree this instant!  Put it down!  Don't you even think about putting that in the fire, Dennis.  George!  George, give Dennis back the Peepee Doll!  Put down the tree, Dennis, and Daddy will give you the Peepee Doll.  There we go.  Okay. Let's all take a deep breath.  Everyone just, just take a deep breath and calm down.Well, my goodness.  We've certainly had some excitement, haven't we?  Now, let's see what Kris Kringle--Dennis, don't look at your Aunt Jeanette like that.  Staring is very rude, Dennis.  Dennis, sit down!  No licking, Dennis!  We don't lick our guests!  Don't--Put Jeanette down, Dennis!  Put Aunt Jeanette down this instant!  George, get the shot!  Dennis, no licking!  Get the shot, George! Go limp, Jeanette!  Go limp!  We don't lick guests, Dennis!  George, the neck!  It has to be in the neck!There...there...there he goes.  There goes Dennis.  Okay.  Bedtime for Dennis.  Good night, Dennis.  Okay.  Leave him there, George.  He's perfectly all right.  It's just a mild horse sedative.  He'll be fine a few hours.Well, my goodness.  Is everyone all right?  Jeanette?  Everyone's all right, okay.  Let's just... let's all have a seat.  Scone, Jeanette?  No?  Okay.  Let's all just...stop crying.  George, please stop crying.  There.  There, that's better.Okay.  Now, where were we?  Ah, yes.

"I want to start this off by thanking Kleenex for selling these in 36-packs.  I've put it on subscription, and if they want to start selling a 72-pack, sign me up.  I have three reasons for needing this much Kleenex, and their names are Liam, Samuel and Hank.This is how it goes in this house.  First the Kleenex disappears.  Then the toilet paper.  Then they go for fabrics.  And you don't want it to get there, unless you're ready to invest in a five gallon drum of Fabreeze.This used to be a good Christian home.  But it's not about moral judgment anymore.  I'm way beyond that.  I'm in survival mode.  If I don't supply absorbent paper products, I'm going to find my dish towels hidden in the basement, stiff as aluminum.  The other day, I almost cut my hand on a sock.  I am sorry to speak so frankly, but with three teenage boys, a woman has got to be practical.The funny part is, they think they're being sneaky, with their 45 minute showers and sudden need for ""privacy"", as if I'm going to walk in on them journaling.  They slink around the house like unfixed cats, while I try to announce my location at all times.  No one needs to ask me to knock anymore.  I knock on the walls.  I practically wear a cow bell.  I'm not looking to catch anyone by surprise, believe me.  I'm just trying to get through this.The other day my husband was watching me unload the groceries, and he asks me, all sweetness and light, ""Honey, what're you doing with all that Kleenex?""I about knocked him off his chair.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFWM0CFO0UMWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B9OYLC4#wasThisHelpful","RFWM0CFO0UMWY","A2Q14JXZX4R807","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q14JXZX4R807?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[THIS REVIEW IS SATIRICAL, AND NOT AN ENDORSEMENT OF ACTUAL AXE MURDER.  DON'T DO IT.  IT'S WRONG.]I really like this axe.

"I have purchased these jeans 4 times, the first 3 pairs were purchased at a levis store, and were the exact same jeans, fit, style and everything except that I chose 3 different ""washes"" (colors) and then this one purchased from amazon was the 4th time purchasing these, though it was the same wash as one of the others I had bought before. Now the issue is this: All 4 of these jeans I have purchased have fit and warn very differently from each other. 2 of the 3 I purchased in store this spring were the perfect length (they were all supposed to be 38/29) where the third one dragged on the floor a lot and I had to take it to get hemmed. This pair from amazon was the longest of all 3 and I can fold up a few inches and they still touch the floor. 2 of the previous pairs shunk majorly after the first wash and ended up being like skinny jeans, thile the third and the Amazon pair have stayed loose and baggy, and again the Amazon ones are the most loose and baggy of the 4.I think I may be switching brands as these are just too inconsistent.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O8VFFQJVSO5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OTLTMSW#wasThisHelpful","R2O8VFFQJVSO5B","A2N6MS2FNKU5PS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N6MS2FNKU5PS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had heard a lot of bad things about this from a critic for many of our papers here in town, and also from a local radio station, so I was hesitant to watch it, and my wife had no intention of watching it, but because of the plot and my love for the video games I decided to go ahead and rent it one night and didn't tell my wife what we were watching. We actually both ended up liking it quite a bit. It is not actually directed by Adam Sandler so it doesn't have a lot of his cheesy reoccurring jokes and characters and really he is just quite tamed down in it, so that is good.The plot is a bit weak, and they jump to the thick of it without much build up, but really it was quite a bit of fun, and some good laughs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BS3E25HRU9OK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DWS874#wasThisHelpful","R1BS3E25HRU9OK","A2N6MS2FNKU5PS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N6MS2FNKU5PS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These locks are great! they work amazingly, and even though it is a bit annoying at first to have to grab the magnet every time, and at first we were thinking we might have rather had the latch kind so you don't have to grab a thing any time you want to open something, after you get used to it they are the best. Also they are better than the latch kind because they are so low profile, you cant even tell they are there.The reason I marked down one star is because of how they are may/work/ shaped, there are many drawers (at least in our house) that wouldn't work for them, so we were only able to use them on cupboards. The reason being that the drawers have a ledge piece that meets flush inside of the cabinet when closed and that ledge is right in the middle of where these need to be installed, so there is no way to attach them. Most low end modern cabinetry is built this way, so I think drawers may be a problem for just about anyone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPXHJSC73K91Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S0MVB9E#wasThisHelpful","RPXHJSC73K91Y","A2N6MS2FNKU5PS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N6MS2FNKU5PS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These work very well! They are really good at eliminating the background noise so you don't have creepy/annoying humming all night, I also love that you can turn the screen off and have just sound while you sleep. It also has a function that will alternate between the 2 cameras every few seconds and that is nice.The sound and picture quality is good, but as others mentioned not like full HD like it looks in the picture. This was perfect for us since we have twins, so we can keep one camera on each crib, but you can also still hear both of them in alternating mode since the mic's are so good. The night mode is good to, and you can see the kids very well in the dark.These are ridiculously easy to set up, basically you just turn them all on and they find eachother, I had one time where I had turned one camera off, and it didn't find automatically when I turned it back on, so I just had to push this ""find"" button that is on the front of the camera. Also I found that if both cameras are on first then you turn on the receiver it reconnects everything easies without ever having to use the find/pair button.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33RMU1FBJMTWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXV3A8Q#wasThisHelpful","R33RMU1FBJMTWG","A2N6MS2FNKU5PS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N6MS2FNKU5PS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Using these it is several weeks or at least until it shrinks down all the way that the toilet bowl doesn't get a ring. The main thing I like though is that they have a very strong scent and keep the bathroom smelling like it was just deep cleaned al the time, particularly for the first 2 weeks, and on the first 2 or 3 days you can even smell it when you walk in the house.Others have rated bad because I think they expect the thing to clean the toilet for them but that is not the point.

"I can not for the life of me get or keep these things lit! I've used a couple other brands of lump charcoal and first of all the others had more consistently sized pieces, all a good medium size and this one they are either huge or most of them are very tiny little chips.I have tried several methods including a Weber chimney I have and they will not get hot for me, I once left them in the chimney for over 45 min and kept going out and re-doucing and lighting them and even after that time only a handful in the heart of the chimney were red and the rest were completely cold.I also once started up a bag of the match light briquettes and put some of these mixed in and on top of those and was smoking a shoulder for 8 hours, and as far as I could tell not a single piece of these charcoals started up, and certainly never got white. Once I dumped out the bed, everything was dust except about the same amount of these I put in looked just like they did out of the bag.I purchased this brand because it had by far the best reviews on Amazon, and the brand I normally buy from my hardware store (""cowboy"" I think) were rated poorly, I will be sticking with that other brand from now on as they have always worked well for me, and they also produce a more aromatic burn, almost enough to smoke something without chips.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KLCE9I2IG1DS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LL9CJ4#wasThisHelpful","R3KLCE9I2IG1DS","A2N6MS2FNKU5PS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N6MS2FNKU5PS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This item is basically densely packed cardboard with a textured paper coating. It looks good from several feet away, but looks quite cheap up close, also only one side of the wood/cardboard mixture is covered in the textured wood paper, where the other side of all the pieces is covered with a brownish paper. I purchased this item with confidence because the Amazon reviews were really good, and a lot of people said it was really high quality.I am still on the fence whether the purchase was worth it, but I’m leaning towards no. One huge thins i was upset about was that a couple reviewers specifically mentioned that this item was very easy to set up, holy crap that could not be further from the truth!

I’m not lacking in skill either, i have fully renovated several houses, i could literally build and entire house, but this thing was a pain in the @ss!The instructions were sooooo unclear, they didn’t ever specify which way to face thing, or point out key attributes of a part so you know which way to face it, or what holes to drill it through, for example step 5 was more than 75% of the entire assembly, so all of the small steps to getting the entire thing put together were squashed into one picture with everything stacked on top of each other, and like 3 paragraphs of text above. I got all the way to the end and realized that I had put the whole assembly essentially backwards, so rather than undo everything (which im sure would have also resulted in shredding the cardboard parts to bits) I went ahead and drilled my own holes in a couple of spots.Perhaps my mind was just set with the simplicity of the IKEA instructions, but seriously this was the worst piece of furniture I have ever had to assemble.Honestly the thing has a pretty decent look and feel now that it is all together and in the right place, but I am not at all confident that it will last very long. Another thing I wanted to point out is that the bottom board that makes up the entire bottom shelf is also the same cardboard/particleboard material as described above, though unlike the countertop there is no support that goes across underneath it. They really should have invested in some cross bars, or at least one more cross board to go across the middle underneath, because it is not very strong stuff, and I don’t think I’d be able to store anything on that bottom shelf that weighs more than a couple of pounds.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13OY708XTAQE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMQE2OK#wasThisHelpful","R13OY708XTAQE1","A2N6MS2FNKU5PS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N6MS2FNKU5PS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not a huge fan of the wing sauce, i bought it after doing an online search for a good wing sauce, but really its just like franks red hot mixed with mayo and other seasonings. I have had it just a couple times, it tastes pretty good but i just cant get over the mayo flavor, its just not a good combo in my opinion. I was thinking it was a bit sweeter because some reviewers of the restaurant it comes from said that it is, but i was lookign for something more alon the lines of Wingers Amazin Sauce, cause i cant find that online.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16DTM723YL1SR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001H3RVZ6#wasThisHelpful","R16DTM723YL1SR","A2N6MS2FNKU5PS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N6MS2FNKU5PS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These curtains are awesome! they are thick and high quality, and are just beautiful! I cant believe the quality of item i got for the price i paid, and they were like the only curtains that i could find that came in a set. i actually paid slightly less for these than i did for the cheap, plain, seethrough ones i got from Walmart.

"No kidding, within the first 2 minutes of playing the game, on the first little demo piece where you play a long haired templar, the game was glitchy like nothing ive ever seen. I was runnin into invisible objects, not jumping to obvious objects like the scaffolding out the window, instead i jumped through it and into the water which i could not get out of, all of the walls that appeared to have something to climb on to would not let me climb. then there was a spot in the water where i was walking several inches over the water, but i was finally able to use this to climb a wall. Byut kept getting back into that same water when i would try to jump on to the scaffolding because instead of grabbing the edge i was grabbing the air underneath the middle of the scaffolding! not a great first impression.Other than that and the people who i can run through, or the other charicters are constantly walkign through i havent noticed any other glitches, but i only played for about 20 minutes.The only reason i gave it 2 instead of 1 is because it is very beautiful and the graphics are amazing! I am really just getting tired of the Assassins creed franchise, as they are all basically the same. Black Flag was nice because it added the whole ship battle into it so it was a new and fun!.I really thing that they need to do something totally different with the franchise like either Ninja vs Samurai with a tenchu feel, or like american west. Im sure the game is building up to things like american west and/or present day, but i think they should just skip right forward to refresh things.Those ones could be fun because they are all new settings, eauropeans and people with british accents are just getting old! I think Ninjas would be fun because it is the more sneaky unseen assassin rather than the face head on and fight style. And i think that the american west or present days could be fun because it is a whole new world not only for the franchise, but with the exception of Red Dead, no one has really tapped the potential of a great western game! And something like splinter cell with an assassin twist would be great too!Anyway thats just my pointless rant about the franchise just to say that essentially this game is going back a few installments to the style of the days of Ezio rather than forward to something new. I feel like im playing Revelations again with a bit better graphics.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YHVOYBPSX1Q1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J48MUS4#wasThisHelpful","R2YHVOYBPSX1Q1","A2N6MS2FNKU5PS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N6MS2FNKU5PS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The flavor of this soda is NOTHING like Dr. Pepper! like seriously it is a t otally different drink, and the flavor is no good. Like how the Mr. Pibb is sooooo much sweeter than Dr. Pepper except it at least still tastes like it, this one is like 10 times sweeter than wither and you can just barely tell that it is intended to taste like Dr. Pepper.

"Im having a great time playing this game. I love the story line, which is not to full on itself, and not too packed with useless details, and i really like most of the gameplay. There have been quite a few glitches i have ran into over the last couple of weeks, and the gameplay is basically similar to Assassins creed but not quite are robust, more like the very first assassins creed where you are limited to only climbing certain things, and its not super intuitive. Like you have to always press x (even if you are holding it already) to get on top of a wall or platform, and you often come up to a wall while being chased by a band of Urucks and you don’t naturally jump on to the wall, but have to make a few approaches to actually get the game to realize that you are trying to go up the wall. One other issue is that a lot of the object in the world are ""larger"" than they actually are, meaning that a torch sitting there on the ground takes up much more invisible space than the visible part of the image, this makes for annoying getaways and just moving about as well, i have run myself into an invisible corner more than once in a opening that should be plenty big enough for me and or my Catagor.Other than those few minor glitches, i am really forgiving because i have seriously been addicted to every other aspect of the gameplay. I really like the Saurons Army feature, where your gameplay determines who makes up the army, and no matter how you play it can be all kinds of different outcomes! Most of the combos, and special abilities and Runes aren’t quite as deep, game changing and robust as i would like them to be, but again could be because of the comparison to other games with a similar gameplay and function like Assassins Creed, and Infamous.I really hate move games, especially those that follow the plotline to the ""T"" (Spiderman movie games, Iron Man…) but when a game takes an original spin on an existing universe, this game has made me realize that is Gold! Of course it help that  am a huge Lord of The Rings fan, but that said I did not care much for any previous lord of the rings video game, because the gameplay is unexciting because you already know the outcome. With this game, It basically falls between the events of The Hobbit, and the Trilogy, and though we know what becomes of Sauron and his army, I’m anxious to see how our protagonist plays into the whole picture!This game really makes me with game makers will do similar universe expansions on other epic novels and movies. Much like the force unleashed series, the prospect of some new stories to a universe that I already love is just awesome to me!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXR3X7AL94X49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMFKYK8#wasThisHelpful","RXR3X7AL94X49","A2N6MS2FNKU5PS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N6MS2FNKU5PS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this Drone! i have never had one before, and have been itching to get one for quite some time. After about i month of research and contemplating, I settled on the X5C over the various other options in the category. I used user reviews from Amazon and other sites, YouTube videos and other sources to determine which one i felt was the best bet. It sounds like many in this price category are well matched in flight, and in fact a couple of the YouTube videos I had watched suggested that a WL Toys, and UDI model may possible have better outdoor flight capabilities, but that the X5C was far and away the best camera amongst the competition, and since that was more or less the primary reason i wanted a Drone that was my deciding factor.There was also a few days spent in confusion about the difference between the ""X5C"" and the ""X5C-1"", but after much digging I can say that the key differences are 1: the ""-1"" has a better stabilizer, and is less wobbly in flight, and can hover in place better, and 2: with the X5c""-1"" you can do the 360 flips with the camera mounted on the chopper.I can says for certainty though the description on this item does not specifically specify, that this item is in fact the ""X5C-1"", because of the following performance differences (i can do flips with the camera on) and also because of the box it came in, and a YouTube video i watched showed that the ""X"" and the ""2.4 GHZ"" printed on the copter are in red, where on the other they are in white.I was hoping to get lucky like some other reviewers and receive a bonus third battery, but no such luck! There was one inside of the chopper, and one inside of the box.Even though it was unclear in the description and packing list, i also had a set of spate blades come with mine, and I’m assuming that because of the fact that the packaging has a mold out in the plastic for them that all of this item comes with the extra set of blades.Because of adverse weather i have yet to fly my drone outdoors, but the flights that I have had have been awesome, and I have been able to easily pick up the hang of it, though there is a learning curve, and I still often crash into things, I was also trying to navigate down my spiral staircase last night, and took a massive tumble down the stairs with no damage whatsoever to the drone.I have been able to do successful 360 flips in every direction in just an 8 foot ceiling room without smacking the ceiling or floor with some practice (though I smacked both and other obstacles many times in the process)I really wish that there was some way to pack some more battery life into this thing, because really I cant get enough play time in even with the 2 batteries to really learn some maneuvers and tricks. I did order a pack of 4 of the slightly better batteries, but really 5-10 minutes of flight time is just sad. It makes sense and that is why it did not affect the star rating I gave, but man I wish a new technology could come out that would provide a small drone like this with a half hour or so!Ill say that I am a little afraid to fly the thing outside, and hope that I don’t lose it the first time I try. Someone here in my town had posted to a local forum that they lost their $1200 GoPro mounted drone in a wind burst, and was hoping someone found it, so I am sure that this thing would just be gone baby gone if I’m not careful!This will be a first step for me, and I hope to buy a really nice one in the future once I get the hang of flying this copter, I have decided to use “mode 1” for now, because I thought mode 2 would be better, but after flying it for a while it was less intuitive for me.I would recommend this Drone to anyone looking for a fun beginner Quadcoter, it is a lot of fun, and the camera does a pretty good job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33466WQT0CNGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OGRMU38#wasThisHelpful","R33466WQT0CNGL","A2N6MS2FNKU5PS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N6MS2FNKU5PS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This device is much better than any of the other harmony remotes i have owned! The biggest issue i have had with others is that when you dont touch the remotes with enough delecacy they get reset and then you jsut have to do everything manually. The also always have issues not quite turning on or off all of the devices they are supposed to. With this one, both of those issues are a non-issue because the device itself is stored away in a cabinet, and the RF transmitter can be put anywhere and just bounce the signal around the room until it does what it is supposed to. Furthyermore the ""Basic Remote"" it comes with is super nice and significantly sturdier than other harmony smart models.The reason i only gave it 4 rather than 5 stars is because i basically only use the basic remote because thwe app on the smartphones and iPad are terrible. Not only are their interfaces (i have used it on android, iPhone and iPad) just terribly designed and super un-intuitive to navigate, they also limit many basic functions that even the basic remote as, and the bigges issue is the delay. You swipe up, or tap the button up to move or change the channel and the delay is a good 2 seconds or more!Basically how it works is you can put the ""Smart Hub"" somewhere either out of sight in a cabinet, or you can display it if you want, then you plug in the RF transmitter which is a little dongle on a 6ft cable. I am unsure whether you can use the smarthub without the RF transmitter, and you may be able to if you dont have it in a cabinet, but i do so it doesnt work without the dongle. Then you set up the app on your smart device, which is actually pretty difficult to set up. I did transfer over my activities and info from an old remote, but the setup still has you go through some steps to make sure it is all working properly. Then you can either use your device to make your commands or the remote is comes with. The RF transmitter will bounce the signal around your room so it really doesnt need to be placed very stratigically, but the type of room you are in may affect this. There was one spot i initially placed mine and it would turn on everything but my TV (i really think it was more because my TV has a weak reciever) but then i moved it a few inches and that did the trick, plus everywhere else i messed around with putting it except for the one spot worked fine.Another added bonus is that it has bluetooth, and though it has told me that it doesnt work for the PS4 (Yet?) it does woprk with the PS3, and the one that i was happy about it that it lets you use the keayboard feature for the Apple TV so you dont have to ""type"" with the joystick navigation.I would highly recommend this device to anyone, and though it has a few quirks i think it may be one of the best Harmony devices, plus its a bit cool to show your friends that you can control everything with just your smartphone!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30BL7WUNX6P5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5H1IQM#wasThisHelpful","R30BL7WUNX6P5S","A2N6MS2FNKU5PS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N6MS2FNKU5PS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The device iteslf is pretty good, and the lenses seem to work, though im not too impressed with the macro lense thus far.

"I had mixed feeling about this book. Whilst I did enjoy reading it for the author's good writing skills and well picked stories, the concepts/laws covered are common sense, though common sense is not that common nowadays. In short, if one had already read three or more leadeship books beforehand, please give this a pass.p.s. Below please find some favorite passages of mine for your reference.Balancing optimism and realism, intuition and planning, faith and fact can be very difficult. But that’s what it takes to be effective as a navigating leader. Pg41One measure of leadership is the caliber of people who choose to follow you. – Dennis A. Peer pg81Who you attract is not determined by what you want. It’s determined by who you are. Pg104You cant move people to action unless you first move them with emotion….The heart comes before the head. Pg115It may sound corny, but it’s true. People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care. Pg122You can do what I cannot do. I can do what you cannot do. Together we can do great things. – Mother Teresa pg129To push people down, you have to go down with them. Pg150Great leaders always seem to embody two seemingly disparate qualities. They are both highly visionary and highly practical. Pg158Mission provides purpose. Vision provides a picture. Strategy provides a plan. Why? What? How? Pg159No written word nor spoken plea can teach our youth what they should be. Not all the books on all the shelves. It’s what the teachers are themselves. Pg160A good supervisor is a catalyst, not a drill sergeant. He creates an atmosphere where intelligent people are willing to follow him.

"My review title says it all. In case you want to read advanced knowledge/solution in layman terms on memory loss, depression, overweight, anxiety, personal crises, Alzheimer and so on. This is a great read. For those who expect to read something like a common self help or spirtual book, please give this a pass.p.s. Below please find some favorite passages of mine for your reference.How to be adaptable pg49-Stop repeating what never worked in the first place.-Stand back and ask for a new solution.-Stop struggling at the level of the problem – the answer never lies there.-Work on your own stuckness. Don’t worry about the other person.-When the old stresses are triggered, walk away.-See righteous anger for what it really is – destructive anger dressed up to sound positive.-Rebuild the bonds that have become frayed.-Take on more of the burden than you think you deserve.-Stop attaching so much weight to being right. In the grand scheme of things, being right is insignificant compared with being happy.You are becoming more adaptable when pg51-You can laugh at yourself-You see that there’s more to the situation than you realize-Other people no longer look like antagonists simply because they disagree with you.-Negotiating starts to work, and you genuinely participate in it.-Compromise becomes a positive word-You can hang loose in a state of relaxed alertness-You see things in a way you didn’t before, and this delights you.As the brain shifts, reality follows. Depressed people live not just in a sad world, Sunshine is tinged with gray; colors lack luminosity. But those who have no mood disorder imbue the world with livelier qualities. A stoplight is red because the brain makes it red, although red green color blind people see the same stoplight as gray. Sugar is sweet because the brain makes it sweet…....Facts are personal, in fact. The radical part is that nothing escapes the process of reality making. Every quality in the outside world exists because you create it. Your brain is not the creator but a translational tool. The real creator is mind. Pg60-1It's good to be aware, but self-awareness is even better. “I am angry” gets you only so far if your aim is to control your anger. Knowing where your anger comes from adds the component of self-awareness. It allows you to see a pattern in your behavior. It takes into account that past outbursts haven’t worked out so well. May be a spouse has left you in the past, or someone called the police. Once you bring in self-awareness, reality shifts. You start to take control; the power to change is dawning……Of course, this awareness of being aware is also made possible by the brain……While the brain produces feelings and thoughts that you identify with, super brain calls upon  your ability to be the observer, or witness, who is detached form the thoughts and feelings delivered by the brain.  Pg86When you are aware, you could be anybody. But when you are self-aware, you become unique. I am feeling X turns into What do I think about X? Where is it taking me? What does it mean? Someone who is angry can stop there, with almost no self-awareness.

"Whilst this book is exceptionally informative, I am quite disappointed for two reasons. First, I agree with many reviewers here that a scientific book of this sort should provide ample reference to the theories discussed. Second, rarely a book can be so poorly written that I had to go back and forth within a chapter to make sure I truly understand the core messages. In short, for this may be good for professionals and for those who are used to take notes.

"The author’s previous work ""Reality Check"" enchanted me. This book did not. IMHO, he had tried to satisfy too many different audience in one volume and failed to deliver something insightful and practical which he is capable of. A bit disappointed!p.s. If it were not for the excellent quotes and the following passages, I might have rated it a two star.The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones, which ramify, for those brought up as most of us have been, into every corner of our minds. – John Maynard Keynes pgxviiYou have first to experience what you want to express. – Vincent van Gogh pg1When Karin Muller, filmmaker and author, was in the Peace Corps from 1987  to 1989, she dug wells and built schools in a village in the Philippine. One night, 12 members of the New People’s Army, came to her hut to interrogate her….When the NPA arrived, she exclaimed, “Thank God you’re here. I’ve been waiting all day. Please have some coffee. Leave your guns at the door. “Her reaction baffled the leader of the group, but he took off his gun and sat down for a cup of coffee. She avoided an interrogation or something worse because, according to Muller, “you cant interrogate someone you’re having coffee with.” Muller did not react with anger, indignation or panic (which is how I would have reached). Instead, she touched an emotion in the leader of the group and transformed the situation from brute force and intimidation to conversation and communication. She delighted him wither unexpected hospitality and changed his heart, his mind, and his actions. In short, she enchanted him. Pg1-2Some cause happiness wherever they go; others, whenever they go. – Oscar Wilde pg9Communicate a cause in an “easy to swallow, easy to follow” manner. Pg45There is no abstract art. You must always start with something. Afterward you can remove all traces of reality. – Pablo Picasso pg55Explaining your cause in terms of something familiar (anchoring) but then giving it a different meaning (twist). This is a favorite technique of movie producers and book authors: “It’s like Dirty Harry but set in the year 2100” or “it’s How to win friends and influence people brought up to date. “ pg59“Priming the pump”, a research by University of Leicester – The market sold forty bottles of French wine and eight bottles of German wine to French music. With German background music, it sold twenty two bottles of German wine and twelve bottles of French wine. The researchers interpreted these results to mean that music can “prime related knowledge and the selection of certain causes if they fit with that knowledge.“ Pg61To fly we have to have resistance. – Maya Lin pg70Diplomacy is the art of letting somebody have your way. – Daniele Vare pg81Richard Branson polishes my shoe and makes me a Virgin America customer for life. pg102The function of muscle is to pull and not to push, except in the case of the genitals and the tongue. – Leonardo da Vinci pg135So much of what we call management consists in making it difficult for people to work. – Peter Drucker pg154Priority is a function of context. – Stephen Covey pg166The plural of anecdote is not data. – Ben Gold acre pg177","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HK8TULV3BVYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591845831#wasThisHelpful","R2HK8TULV3BVYU","A16IITISD2LAX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16IITISD2LAX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this up because I wanted to know what the 0.5 strength of the ""12.5 Strengths"" in the subtitle is. Quite disappointing, it's only a gimmick of the author who simply named every last point x of his dos and donts as point x.5. Even worse, I found the ideas quite repetitive around page 50 and I had tried really hard to finish the whole book. In short, not recommended! For those who aspire to sharpen their leadership skills, ""The Leader's Guide to Speaking with Presence: How to Project Confidence, Conviction, and Authority by John Baldoni"" would be a more suitable choice.p.s.

"My review title says it all. It's been a long time that I could enjoy a fluently written and productive communication book like this. In short, recommended!p.s. Below please find some favorite passages of mine for your reference.There is never enough time to do everything, but there is always enough time to do the most important thing. – Brian Tracy pg3Great minds have purposes, others have wishes. – Washington Irving pg23It’s not a conversation if only one person is talking. – Charles Schwab pg31In the 20 minutes leader time frame, you would:- Expectations and importance 1-3 min. Questioning and listening 4-10 min.

Pg401. Identify. Why are we having this conversation? For coaching, we want to identify the issues and barriers to the desired performance or improved performance.2. Involve. How can we seek improvement and solutions together?3. Initiate. What are the action steps to take next? What is our agreement to change?Nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing. – Ralph Waldo Emerson pg51No organization action has more power for motivating employee behavior change than feedback from credible work associates. – Mark Edwards pg72Distinguish between the person and the behavior and the performance. – Stephen Covey pg78Try again. Fail again. Fail better. – Samuel Beckett pg81In our research, when we ask managers what they think motivates their employees, they say the following two things, in this order: First 88% say its money. Second 67% say it’s promotion. When we ask employees what motivates them, however, they say that two things, primarily, motivate them – in this order: First, 76% say it’s interesting and meaningful work. Second, 72% say it’s new learning and professional growth. Pg91Never let vanilla be your “Flavor of the Month” pg116You can be totally rational with a machine, but, if you work with people, sometimes logic has to take a backseat to understanding. – Akio Morita pg126Practice “Active Patience”.

"History is full of human foolishness, or evilness, to be exact. In this well written and researched book with a wide variety of of ""cases"", the author had vividly depicted how humans had played ""The Blame Game"" so well, to the detriment, and even dealth, of a vast number of innocent. History will repeat itself, for sure. Yet, I think reading this book will still lower our chance to become a scapegoat, or make somebody else one. In short, recommended!p.s. Below please find some favorite passages of mine for your reference.In the days before the Normandy Invasion, General Eisenhower prepared a short speech acccepting all blame in the event of failure. A readiness to admit to mistakes may not win the battle, but it can help win the war. pg21Robert Anton Wilson wrote of the Howard Hughes syndrome, where everybody lies to the man in power, some to gain favour, others to escape punishment. The result is that the person at the top feeds on ""flattering and decpetive garbage"" and gets a very warped views of how things really stand. Few people in that situation are likely to accept anything other than praise. pg48Nothing has paralyzed intelligence more than the search for scapegoats. - Theordore Zeldin, An Intimate History of Humanity pg181Scapegoating doesnt work. All too often it covers up the problem, rather than solving it; it focuses on rotten apples when really it is the barrel that is disintegrating around them, and it results in an incredibly harsh treatment of a minority. The most it can ever achieve is a temporary lessening of the problem, but the real roots remain. pg187","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAINZLG34KW0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590207165#wasThisHelpful","RAINZLG34KW0O","A16IITISD2LAX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16IITISD2LAX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My appreciation of this book is beyond words. In short, a must for any businessman. Highly recommended!p.s. Below please find some favorite passages of mine for your reference.Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren’t learning from them……..Today’s best practices lead to dead ends; the best paths are new and untried. Pg1Whenever I interview someone for a job, I like to ask this question: “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”….Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius. Pg5Madness is rare in individuals- but in groups, parties, nations and ages it is the rule. Nietzsche wrote (before he went mad) pg12The entrepreneurs who stuck with Silicon Valley learned four big lessons from the dot com crash that still guide business thinking today. 1. Make incremental advances 2. Stay lean and flexible 3. Improve on the competition 4. Focus on product, not sales. These lessons have become dogma in the startup world; And yet the opposite principles are probably more correct: 1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality 2. A bad plan is better than no plan 3. Competitive markets destroy profits 4. Sales matters just as much as product pg20-21Google’s motto –“Don’t be evil! – is in part a branding ploy, but it’s characteristics of a kind of business that’s successful enough to take ethics seriously without jeopardizing its own existence. In business, money is either an important thing or everything. Pg31Tolstoy opens Anna Karenina by observing: “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Business is the opposite. All happy companies are different; each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same; they failed to escape competition. Pg34Rivalry causes us to overemphasize old opportunities and slavishly copy what has worked in the past. Pg39If you focus on near term growth above all else, you miss the most important question you should be asking: will this business still be around a decade from now? Numbers alone won’t tell you the answer; instead you must think critically about the qualitative characteristics of your business. Pg47Disruption has recently transmogrified into a self-congratulatory buzzword for anything posing as trending and new. This seemingly trivial fad mattes because it distorts an entrepreneur’s self-understanding in an inherently competitive way. The concept was coined to describe threats to incumbent companies, so startups’ obsession with disruption means they see themselves through older firms’ eyes. If you think of yourself as an insurgent battling darks forces, it’s easy to become unduly fixated on the obstacles in your path. If you truly want to make something new, the act of creation is far more important than the old industries that might not like what you create. Pg56You must study the endgame before anything else. – Chess Grandmaster Jose Raul Capablanca pg58Malcolm Gladwell declares in Outliners that success results from a “patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages. “Warren Buffet famously considers himself a “member of the lucky sperm club” and a winner of the “ovarian lottery”. Jeff Bezos attributes Amazon’s success to an “incredible planetary alignment” and jokes that it was “half luck, half good timing, and the rest brains.” Bill Gates even goes so far as to claim that he ”was lucky to be born with certain skills,” though it’s not clear whether that’s actually possible. Perhaps these guys are being strategically humble. However, the phenomenon of serial entrepreneurship would seem to call into question our tendency to explain success as the product of chance……A definite view, by contrast, favors firm conviction. Instead of pursuing many sided mediocrity and call it “well roundedness”, a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it. Instead of working tirelessly to make herself indistinguishable, she strives to be great at something substantive – to be a monopoly of one. Pg61-2“Thiel’s law”: a startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed. Pg107The best thing I did as a manager at PayPal was to make every person in the company responsible for doing just one thing. Every employee’s one thing was unique, and everyone knew I would evaluate him only on that one thing. I had started doing this just to simplify the task of managing people. But then I noticed a deeper result; defining roles reduced conflict.

"A well written and helpful book. It did correct a lot of misperception of mine about how people lie. If the authors had covered a wider range of lie detection techniques and case studies beyond the present ones so criminals and politicians related, even better, although the authors had compensated so with several lists of questions in the appendix targeting at children and spouses!p.s. Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.Advances are made by answering questions. Discoveries are made by questioning answers. - Bernard Haisch pg27A polygraph machine doesn't detect lies. It detects physiological changes that occur in a person's body in response to a stimulus.....The pens on a polygraph chart record four physiological responses to the stimulus. There are two respiratory tracings, one cardiovascular activity tracing, an don galvanic skin response tracing, which records changes in skin moisture. The polygraph examiner will make precise annotations on the chart to indicate the points at which he begins and finishes asking a question, and the point at which the examinee provides his ""yes"" or ""no"" response. Pg29Human beings tend to be either visually dominant or auditorily dominant....deceptive behavior can come in either or both forms. How do we capture both at the same time? The trick is to train our brains to go into what we call ""L-squared mode"" - we have to tell it to look and listen simultaneously. We have to say, ""Brain, for the next few seconds, you're going to process in both the visual and auditory channels what's being communicated to me."" Pg32A catch all question: ""What haven't I asked you that you think I should know about that might be a concern?""  pg36A deceptive person may respond to an allegation with a truthful statement, often one that casts himself in a highly favorable light. It's what we call a ""convince vs. convey"" situation - an attempt to convince the accuser of one's uprightness, of being the type of person who would never do anything like what he's been accused of doing, rather than to convey information that addresses the facts of the case. Pg45If you want to know if someone is lying, you need to ignore truthful behavior so that it's not processed. That seems counterintuitive to most people, and downright nonsensical to many. Yet it's one of the core principles. Pg48The way to combat convincing statement is to neutralize them - to render them ineffective by acknowledging or agreeing with them. This, of course, needs to be distinguished from agreeing with the action. Pg75A deceptive person will often hide her mouth or eyes when she's being untruthful....We are not referring to blinking here. Pg97If a person clears his throat or performs a significant swallow prior to answering the question, that's a potential problem. If he does  it after he answers, that doesn't bother us. Pg98When you're in L-squared mode, be on the lookout for anything a person does with his face or in the head region in response to your question. This often takes the form of biting or licking the lips, or pulling on the lips or ears....Beyond these physiological reactions, the body also dissipates their anxiety through other forms of physical activity, most notably ""anchor-point"" movements.  Pg98A deceptive person might adjust his tie or shirt cuffs, or maybe his glasses. An untruthful woman might move a few strands of hair behind here ear, or straighten her skirt. Pg101Present a clear stimulus: Keep it short. Keep it simple. Keep it singular in meaning. Keep it straight forward. ""What else?"" pg127-131People standing in line to use a photocopier were approached by individuals with request to butt in line. If the person making the request gave the reason that he was in a rush, he was successful 94% of the time. If no reason was given, the success rate dropped to 60%. What was remarkable is that when a person gave a reason that was essentially meaningless - ""because I have to make some copies"" - the success rate jumped back to 93%. So people respond to legitimacy statements, even if those statements lack a great deal of substance. Pg143The last piece of information the person gave you is likely to be the most serious piece, the one he was most reluctant to share. The bottom line is that you don't accept the first thing someone tells you. It's almost as if you didn't hear it. Pg148","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA8OSI5TB9ZSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250029627#wasThisHelpful","RA8OSI5TB9ZSV","A16IITISD2LAX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16IITISD2LAX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My review title says it all! Nevertheless, I still have two negative remarks about it. First, the second half of it is not as captivating as the first, which explains why I rate it a four stars instead of five. Second, ""How come I read it so late!?""p.s. Below please find some favorite passages of mine for your reference.Any man who can drive safely while kissing a pretty girl is simply not giving the kiss the attention it deserves. - Albert Einstein pg15When a player comes to recognize that learning to focus may be more valuable to him than a backhand, he shifts from being primarily a player of the outer game to being a player of the inner game. Then, instead of learning to focus to improve his tennis, he practices tennis to improve his focus. - W. Timothy Gallwey pg28According to Pavlov, when something occurs that is novel to an organism, it stops what it's doing and turns its sensors to the source of stimulation. In humans, the orienting response OR includes pupil dilation, reduce skin resistance, and a momentary drop in heart rate. In other words, our eyes open wised, our skin is more sensitive, and we feel attracted to the novelty. The body wants to receive the novel stimulus and take it in to be processed further. Pavlov called this survival response the ""What is it?"" reflex. Pg40Too much information and too many interruptions deplete brain chemicals that take time and rest to replenish.....Your brain tries to conserve energy by slowing down thought processing and decision making. Sometimes, a circuit breaker trips and temporarily shuts those circuits completely; you can no longer focus or make even one more decision. Or you might blow a fuse and lose your temper. In any event, you're far from being in your focus zone where your attention is at its best. Pg44Attention shapes the brain from the very start. A human infant is born with 200 billion neurons - twice the number she will have as an adult - and immediately starts to lose the neurons she doesn't use. Remarkable as it seems, at birth every infant can clearly distinguish every phoneme of every language. Then, as infants hear only the sounds of their own native tongue, they lose the ability to process the sounds they don't need. This early natural trimming of unused neurons is called pruning. Throughout the life span, ""use it or lose it"" remain true for synapses, pathways, and even entire regions of the brain. When blind people learn braille, the brain region that corresponds to their fingertips gets larger and takes over parts of the brain that would have been used for vision......Like muscles, thinking skills strengthen with exercise and weaken without it. Pg52An ancient Buddhist psychology, abhidhamma, teaches that thoughts and feelings are transitory. By calmly observing their rise and fall, appearance and disappearance, you strengthen your sense of distance and detachment from them. This practice of mindfulness has become a basis for schools of both meditation and therapy today. Instead of reacting to thoughts and feelings instantly and automatically, you see them as events of the mind to notice and consider. You are ""awake in the moment."" Your observer self is mindfulness in action. Freud described it as an ""evenly hovering attention"" and his students named it the ""observing ego."" Others call it the ""impartial spectator,"" ""witness self,"" ""detached onlooker,"" ""neutral bystander,"" and ""voice of objectivity."" ""Your observer self accepts ""what is"" without judgment or editorial comment. It is a reliable, rational crewmate - like Spock or Data of the Starship Enterprise - an emotionally detached voice of friendly awareness. Pg63The questions that conquer avoidance: Relentlessly ask yourself - What am I not doing now? What don't I want to face? Pg70We must constantly build dikes of courage to hold back the flood of fear - Martin Luther King Jr. pg88To improve their skills, world class athletes correct their past mistake mentally and physically......in his mind he returned to that critical moment many times and practiced what it would have felt like to have made the shot.....He also imagined his emotional self in a relaxed alert state. He visualized staying in his focus zone and withstanding the pressure of the match. He saw himself made the shot, and he made this vision even stronger than his memory of having missed it. Pg98When asked what book he would choose if he were shipwrecked on a desert island: A practical guide to boat building. - Bernard Baruch pg141When you mentally rehearse, it's helpful to use a keyword or symbol to connect yourself back to your rehearsal.

Then, on that day, when you say the word ""confident,"" you'll connect back to the confidence you felt when you rehearsed.

"My review title says it all. The authors had filled the book with plenty of good examples and practical questions that even the most pragmatic executives will find itt helpful. Recommended!p.s. Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.The lack of empirical data behind many business ""cure-alls"" has prompted one Oxford don to proclaim management science a ""phony academic subject, a shallow contemporary shibboleth promoting noxious cant. Pg11Alexander the Great ruled the largest area of the earth ever conquered by a single individual, stretching from Mount Olympus to Mount Everest. Although not everyone's idea of the model CEO, he amassed his kingdom in less than four years, covering more than four thousand miles by foot, and winning 100 percent of his battles - a remarkable record in such a short time. But did he create lasting value? Just a few years after his death, his empire had dissolved and the captured territory slipped away. Alexander's problem was not inadequate initial resources or poor execution. It was the lack of a long term strategy and the inability to exploit and consolidate his extraordinary short term gains throughout the Near East to Nepal, which stretched resources to govern too far beyond the Macedonian core. His sticking point - the failure to anchor in the core business (in his case, governance) and consolidate a rapid expansion - exemplifies the most common problem across all growth strategy. Pg63-4The ten questions that we believe management teams should periodically ask themselves about their companies and should include at the start of every review of their basic growth strategy. Pg149-501. What is the most tightly defined profitable core of our business, and is it gaining or losing strength?2. What defines the boundaries of the business that we are competing for, and where are those boundaries going to shift in the future?3. Are there new competitors currently at the fringe of our business that pose potential longer term threats to the core?4. Are we certain that we are achieving the full strategic and operating potential of our core business, the ""hidden value: of the core?5. What is the full set of potential adjacencies to our core business and possible adjacency moves (single or multiple moves)? Are we looking at these in a planned, logical sequence or piecemeal?6. What is our point of view on the future of the industry? As a team, do we have consensus? How is this point of view shaping our adjacency strategy and point of arrival?7. Should major new growth initiatives be pursued inside, next to, or outside the core? How should we decide?8. Is industry turbulence changing the fundamental source of future competitive advantage? How? Through new models? New segments? New competitors? And what are we monitoring on a regular basis?9. Are organizational enablers and inhibitors to growth in the right balance for the needed change?10. What are the guiding strategic principles that should apply consistently to all of our major strategic and operating decisions?","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6687XNKRUWQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1422131114#wasThisHelpful","R6687XNKRUWQC","A16IITISD2LAX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16IITISD2LAX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book addressed to three questions: Is God unfair? Is God silent? Is God hidden? Definitely the author had done an excellent job to provide the most plausible answers. Yet, my prior reading of ""Where is God when it hurts?"" and ""What's so amazing about grace?"" had lowered my satisfaction whereas the former had opened my eyes to similar concepts of this book and the latter had consummated them. IMHO, for those who had no prior experience with the author's great works, ""What's so amazing about grace?"" is a superb start (and the author at his best), followed by ""Where is God when it hurts?"", ""The Jesus I never knew"", ""The Bible Jesus read"" and ""Soul Survivor"" rather than this. For fans of the author, should I say anything at all?p.s. Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.But did a clear word from God increase the likelihood of obedience?.....The Israelites marched when they were told to sit tight, fled in fear when told to march, fought when told to declare peace, declared peace when told to fight. They made a national pastime out of inventing ways to break the 613 commands. Clear guidance became as much of an affront to that generation as unclear guidance is to ours. Pg41Exodus and Numbers taught me that quick solutions to those three questions may not solve the underlying problems of disappointment with God. The Israelites, though exposed to the bright, unshaded light of God's presence, were as fickle a people as have ever lived. Ten different times on the melancholy pathless plains of the Sinai they rose up against God. Pg44The response of the Israelites to such direct intervention offers an important insight into the inherent limits of all power. Power can do everything but the most important thing: it cannot control love. Pg71God's problem is not that God is not able to do certain things. God's problem is that God loves. Love complicates the life of God as it complicates every life. - Douglas John Hall pg72Dorothy Sayers has said that God underwent three great humiliations in his efforts to rescue the human race. The first was the Incarnation, when he took on the confines of a physical body. The second was the Cross, when he suffered the ignominy of public execution. The third is the church. In an awesome act of self-denial, God entrusted his reputation to ordinary people. Pg164If we develop a relationship with God apart from our life circumstance, then we may be able to hang on when the physical reality breaks down. We can trust God despite all the unfairness of life. Isn't that really the main point of Job?.....Was life fair to Jesus? The cross demolished for all time the basic assumption that life will be fair. Pg214And here is where the ""higher"" view of eternity defies our normal understanding of time. Imagine, if you will, a very large Being exists simultaneously on earth and in the space occupied by Supernova 1987A. In 1987, what time was it for that Being? It depends on the perspective. From the perspective of earth, the Being would have ""observed"" 1987 history, which included the discovery of Supernova 1987A. But from the perspective of Supernova 1987A, the Being would have experienced what the earth will not know about for another 170,000 years!....such a Being, big as the universe, could, from some lookout post, see what is happening  anywhere in the universe at any given time.

"This is by no means an ordinary marketing book. I do agree with many reviewers that the concept of the 7 triggers, including Lust, Mystique, Alarm, Prestige, Power, Vice and Trust is nothing new. However, I am obliged to praise the author for his superb writing skill and unique insights that I, a real bookworm, still got fascinated. In short, a must read for any marketeer! Highly recommended!p.s. Below please find some favorite passages of mine for your reference.Fascination is a visceral and primal decision making process, one that's largely involuntary. Fisher says that our brains are literally ""built to fall in love"" because it's in our evolutionary best interest not to think clearly during the two year time period it takes to meet, court, and produce a child, or else we might come to our senses and avoid the inconvenience of child rearing altogether. Tallis agrees, proposing that evolution has hardwired us for psychopathological romantic obsessions that last ""just long enough to ensure the survival of genes from one generation to the next."" Pg7Anthropomorphization - ascribing human characteristics to nonhuman things - is a common way to create bonds. The more something resembles a human face, the more emotional attachment we feel for it. Pg22From an anthropological perspective, you're not smiling in order to look friendly. In the phone call, you're using your smile for its original, intended purpose: to sound friendly. Pg30The Gold Hallmarks of a Fascinating Message:-- Provokes strong and immediate emotional reactions- Create advocates- Becomes ""Cultural Shorthand"" for a specific set of actions or values- Incites conversation- Force competitors to realign around it- Triggers social revolutionsDo you lead? Only if you are able to fascinate others to follow you and your vision. Because, as Peter Drucker said, ""The only definition of a leader is someone who has followers."" Pg59As a motivator, desire is more powerful than fulfillment. Pg81The Journal of Consumer Research reports that the image of a woman in a bikini will not only increase a man's sexual stimulation, but will also increase his likelihood of indulgent decision making. The authors continue, ""It seems that sexual appetite causes a greater urgency to consume anything rewarding. Merely holding a lacy bra made the men more likely to seek immediate rewards such as an indulgent dessert, or spending a greater amount of money. The appetites appear to become intertwined in the brain. As the brain opens to possibilities, the wallet opens as well. Pg82Eye catching enough to get noticed, yet complex enough to stay interesting. Revealing enough to pique curiosity, yet shadowy enough to prompt questions. Mystique flirts with us, provoking our imagination, hinting at the possibilities, inviting us to move closer while eluding our grasp. It doles out information, without ever actually giving anything away. Like the lust trigger, this trigger is rooted in unfulfillment. The magic trick ends if you find out how the white rabbit appears from the black hat. Pg87Teenage drivers aren't as alarmed by the graphic threat of drunk driving, thanks to an adolescent sense of immortality.....The headline reads: ""If the thought of losing your life doesn't keep you from drinking and driving, imagine losing your license."" In the photo, the boy is being chauffeured to prom....by Mommy.  Pg101Just as they paid absurd prices for tulips 375 years ago, today people pay absurd prices for logos. Prestige emblems can cost a few billion dollars, but usually have little or no intrinsic value.....Emblems fulfill a deep, intrinsic need because they say something about us. Maslow calls this esteem: the need to feel important, respected, and recognized as an achiever.....As a brand, the care is less of a ""car"", and more a statement of membership in an elite. Pg121People will stare. Make it worth their while. RSVP your regrets to the ordinary. Watch the women watching the men watching you. - Harry Winston ad. Pg127People inherently compete within their peer group. Every product has the potential to become a prestige emblem. If that emblem sets a new standard, people work harder to achieve it. The value of that emblem isn't about the utility, so the cost of the item often doesn't matter, but rather, the signal of achievement it sends to others....Within your company, in the office, the same principle applies. If a manager can create an environment in which people compare themselves to one another, they often naturally seek to achieve just slightly more than those around them. Pg128When people are no longer in charge of basic of basic elements of a situation (such as where they sit, or when they go to the restroom), they must give over some degree of control that they normally use to define their independence, and thus themselves. Many researchers have proven that once people have agreed to let go of small details, they become more willing to submit to the more significant changes. By gradually releasing self-control, they open themselves up to more significant changes, and to the leader. The leader's message sinks in far more deeply, ""destabilizing"" an individual, and shedding his natural resistance. This destabilization, according to experts, makes people more open to new interpretations. It's how brainwashing works, how boot camp works, and to a greater or lesser degree, it's how most immersive learning works. Often, immersive learning begins small, with seemingly insignificant details of environment. Pg144Vice includes everything you want to do, and know you shouldn't do, but still just might do. Pg151Ask yourself:Do you represent such a distinct point of view that you can stand as a symbol for certain values?What's the one essential quality without which your brand would not survive?How do customers use your product or message to tell the world about themselves and their point of view?What opportunities do you create for people to connect with one another?How can you set your competitors on the defensive?How can your message capitalize on emerging changes?What groups, communities, and tribes could your message excite and activate, so that they champion your message as part of their own?","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4PA45PMJRG6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061714704#wasThisHelpful","R4PA45PMJRG6S","A16IITISD2LAX0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16IITISD2LAX0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

(Affect Heuristics) Ch25You excuse your failure and see yourself as more successful, more intelligent, and more skilled than you are. (Self-Serving Bias) Ch28People devote little attention to you unless prompted to.

(Conformity) Ch33Any time you quit something cold turkey, your brain will make a last ditch effort to return you to your habit. (Extinction Burst) Ch34Your first perception lingers in your mind, affecting later perceptions and decisions. (Anchoring Effect) Ch39Unless you consciously keep tabs on your progress, you assume the way you feel now is the way you have always felt.

"I had read a lot of self help books. Normally it takes me less than three days to finish one. Surprisingly, I had spent nearly two weeks on this, not for my lack of time, but my determination to devour the juicy writing and knowledge in nearly every page of it. Succinct, fascinating and insightful! Highly recommended!p.s. Below please find some favorite passages of mine for your reference.Begin taking action now, while being neurotic or imperfect or a procrastinator or unhealthy or lazy or any other label by which you inaccurately describe yourself. Go ahead and be the best imperfect person you can be, and get started on those things you want to accomplish before you die. - Shoma Morita pg14We're better in connection than in isolation. This works with worry, as with any area of life. If you're in a big room, alone in the dark, you feel frightened. If you're with someone else, you laugh. Pg34Cultivate your capacity to pay attention - to not let life go by in a distracted blur - and time expands.....The mental faculties ..... do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change - not rest, except in sleep. Pg44Take a few deep breaths and notice your mood. Then pull your lips into an exaggerated smile and hold it for three or four seconds. You should notice an elevation in your mood. Pg51We're assailed by lifestyle suggestions promising stress reduction: blissful holidays, say, or downshifting to the country. But if you're using them to avoid things that trigger your negative responses, mightn't it be wiser to work on your responses instead? Pg52Survivors are those who think they have some control over external circumstances, and who see how even a negative experience might lead to growth. Overconfident people, who overestimate their powers, do particularly well. Pg53If you're worried that your boss is displeased with your work, that your child...., or your so called friends are sneering at you behind your back, be reassured. It's not that these people are thinking wonderful thoughts about you - they're just not think about you at all. (Partly, no doubt, because they're too busy worrying about what others are thinking about them.) pg83He that has done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged. The Ben Franklin Effect works because we hate cognitive dissonance. pg85Stand out from the crowd, but not too much. Pg88A less well known but equally spot on dictum, also outlined in his book Parkinson's Law, is the Law of Triviality, which he illustrates with an imaginary tale in which a firm's executives meet to discuss two new projects: an atomic reactor and a company bike shed. The reactor is complex and bewilderingly expensive, and non -experts risk embarrassment if they speak up, so it gets approved in two and a half minutes. But everyone knows about bikes and bike sheds, and everyone has an opinion. The bike shed, Parkinson writes, will be debated for an hour and a quarter, then deferred for decision to the next meeting, pending the gathering of more information. Pg98-9I've spent many hours procrastinating by reading books and websites on combating procrastination - with the handy side effect that I can summarize here what I reckon are the only three genuinely useful pieces of advice they contain: 1. Motivation follows action 2. Resistance is a signpost (that it's meaningful) 3. Schedule leisure, not work pg116Time passes more slowly when we have to absorb more information. That would explain why it seems to take longer to get to a new destination than to return from it, and why a holiday seems longer than a week in the office. One obvious solution, therefore, is to seek newness, to break your routines. People who go on adventurous trips report longer seeming holidays than those who choose the regularity and inactivity of a week on a beach. Hang on, though: isn't time meant to fly when you're enjoying yourself? Yes, but there's a confusion here, between the perception of time as we recall it in memory versus the experience of the moment itself. We don't usually want the hours to feel as if they're passing slowly; that's boredom. Pg147If you're eating burgers and ice cream to feel comforted, relaxed and happy, trying to replace them with broccoli and carrot juice is like dealing with a leaky bathroom tap by repainting the kitchen. What's required isn't a better diet, but an alternative way to feel comforted and relaxed. The chains of habit are too weak to be felt until they are too strong to be broken.

If you love books with undying dialogues that make you come back for more even when you've finished the book, this is one for you. The story reads more like a suspenseful, paranormal romance than sci-fi. The author has a unique writing style that I find really addictive and she did a brilliant job with the characters that I found myself falling in and out of love with one or the other every time a new `hot' vampire was introduced.

And then she finds out about the Mensa Murderer in Florida and realizes that her aunt has committed the perfect murder! To make matters worse, a tragic event takes place and she's forced to go live with her aunt, who is now out to kill her.

There's a whole new cast of characters, and I loved them as much as the ones I miss from the first book.  I think my favorite was the crotchety old geezer, Mech.  I think he's the onlyhuman in the book.  Either that, or the slobbery alien, Perlertok, who was constantly stuffing his face.  Neither one of them is a main character, but that's what made this book so enjoyable.  Even the side-kicks are fun!  And if you're looking for great action scenes, this book has them in spades!

I enjoyed the range of questions answered in Mullins's book, from time travel to space travel and more. Personally, I think that the questions and answers from the second part of the Unofficial Companion stand alone on their own merits. Some of them are more realistic than those weird questions discussed in Munroe's book. Mullins certainly has the ability to make science sound interesting and understandable.I was entertained by some one- and two-stars reviews of this book, but in a different way. Looks like some kind of marketing war to kill a good book. For instance, when a reviewer posts a 1-star review limited to the critique of space between the lines of text in the book. In my humble opinion, reading text does more good for intellectual development than counting space between the lines.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CM3U6VFLKE4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PPTQOTW#wasThisHelpful","R2CM3U6VFLKE4W","A129U9QD2DWCB8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A129U9QD2DWCB8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted to second the first reviewer's opinion about this being a worthwhile book for pre-Civil War study. I just read it to research pre-Civil War events and thoroughly enjoyed it, despite the writing being a bit turgid in places.This really is a great book, primarily scholarly, but with enough humorous anecdotes about the personalities of the time to provide some laughs along the way. The author has managed to summarize many historical schools of thought about pre-Civil War days as well as to add some unique insights of his own.He is able to ""get inside the heads"" of what made pre-Civil War Southerners and Northerners ""tick."" He explains HOW they thought, making their actions more comprehensible to our generation.The author's matter-of-fact style is also to be appreciated. He explains the motivations of pre-Civil War leaders like Abraham Lincoln, Stephen Douglas, Jefferson Davis, James Buchanan, John Bell, John C. Breckinridge and many others without inserting his own opinions about their motivations. Understanding these lesser-known characters like John Bell and John Breckinridge is essential to understanding the Civil War as a whole. The stories of some of the colorful African-American personalities like Sojurner Truth, who grew up a slave in a DUTCH-speaking New York planation, were also intriguing. I enjoyed learning the details of all these people. The book has most definitely filled in some gaps in my understanding of the years leading up to the Civil War.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZGMBNAMFZ8B5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807833924#wasThisHelpful","R2ZGMBNAMFZ8B5","ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Mark Binelli tells a well-written and engaging story of America's most maligned city. He explains his purpose in writing the book:=====For people of my generation and younger, growing up in the Detroit area meant growing up with a constant reminder of the best having ended a long time ago. We held no other concept of Detroit but as a shell of its former self. ... Would my kids one day grow up thinking the same thoughts about America as a whole, about my ponderous tales of cold war victories and dot-com booms....A malaise spreading through the rest of the country....After I moved back to the city, people I met in dozens of different contexts described Detroit as ""the Wild West."" Meaning, it's basically lawless. Meaning, land is plentiful and cheap. Meaning, now, as the frontier quite literally returns to the city-- trees growing out of tops of abandoned buildings! wild pheasants circling the empty lots!-- so, too, has the metaphorical frontier, along with the notion of ""frontier spirit.""...just as Greenland might be called ground zero of the broader climate crisis, Detroit feels like ground zero for  ... what, exactly? The end of the American way of life? Or the beginning of something else? Either way, that is why so many divergent interests are converging here right now. Who doesn't want to see the future?=====Detroit is late to the urban revitalization party. In the early 1980s other decrepit inner cities like Baltimore and Cleveland began replacing their boarded-up crumbling downtown areas with new commercial developments and ""gentrified"" neighborhoods of upscale real estate. These renewing inner cities attracted prosperous African-Americans, reverse-migrating White suburbanites, and foreign immigrants. I lived in Chicago during the twenty years when developers transformed its Near South Side from an urban wasteland of slums and crumbling warehouses into a brand spanking new neighborhood of glitzy high rises, fine restaurants, and multi-million dollar condos.Detroit remains massively slummy and scummy. In 2010 Mitt Romney's birth mansion was demolished, like many others in the city, because it had become a blighted crack house. The property in Detroit is so beyond repair that the city has abandoned much of its 139 square mile area, withdrawing police protection and city services. Even many of the suburbs are rancid. The abandoned Silverdome way out in Pontiac was auctioned off for next to nothing.Recently private developers have attempted to revitalize the city by buying up real estate for pennies on the dollar and rehabbing it. The big developers tend to be followed by individual investors who buy one property at a time and start improving it. The rising fortunes of the city then become a magnet for other property owners and businesses to start moving in. The cycle of urban decay is replaced by a virtuous circle of renewed growth.This book chronicles the beginning of that process in Detroit. It is funny in a self-depreciating way. It doesn't pull any punches about the mountain of problems that Detroit is buried under. But it also tells the happier times in the city's history --- those days from the 1920's through the 1960's when it was a boomtown that offered blue collar prosperity to the Italians, Poles, and Slavs who left the poverty of Eastern Europe, and also prosperity to the country boys from Appalachia and the destitute Southern Blacks who built the vibrant ""Motown"" music industry. Millions have prospered in Detroit.Binelli personalizes the history of the city through stories of his multi-generational Italian immigrant family. He tells about his life of growing up in the 1980s, leaving the city in the 1990s, and then returning as an ""urban pioneer"" in 2000s. He tells poignant stories about other Detroiters, heroes and villains. He tells the stories of labor unions vs. managements and of drug gangs against police. He tells the story of the city's politics, both of vision, and too often of corruption.You will take away from this book an experience of what it is like to live in Detroit and try to make sense of the economic and political issues affecting the town.After reading the book my feelings about Detroit's prospects for revival are:* Detroit is an ""accidental city"" rather than a ""City of Destiny"" like Chicago, St. Louis, or even Cleveland.  These other cities were founded upon great natural transportation corridors, had trade areas extending hundreds of miles, were centers of distribution of natural resources, and attracted outstanding civic leadership. Detroit, on the other hand, is an ""accidental city."" It is a megalopolis only because Henry Ford happened to live there. Until he came to town it wasn't destined to be anything more than a middling city like Toledo or Grand Rapids. Now that the auto industry has dispersed the city must decline to a more ""natural"" size. Thus Detroit is NOT a metaphor for the rest of America. It is the exception, not the rule.* Detroit is one-dimensional. It rose and declined with the auto industry. The auto industry is reviving and there are many outstanding industrial and engineering firms remaining in the area. But it may not be able to develop a truly diversified economy as its more successful neighbors like Chicago, Indianapolis, and even Cleveland have done.* It's hard to imagine that small-time businesses like ""urban farming"" or artist colonies will gin up anywhere enough economic activity to replace the lost industrial powerhouses. Nevertheless it is better for people to be TRYING to add value to the city, even in humble ways, than to be sitting home collecting welfare or turning to crime. If Detroit is really going to recover significantly it will be through more traditional projects like the proposed new bridge linking the city to Canada and thereby making the city a giant truck stop on the NAFTA Superhighway.* The positive aspect is that the people of Detroit are nice. Contrary to all the stories about them shooting at you, the typical Detroiter is a friendly White, African-American, or immigrant who will be pleased to give an out-of-towner directions, recommend restaurants, or chat in a bar about the Lions, Tigers, Pistons, or Redwings. All those Appalachian Whites and Southern Blacks who came to town during the prosperous years give the city a folksy, down-home feel. I can imagine anybody who does go to live in Detroit will find it a welcoming place. These people seem capable of working together to restore a modest prosperity if properly led by the city governing officials and perhaps getting a boost from the investments of private developers.This book will definitely hold your interest if you're from ""The D"" or the State of Michigan or just want to know what's going down in the city. Detroit may not seem like the most entertaining subject to write about, but Mark Binelli is a great writer with many meaningful stories about the past, present, and possibly brighter future of the city.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E0Q60PETERGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805092293#wasThisHelpful","R1E0Q60PETERGH","ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is written in two parts. The first 90% explores that remarkable period of economic growth in the 19th Century when the United States transformed itself from a nation of stone-fenced farms and backwoods log cabins into a continent-spanning urban/industrial economy almost as large as the rest of the world's economies combined. The final 10% is an analysis on how the lessons learned from our early economic rise might help us to manage our trading relations with China, which is currently in the same stage of explosive economic growth as we were then.This book isn't an organized scholarly history of America's early economic growth (many books of that type have already been written). Rather it is a series of colorful vignettes exploring the development of various machine technologies intertwined with insights into the remarkable character of early Americans that expedited our rise as an economic powerhouse. Author Charles Morris weaves his vignettes into an interesting and comprehensive whole.The starting point to understanding this book is that America might well have evolved into a poorer country with a less developed economy. Our richness in land, natural resources, and a benevolent climate might have lulled us into contented indolence. Instead our free economy and democratic ideals attracted some of the most talented mechanics, inventors, industrial engineers, and businesspeople from Great Britain and northern Europe.Morris then explains how an early test of our industrial prowess occurred during the War of 1812, which began with the economic and political fortunes of the fledgling United States at low ebb. He explains how we obtained a satisfactory peace from a difficult war by creating a shipyard employing 5,000 workers on the remote wilderness of Lake Ontario. This early ""military/industrial complex"" created a first-class fleet complete with heavy cannon and early prototypes of machine guns. If this fleet had not won control of the Great Lakes the peace may have concluded with the British flag flying over its old pre-Revolutionary border along the Ohio River.Other vignettes explain how Americans inherited the entrepreneurial character of the British and then intensified it. Others explain how complex machines and instruments for precision manufacturing were developed then scaled up to industrial strength. Watch-makers working in cottages learned how to build steam engines for boats and locomotives. He explains how entrepreneurial-minded British visitors to the United States were impressed by the business savvy of America's ""democratic rabble."" They were astounded to see Americans investing their money in every type of business from small stores on the frontier to great factories and large networks of canals and railroads. He explains that America was the first country whose people started out middle class and then aspired to become wealthy.Although I knew the outlines of this history I enjoyed Morris' micro-focus on some of the key inventions and personalities of the era. Among other things, a colorful picture of how people lived and did business in the emergent metropolis of Cincinnati (our third-largest city in the early 1800s) is presented.The book is not quite complete because it leaves out any discussion of the PLANNED aspects our economic development. Many of our leaders in government from Alexander Hamilton to William Seward dedicated themselves to shaping America into the world's preimenent industrial and commercial power. They made sure that the tailwinds of government were behind every business enterprise from manufactories to canals and railroads. Our economy grew much faster than it would have if government had been hostile or merely indifferent to the development of an industrial economy.However, Morris does conclude the book with an interesting analysis of how Great Britain fared in the face of competition from America's emerging industries. He seeks out lessons from the experience of established British industries competing with their upstart American cousins that might now be applied to managing trade with our emerging competitors in China.  Morris explains that Great Britain was actually a gentle giant of an economic empire. In the late 1800s its political leaders were wedded to Adam Smith's laissez-faire concept of free trade. They kept their markets open to American-made products at a time when our protectionist tariffs shut most of their products out of our market.Morris explains that the British leadership believed, as do most of our current politicians, that free trade forces domestic industry to compete globally and therefore hones its competitive edge. Britain's industries WERE saddled with hide-bound management and militant labor unions that resisted productivity-enhancing innovation. But instead of becoming more productive they were obliterated by competition from the U.S. and especially by the predatory ""dumping"" by Germany's rising industries. Instead of making British industries more competitive, free trade with non-reciprocating trading partners may have hastened Britain's economic decline.Morris points out that today the U.S. is in a similar position vis-à-vis China. He says that while China is not particularly discriminatory with its tariffs, there is nevertheless a government-planned scheme of harvesting foreign investment. He says foreign companies are invited to set up shop in China for the express purpose of stealing their technologies then building an industrial base to export knock-off products back to the rest of the world. Of course promoting ""free trade"" with a predatory trading partner has the potential to impoverish us the way Britain's industrial economy was demolished a century ago.My takeaway is that there may be better ways to keep our industries competitive than giving them away to China. One way to increase competition would be to bust up the oligarchies that currently stifle competition in many of our industrial, technology, and financial sectors. This could be done either by vigorous enforcement of Anti-Trust laws or better yet by imposing a progressive corporate income tax starting at zero for small companies and scaling up to 100% on the profits of gargantuan monopolistic companies.This would cause the consolidated behemoths to disband into more productive and more competitive smaller units. That would in turn cause an increase in R&D spending and would began a process of re-employing American scientists, engineers, and industrial managers instead of continuing to export their jobs and their knowledge base to China.Perhaps the important revelation is that it doesn't pay to be a ""Gentle Giant"" when your predatory trading partners are determined not just to move your cheese but to eat it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19ULLG8CV28WL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00918JTLS#wasThisHelpful","R19ULLG8CV28WL","ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author David Von Drehle's premise is that 1862 was the pivotal year of the Civil War, the year that ultimately guaranteed the Federal victory orchestrated by President Lincoln. Having read about the Civil War for 45 years, this theme seemed dissonant at first. Is ""1862"" a typo? Doesn't Von Drehle mean 18 SIXTY-THREE? Didn't that year begin with Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson running rampant at Chancellorsville? Didn't it end with the Confederates  severed along the Mississippi and driven back toward  Richmond and Atlanta? Wasn't THAT the year that the tide of the war was irrevocably reversed to favor the eventual triumph of the Union?Von Drehle makes a convincing case that 1862 is AT LEAST AS DECISIVE as the later years. He points out that a lot of things could have gone wrong in 1862 that would have wrecked the Union BEFORE the calendar turned over to 1863:1. The North might have convinced itself that the Confederacy was unconquerable. Conventional wisdom is that the North overpowered the South with manpower, industry, and railroads, but that was far from obvious in the early years of the war. Before the war most of the nation's foreign exchange was generated by the South's cotton exports. Cotton made money for Northern shippers, brokers, and banks. Could the North's economy sustain itself without the South? The immense land area of the Confederacy might have made the logistics of subduing and occupying it impossible even if the Federals somehow managed to win every battle.================Pressure aside, the idea that the Confederacy-- now a powerful country in its own right-- could be tamed and forced back into the Union by an army of raw volunteers, led by an unschooled frontier lawyer as commander in chief, struck most European observers as far-fetched, even preposterous. ""It is in the highest Degree likely that the North will not be able to subdue the South,"" the British, Lord Palmerston, counseled his Foreign Office.================2. Lincoln had to convince the North that it was fighting on the right side of history. The notion that the United States was a confederation of sovereign states was widespread even in the North. In the years before the war Jefferson Davis' States Rights speeches had been cheered as loudly in New York City and Boston as in Charleston and Savannah. Confederate leaders expected to reverse-engineer the United States such that even most of the Free States would secede from the old Union and seek admittance to the Confederacy. Lincoln had to win the NORTH over to the idea that the United States was a nation indivisible.3. Lincoln had to mobilize the North for war. The logistical effort of raising, training, and equipping a National Army of hundreds of thousands was immense. Lincoln understood that besides mobilizing an army he had to finance it: ""The result of this war is a question of resources. That side will win in the end where the money holds out longest.""4. Lincoln had to manage egotistical personalities in his Cabinet, in the Federal Congress, and among his army officers --- most of whom thought he was a hick. Cabinet members like Simon Cameron and Generals like McClellan were outrageously insubordinate. Yet their services at the beginning of the war were essential. The Congress' Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War constantly second-guessed Lincoln's decisions and interfered with his chain of command.5. He had to ferret out the Union's military talent and promote it to high command. Lincoln had astoundingly bad luck with most of the generals who were prominent early in the war. Fremont, Pope, Burnside, Hooker and McClellan all had failings that made them ineffective as army commanders. Lincoln had to discern the abilities of men he did not know, such as Grant, Sherman, Thomas and get them promoted to army command where they could be effective in winning the war.================Lincoln's job was to glean somehow, from these thousands of unproven men, the few with the stuff of true leaders. As he was already discovering, a West Point education or a long stretch in uniform provided no guarantee of military ability.================6. He had to manage diplomacy, including irritating incidents like the Trent Affair, so as to keep the British and French from recognizing the Confederacy and perhaps intervening on its behalf. To keep the Europeans from intervening he had to prove that his armies could fight well enough to have reasonable prospects of restoring the Union by force of arms.7. He had to time the Emancipation Proclamation perfectly. If he had done it any earlier he would have driven Kentucky and Missouri into the Confederacy. If he had waited any longer the Republican Party would have shattered and undermined the war.8. He had to maintain his Administration on an even keel during times when rumors of exaggerated calamities, such as McClellan's retreat from the Peninsula and the slaughter at Fredericksburg reached Washington. Had Lincoln once given way to the panic that infected many in his Cabinet, his army, and in the Congress, the war effort would have unraveled.9. He had to make his generals and the people understand that attrition favored the Union. After the slaughter of Burnside's army at Fredericksburg he said: ""If the same battle were to be fought over again, every day, through a week of days, with the same relative results, the army under Lee would be wiped out to its last man, the Army of the Potomac would still be a mighty host, the war would be over, the Confederacy gone, and peace would be won.... No general yet found can face the arithmetic, but the end of the war will be at hand when he shall be discovered."" This foreshadowed the rise of General U.S. Grant to supreme command in the following years.10. Finally, he had to overcome personal tragedies in 1862 that would have incapacitated many men. His wife's erratic behavior was a public and private embarrassment. He endured the death by typhoid of his most beloved son Willie. He had to maintain his sanity, let alone his judgment, with both a family and a nation in turmoil.The book demonstrates that by the end of 1862 Lincoln had accomplished substantially all of these objectives. He had mobilized for the war and financed it. He had convinced most Northerners that the United States was a real nation, not merely a confederation of ""sovereign"" states. He had replaced his old fogey generals with Grant, Sherman, Thomas, and other rising stars. He had issued the Emancipation Proclamation. And he had proven HIMSELF to be a great deal more than the backwoods bumpkin that so many had perceived him to be the year before. The war would continue for another year and a half, but by the end of 1862 the pattern had been set.The book is written in an engaging style that takes the reader right into the Civil War. It is an education on the higher level aspects of the war that Lincoln dealt with as well as his colorful day-to-day routines. It will satisfy scholars and casual readers of popular history, including those who may not have read much about Lincoln or the Civil War.It also provides  insights into the controversial characters that surrounded Lincoln, such as George McClellan, Henry Halleck, Edwin Stanton, William Seward, Simon Cameron, and not least Mrs. Lincoln. The right amount of emphasis is paced on the military operations and battles --- explaining them sufficiently but without bogging the reader down in detail. Maps are included.This book is all the more convincing because Von Drehle's knowledge of the Civil War and how people thought and acted in that time is COMPLETE. His expressive style conveys the drama of that year day-by-day in diary style so that the reader can imagine being right there at Lincoln's side as he receives each day's news, some of exhilarating victories and others of brutally discouraging defeats.I approached this book skeptically, doubting whether Von Drehle really had a sound premise in his concept of 1862 being the pivotal year of the war. I finished the book by being educated as to all the reasons why it was. It's hard to believe that ANY book about the Civil War could seem ""fresh"" after so much has already been written, but David Von Drehle succeeds in presenting a uniquely fresh perspective to the war in focusing in on 1862 as its critical year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H9PG21M95WRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080507970X#wasThisHelpful","R2H9PG21M95WRQ","ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About a hundred years ago we had the ""golden age"" of discovery in cosmology and physics that revolutionized our understanding of the universe. Before 1900 we thought of our universe as an orderly place consisting of well-behaving molecules and atoms bound by a space consisting of a few thousand nearby stars.Thirty years later we discerned the universe to be a gigantic and disorderly place of quantum chaos, where particles are expressed not by substance but by mathematical probabilities. We learned through Relativity that the size and shape of the universe itself depends on the frame of reference of the observer.It's taken decades to assimilate the knowledge we uncovered during that golden age. Author Paul Halpern argues that our time of consolidating that knowledge is just about over, and that we are on the cusp of a new golden age of discovery that will turn our understanding of the universe upside down yet again:===================================================Cosmology, the science of the universe, is witnessing a golden age. Thanks to powerful telescopes, delicate microwave receivers, sophisticated computer algorithms, and a host of other tools for collecting and analyzing light, the study of the cosmos has achieved extraordinary precision. Researchers have been able to extend the reach of astronomical knowledge out to unprecedented depths and farther into the past than ever beforeWe've known since the late 1920s that the universe is expanding; however, it was only in the late 1990s that astronomers discovered that this cosmic expansion has been speeding up rather than slowing down. Nobody knows the cause of this acceleration. Possibly it is a modification of the law of gravity itself rather than an actual substance.Many other questions about the universe defy current attempts at understanding and challenge us to press further until we know the answers. Was there a beginning to time? Were there events before the Big Bang? Is it possible to travel backward into the past? Are there other universes? Could there be higher dimensions beyond our perception? Will the history of the cosmos ever draw to a close? If so, what will happen in its final era? In recent years the idea of a multiverse--a collection of universes--has gathered much currency. A model of rapid growth in the very early universe, called inflation, suggests in some of its versions that our universe is surrounded by other, ""bubble"" universes. While the concept sounds like science fiction, amazingly, a recent discovery seems to bolster the idea of universes beyond ours.From these images and theories has emerged a narrative even more exciting than the heroic sagas of yore. Let the celestial adventure begin!================================================As other reviewers have noted, this is one of those outstanding books that is both deeply informative and beautifully expressed. Here is what I especially liked:1. Halpern expresses the nature of the universe, from subatomic particles to chains of galaxies in a poetic beauty reminiscent of Carl Sagan. I didn't understand all these ideas on the first reading, but Halpern's vivid explanations made me want to read them several times until they did start to sink in. He mixes in enough light-hearted anecdotes to break up the ""heavy"" subject matter, but he doesn't overdo the comedy shtick to the extent of distracting from the serious material.2. He explains why some obtuse ideas are critically important: for example WHY the ""inflation"" theory of the universe expanding instantaneously from the size of a proton to the size of a baseball is a critical link in the Big Bang scenario.3. The most interesting aspect of this book is how it INTEGRATES all these ideas: how concepts like inflation, dark energy, vacuum energy, the Higgs particle, "" branes,"" strings, multiple universes, and even the evolution of human consciousness all tie in with each other. The degree of integration of all these theories from the micro-universe to the macro-universe is remarkable when fully considered.4. In the later parts of the book he explores some REALLY mind-bending ideas such as ""reality is a weighted sum of all possibilities, ""evolutionary cosmology,""  and ""quantum immortality.""5. And there's an important new concept that I hadn't heard of before --- ""The Holographic Sky"" which theorizes that all of the ""information"" of the universe is contained at its observable edges, not within the volume of its space. This concept gives the book its title.This book covers perhaps a hundred discrete topics from particle physics to astrophysics. It gets its message across very clearly: ""We may be on the verge of discovering a vast amount of new information about our Universe, and here is a heads-up on the topics you need to be familiarizing with yourself now, in order to understand what's coming down the pike."" The only ""problem"" is that the book  is so filled with fascinating topics that you'll want to spend WEEKS fully absorbing it.The book also made me think of this question: Why aren't we spending more money on building the next generation of telescopes --- either those placed in orbit or terrestrial-based telescopes with auto-correcting lenses that compensate for distortion in the atmosphere. Spending money sending robots to Mars and the Outer Planets is fine, but wouldn't the same amount of money buy us a gigantic telescope that could peer to the edge of the universe and give us the answers to some of these mind-bending theories that this book introduces?","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33X15JR0A8683/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0470636246#wasThisHelpful","R33X15JR0A8683","ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Until Alvaro Uribe was elected as its president, Colombia was a country in name only. It was a land of isolated cities surrounded by an almost impenetrable terrain of mountains and jungles where FARC and ELN leftist guerillas, paramilitary vigilantes, narco-traffickers, and other outlaws reigned supreme. Citizens put their lives in danger as soon as they passed the checkpoints around the towns and ventured into the country. Almost every Colombian family has a member who was kidnapped or murdered by one or another of these terrorist groups.Try to imagine this incident happening almost EVERY DAY in America: A family driving from Atlanta to Nashville gets stopped at a guerilla roadblock on I-24. They get dragged out of their cars and watch the guerillas machine-gun their elderly grandparents with AK-47s, then carry the children off to a mountain hideout, saying they will murder them if the parents don't return with a ransom.This barbarity was a NORMAL part of life in Colombia prior to Uribe being elected president. For over a century the national government, holed up in the cities, had taken a hands-off approach to the reign of terror in the countryside.Uribe explains the essence of life in Colombia that he knew growing up:==============================For as long as I can remember, there has been a paradox at the heart of Colombian life. On the one hand, our country suffers from its well-known maladies and afflictions. On the other, it is a country that is also capable of stunning, almost inconceivable goodness-- a place where the laughter seems heartier, the food tastes better, and the sun shines brighter than anywhere else. The overwhelming majority of our lives take place in the latter place. Learning how to reconcile the two worlds was, for most of our history, the very essence of being Colombian.A well-known American traveler named Frank Vincent once visited Colombia and wrote: ""The whole genius of the nation seems directed toward civil dissension and guerrilla warfare. Hence, while the people complain of poverty, they offer so little guarantee and security to foreign life and capital as to be quite unable to secure the presence and help of either."" Vincent wrote this in 1890. A century later, it would still ring true.Why? In our case, we were held back by the same two intimately linked problems that have been our undoing time and again during the past two hundred years: 1) our difficult geography, and 2) the historic inability, or unwillingness, of Colombian governments to project sufficient federal authority.I remember watching as my father, such a proud and democratic man, talked with these outlaws with guns. And I remember yearning, at the purest, most primal level, to live in a Colombia where armed men would never invade our farm, where my family would all be safe, and where no one would ever have to lock herself inside her house, staring at the door in terror.============================Uribe tells his story as a member of a well-to-do but humble family who dedicated their lives to the cause of restoring civil government to Colombia. Uribe's father was murdered and his brother gravely wounded by leftist outlaws. Uribe faced almost daily assassination threats as he rose up the political ladder as mayor of Medellin, Governor of the Department (State) of Antioquia, and President of Colombia. As president he mobilized the police, the army, and the courts to defeat the guerillas and drug criminals. During his administration kidnappings, murders, and bombings became so rare as to become newsworthy.Uribe proved himself a wise administrator in almost every area of government. He made the government more transparent and responsible to the people. He restored the government's finances by courageously raising taxes and cutting excessive bureaucratic spending. He helped to restore sustainability to Colombia's public and private pensions. He encouraged the development of modern infrastructures among the ports, railroads, and highways. He encouraged the urban planning that has made Bogota and Medellin models of urban development. Of course he had a lot of help in these things, but as President he set the leadership tone of peace, progress, prosperity, and optimism that has spread throughout the country. Almost every Colombian you talk to these days says, ""Our country is going up!""From this book you will learn not only about how Uribe saved his country from being submerged in criminal anarchy but also:1. About Colombia, a large and now stable country of fifty million, just a few hours flight time from Miami. It has a beautiful geography and fantastic biodiversity. It has uncounted natural resources and a large population of increasingly prosperous consumers, making it a trading partner that is likely to benefit our economy by selling us what we need and buying the products that we export. The majority of its people are aligned with our views on democracy and free market economics.2. How the law-abiding people can prevail when their leaders inspire them to stand up to terrorists. Colombian judges, soldiers, and politicians woke up every day knowing they and their families were specifically targeted for assassination by the terrorist groups they fought and prosecuted. They refused bribes that would have made them wealthy, choosing to give their lives to the cause of justice rather than becoming corrupt pawns of guerillas and drug Mafioso.3. How guerilla insurgencies are defeated. There has been something of a post-Vietnam War myth in Leftist circles that guerilla movements can't be defeated. And yet Colombia's entrenched insurgencies, operating for decades in the most guerrilla-friendly terrain on the planet, WERE defeated after Uribe mobilized his intelligence operatives to infiltrate them and then sent the army into the jungle to hunt them down. Over a period of years they were killed off and incarcerated faster than they could replace their losses. Some of their leaders died in combat. Some were obliterated by airstrikes. Some died of natural causes. Uribe learned that negotiations were futile until AFTER the leadership was killed or captured. He had to eliminate the leadership first, and then offer to negotiate a return to society for the demoralized rank-and-file.4. To appreciate the necessity of democracy. We Americans often become frustrated with the democratic process and say, ""We have way too many people who are too  stupid to vote!"" And yet Colombians, who are so much poorer and less educated than we are, elected Uribe as their President and elected other strong leaders to the Legislature and regional governments who they knew would risk their lives to restore order to the country. If democracy can work to elect the best leaders in Colombia, then surely it can work here.5. To understand that we Americans must never shrink from our role as being the both the advocate and the ""arsenal"" of democracy. Says Uribe:==========Over the years, many countries offered Colombia their condolences. But only one country ever stepped forward to offer us real, tangible military aid that helped us address our problems. The Colombian people will forever be grateful to the United States, and to presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, for providing us with many of the tools we needed to defeat terrorism and extend the reach of the democratic state.===========6. At the same time recognize that opportunities for dialog with our ideological adversaries in Latin America may be possible. Uribe portrays Cuba's Fidel Castro as being an advocate for peace. He says Castro warned him not to place any trust in negotiating with the FARC because Castro knew their leaders and knew they had no sincere desire for peace. It would seem from Uribe's account that Cuba's ambitions of fomenting Communist insurgencies in Latin America are finished. Uribe's accounts of meetings with Hugo Chavez are more ambiguous. Uribe says that Chavez funded the FARC to the tune of $300,000,000. And yet Uribe says there is a sense of Latin American solidarity that prevents Colombia and Venezuela from considering themselves enemies.This book is a very personal and moving view of how President Alvaro Uribe led Colombia away from anarchy and terror and into a constitutional government that balances libertarian concerns with the necessity for being strong enough to suppress the insurgent and outlaw groups that threatened the country's existence. Uribe has transformed his country by inspiring its people with his values of integrity, social justice, respect for the law, and willingness to give up his own life to defeat the insurgents and drug criminals who sought to bring down the government. His story is an inspiration for all peoples and governments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AI0VPGQYW60R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451413814#wasThisHelpful","R2AI0VPGQYW60R","ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just returned from the 150th Reenactment of the Battle of Perryville where I heard this book discussed. I thoroughly enjoyed the book because it is written in a style of vividly told human interest, with photographs on almost every page, that makes the reader feel as if he/she is right there in Perryville during the days after the battle.The Battle of Perryville is interesting because it is a perfect microcosm of the Civil War. A hard-charging veteran Confederate Army shoved the larger Federal Army back across miles of the battlefield in ferocious, hand-to-hand fighting. But the Union men, though green and poorly led, did not break. They gave ground grudgingly and took just enough of the edge off the Confederate attack to prevent their rolling up the whole Federal Army. The next day the Confederates discovered that they were outnumbered by 3 to 1 and retreated. Like the Civil War as a whole, the aggressive hard-fighting Confederates came close to destroying a Federal Army that heavily outnumbered them, but the Federals dug in their heels and blunted the attack just sufficiently to prevent the Confederates from winning a victory of war-winning significance.Author Stuart Sanders covers that part of the story in the first 10% of the book. The other 90% deals with the dimension of the war that we hear almost nothing about --- the months-long aftermath of the battle when the dead were buried and thousands of wounded on both sides either recuperated or passed away. The Confederates and Federals were superbly organized in almost all aspects of war EXCEPT for the caring of the wounded after a battle. Both sides were woefully short of doctors and medical supplies.After a big battle like Perryville the commanders of both armies were only interested in one thing --- getting the able-bodied men together for the next battle. The wounded were left to fend for themselves with scant help from the few doctors left behind. Many of the wounded at Perryville lay on the battlefield for days before being picked up and moved to the citizens' houses and makeshift hospitals. The overflow of wounded filled private residences, schools, and churches for miles in all directions.The book blends many personal narratives of the survivors. It captures the agony of men who passed away from gruesome wounds, but also the joy of grievously wounded men who thought they were going to die but recovered. It tells the devastating psychological and economic impact of the local residents whose livestock and property was destroyed or confiscated. Many of the locals heroically gave up their own lives caring for the wounded, which they knew were infected with typhoid and other fatal diseases. The story is all the more poignant because this part of Kentucky was almost evenly divided between Unionists and Confederates. Many locals who favored one side found themselves caring for grievously wounded relatives who had fought on the side of their enemies.The book shows, through its vividly told personal narratives and photographs, that if the battlefield turns men into devils, the aftermath brings out the healing side of human nature. For every Civil War battlefield there are towns like Perryville whose citizens, though dazed by their own loss of property and disrupted lives, rallied to take care of the wounded among their friends and foes. They put their own lives in danger to care for the sick and gave what little they had left of their own food and medicine to help the wounded on both sides. That dimension of war is as important as what happened during the battle itself. Stuart Sanders tells the story in all its details of human interest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25OUQBLP4WYZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609495675#wasThisHelpful","R25OUQBLP4WYZA","ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the kind of critique that should have been written about President Obama years ago, because most of the other critiques have been juvenile name calling: ""Obama's a (Communist, Marxist, Socialist, Illegal Alien with no birth certificate)."" These sorts of critiques are counterproductive because they don't convince anybody who's not already convinced, and they often generate a backlash of sympathy.I should say up front that I do not agree with the book's implied thesis that Obama is a megalomaniac who uses Progressive / Liberal ideologies to promote himself. My impression is that he's a humble personality with the same sorts of values of faith, family, and country that most of the rest of us have. (I understand that most readers will have a contrary opinion.) I'm basing this review on the part of the book that interests me, and that is the question of whether or not Obama has wrapped himself in the Progressive ideology or whether he is a non-ideological leader (like perhaps a Bill Clinton) who may have some core beliefs, but in matters of public policy tends to dabble a little here, and a little there, depending on which way the shifting winds of public opinion blow.My first critique of the book doesn't have anything at all to do with its substance, but is about its style of dense sentences and long, multi-page paragraphs. It would have been easier to comprehend if it were written in a lighter style of short sentences and paragraphs. Even an intellectually-deep book like this one can be written in a reader friendly format.In terms of substance, author Charles Kesler's premise is that Obama's primary failing isn't that he's an extremist in the sense of being a Communist or Socialist, but merely that he's a ""decent man""  who ""believes in justice"" and therefore thinks of himself as being a Progressive. Kesler doesn't explain, at least to my satisfaction, what a Progressive really is. He explains PART of the early Progressive agenda as it originated in the late 1800s, the part of the agenda that sought, successfully, to expand the scope of government in extending its regulatory authority over corporations, banks, and railroads engaged in interstate commerce.However, he doesn't describe the heart of Progressive ideology, which is the belief that government has the obligation to restore the balance between Labor and Capital.Progressives believe that Labor (employees) and Capital (employers) should work together in a virtuous circle whereby Labor creates Capital, Capital invests in businesses that employ Labor, the laborers of those businesses save and invest some of their wages, thereby creating more capital for business expansion, businesses use this capital to expand, more people are hired, more capital is created, and so on to infinity. When this virtuous circle occurs the economy becomes ever more prosperous for business owners and their employees. Labor and Capital prosper together.Progressives believe that because there are almost always more laborers available than there are opportunities to employ them that employers (Capital) enjoy an inherent advantage over employees (Labor). Employers hire and fire employees and thereby exercise a considerable power to control their livelihoods. Employees do not hire and fire employers and usually do not have much, if any, leverage to increase their wages and working conditions.Progressives believe that without any superior power to constrain them, employers will use their economic advantage to replace their current workers with lower cost labor, thereby creating a constant downward pressure on wages as employees are made to compete against each other to work for lower and lower wages. What employers don't understand is that after they beat down the wages of their workers they don't have any customers left who have money to buy the products their business produces. In the absence of any higher power Capital beats down Labor, then Capital goes bankrupt because Labor doesn't have money to purchase what it produces.PROGRESSIVES BELIEVE THAT WORKERS MUST HAVE WAGES SUFFICIENT TO PURCHASE THE GOODS AND SERVICES THAT THEIR LABOR PRODUCES.Progressives believe that government must be the higher power that restores the balance between Labor and Capital. They believe that government must:1. Enforce a minimum wage so that wages can not be beaten down indefinitely.2. Increase the demand for labor by mandating a 40-hour week with premium pay for overtime; eliminating child labor; and creating Social Security pensions so that older workers may retire from the work force and open up opportunities for younger ones.3. That in extreme circumstances, such as economic depressions, that government should become an ""employer of last resort"" to soak up the idle workers that business can't hire. The idea here is to maintain sufficient purchasing power to prevent the entire economy from failing.4. That government should regulate the activities of banks and large corporations to prevent them from colluding to cheat consumers. Banks that accept the public's money are a public trust and must be regulated by government to insure their solvency. Corporations must not be allowed to use their concentrations of capital to unfairly rig markets in their favor by forming anti-competitive trusts or price-fixing cartels, which they did all the time before the Progressives reined them in with the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Interstate Commerce Act.Free market purists don't believe that government should have a role in overseeing the employee/employer or producer/consumer relationship. Thus there IS a great philosophical divide between Obama's beliefs and the laissez-faire orientation of Conservative Republicans.To me, the most insightful part of the book is:====================Obama is neither an old-fashioned Progressive nor a radical postmodernist. Part of what makes him interesting is how he handles the conflicting strains of his own thought. As a decent man, he believes in justice, and identifies with the civil rights movement's insistence that Jim Crow was manifestly wrong and the cause of black equality manifestly right. As a self-described progressive, he believes in change...=====================Kesler is absolutely correct that Obama ISN'T a Progressive, at least not in the sense that Progressives define themselves. If Obama really WERE a Progressive, we'd be hearing about the Progressive ideal of restoring the balance between Labor and Capital. He would be talking about raising the minimum wage, passing laws to improve employment security and pensions, and imposing tariffs on jobs-destroying imports. Genuine Socialists like Cuba's Fidel Castro and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez regard Obama as just another ""Classical Neoliberal"" bent on promoting capitalism at the expense of labor.My opinion after reading the book is the same as it was before, that Obama is more a dabbler than a committed Progressive ideologue. I believe he made Healthcare Reform a priority NOT because he sees it as part of a unified Progressive Agenda, but because he believes that it has merits on its own in expanding access to affordable healthcare to people of modest means. He has entirely ignored the rest of the Progressive agenda of raising the minimum wage, passing laws to improve employment security, etc. If Obama does transform the country along Progressive lines, it will happen on a piecemeal basis rather than as part of any grand design on his part. But opinions differ on what his real intent may be, so read the book and come to your own conclusions!This book is thought provoking and must be read on a scholarly plane. If you're comfortable with reading in deep thinking mode and don't mind dense prose, then by all means delve into it and decide for yourself whether Kesler's points have merit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29N6J6G7QBEY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006207296X#wasThisHelpful","R29N6J6G7QBEY6","ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this book from two perspectives. First, decades ago, I was given a copy of the Air Force War College's textbook on geography as a basis for global military strategy and therefore became familiar at an early age with some of the concepts this book explores. Secondly, my family is bi-national American/Colombian, with family and businesses in both countries, and therefore is attuned with author Robert Kaplan's future vision of the USA evolving to become the center of an Anglo-Hispanic ""supra-state.""Although this book is supposedly focused in on the influence of geography in making and breaking nations, it is actually what we used to call ""Social Studies"" --- a combined analysis of all the factors of geography, demographics, history, economics, and politics that go into constituting a nation state.PART III. AMERICA'S DESTINY is the 25% of the book that most interested me. The other 75% is just OK, because it is an agglomeration of themes that students of world history and current events will probably already be familiar with. I didn't care for the lack of focus among so many topics. The chapter on Mexico starts with a rambling history of the Roman Empire followed up by a digression into our wars in Iran and Afghanistan, the history of China, India, Venice and the 18th Century mutiny of Indian troops against British Colonialists. However, those who aren't already familiar with these topics of World History 101 and are looking for the widest possible introduction to the geography, demographics, history, economics, politics, and current events in all parts of the world may enjoy Kaplan's ""stream of consciousness"" approach.Kaplan can also be a bit pedantic (""history and geography tell us"") and prone to over-comparing motivations of current nation states to what their forebears did thousands of years ago (""Ancient history, too, offers up examples that cast doubt on whether Afghanistan and Iraq, in and of themselves, have doomed us""). He also says that he is ""aware that I am on dangerous ground in raising geography on a pedestal"" but actually covers so much material of a political, demographic, and economic nature that geography seems to be secondary. He might just as well have titled the book THE REVENGE OF (GEOGRAPHY, ECONOMICS, DEMOGRAPHICS, POLITICS, ETC. ETC.).My interest perked up in PART III  AMERICA'S DESTINY. This is the part that Kaplan put his heart into, as he explains:==============As a visiting professor at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis some years back, I taught a course about future challenges in national security.==============In fact the book becomes especially interesting because Kaplan expands on the topic of ""future challenges in national security"" to include the future composition of our country in the combination of ALL factors that make us the nation we are, including geography, demographics, politics, and economics.Kaplan starts out by pointing out how fantastically blessed by geography we Americans are. We have 6% of the world's land area, but perhaps 25% to 30% of its arable farmland. Our entire country, except for the Desert Southwest, is drained by the Mississippi/Ohio/Missouri, and the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence. Our East Coast ports were perfectly positioned at the head of navigable waters to facilitate settlement, commerce, and the extension of political sovereignty for hundreds of miles inland. We ARE the center of the world's trading routes, with our East Coast facing Europe, our West Coast facing Asia, and our Gulf Coast facing Latin America. Kaplan perhaps overplays the idea that the United States is a superpower PRIMARILY because of our geography (the ambitions of our people also had a lot to do with making us what we are) but he makes it clear that no country has been favored by geography as we are.He then makes the point that in regard to the vision of what the United States wants to become as a nation, we are coming back to our starting point. Our country is named ""The United States of AMERICA"" (not NORTH AMERICA) because it wasn't until around 1900 that the word ""America"" stopped being used as a synonym for ""Western Hemisphere"" and the words NORTH AMERICA and SOUTH AMERICA began to be used to distinguish the continents. As late as the 1870s some prominent Americans continued to believe that the United States was destined to become coextensive with the entire hemisphere.Something of the reverse has actually happened. Instead of Anglo Americans going forth to colonize Latin America and incorporating it into the United States, tens of millions of Latin Americans have been attracted by our free political system and vibrant economy to come live among us. Kaplan makes a point that I (an Anglo American) and my Latin American family talk about almost every day, that the elderly Anglo population is passing, and America is being repopulated by a younger, more Latin American generation.Kaplan  thinks, as I do, that we're on our way to becoming an even more powerful Anglo/Hispanic Superpower whose economic perimeter includes not only Canada but also Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and much or even all of South America. He thinks our population will be browner, but we'll still be Americans living under the same Constitution, and a rising prosperity in Latin America will boost our own prosperity (I see this happening in the microcosm of my own family).My takeaway from this book is that Mexico and Latin America REALLY are vital to our own well being. Before reading this book I leaned toward the view that America's free trade partnership shouldn't extend beyond Canada. Now I am wondering whether free trade with Mexico and most of the rest of Latin America may not after all be necessary for our security. These free trade agreements have put millions of Americans out of work, but they are accomplishing their purpose of helping to stabilize fragile countries like Colombia and Mexico. Eventually the trade agreements may serve their full purpose by boosting American exports, and therefore restoring employment, to the newly prosperous countries of Latin America.You'll  find this book a worthwhile read if:1. You're looking for an education in Global Social Studies 101 (i.e. a basic literacy in global geography, demographics, politics, military strategic theory past and present, and current events).  None of these subjects is covered deeply, but the reader will become away conversant in just about every factor that influences the world today.2. You're interested in the part of the book I was, which is to glimpse ahead into the USA's future.3. You want to acquire a more open-minded view of the cost/benefit analysis of U.S. free trade with Mexico and Latin America. It led me to wonder if perhaps the USA should include Mexico in its continental integration perimeter to the same degree as Canada (an objective that Mexico's former President asked for).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32CEH6885M0MA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007MDJY5K#wasThisHelpful","R32CEH6885M0MA","ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent introduction to the life and times of Confederate General Joseph Johnston, one of the most controversial Confederate military men. It captures the complex personality of the general, being ferociously brave as a person (his uniform accumulated 30 bullet holes in one battle of the Seminole War, he was hit five times in Mexico, and seriously wounded at Seven Days) but very cautious as a military commander.It tells some of the poignant episodes of Johnston's life, such as his fistfight with Jefferson Davis while both were cadets at West Point (apparently this is why Davis detested him during the Civil War) and his death from pneumonia contracted as the pall bearer at William T. Sherman's funeral --- his mortal enemy from the Civil War who became one of his best friends after the war.The book also wraps a lot of early 19th Century American History around Johnston, including his involvement in the Seminole War, the Nullification Crisis, the Mexican War, Bleeding Kansas, John Brown's Raid, and of course the Civil War. It's a great short introduction to the people who interacted with Johnston like Andrew Jackson, Robert E. Lee, U.S. Grant, General Sherman, and Jefferson Davis.Because Johnston arguably saw more of the Civil War than anyone else, being in command at Manassas, Seven Days, Vicksburg, Atlanta, and the final campaign against Sherman in North Carolina, this is also an excellent introduction to the Civil War.The entire book can be read in about 30 minutes to an hour, so it may be too basic for the serious Civil War buff. But it is extremely easy to read and therefore an ideal resource for students who may be doing a term paper on General Johnston or the Civil War as a whole. The maps and photos are superb. The battle field maps are some of the best illustrated I've seen in any book. The pictures, mainly of people who interacted with Johnston, are clear and well-selected.The book doesn't go into any analysis of whether Johnston's ambiguous reputation was justified by his poor performance as a general, or whether he was simply the victim of bad luck (being in the wrong place at the wrong time) and the animosity of Confederate President Jefferson Davis who wouldn't give him a fair hearing. It's nevertheless a well-written basic biography of the life and times of General Joe Johnston. If the reader didn't know much about General Johnston before the book, he/she will definitely come away with familiarity of who he was as a person and how he fought as a military man, especially during some of the Civil War's epic battles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R314MJ2LCQQD0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090SY02W#wasThisHelpful","R314MJ2LCQQD0P","ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALRQYRWQ7LRQ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a librarian, I read scores of books each year, and I enjoy nothing more than recommending a good read to fellow book lovers.  ME BEFORE YOU was my favorite adult read a couple of years back, and I was thrilled to learn that Jojo Moyes had another Louisa and Will story in her heart.  Indeed, even though Will is gone, AFTER YOU is still, in a unique way, a continuation of their story.  In the Robert Anderson play I Never Sang for My Father, the narrator tells us that ""death ends a life, but it does not end a relationship, which struggles on in the survivor's mind toward some resolution which it may never find.""  AFTER YOU tells the story of Louisa Clark's painful struggle, loss, and her unresolved feelings for Will Traynor.  Luckily for Louisa, and for us readers, there is a group of people who truly care about Louisa as she navigates the heartbreak of trying to settle back into her ""normal"" life, 18 months after the death of the man she grew to love.The hole which Will leaves in Louisa's life is vast, empty, and so painful.  There are a number of new characters who slip into the space Will left in Louisa's heart; some are likeable, others take a while to warm up to.  There is one surprise newcomer who throws an interesting curveball into Louisa's emotionally comatose state, and gives her something to wake up for.  There is, thankfully, no easy cookie-cutter magical leading man to jump into the shoes which Louisa so wanted Will to fill, but there is something....something that takes Louisa on a journey which signals at least the potential for happiness, for meaning, for value in her life...and Louisa spends this book trying to find out what that may be.Louisa's journey helps her to find a place in her heart, and in her life, where Will still belongs...in a way she can live with, while still allowing her to look forward to truly living.  I'll not write any specifics here about any of the story or its characters.  I merely hope that I've convinced any readers of this review to read AFTER YOU.  It is a heartrending, personal, unflinchingly honest account of this special character's efforts to put a devastating loss behind her...and come out on the other side of it with her love remaining....love for the one she lost, love for those special people in her life, and love for the life she has the opportunity to reshape and go ahead living.  AFTER YOU is a different kind of magic than ME BEFORE YOU...but it is a beautiful story which reminded me once again of how worthy love is, even if we can't be certain that we won't lose it, because it is never wholly gone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYXIDRWWNH339/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426590#wasThisHelpful","RYXIDRWWNH339","A28SZ335IJ2U2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28SZ335IJ2U2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: Series reading order follows at end of review.WILDEST DREAMS is the story of Lin Su Simmons, the nurse-caretaker of Grace's mom, Winnie.  To best appreciate this story, I recommend that the series be read in order, especially in light of the developing plotlines of all the secondary characters.  Lin Su's charming son Charlie features prominently in this story, as he befriends new next-door neighbor Blake Smiley, an Ironman professional competitive athlete.  Blake's immediate attraction to Lin Su is supported by the fact that he is ready to settle down and find ""the one,"" and is even happy to find his ""one plus son,"" but he is impeded by a tremendous amount of baggage carried by Lin Su.  She's got serious insecurities regarding her ability to trust, to love then lose others, and huge roadblocks regarding her son's health and activities, her own history, and the conditions of her employment.  Lin Su rationalizes her fears and insecurities in order to allow her to isolate herself and her son...and she lies, to others and to herself, about her family history and her past with Charlie's father.  Although I sympathized with Lin Su, I did not like her nearly as much as I have appreciated all of Carr's other Thunder Point heroines, and this detracted from the story for me.Conversely, Blake is a terrific hero, and the best parts of the story for me were those dealing with Blake's character development as he works toward reaching his professional goals, closing old chapters of his romantic past, and gently and with great care, developing a relationship with Lin Su.Charlie's struggle to gain some independence was a high point in WILDEST DREAMS, and gave the story its most funny and touching moments.I have read the comments of a number of other reviewers who were discouraged by the length of time it took the H/h to get together and share even a first kiss.  I consider myself a patient reader if the payoff was worth it, so I accepted the author's pacing.  I must say, however, that the ending was a great letdown for me.  I've read all of Miss Carr's series, and she does end some books far more abruptly than others.  I enjoy a complete ending, or an epilogue, but I am more than willing to accept a cliffhanger as well.  This ending, however, was none of those things.  Unfortunately, after a rushed and somewhat difficult to believe final event at the very end of the story, we are given the most abrupt, two-sentence HEA which I can ever remember reading.  I literally checked and rechecked my Kindle, thinking my ""next page"" touchscreen location was faulty.  When I verified that I was at the final location number point of the book, I was truly shocked.  This is the first Robyn Carr book which I have been tempted to rate at less than a 4; the last scene of the book and the unfinished, awkward feeling to the ending are the cause.  The hero's charm, the interesting and educational value of the author's writing regarding Blake's athletic career, and the humor and pathos of Charlie's scenes allowed me to rate this story at 4 stars.  I'm hoping for a return to form and a stronger story as I await the next Thunder Point novel.Until then, if you have not read Miss Carr's (earlier) Virgin River series, then I recommend that you run, not walk, to get the first novel in the series, also titled Virgin River.  For me, it is Miss Carr's finest novel.  I still long for a visit back to that special place, and hope that one day Miss Carr will spend some with those wonderful characters again.THUNDER POINT SERIES READING ORDER (this series is best read in order):1.

"A beautiful, lyrical, romantic rendition of the classic story about the relationship which develops between Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett.  This version of the movie beautifully depicts the emotions and intensity of the novel.

"Reading STAY was a terrific surprise for me; full of action, suspense, and old-fashioned good-guys-vs.-bad-guys intensity.  I loved the first person perspective of David Sparrow, the stay-at-home dad with a skill set unlike your average next-door neighbor dad.  At times, the line between right and wrong is blurred as David does whatever it takes to assure the safety of his family and take down the heinous threat that will not go away.  We gain occasional perspective from the points of view of David's wife and the big bad mobster who sets all of the drama and homicide in motion...but the bulk of the book is in David's entertaining, thoughtful, skillful  point of view as he cleverly observes and identifies what should not be happening in his suburban family environment, and quickly steps up to the challenge of becoming the vigilante rather than the victim.

"SERIES READING ORDER appears at end of review.EARLY SPOILERS IN REVIEW (only in the setup of the story – not the climax or ending).This fourth Travis Family novel almost didn’t happen; the author indicated on her website that she had intended to leave the Travises as a trilogy of stories.  Thanks to Lisa Kleypas’ listening to her fans, she was persuaded to write this book to tell the story of the last single Travis sibling, Joe, who’d been seriously injured in a boating accident with brother Jack when we last left the Travises at the end of Smooth-Talking Stranger.Six years have passed since the last book was written, and as Brown-Eyed Girl begins, years have also passed.  Joe has healed from his accident, the Travis family patriarch Churchill has passed away, and Joe’s brothers and sister have married and begun their families, all of them becoming parents.  We are treated to glimpses of Gage and Liberty, Jack and Ella, and a very touching scene with Hardy, as he anxiously awaits news of Haven and their first baby, when pregnancy and delivery complications threaten the lives of the ones he loves most.Against this backdrop, Joe meets wedding planner Avery Crosslin, who mistakes him for an employee, rather than a relative of the man whose wedding she has been hired to plan.  Sparks fly, and there is major chemistry between Avery, who believes that there is a happily-ever-after for everyone but herself, and Joe, who has been burned by love before and is now sure and steady regarding whom he wants and his ability to commit.  Their courtship is full of twists and turns: undeniable attraction, Avery’s attempts to deny the significance of her feelings for Joe and her fear of rejection, leading to her pretense that she can keep their relationship to a light affair, the involvement of her close friends (her employees) who provide many comical and serious moments, and through it all, Joe’s steady, reassuring presence in her life, as he waits for Avery to realize, as he already knows, that they belong together.I was thrilled to see Joe finally get his own story, and the conclusion of Brown-Eyed Girl is Lisa Kleypas at her best, weaving a touching, satisfying, mature romance between a strong yet vulnerable heroine, and a sexy, charming alpha male hero who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.  Avery’s friends offer terrific potential for yet another sequel….and there is one love-hate relationship among her staff which this reader would love to read more about!  Here’s hoping that Miss Kleypas agrees!If I had one wish granted here, it would be to have the ability to hear Joe’s point-of-view directly.  All of the Travis family novels are written from the perspective of the female protagonists.  While I greatly admire Miss Kleypas’ ability to depict strong, independent, worthy females, I also long to hear the voices of the male protagonists she writes.  The Travis men are among my favorites in all romance genres, and my only ungranted wish in this marvelous series is that we’ve never been able to hear what the men are thinking, only what their women hear or observe.  Since it’s been years since we’ve had a Travis story, and Avery is completely new to the family, I felt a sense of loss in not being able to hear and experience more from inside the Travis inner circle.  It’s a tribute to Miss Kleypas that she’s created characters that her readers have missed so much!SERIES READING ORDER:1. Sugar Daddy – Liberty & Gage2. Blue-Eyed Devil – Haven & Hardy3.

"UP is my family's favorite animated film.  It is a heartrending, beautiful story of second chances, the value of family and friendship, and the meaning behind the very best parts of our lives and the people in them.  We laughed, we cried, and in the end, we were reminded to appreciate the value of every day spent with the ones we love.  Whether or not we accomplish our bucket lists, UP reminds us that if our buckets are full of love, nothing else that we have missed really matters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21GWIKXG0VGKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LK3DUQ#wasThisHelpful","R21GWIKXG0VGKX","A28SZ335IJ2U2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28SZ335IJ2U2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stepbrother Mine begins with Dana, a dedicated college student with aspirations for grad school, being basically cut off by her mother and desperate for financial support.  She decides to follow her best friend's advice and put herself up for ""contract"" on a website for rich men looking to purchase a no-strings-attached sexual experience with a virgin.  Dana expects to get $50,000 out of this enterprise, but she's shocked to learn that her contract has been bought by none other than her stepbrother, a man whom she had an unforgettable teenage crush on and who, ten years her senior, disappeared from her life without a word after having become her best friend, protector, and confidante.  We are introduced to stepbrother Mason in a rather awkward experience with one of his many subs; he has become bored with all of them, he tells us, even though he has a bevy of submissive beauties in his life on a regular basis, all of whom know and seem unconcerned that he sleeps with the others routinely.  Mason, when surprising Dana at an arranged weekend tryst (after buying her contract), immediately falls back into the role of the honorable and heroic older stepbrother.  He is unable to resist Dana's efforts to cajole him into a sexual relationship, but he tells her that he wants to take things slowly.I liked these characters quite a lot, and look forward to seeing how Dana and Mason's relationship progresses.  I was not impressed with Mason's behavior during his first appearance, and found his descriptions of his social and sex life to be unappealing.  The alternating points of view are a big plus, allowing us to hear both Dana and Mason's perspectives.  Part one is a solid start to an interesting three-part serial novel, and I'm convinced by Ms. Carew of the chemistry that her characters have together, and the emotions that run deep between them.  The 66-page length had me anxious to read part two to see if Mason and Dana can find enough common ground to build a relationship (hopefully without the sub club!).**I was granted a complimentary copy of STEPBROTHER MINE by St. Martin's Griffin in exchange for my honest review.**","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24MB5PM5DHQHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRI06L6#wasThisHelpful","R24MB5PM5DHQHE","A28SZ335IJ2U2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28SZ335IJ2U2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Please note:  SPOILER FOLLOWS.An Accidental Mother broke my heart.  Without any self-pity or over-dramatizing, the author tells her true story of parenting a child who grew to love her as his mother...and then losing him along with the man she loved when he moved on in his life without her.  Kindred's pain is very clear, and the only loss she focuses her energy on reversing is her relationship with her son; she wastes no time on the man who left her.  We are left with what most people who are abandoned by the one they love are left with...merely the hope that her future will reunite her with her child.  As I write this review, I still have a lump in my throat.  I found myself profoundly moved by this little book, and profoundly hoping that Kindred will be able to find Michael when he is older, and give him the journal she is writing for him along with all of the treasures she is accumulating for him while she waits for him to grow up enough so that she is permitted by law to reach out to him directly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFPJ5IUBTRFKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609530586#wasThisHelpful","RFPJ5IUBTRFKR","A28SZ335IJ2U2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28SZ335IJ2U2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased the Audible audiobook version of this title and listened to it in order (a must-do for this series); SEE READING ORDER at end of review.I must say that author Pamela Palmer has truly hit her stride in this third book in her Feral Warriors series.  I enjoyed the first two entries and reviewed them considering my opinions of both positive and negative aspects of the stories and the writing, but in PASSION UNTAMED I was pretty much blown away by the strength of character, story, and expression.  This story was so exciting, so rewarding at certain times and utterly heartbreaking at others, that I found myself completely swept away.  Palmer's character development skills here far outweigh what she displayed in her first two titles in the series; Paenther (a black panther Feral Warrior shifter) and Skye (a Mage witch who is also an Enchantress, able to ""call"" any animal with a special empathic connection) are her most rounded and sympathetic characters to date, and both of their backstories leave the reader heartbroken and utterly invested in these characters.  I was desperate for Paenther and Skye to find their HEA, but Palmer took her time getting them to first acknowledge the goodness in each other and then start to understand each other, and that was anticipation at its best!  The alternating points of view from each of their perspectives gave us a fabulous glimpse into the mind of Paenther, who had been tortured and permanently scarred by a Mage witch in his past, and who truly hated Skye for encapturing him.  Watching Paenther's feelings change from hate to grudging respect, admiration, and finally love, was a beautiful thing!  Concurrently, Palmer develops the story of the lost daemon blade, the efforts of the dark magic practitioners to raise their evil deity, and the whereabouts of Viper.  Viper's story is heartbreaking, and Palmer handles it in a sophisticated, thoughtful way, while leaving Viper's future still to be written, and the reader wanting more, more, more!The audiobook was once again narrated by the fabulous Rob Shapiro.  His ability to change his voice to differentiate characters is superseded only by his uncanny ability to breathe precisely the perfect amount of emotion into every character...never over the top, but always reaching an emotional apex.  Unlike my reading of almost all other books, I actually prefer the audiobooks to the print titles in this series, all thanks to the excellence of this narrator.All of the elements of this story seem to be racheted up a couple of notches from the prior books in the series, and the writing is so much more rewarding.  I cannot wait to begin the fourth book; Paenther's story has made me decide to download the next audiobook immediately, and I can only hope that Jag's story will be as thrilling, passionate, and touching as Paenther's.  Long live the Feral Warrrios!SERIES READING ORDER:1. Desire Untamed - Lion + Kara2. Obsession Untamed - Tighe + Delaney3.

"Happily, I was able to purchase this Best Manufacturers whisk (also called a whip) in an Amazon holiday lightning deal, so I was able to save about fifty percent of the current price.  Without a doubt, this whisk is an excellent product.  It is well-constructed and sturdy, yet flexible enough not to get bent during robust use.  Its chief additional benefit, for my purposes, is its shape.  The length and flat presentation of the wires is perfect for reaching the bottoms of my pans, and the position of the wires allows for perfect blending when I whisk gravies and sauces.  I purchased the full stainless-steel version, and all of the cooks in my household love it.  I recommend close inspection of the various models within the product information; click on each picture and you will see the various construction materials (wood, metal) and colors.

"Although music is a staple in my daily life, this is the first CD which I've posted a review for; I was compelled by all of the press, both positive and negative, about Taylor.  I have to say that I am completely impressed by her ability to deal so positively and productively with all of the negativity that comes her way.  Taylor also makes an impact in the way she is grateful and humble in her public appreciation of the many blessings which her success and fame have given to her.  The ""Shake It Off"" track has become a shield of mental armor for my children, and is something even my colleagues refer to when looking for inspiration to repel the negativity of others.  Taylor became a superstar long before this album; no matter what she writes and sings, it's all her....country, pop, whatever...and she is, in my opinion, a worthy role model for my children and all young people today.  I don't learn many lessons from celebrities; in fact, I feel that there are many lessons about what not to do in the publicized behaviors of many celebs, but Taylor is a complete exception in that regard.

"SEE NOTE AT END OF REVIEW REGARDING BUNDLE PACKAGING!HUNGER'S MATE PART ONE begins a four-part serial which continues the saga of the Shadow Shifters, which began in the Damaged Hearts serial and continued in the Shifter's Claim serial.  A. C. Arthur begins this new story with a glossary which is helpful especially to those who may not have read the two previous serials.  The setting is our current-day world with the addition of the supernatural shape-shifters, species of man-cats who exist unbeknownst to nearly all humans and who have a fully-developed hierarchy of their own government/protective elite.  Each shifter protagonist in these erotic romance stories finds his mate, whether she be shifter or human, against a plot wrought with danger, intrigue, and passion.In part one, shifter Lead Guard Ezra Preston has come to Perryville due to the possibility that the government may have learned of the existence of the shifter race.  He will perform a dangerous assignment at Comastaz Labs in order to ferret out a suspected government-backed plot to exploit shifter DNA.  Ezra is confident and as cool as a cucumber in anxiety-provoking moments at the labs; he is completely unprepared, however, for Jewel Jenner, an administrator at the resort he's residing in who stirs feelings within him that throw him completely off balance and bring to the surface painful memories from his past.  Ezra's past is just a dark memory, whereas Jewel's may cost her her life and more likely, her freedom.Arthur weaves an interesting tale; she's skilled at backstory, helping the reader to understand and sympathize with her main characters.  Another plus is the alternating points of view; we get to hear the story from both Jewel and Ezra's perspectives.  It is also gratifying to be reunited with characters from Arthur's other serials.  The story does suffer a bit due to its descriptive style.  In scenes centering on the emotional struggles within her characters, flashbacks, and interpersonal conflicts, the writing is at its strongest, particularly in the verbal battles waged between Ezra and Jewel; though they are brief chats, they are witty and charming.  The mechanics of the physical scenes, however, are less elegant; the descriptions of the physicality between Ezra and Jewel is not romantic or sensual, nor do their sexual encounters deliver the expected impact (perhaps due to many clichéd word choices during these moments), unlike the easy flow of other scenes.  The conflict at the police station seems staged, awkward, and a bit confusing.  In all, there is some choppiness in the descriptive narrative which led me to read through more quickly than I usually like to, slowing to absorb the more compelling scenes such as the flashbacks and emotional revelations.  Arthur does pack a lot of action, physical and emotional, into these brief 95 pages, but that also may contribute to the choppy quality due to the minimal page count.  It is challenging to set up the frame of the entire serial and still tell a story in a short first episode; considering this and the fact that Ezra and Jewel are promising characters whom I am interested in following, I am rating part one of this serial at four stars.  Due to the world-building and shifter vocabulary, and the return of Bas and Priya, readers would benefit from first reading the Shifter's Claim serial, though it is not a must-do.NOTE: THERE IS NO ""PART 5"" AS LISTED ON AMAZON; IT'S A BUNDLE OF THE ENTIRE SERIAL:The covers of the four-part e-serial each state that Hunger's Mate is ""a novel in four parts.""  Amazon's listing for Hunger's Mate Part 5 is actually the bundle pack of the original four-part serial in one title, either e-book or 352-page print paperback release. At this time, It does not state in the product information that there is any new material added to the bundle package title.  It is confusing to see this title listed as ""Part 5.""  The author's website clearly indicates that this Hunger's Mate title is simply the bundle of all previous four parts (not a new fifth part); the full print and e-book release will be available on the same date which the last (fourth) part of the e-serial is available---February 3, 2015.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R118DOUX86W3BW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OXLUI8G#wasThisHelpful","R118DOUX86W3BW","A28SZ335IJ2U2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28SZ335IJ2U2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I freely admit to the bias of loving every Megan Hart title I've read. A couple of them have broken my heart, and more than a couple have stayed with me in a vaguely uncomfortable way which I've come to expect from the best of Megan's books...she brings feelings and vulnerabilities to the surface of her characters which are so resonant they leave the reader exposed, moved, and feeling that something real, poignant, and almost tangible has happened in the pages of her books.Considering the above, it was no surprise to me that DON'T DENY ME, PART ONE was one of the most satisfying serial book entries I've read. The e-serial is a very popular book vehicle nowadays, but I've not started any series with a more satisfying and impactful first episode. True to her style, Hart's characters nearly jump off the page, immediately making the reader feel that they are flawed, searching, and very real. The protagonists in this story, Mick and Alice, were lovers within a tight group of old friends, each of whom clearly have an interesting story to tell. While giving us interesting and provocative snippets of the lives of this band of friends as they eat, drink and be merry (think ""The Big Chill"" a la Megan Hart), Hart focuses on the passionate but seemingly volatile relationship shared ten years ago by Mick and Alice, who are reunited at a special anniversary celebration of the group. The chemistry between them is as electric as it was during their affair, and the reader gets to wonder along with Mick and Alice if there is any way, after a painful parting, they can find their way back to each other.Hart's depth of characterization, her skill at developing her entire cast of characters, and her uncanny ability to hone right in on the deepest regions of the heart, especially the less ""tidy"" aspects of love and desire, set her apart from other erotic fiction authors. She writes with an edge that reminds us that in real life, there really aren't usually silver linings, and that happily ever after does not come without some cost. I get the sense of all of these elements in this first part of Mick and Alice's story, and the potential for the same in the stories of a few of the secondary characters in Don't Deny Me...and I can't wait to read more!All of this potential, set up masterfully in only 96 pages? Also, one plus which is not in many of Hart's earlier stories: dual perspectives written from both Mick and Alice's points of view; love it! I have never been quite so enthused about rushing to the next part of an e-serial book, but if you'll excuse me now, that's precisely what I am going to do next.*I was given a complimentary copy of this title from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.*","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R354GKBSUMA6LG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OXI1LQW#wasThisHelpful","R354GKBSUMA6LG","A28SZ335IJ2U2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28SZ335IJ2U2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Sagan changed the face of the universe for all of us; he got on television, talked about the COSMOS, and made the universe accessible to everyone.  His perspective on science and the universe is one still referred to today in many classrooms.STAR STUFF has beautiful illustrations, a big fold-out, and a number of vertical pages which enhance the illustrative value of the book.  There is extensive back matter for more serious students of the cosmos, and many anecdotes about Carl that make him seem just like any other little child who looks up at the sky and wonders...what if?Sagan's vision led to the inclusion of our world's ""friendly greeting"" message in every Voyager space mission; he encouraged us to think about the universe beyond our ""neighborhood of planets.""  In a world full of so much tragic breakdown of communication and connection, Sagan's message reminds us that we are all a part of this wonderful universe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28XUVW0IZZEN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NS3TEEY#wasThisHelpful","R28XUVW0IZZEN4","A28SZ335IJ2U2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28SZ335IJ2U2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series should be read in order; see READING ORDER AT END OF REVIEW.OBSESSION UNTAMED is the follow-up to DESIRE UNTAMED in the Feral Warriors series.  In this second entry in the series, we share the story of Tighe, the Feral Tiger, and Delaney Randall, a no-nonsense female warrior in her own right--she's a hardened FBI agent whose tragic past (her mom was raped and murdered when she was young, then her father abandoned her) has made her passionate about stopping criminals and fighting injustice.Author Pamela Palmer follows much of the same formula here as she did in book one; a strong female protagonist shocked to learn of the existence of a race of much stronger immortals who have forced her into their world.  It is again a pleasure to have the points of view of both the hero and the heroine presented.  The story alternates and moves forward between protagonists' voices, and that rounds out the perspective and character development in a very satisfying way.  There are also points of view of other characters in scenes throughout the story, which furthers the subplot and sets the reader up for the next book in the series.  Tighe is a very sympathetic character, and we learn so much about his broken past (no spoilers here!) that I felt even more interested in him than in Lion (book one) due to the strength and sadness of his backstory.  The author is honing her character development skills, it seems, because Delaney was also developed more than Lion's mate was, and we are able to truly feel for her as she struggles between her feelings for Tighe and her awareness that he and his brother Ferals kill for a living, and operate on the other side of the law.I listened to the Audible audiobook and was once again extremely impressed by the talent of the narrator; I'm very glad to see that he is narrating all of the books in this series.  The narrator's ability to render emotion in his voice and to differentiate between characters with a multitude of voice variations is a real plus.On the ""down"" side, I will mention only a few points.  There are omissions of events or information which seem obvious solutions to some of the crises befalling our characters (Why on earth did Kara remain inside the house when walking to the goddess stone to share her radiance would have radically improved the battle and danger our heroes were in?  And what was up with Paenther?  These are the immortals who constantly discuss mage magic, spells, and enchantments...and he skipped happily right into the most obvious setup in the story.  I'd have liked a more legitimate trap here; at times it felt that the story was leading the characters along, rather than the characters creating the story).  Also, there is excessive repetition, as in book one, of the same sentiments as our characters vacillate in their feelings toward each other.  Literally dozens of times both Tighe and Delaney ask themselves exactly the same questions as they think to themselves, musing about whether to love each other or not, whether he should allow her to live or kill her, whether they can resist the intense sexual attraction they feel to each other, etc.  A good deal of dramatic tension is lost when a character debates with himself a dozen times over the issue of whether or not to kill his lover!Happily, however, these flaws are diminished by the passion and intensity of the story and of the strength of the characters.  I was invested in Tighe and Delaney, and couldn't wait for them to find their HEA.  Palmer leaves us with her trademark cliffhanger ""hook"" into the next story, but she resolves Tighe and Delaney's relationship in a very satisfying, feel-good way.  I'll be listening to the next in the series, PASSION UNTAMED, in the very near future.SERIES READING ORDER:1. Desire Untamed - Lion + Kara2. Obsession Untamed - Tighe + Delaney3.

"The Feral Warrior series should be read in order; please see READING ORDER AT END OF REVIEW.DESIRE UNTAMED was quite a nice surprise!  I listened to the Audible audiobook, and was very impressed with both the articulation and the voicing of the narrator.  In a series about the supernatural shape-shifting ""Feral Warriors"" and the women they mate while attempting to save their race (and the world) from a number of evil supernatural forces, it was a true pleasure to hear a male narrator.  The majority of the dialogue was spoken by males, and hearing a deep, almost hypnotic male voice was an unexpected thrill!  The narrator altered his voice quite successfully to differentiate his characters, even making a noble effort to voice the female protagonist; Kara sounded certainly gentler than the male voices, though no one could actually call this testosterone-laden narrator feminine-sounding...but it worked just fine for me!  He had a mesmerizing voice, and it added substantially to my enjoyment of the story.The story itself was a solid alpha male-meets-mate and saves the world fare, with a few interesting conundrums added to hold interest.  The villains were, quite honestly, easy to spot; that, in addition to excessive repetition in parts of the story (Should I stay with the ferals?  Should I go?  Do I love her?  Should I hate her?) were the only flaws in the story worth mentioning.  Those flaws were eradicated by the strength of the author's character development...these characters are hard not to love!Although the villains, as I said, were not hard to predict, the ending was highly entertaining nonetheless, and had some surprising elements in it--enough to make me decide to listen to the sequel immediately.  DESIRE UNTAMED is an interesting, provocative new paranormal erotic romance series which will appeal to readers of those genres on multiple levels.SERIES READING ORDER:1.

"Quiet Dell is a fictional novel which relates a true crime--the grisly ""Ladykiller"" murders in the late 1930s by Harm Drench, the son of a Dutch immigrant family who lured lonely, middle-aged women by answering their lonely hearts newspaper ads, convincing them to turn their fortunes over to him, then murdering them.  One case led to the conviction of Drench, who under the alias (one of many) Corenlius O'Pearson, killed widow Asta Eicher of Park Ridge, Illinois, and her three young children.  The murder occurred in cold blood in an underground basement he'd built below a garage specifically, it appeared, for the purpose of bringing his victims.  The bodies of the Eicher family were found in  a nearby ditch on the murderer's property, along with the body of another lonely heart victim.This sensational story had been recounted to author Phillips by her mother, who had been raised in the Park Ridge area.  When she was six years old, she'd walked with her mother past the infamous sight after Drench's conviction, as the ""murder garage"" was literally being picked to pieces by people by people who'd visited looking to grab up souvenirs from the crime scene.  The story remained with Phillips all her life; she made mention of it in her first novel then later decided to devote a book to what she imagined might have been the events leading to the Eicher murders.Weaving actual court transcripts, newspaper accounts, and numerous real characters with a number of fictional characters, events, and dialogue, Phillips tells us the story of Asta Eicher's life, her choice to rebuff a  close family friend and suitor in favor of O'Pierson, and the events leading to, including, and following the murders, right through the trial and execution.There is no doubt that Phillips can write well, evoke poignant and effective images, and develop her characters.  For me, however, the story was absolutely overdone.  The fictional protagonist of the book, a reporter named Emily, takes turn with the specterized real-life heroine chosen by the author:  Annabelle, the youngest Eicher daughter.  Annabelle is nine years old through most of the telling, but she has the voice of a decades-older wordsmith--a writer--and never sounds like a child at all.  When she appears as a ghost, her musings are soap operaesque.  Herein lies a major flaw of the book--the absence of credible moderation.  It is at times soap opera, mystery, true crime, ghost story, romance novel, erotic fiction (which fails miserably), historical fiction...it does not know its limits.  Mash-up genre books can be very entertaining and effective, but if they are not ever reigned in and too many excesses are imagined and indulged in, the read seems to have a very sloppy, self-indulgent feel...and that is the case with quiet Dell.  Each fictional story element was pushed beyond credible levels and became impossible to believe, and with a true story as shocking and sensationalized as this one was, the added fictional excess was a fatal flaw.I was encouraged as a result of reading this book to look into the actual historical information surrounding this crime, and that was quite interesting (as well as disturbing, of course).  That research was the most rewarding experience I can associate with reading Quiet Dell.  I wish I'd read a different Phillips title first, because I'm not likely to seek out another of her books at this time; perhaps after my TBR stack shrinks.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28VQXKT3MPDNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439172544#wasThisHelpful","R28VQXKT3MPDNF","A28SZ335IJ2U2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28SZ335IJ2U2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've written a good number of reviews for Amazon as well as for publishers and authors directly, and I can honestly say that no other romance series has impressed or affected me as deeply as Sylvia Day's CROSSFIRE SERIES.  With thousands of reviews already written for the four books and sets currently available in the series, I will address a few points here which are outside the usual synopsis/review format.Firstly, the characters in this series--all of them--are, in my opinion, among the most rounded, dimensional, reliable characters in romance.  Miss Day's character development skills are simply among the best in the business.  Secondary characters are as complex and dynamic as the main characters in many other series, and Gideon and Eva are so real that I actually imagine them moving, breathing, and looking at each other with the intensity of all they feel for each other as their images pop so easily into my mind, thanks to the strength of the characterization and writing.It is tremendously rewarding for me to spend time with the Crossfire characters.  After reading each book, I've also listened to all of the audiobooks, and the narrator is superb.  She differentiates the characters expertly with her voicing, and even manages to express Gideon's passion and intensity.  The fourth book in the series, CAPTIVATED BY YOU, provides Gideon's point of view for the first time in the series.  This was an ENORMOUS pleasure for me and will be appreciated by any true Gideon Cross fan.  Although Gideon's narrator does not have the deepest, most masculine tone of voice, he has the intensity which embodies Gideon, and he conveys all of the singular focus which Gideon has for Eva, making the reader believe that Eva truly is the reason that Gideon draws breath, and able to understand how he could take some of the actions he has on behalf of Eva in his desire to protect and care for her (no spoilers here!).I must admit to being somewhat surprised and disappointed by a number of reviews which criticize and even insult the story, characters, and writing of the later volumes in this series.  It is my hope that new readers will be open-minded about the direction in which Gideon and Eva have gone.  Yes, the situations which befall them are sometimes extreme; this is a story about two passionate people who collide into each other with all the force and pathos of their personalities, and their relationship itself is highly sexual, emotional, and extreme.  Gideon's never been able to tell the reader how he feels prior to book four...so when you hear his anguish, his fears, his vulnerability for the first time, is it fair to call him weak or pathetic?  I say no; Gideon is written as a fully dimensional character, and the responsible reader will accept the notion that any man who could admit to having the profound need and emotion which Gideon has for Eva will also be intensely vulnerable to the thought of losing her.  Getting inside Gideon's head was one of the most vicarious literary thrills I've ever had!  Please, please, Miss Day, give us more of Gideon's POV in the next book!Finally, I am utterly confounded by those who complain that the author ""said this would be a trilogy,"" and have problems with additional books.  I say PLEASE keep giving us Crossfire stories!  Do we not want to spend as much time as possible with the significant people in our lives, those we've come to love?  Why not hope for the same time with our most compelling literary characters?  I IMPLORE Miss Day to keep writing this series.  Gideon and Eva are such ""big"" characters, living big lives; I believe that they have a lot more to share with us.  The cast of secondary characters is so strong that many of their stories also warrant telling.  I doubt that there could EVER be enough of Gideon and Eva to satisfy me.  When it comes to the passion, the pain, the romance, the struggle, and the mad love between Gideon and Eva, we can never get too much of a good thing.  I run a large virtual reading group of women who love erotic fiction, and the group grows monthly.  The Crossfire series is our number one rave read; in fact, it's been Gideon and Eva who've gained our group quite a few of its members!).  You keep writing them (pretty please?), Miss Day, and we'll keep reading them.  Promise!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZYDZPAHNII9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUMIKYI#wasThisHelpful","R1ZYDZPAHNII9X","A28SZ335IJ2U2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28SZ335IJ2U2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise of this series was interesting; shape-shifting human-animal paranormals finding their mates and being hunted by antagonist human extremists who want to eradicate them--a successful formula employed by more than a few PRNL romance authors.  However, the characters in OMEGA MINE continually lose their focus and trains of thought and action.  Often they veer into filibustering monologues!  The level of description in these lengthy speeches by each voiced character, and within all of the general narrative, make this story heavy, convoluted, and burdened.  Often the reader has to hang onto the plot line and wait for paragraphs of unnecessary description and musing while the thoughts of the character are repeated in a variety of ways.  An example:  paragraphs about vomiting, with three or four synonyms of the verb repeated, the detailed contents of the vomit and what had been eaten by the vomiter earlier in the day, the shape of the mouth, where he held his hands while vomiting, and on... We are waiting to learn what is happening in a significant event, but we are interrupted by paragraphs describing nausea and vomiting.  At another point, (secondary character) Emory is right in the midst of considering violent action to learn Mary's whereabouts from a women he wants tortured , and he stops to expound for (audio) pages about the notion of how Mary would feel if she knew...the feeling should have been a sentence (two max), not dozens of them.  The story was burdened to the point that it became frustrating, and these poorly positioned ""asides"" continually reduced the dramatic tension of the narrative.  Perhaps in print (text), where the reader can skim less interesting or repetitive narrative, these issues would not have seemed so pronounced, but the story suffered nonetheless.Another issue is the contradictory behavior of characters; consider the protagonists.  If you've presented your protagonists as ethical, loving, and victimized, you can accept and even expect them to be warriors defending their freedoms, but it is not prudent at the end of the novel to introduce (their) behaviors such as:  torturing their enemies, then healing them intentionally in order to re-torture, or playing versions of ""The Deadliest Game,"" in which our heroes express bloodlust over their plan to set their captives free, then terrify and hunt them, murder them in animalistic fashion, and feast on their blood.  I thought these were the good guys!Thus, an otherwise interesting story became a frustrating read/listen.  A good edit would serve this story well, and allow the plot and characters to have the opportunity to shine.  The main characters are interesting, sympathetic, and developed fairly well.  The romance is heavily sex-based, but the explanation of mate pairing just barely legitimizes the mindless sexuality between Diskant and Ava.  Finally, the narrator of the Audible version, which I purchased, had clear articulation and voicing, but she stressed multiple syllables and words in each sentence.  Although her intent was probably to add intensity, the overuse of stressed syllables (almost to the point of iambic pentameter in more than a few places) was an additional distraction and didn't allow for the emotional ebb and flow which makes more intense moments effective and dramatic.  A good story, but its execution did not live up to the story's potential.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FC2UDG59AB9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OYI2IE#wasThisHelpful","R2FC2UDG59AB9Y","A28SZ335IJ2U2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28SZ335IJ2U2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CONSUMED is the story of Olivia James, a ""good girl"" who catches the eye and then the heart of Seth Marc, a disillusioned young amateur MMA fighter who is making a run for the professional circuit while navigating a seriously dysfunctional family/personal life of his own.  Seth has never desired a real love relationship; he has used and been used by women, and has been hardened by (and nearly becomes the enabler of) his alcoholic mother.  Olivia changes Seth's life in many ways, and he becomes a better man by being with her.  Along the way, many conflicts and crises arise, including family emergencies, illness, jealous and competitive characters who want to come between Seth and Olivia, and many of the basic challenges which occur in a new, tenuous love relationship.The story itself has many similarities in plot, theme, and character to quite a few other series on the market (one has only to search MMA Romance to find a list of many titles which bear similar plotlines and characters), but because MMA and other fighting bad boys are such a hot topic in romance literature right now, it doesn't really hurt that the story doesn't offer anything essentially new.  It's still a good story about themes many romance readers enjoy, and Olivia and Seth are likeable characters whom we'd like to see find a happy ending.Where the story does disappoint, however, is in its actual execution.  The mechanics of the storytelling are often cumbersome and clinical, with Olivia narrating long streams of consciousness-style thoughts, and lots of ""telling"" instead of ""showing.""  I absolutely love description and detail when it adds to the richness of story, or to character development, or to imagery which enhances the atmosphere (mood) and the reading experience.  Olivia's long speeches, however, reflect every thought she has in clinical detail, whether it's about the way her washrag is washing each armpit (repeated use of that word in the description of many showers they took, together and alone), or the way Seth's ""tongue shoots out of his mouth,"" or how he runs his hand around which knee, which leg, with which portion of his palm or exactly which fingers touch where...so much mechanical detail in such repetition it cripples the story, causing the mood to diminish until there is the feel of reading a manual rather than a novel.  Also, there is an unsophisticated use of the characters to forward the plot.  Multiple conflicts ensue because Olivia appears completely unable to extricate herself from the touches, grabs, pinches, pats, and hip-holds of multiple men.  Rather than simply verbalizing her outrage at being manhandled, she simply stares wide-eyed and closed-mouthed at Seth, allowing him to have overused, profound physical reactions in order to develop tension and conflict.  Similarly unsophisticated devices are used in the behaviors of other characters such as Olivia's best friend and mother, bringing these characters very close to caricature (e.g., the careless, exaggerated, repetitive descriptions of Selena and Jackson's kissing procedures; just because we're aiming for a new adult audience does not mean this trope should be used until the reader is sick of it, because quite frankly, many of us are).  Other characters behave more dimensionally, however, such as Olivia's boss Mason, proving that this author has the potential to develop her characters.  The very brief epilogue, in Seth's point of view, was a nice touch; the novel would have benefitted from much more of his alternate POV.I listened to the Audible audiobook, which was adequately performed by the narrator.  Olivia's voice sounded age-appropriate, which is always a positive as it enables the story to be more believable.  Her male voices were also well done.  The narrator's skill was not, however, capable of overcoming the encumbrances which I described above.In all, the read was an enjoyable enough one for me, although a few times I rolled my literary eyes at the areas which needed polishing for this story to get closer to reaching its potential.  Had the story been tighter and more polished (better editing would go a long way), and had the characters been more dimensional and compelling, I'd have hurried to purchase parts two and three in the series.  For now, I'll be going on to the next read that's burning a hole in my bookshelf and, perhaps in future, I'll peek in on Olivia and Seth again to see how they fare in book two.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LY91QJOQH6VL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HX2VG6A#wasThisHelpful","R2LY91QJOQH6VL","A28SZ335IJ2U2D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28SZ335IJ2U2D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We used this tree stand this past Christmas, and it worked perfectly. Placement of the tree is simple, the foot-pedal locking mechanism worked as designed, and it even has a water level indicator to let you know when you need to refill the reservoir.One point to note is that the foot pedal has a release button, which will remove the tension on the levers holding the trunk in place, and it's pretty easy to push. If you have curious or mischievous children (or pets) they could easily release the tree and cause it to fall. The good news is that the manufacturer included a small hole in the mechanism, and if you put something through that hole it will prevent the release of the foot pedal.We bought a small padlock for this purpose. It seems silly to lock up one's Christmas tree stand, but we wanted to be better safe than sorry. I'd prefer if the manufacturer put some sort of child-proof and pet-resistant solution in place for this, but it's a quibble about what is otherwise a great solution.Bottom line is that we highly recommend this tree stand, and also highly recommend that you put something in the safety hole to prevent accidental release.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZR5WSJWGOULJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XRQUSQ#wasThisHelpful","RZR5WSJWGOULJ","AA6176V2HKG16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA6176V2HKG16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We searched long and hard to find this toothpaste. We were looking for something that was all-natural, fluoride free, and also foaming-agent-free. The last one was the kicker - there are many (many, Many, MANY) toothpaste manufacturers who proudly claim that they are ""Sodium Lauryl Sulfate Free"" or ""SLS Free"", but which still include variants of this industrial surfactant foaming agent.It's funny that people go to great lengths to eat healthfully, but then will brush with toothpaste that is, literally, toxic due to the fluoride and foaming agents. Leaving aside hysteria, the facts are that fluoride is a poison, and if one were to ingest the contents of a tube of standard fluoride+SLS toothpaste that would call for an emergency room visit and could potentially be life-threatening.Also, the size of a unit of toothpaste is limited by the manufacturers in order to prevent lawsuits over accidental ingestion (usually by children). Have you ever wondered why you can't buy a huge tub of toothpaste with a pump on top? That's why - the manufacturers don't want the liability of putting lethal doses of sweet tasting poison on your bathroom counter.Also, if you think you're *not* ingesting these agents because you don't swallow, take a look at an article on sublingual administration of medication, where you'll find that mucous membrane under the tongue leads directly to a profusion of capillaries, and substances in your mouth diffuse through them and pass directly into the bloodstream. They don't even pass through the normal digestive or filtering mechanisms of the body, they pass directly into the bloodstream.So, we have made the choice to forego the dental benefits of fluoride and the familiarity of foaming (via SLS) by using natural toothpaste. Yes, we might get a couple more cavities, but we consider that a fair trade when weighed against the daily ingestion of known toxic and poisonous chemicals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IYVKMBIVPBRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005RJHNWM#wasThisHelpful","R1IYVKMBIVPBRN","AA6176V2HKG16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA6176V2HKG16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our guest bathroom has ceramic tile flooring that becomes treacherously slippery when wet. We've had some random throw rugs and shower mats in there, but they didn't really work, particularly because they blocked the door from opening. The door has a fairly low clearance, so any kind of rug or mat with any height jams up under the door.Also, the bathroom is designed with a long stretch that goes from the door, in front of the sink, then to the front of the toilet area which is also where you step out of the shower, so this long, thin sized rug fits almost perfectly (could have used it a foot longer, but not taking any stars away).We did a hard target search for rugs that were both good for wet areas and also very thin, and this one fits the bill perfectlly. It's less than 1/4"" high so the door easily passes over it, the backing is rubber-y so it stays in place and doesn't slip, it provides good footing even when the feet or rug are wet, and it looks great.What more could we ask for (other than an additional foot of length)? Bottom line, this is a fantastic solution for our guest bathroom.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MX7M4DFH2JIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O3K9KU4#wasThisHelpful","R1MX7M4DFH2JIL","AA6176V2HKG16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA6176V2HKG16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a showerhead/handheld combo in our stand-up shower, and the hose for the handheld portion was just too short. The shower has a bench in the corner furthest from the shower head, and it's convenient to put one's leg up on the bench in order to have better access to one's...er...nether regions.However, with the stock hose our handheld wouldn't reach that far so I went looking for alternatives. The local box box (blue and orange) stores carry cheap-y plastic hoses, and they aren't any longer than the stock hose (about 5 ft.).Luckily, I found this one on Amazon and it was also available via Prime. It's 8 ft long, the coiled hose is stainless steel, and the fittings are brass - significantly higher quality than the typical plastic-with-chrome-like-finish that one finds, and also how our original hose was made.Bottom line is that I will be buying one of these in the future every time I put in a handheld shower - highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ5JPRMNHT7ZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G0KBWQ0#wasThisHelpful","RZ5JPRMNHT7ZC","AA6176V2HKG16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA6176V2HKG16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This vacuum has become an essential part of our housekeeping routine. It does a great job on hard floors, and a passable job on our medium-pile carpeting, and works great for a quick clean-up. We typically use this vacuum over the entire floor 2-3 times a week, and then do a deep cleaning with our Miele canister once or twice a month.We have two dogs who shed like crazy, so staying ahead of the dust bunnies is a full time job, and the convenience of this vacuum makes it a great asset. I can roll this thing out and go over the entire downstairs in less than half the time of lugging around our canister vac. This Hoover doesn't do nearly as complete of a cleaning job, but that's not really what we need most of the time - we just need to stay ahead of the mess, and this works perfectly in that role.I've been impressed with the battery life - I can easily vacuum our downstairs (1500 sq ft) twice on a single battery charge, and that's running the roller brush the entire time. That 1500 sq ft is composed of 1000 sq ft of medium pile carpet, 400 sq ft of hardwood or tile floor, and 100 sq ft of low-pile Persian/throw rugs.This is a bagless unit, and emptying the container is relatively easy. There is also a short hose that can be used with attachments, but it's not very long. Note that the trick with the hose is that you can remove the top handle (like a sword from a scabbard), attach that to the hose, and then put the attachments at the end of the handle, which adds another couple feet of cleaning reach. I've seen several online reviews and videos where people were simply using the hose with the attachments attached, without unsheathing the handle, and then complaining about the shortness of the hose. It's still not long, but it's relatively usable with the hose+handle+attachment combination.Bottom line is that we *love* this vacuum, but hate that we still have to use our big canister vac. I'd love to see Hoover make a version of this with more capabilities, and I'd be willing to pay more for a cordless vacuum like that. If you can live with the limitations of this unit, we highly recommend it as a specific tool (reasonably good cordless vacuum) for a specific purpose (convenient day-to-day cleaning).","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LLDBWK1ZMNUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IT5L49E#wasThisHelpful","R3LLDBWK1ZMNUS","AA6176V2HKG16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA6176V2HKG16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We used these hangers this Christmas to hang our family stockings on the mantle, and they worked perfectly. They have soft, rubbery coatings at the contact points, which helps prevent scratching or marring of the mantle wood.

"I have a home office, and for those of you who work remotely you know you're never sure when your work day ends. That means that there's never a 'turn-out-the-lights' moment to my day in the office, and I often ended up leaving my lights on for days at a time, or at least for several hours longer than necessary if I turned them off when shutting down the house for bed time.I tried a 'motion sensing' switch from a big box hardware store, but it wasn't sensitive enough to detect my presence in the office if I were sitting relatively still, like if I were concentrating on something for a long time. However, this Leviton unit is able to detect presence in the office almost perfectly.Also, this model requires that you have access to the 'neutral' wire at the switch location. This allows it to maintain power to the sensor without 'leaking' current through the line. It also allows this unit to properly support low-voltage (e.g. LED) lighting without any issues. They also sell a version of this occupancy sensor that does not require access to the neutral wire, but it 'leaks' voltage in order to get current for the sensor to operate, which will cause LED and CFL bulbs to potentially glow with faint light, and you may need to leave at least one incandescent bulb in the circuit to allow for enough current draw for proper operation.Wiring details aside, this unit works perfectly in day-to-day use. The lights come on instantly when I enter the office, and turn off shortly after I leave (15-20 minutes). There are a lot of settings and options, but what I learned with my first unit at a previous home is that leaving it at the defaults works best for me.The unit even has 'walk-through' logic, meaning that if it senses occupancy for a brief period, and then nothing else, it will shut off after a couple of minutes, assuming it was just a temporary walk through the space.Bottom line is that if need a sensor that is more accurate than the generic (cheaper) ones at the big box stores, this one works great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSQBB62UJT7OW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DA4NZ2#wasThisHelpful","RSQBB62UJT7OW","AA6176V2HKG16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA6176V2HKG16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update after 18 months: Well, we recently got an 8-week-old puppy, and our SpotBot is working overtime and still doing a great job. We keep it handy to treat accidents as they occur and it's fantastic - I'd rate it 10 stars if I could!Original Review:The SpotBot is a must for any household with an indoor pet and carpet, in my opinion. We've always had dogs and cats, and even with the most well-behaved animals there are bound to be 'accidents' from time to time. In the past we've attempted to address these spots in various ways - dry shampoos followed by vacuuming, renting big steam cleaners, buying consumer-grade carpet cleaners, etc. None have been fast, convenient, and inexpensive, until this SpotBot.Now, anytime there is an accident we simply clean up any solid-ish and/or liquid-ish material the best we can with paper towels, then grab the SpotBot and put it to work. If I had any complaint about the unit it is that I wish the cleaning area were a larger diameter - like a foot or more. However, the smaller cleaning area just means that for larger spots you may have to move the unit once or twice.So far this thing has been a dream. It's quick and easy to grab, easy to setup and use, easy to drain and put away, and it is allowing us to keep up with 'accidents' without muss or fuss. In addition, the unit can be used for manual cleaning by unwinding the hose and using the attachable head. With the hose and head you can spray cleaning fluid and vacuum it up, and the head has stiff bristles to help with cleaning. Both the hose and cleaning head neatly attach to the unit so you don't have to track or store them separately.Note that a couple of times we were out of their specific carpet cleaning fluid, and I used a dash of our liquid laundry detergent instead, which doesn't foam up or lather and seemed to work just as well as their branded stuff. I'm not sure if that's a good idea with regards to the warranty or unit operation, but it hasn't caused any problems so far.We've been pet owners for decades, and if I had a time machine I'd go take one of these back to my younger self and save myself a lot of hassle. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7WDZ79VW9MTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00450U7QS#wasThisHelpful","R7WDZ79VW9MTH","AA6176V2HKG16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA6176V2HKG16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We put in new carpet with thick padding, and we also repainted. When re-hanging the sliding closet doors the old white plastic door guides didn't work - they flexed upwards too much in the center, held up by the thick carpet padding.I searched around and found this alternative door guide. Although the current product picture is a line drawing, I found on other sites that this model number has a metal body. The upright door guides are a brownish/reddish soft plastic. They can be adjusted for the thickness of the doors by giving them a half-turn (like a key in a lock) so that they are perpendicular to the doors instead of parallel, which also servers to narrow the channel for the doors.Another nice feature is that the screw mounting holes are not at either far end, but offset to the side and about a 1/4 of the way in from either end (as you can see in the drawing). This makes it both easier to drive the screws and also provides a better mounting plane to hold it in place on carpeting. Meaning, if the screws were at the far ends then there would be much more upward leverage on the center when installed on carpeting.Bottom line is that these work perfectly in our installation, and feel well made.

"If Fall of Hyperion were better I would give Hyperion five stars for being a terrific setup. As it is, it's still a terrific setup, but the payoff is just not there in Fall.If you decide to dive into Hyperion be forewarned that it is *not* a standalone story, there isn't even a mini-climax at the end, just a cliffhanger that is enticing (if the follow-up were equally excellent) or aggravating (if the follow-up were a lesser work), depending on your opinions of Fall.Leaving subsequent books in the series out of it for now, Hyperion itself is fascinating and complex. The characters are diverse, the plot is intricately woven, and the tension ratchets up throughout. At the end of Hyperion I *cared* about these characters and immediately dove into the next book.Fall of Hyperion is not a smooth continuation of the story, or more specifically, of the story-telling. Chronologically it takes up right after the end of Hyperion, but the style of writing is markedly different to the point of being jarring to me. Whereas the characters in Hyperion were dynamic and three-dimensional, the newly introduced characters are flat and passive and I never felt I got to know or care about them.I'll probably continue the series, but after finishing Fall of Hyperion I felt relief at being done slogging through the book, which was markedly different from my excitement after finishing Hyperion.Bottom line is that I would recommend this book due to its unique and interesting composition, but I would also caveat that by warning the reader not to expect an equally brilliant follow-up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DJ5WALMMHIUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553283685#wasThisHelpful","R1DJ5WALMMHIUY","AA6176V2HKG16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA6176V2HKG16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We had a big family vacation with seven of us on the same flight, including our four year old daughter. Travel in groups is always a frenzy, and the last thing we wanted to do was add schlepping a car seat to the mix.I had seen this harness previously and had been mentally tracking it, and as our trip approached I did more research and decided to buy it. Bottom line is that it works like a charm.We were lucky enough to have seats with no row behind us so we did not have to worry about disturbing a stranger for the initial setup, although the impact to the people behind you is only cosmetic (there's a strap going under their tray table when it's in the upright position).One of the flight attendants came by and said that in 20 years of flying she'd never seen one before. I told her that her airline (American) states on their site that they are approved for use on their planes, and they even sell the harnesses there. I was worried she might question the device, but she was merely curious and seemed fascinated by it.Our daughter had no issues with it, which may be in part because it fastens similarly to the straps of a car seat. I'll echo other comments that the lack of a between-the-legs strap seems less safe than having one, but in actual use she felt quite secure.Bottom line, I highly recommend this to parents traveling with kids. It folds up into a small pouch, it's simple to use, and it makes travel significantly easier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13NKI16O0P1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012E4FV8#wasThisHelpful","R13NKI16O0P1B","AA6176V2HKG16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA6176V2HKG16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted a dart board in the game room, but with a toddler and dogs I didn't want the safety concerns of traditional darts. This dart board fits the bill perfectly!First and foremost, the actual mechanics of play are great. The darts stick to the board with authority. The board itself is well made - it's light-weight, but so far is standing up to use (and abuse) without showing any signs of wear.If you're a hardcore dart player this probably wouldn't be very satisfying, as the 'tips' are actually circular magnets so it's virtually impossible to group darts near each other like you can with traditional needle-tip darts. We only play for fun, so this was not an issue for us.Put it all together and this was a great purchase, great fun, and highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39ZSSYA2SBSKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BXKN30#wasThisHelpful","R39ZSSYA2SBSKR","AA6176V2HKG16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA6176V2HKG16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We moved into a new house and one of the bathroom doors wouldn't latch closed properly.  I could see that the door was about a sixteenth of an inch too low. The door hinges were 3.5 inches tall and used three screws, so these were the correct shims.I ordered them and once they arrived I had them installed and the problem fixed in about 5 minutes. To explain how they work, if you look at the product photo the actual shim is one third of the white square that you see - it snaps into three identical pieces.  You then use the number of shims stacked on top of each other that adjust the door the appropriate amount.For the three-screw hinges these are designed for, you remove the top and bottom screw from the hinge and loosen the middle screw, but leave it in place. If you see the far-right side of the shim in the picture you can see it has an opening on the right-edge, and this screw that is left in place slides into that notch.Once you've slid the shims into place, the holes at the top and bottom of the shims will align with the screw holes in the hinge and the wall, allowing you to put the two removed screws back into place.These shims won't fix every problem, but if you have slight alignment issues and don't want to take down your trim to re-shim the door frame (and re-paint), these can really do the trick - they are a really ingenious solution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17TCVAVWPWX21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DDAV3O#wasThisHelpful","R17TCVAVWPWX21","AA6176V2HKG16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA6176V2HKG16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First and foremost, the good news is that we love this mattress. Both my wife and I have lower-back problems and this mattress is a dream to sleep on and we wake almost every day with no sleep-related back pain.The bad news is that it takes some getting used to and/or modifying to deal with the absolute lack of side support. If you have a relatively conventional mattress you can sit on the edge of the bed without complication, however with this mattress the sides have no added support of any kind, so if you sit on the edge of the bed you sink in and begin to ooze forward and off the bed.The same is true if you sleep anywhere near the edge of the bed - you'll find yourself listing towards the edge due to the lack of structure in the sides. For the first week I always felt vaguely seasick because I was literally sleeping at an angle, with my right-side (closer to the edge) noticeably and visibly lower than my left-side (closer to the center).  My wife experienced the same issue, although to a lesser degree given that she's much lighter than I am.EDGE SOLUTION: The other good news is that I figured out a relatively cheap, safe, simple mod that solves the issue.  I wanted to upload a picture, but for some reason this item does not appear to be allowing customer images at this time.We use our mattress on a platform bed, and the bottom of the mattress rests about six inches below the sides of the bed. I took pool noodles (3"" diameter) and lined the left and right inner edges of the mattress platform with a double row of noodles (side-by-side), such that the far left and far right edges of the mattress rest on the two rows of noodles.  This raises the edges up a couple of inches, which is barely noticeable when the bed is made, and creates a bit of support for the sides that prevents list-full sleep.Once I was sure that this solution was working, I took the mattress out and used big, long, fat zip ties to gently secure the noodles in place so that they wouldn't migrate around whenever we moved the mattress (lifting corners for fitted sheets, rotating mattress for even wear, etc).So far this solution is working *perfectly* for us, and although I feel I should ding the mattress a star for this issue I didn't because a) it's so darn comfortable and b) there are people for whom this won't be an issue (e.g. people who sleep alone in the center, very thin/light people, etc).In any case, be prepared for a mushy edge experience and if you can handle it (or fix it) this is a great mattress.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BLQIHJLI48C5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0092UMVEW#wasThisHelpful","R2BLQIHJLI48C5","AA6176V2HKG16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA6176V2HKG16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We ordered this for our nearly 4 year old daughter, and it's great. First and foremost, be sure you have the square footage for this thing, because it is not small (9.5' x 8.5'), and note that the position of the slide, ladder, and fold-out desk cannot be reversed, it assembles just like you see it in the picture, period.What you can't see is the fold-out desk that's on the opposite end from the ladder - I didn't even know it came with the desk, and right now we aren't using it but I did go ahead and attach it so that it's there if/when we decide to use it.For us, the bed only went in one specific position in the room because we didn't want there to be a window beside or behind the upper bunk, because no matter what you do kids are going to jump around on this thing and we didn't want anybody accidentally crashing through a 2nd story window.Assembly is a bit of a chore, but pretty straightforward. The delivery box is huge and heavy - I left it in the garage and carried the individual pieces upstairs to the bedroom for assembly rather than trying to move the whole box.  It took a couple of hours, and having a cordless drill with the correct bits made things MUCH easier.With regards to the mattress, they recommend nothing thicker than 6"" so that there is still sufficient railing around the bed to prevent roll-offs during sleep, and after seeing the bed I agree. We had to get a different (thinner) mattress to be on the safe side.Now that it's in action our daughter loves it. She uses the slide constantly, and loves to go into the tent and play in the surprisingly spacious underneath area. The bed is solidly built, and feels like it will last well until the time our daughter is too mature and cool to appreciate a tent+slide+bunk bed. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8FP7EO799JA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AIR2KS#wasThisHelpful","R8FP7EO799JA9","AA6176V2HKG16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA6176V2HKG16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wear reading glasses which requires me to a) have them with me constantly and b) take them on and off regularly. Add to that that I often need to use my glasses while doing home repair projects or other physical activity where they would tend to get pushed out of position and/or fall off.I have used neck chains/lanyards for years, and these are my favorites.  I've been wearing them for a couple of months now, and although they are not perfect, they are the best by far.First, if you set them at the longest setting then they work like a regular lanyard, with the exception that you can't lean back on something (pillow, headrest) without pushing your glasses around, because the underlying wire is fairly stiff.Second, anytime I'm doing home repairs and/or physical activity requiring glasses, I can cinch up the spacers to shorten the wires until they are much closer to the back of my head. They don't get tight enough to actually pull my glasses up to my face, but they leave so little free space that they stay mostly in place.When I go to bed at night I switch to a pair of glasses without a lanyard, because these would be impossible to use laying back against pillows without dislodging your glasses.Overall I like them, they are sturdy, and they work.  Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35PLK73Y56JDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2TJD3E#wasThisHelpful","R35PLK73Y56JDY","AA6176V2HKG16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA6176V2HKG16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I work remotely for the same company and spend anywhere from 3-8 hours a day in meetings and conference calls, and are essentially on-call 7x24x365 and need to be reachable at all times. We moved to a new house and found that our cell coverage was very spotty, and we were missing calls and text and voice mails to a significant degree.In researching I found this item, which had mixed but generally positive reviews, and decided to give it a shot.  Bottom line, it works.Setup is relatively straightforward. This device connects to and uses your internet connection, meaning that your calls/texts/browsing actually go from your phone to the microcell and from the microcell over your internet connection to the cell network, so be sure you have a fast internet connection.  It also means that if your internet goes down so does your microcell.Once the device is connected it needs to find a GPS signal to validate where you're using it, and for that I needed to add the GPS antenna.Once the device is fully activated you can then control it via your AT&T account via the web. You have to tell the Microcell what phone numbers are allowed to connect to and use it, and they have to be AT&T numbers.I had to work with AT&T support because while our calls were working our data was not, meaning we couldn't surf the web, etc, over our cell connections.  They worked for several hours, were knowledgeable, but were unable to solve the problem and told me that the Microcell was bad.  I eventually fixed it myself by changing my internet router and voila, it started working for data.In use this thing works great.  First, battery life is MUCH improved because our phones aren't wasting energy constantly looking for signal and reconnecting. Voice-wise the sound quality is virtually indistinguishable from a normal cell connection. Also, if we start a call at the house and then drive away the call (usually) transfers to the regular towers without issue, but going the opposite way (coming home) almost always results in a dropped call.I didn't like having to spend my money to solve what is, to me, an AT&T problem, but in our situation our livelihoods depended on solving the problem, and spending a couple hundred dollars for it was worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYZBH42M44NFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004F1F9P6#wasThisHelpful","RYZBH42M44NFN","AA6176V2HKG16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA6176V2HKG16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wish I discovered these laces years ago. I cam across these while looking for some replacement laces for my running sneaks and the idea of not having to tie my sneakers and to have some elasticity in the lace sounded very attractive.  Lets just say that now that I have tried these laces I will never use regular laces in my workout or running sneaks again.  Working out at six in the morning evening tying sneakers can be difficult. I love that can just slip them on and not have to worry about double tying my laces, or hearing long laces flapping around or irritating me during a workout or run, or having to stop because the laces are either too tight or too loose or coming undone.  These laces just give me one less thing to worry about with my running sneakers and they make my sneakers even more comfortable. As far as size, I wear a womans size 9 running sneaker and typically wear just Mizuno's.  I leave the last lace hole free and tie my laces one hole from the top.  I ordered the 36 inch laces and they fit perfectly with just enough room to give some stretch, not be too tight, and allow me to tie off the ends right at the lace hole I prefer.

"I am an organization freak.  When I discovered these drawer organizers, I ended up purchasing about 10 of them to use in all of my clothing drawers.

I haven't had any problems with the 20 or so expanders I have in my drawers.  Sometimes they might shift a little but no big deal. I haven't had any of them break or not work properly.  I use them in all my clothing drawers, to keep stacks of jeans, t-shirts, etc. separated into neat piles and when I pull something from one pile it doesn't disturb the other pile as it stays in place nicely between the separators.

"I have tendonitis in my peronial and posterior tibialis along the bottom of my leg. I actually use Penetrex as a massage cream when working to stretch and massage the tendons.  As a massage cream, it works great and gives good traction along my skin. As far as reducing inflammation, unfortunately I cannot tell. I feel the relief I receive comes from the massage and stretching, the same as when I am working with the physical therapist or massage therapist and they are not using the product.  I do not feel any sort of sensation or anything when I apply it, such as a cooling or warming sensation. Since I need a cream to use for self-massage of my injuries, I just use this and have been for a while. Im not sure if it helps to reduce inflammation at all or not as I have not experienced any miracles or reduced pain and ended up having to go to physical therapy, but if Im going to use something it might as well be this rather than a regular cream. This is my honest review of my experience of the product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32HP53L08L8AB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026HDURA#wasThisHelpful","R32HP53L08L8AB","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed a freezer to keep all my ice packs in so that they were not taking up so much space in my food freezer.  There are not a lot of small freezer's out there but I did find this one.  This bugger is actually more powerfull than my food freezer? As far as being able to keep things frozen, this is more than qualified to do so.  I actually had to turn the freezer settings down a little because it was making my ice packs rock hard.  I keep this in my bedroom and it is extremely quit, I cannot hear it at all other than just a light humming every once in a while for a few moments then it stops.  If there is one negative I can say about it is that it builds up frost fairly quickly if you use it as a freezer.  I have been unplugging it every week or too to shave off the frost that builds up. This appears to be likely due to the hot summer air and humidity surrounding the unit. But this process literally takes me a few minutes to shave off the frost (it actually comes with a little plastic tool for this purpose). But the positive is that this thing gets back to freezing within a couple of hours. The stainless steel look is also much more attrative than a black or white unit. It is really a little power house freezer.  I am very happy with my purchase and if you need a little unit this is a great choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38BV95CNQ2SQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RHWT3M#wasThisHelpful","R38BV95CNQ2SQ9","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This shin wrap would be great...if it stayed cold for longer than a couple minutes. I am talking 5 minutes max that it stays cold after immediate application coming out of the freezer.  I used these on my shins after a work out to help with some tight tendon issues I was having, but they would literally get warm within a few minutes.  Icing requires at least 15 minutes of application to be effective so the fact that they get warm so quickly makes them non-effective if you are using it to ice an injury etc.  It's a great idea...if they could only use material that would remain cold for longer.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17DV05YE527KO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008O02AEW#wasThisHelpful","R17DV05YE527KO","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a pretty bad ankle injury and needed some protection and stabalization. I was surprised to find this type of boot on Amazon as I thought I could only get something like this from the doctor's office.  This aircast boot is about as protective you can get for an ankle injury without a regular cast and crutches.  This is a stepping stone for getting off the crutches and back to normal.  Seeing as though its a heavy boot, I have to say it's pretty comfortable.  You will not walk as though you are completely normal, but it's not hard to do walking around the house or work or whatever with this.  You can adjust the amount of tightness and pressure of the air chambers using a small pump to either increase or depress the amount of air that the chambers hold. So the amount of tightness is really up to your own settings. It's pretty easy to get off and on, once you know exactly how it's done, it can be done quickly.  And the inside lining is washable as well.  I am a size 9 in woman's and my toes barely pop out the end of the boot so it fits well.  This definitely helped in allowing my anklie injury to heel and providing me the mental and physical peace of mind of not hurting it again.  HIghly recommended and now that I have it I plan on keeping it forever...just in case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30CRPOZUZFIMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XX56M8#wasThisHelpful","R30CRPOZUZFIMI","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ""kit"" comes with a regular three blade razor, bikini area moisturizer, as well as the bikini razor.  The bikini razor is basically a razor, with a blade, that has a small comb like head.  So you basically use it the same as you would a regular razor, but the comb prevents you from shaving the area completely.  I would say it works pretty well at keeping the bikini area trim.

"I was looking for hand wraps to go under the new muy thai gloves for use with a heavy bag, without having to get the extremely long wraps that would take longer to put on. Unfortunately, these gel hand wraps were just too thick to fit into my glove. I think you would have to purchase a larger glove than you may otherwise, if you want to fit these in.  I also found that the thumb loop on this glove was pretty small and did not feel comfortable at all, and there was no way to loosen it.  It was way too tight around the base of my thumb, and I am a woman, so I cannot imagine how it would fit for men with larger hands.  Unfortunately, this product did not suit my need as it did not fit in my gloves and the thumb loop was too tight, so I ended up returning and just getting regular hand wraps, which fit fine in my muy thai gloves and wrap much more comfortably around the thumb.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTXYO9MELUZ3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009F03QKC#wasThisHelpful","RTXYO9MELUZ3Y","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this to hang a 100 lb heavy bag from the wood beams in my basement.  This hanger is EXTREMELY sturdy.  I will tell you that it was a slight challenge to get the thick long screws that hold this in place fully screwed into the wood beam, just because they are so long and thick.  I used my power drill to get it most of the way in but had more luck using a regular screw driver by hand to finish getting it fully installed.  I opted to go with this hanger over the one sold in the stores for heavy bags simply because this is made to hold more weight.  It has been holding up that 100 lb heavy bag with no problem and can easily absorb any impact or movement of the bag while it is in use.

"I have been dealing with achilles, calf, heel, and foot pain for almost 2 years.  I finally decided to purchase a night splint to see if that would help with the healing and pain.  This product works well at keeping your foot in dorsi-flex throughout the night, keeping your calf, achilles, and fascia at a stretch to prevent them from shrinking and stiffening up during the night.  The biggest challenge for me is after a couple of hours of sleeping I start to feel like it's squeezing my foot too tight and I suddenly wake up and need to rip it off my foot in urgency feeling like it's cutting off my circulation.  It is not too tight when I initially put it on but the discomfort I feel in the middle of the night makes me take it off.  Unfortunately, this type of boot is really the only way to keep your foot in dorsi-flex while sleeping so I would say its definitely worth giving it a try.

Also just to note, it is extremely easy to install the refill. Just twist the old one and take it out and then insert the refill and twist the top tight. Very easy to replace the old with the new. These do a great job at keeping the toilet bowl clean in between giving it a good scrub cleaning. Ive been using these for a couple of years because I have found they work far better than toilet tabs or other everyday toilet fresheners.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G0PDSK3QROGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BO9HXQ#wasThisHelpful","R2G0PDSK3QROGS","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had achilles, arch, heel, and ankle pain from running for over a year.  I am finally getting back into running after a year off due to an achilles injury.  When I wake up int he morning Im still dealing with limping around until everything loosens up. These Feetures Plantar Fascitis Sleeves have been a God send at relieving pain in all areas of my feet.  I wear these under my socks after showering in the morning and the compression helps to relieve the pain in my feet.  I wear them most of the day until I run and sometimes at night too.  These also work better than compression socks because compression socks target more of the calf and lower leg than the foot itself.  All I can say is if you have any type of foot pain...plantar fascitis, arch pain, achilles pain, heel pain, or ankle pain, you may want to give these compression sleeves a shot because they have been so effective for me I have 3 pairs and wear them almost every day, and I will continue to do so until I am fully healed from my injuries. Excellent product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QV77XQ9XJ294/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CF3AT9M#wasThisHelpful","R3QV77XQ9XJ294","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this because I figured it would work with sweet potatoes since it is considered ""heavy duty"" and other reviewers said they made it work with sweet potatoes.  On my first use, I split the sweet potato down the middle to make it easier to push through the fry cutter.  I didnt have trouble with the effort it took to push the sweet potato through but it did not cut the sweet potato well.  It made it about 75% through and turned the last part of each sweet potato fry into a shredded mess.  Also, the piece of metal that you lay the potato in ended up getting bent on the first shot.  After being left with messy sweet potato fries, I had to figure out how to clean the fry cutter.  The only way to do so was to remove the end piece and when I did that the whole thing came apart.  After my first experience I decided to return the product.  Not only did it not cut sweet potatoes well but it was way too much work for cleaning it afterward and attempting to put it back together.  I ended up getting an email from New Star about why I returned it and when I gave them the information in this review they said that this product was not meant for sweet potatoes and as far as cleaning, it is meant for more commercial use where it would be used in a kitchen etc. where it would be used multiple times before cleaning.  This may cut regular potatoes well but I would not recommend it if your sole purpose is for sweet potato fries.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GWIJXHIYN0VT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DVXLML4#wasThisHelpful","R1GWIJXHIYN0VT","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a pretty healthy person but I allow myself a little wiggle room to eat what I want on the weekends. Of course eating take out even once a week or bending the healthy food rules can leave you feeling bloated and icky. This fitmiss cleanse really does what it says it does. If you bend the rules on healthy eating or just feel like you need to flush the toxins out of your body then give this a try. I did not have any side effects from this but the way it ""cleanses"" you is by making you have to go to the bathroom. I especially found that a day after I take this, when I work out it seems to almost kick this into gear when your body temperature rises. So yes, you will have to go to the bathroom more than usual so plan for that when you take it, but it really does feel like your flushing all the junk out of your body and it also helps to get rid of bloating really well too. I like the results of this so much I bought a second bottle and just use it when I feel I need to flush myself of unhealthy toxins etc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31A1AK6Q84G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BD565L4#wasThisHelpful","R31A1AK6Q84G","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am always on the look out for sugar free low calorie drink mixes to add to water.  I have tried everything out there.  One day Target had these boxes on sale for $1 so I decided to try it out.  This is without a doubt my favorite drink mix out there because the strawberry flavor is DELICIOUS.  Yes, the fact that it only comes with 6 packets to a box makes it more expensive than other mixes but to me it's worth it.  Unfortunately, Target did not continue to sell these so I looked on line and stocked up from Amazon.  If you're looking to try a new low calorie sugar free drink mix, and you like strawberry flavor, definitely try this out.

"I have multiple different types of Drymax socks.  I have thick and thin ankle Drymax, no show Drymax, no show with tab Drymax...the are my go to socks for running and working out and when I need white socks to wear with sneakers. Drymax socks are extremely comfortable and very durable, great qualify socks.  I havent had a single pair get a hole in them after over a year's use.  I decided to try out a pair of higher Drymax Run Crew Socks for the winter when I need a sock higher than my ankles.  These socks are just as comfortable and durable as the other pairs I have.  They are thick enough to provide a bit of warmth but still very comfortable and thin enough to wear during a workout and with sneakers.  I have also worn them in my snow boots and they hold up great and dont fall down.  Drymax are the best quality socks I have come across.

"Twingings Green Tea is the best tasting Green Tea in my opinion.  I enjoy it better than Tazo Green Tea. The main reason that differentiates this from others is that it does not have a bad aftertaste.  It is smooth, fresh, and flavorful tasting and is an alternative source of energy and antioxidants if you want a break from coffee or don't drink coffee at all.  I have only drank Twinings Green Tea hot but I can honestly say that I think it would also be very good cold for anyone who enjoys cold green tea.  I would highly recommend to anyone who is searching for a great green tea in k-cup form that you try out this Twinings Green Tea.  This will be the brand I purchase for green tea from here on out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20HRH3SQ5OXEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006N3I99C#wasThisHelpful","R20HRH3SQ5OXEN","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have constant tight shoulders and neck.  I have an electric heat pad but sometimes I dont feel like sitting around with a cord hanging off of me. I also needed something more portable that I could throw on at my work desk if needed.  I decided to give this a shot due to the shape of wrap. It is heavy enough that it sits comfortably on your shoulders and neck and won't fall off without having to hold it, even if you walk around with it.  It covers the shoulders and neck area nicely and works well at loosening up muscles.  I put it in the microwave for 3 minutes and that's about as long as I can heat it without it becoming too hot to use.  Once heated it does give off a smell that to me is mostly chamomile scented to me.  It is noticeable but I dont like it or dislike it so it doesnt bother me.  The only negative thing I can say about it is that it only stays warm for about 20 minutes.  I usually like to use it longer so I just reheat it for another 3 minutes if it cools off to much.  That to me is kind of expected if you are going to use a microwavable wrap instead of an electric one.  All in all, I like it and Im glad I purchased it. I think the positives of the product outweigh the fact that I have to reheat it a couple of times to get a good hour of use out of it to help relax my muscles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26IKC5VQVGWX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W2H5Y6#wasThisHelpful","R26IKC5VQVGWX2","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is not necessary to use these freshening discs with the Bissell Steam Mop but I love the way it leaves the room smelling fresh and clean after mopping. These only come with 8 discs per package but I get 2 uses out of each disc to get the most of out them. I just remove the disc from the mop head after mopping and set it aside to put in a clean mop head for the next time.  To me, the fresh clean smell that these leave in the room after mopping is worth the costs and just adds to the clean feeling that is left after using the Steam Mop. I have not been able to find these in any local stores so I buy a couple boxes at a time from Amazon when they are available.  Definitely worth it for the fresh clean smell!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W4PFFSFHXBVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A6G3INO#wasThisHelpful","R1W4PFFSFHXBVK","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had 3 Swiffer SwiftJet mop's and all three of them the handle snapped and broke. After the third I decided it was time to upgrade so I decided to try the Bissell Powerfresh Steam Mop. This comes with 2 different mop heads, one with groves and the other with no groves.  They are fairly thick and both machine washable.  It also comes with scent discs that you can slip into the mop head for extra fragrance.  When you plug in the Steam Mop it begins to heat up and probably takes 30-45 seconds to do so before you can choose a steam level preference and start using it.  I always use the highest steam setting as it seems to be the most effective.  Once the mop starts emitting steam you have to give a few seconds for the steam to seep through the mop head cloth and make it wet enough to push around. You do have to be patient with this Steam Mop and move it back and forth kind of slowly to be most effective and allow the steam to penetrate the area fully.As far as performance, this works great at cleaning my floors and the mop head is always very dirty after use.  The steam is especially good at removing any spill spots that may have been missed during clean up.  It is very easy to use, all you do is fill up the water container, put on the mop head, plug in and go.  I do enjoy using the scented discs as well and have purchased more because they leave a pleasant clean and refreshing smell.  The only negative thing I can say about this is the cord is not very long.  I have mop the hallway and kitchen that are connected and I have to end up moving the cord to another plug and then waiting for it to heat back up to finish the room.Other than that, I am far more satisfied with this product than using a Swiffer SwiftJet Mop.  My mother told me she was still cleaning her hardwood floors Cinderella style so I ended up purchasing her one of these for Christmas.  Cleans well and easy to use, all in all a good choice for a steam mop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR851K433VUJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091YYUAM#wasThisHelpful","RR851K433VUJ1","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased a LeapPad 2 with a couple of games each for my niece and nephew for Christmas.  I immediately though to myself that they could easily lose the games if they had nowhere to put them as they are 4 and 5 years old and the games are very small. I also wanted the to have some protection for their LeapPad and somewhere safe to keep it when they weren't using it.  I purchased a LeapFrog LeapPad Carrying Case for each of them.  First, I want to say that even with the protective gel case over the LeapPad it still fits fine in this case.  That was something I was wondering when I purchased these cases but it does fit fine with the gel case on.  There are six slots for games to be held on the left inside of the case but they have stretchy bands over the slots so I think you could slide at least 2 games in per slot if necessary. The case itself is very good quality and sturdy.  When they opened their Christmas gifts I immediately  helped them unpackage everything and put their games and LeapPad in the case and show them how they should take care of their new presents.  I think they actually liked having the carrying case and being able to take things out and put them back by themselves and carry their little case around.  All in all this is a great product. Very sturdy and definitely a needed supplement to the LeapPad to protect the investment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I7FFK01PEIO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Z7H14M#wasThisHelpful","R2I7FFK01PEIO0","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are someone who finds yourself forgetting to turn off or down the heat when you leave or go to bed, therefore wasting money on oil or gas, then I highly recommend investing in a programmable thermostat.  That is why I decided to purchase this product...after constantly forgetting to turn off the heat at night or when I leave and being frustrated in the morning because I know it's a waste of money.  I decided on this LUX Thermostat due to the high number of positive reviews and I also didnt find it necessary to purchase an extremely expensive product.  I LOVE this thermostat and I wish I would have purchased 2 during the lightening deal I found on Amazon.First, it was super easy to install. I just shut off the power in the room I was installing, removed the old thermostat from the wall and wires, connected the wires to the new thermostat per the instructions (very easy to understand), drilled the backing into the wall, snapped the front panel on...power back on and voila. All I had to do at that point is program it.  It allows you to set a morning, day, evening, and night setting for each day of the week.  You set the time and temperature for each setting, for instance I have mine set for the heat to turn down to 60 degrees at 9:30 (so the heat just turns off and stays off unless the room gets colder than 60 degrees) and then for the heat to turn on to get back up to 68 degrees at 7:30 in the morning. I set mine for a lower temperature during the day when Im not around and then to turn back up to 68 degrees at 6 pm.  You also have the ability to override the programmed settings and change the temperature at any point and it will stay however you put it until the next time setting.This has been a very convenient product to have.  I dont have to worry about forgetting to turn the heat off and wasting money.  It is also much more attractive than a standard thermostat as well.  All in all, this is a great choice for a programmable thermostat and well worth the investment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R344P1LAWP1TEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I7MANA#wasThisHelpful","R344P1LAWP1TEV","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These wipes work well at cleaning off the lenses of my glasses.  They dont leave any streaks or anything and they make my glasses crystal clear.  The one thing I will tell you is after you wipe your glasses there are wet beads that always remain on your lenses from the wipe so you will need a microfiber cloth or something of that sort to dry them and as long as you use a dry wipe that doesn't leave any residue you will end up with crystal clear lenses.

"I have purchased both these shorter and the CEP tall compression socks and I definitely find the tall socks to be more effective.  I thought maybe these would provide more compression in the foot area but the only real compression is around the angle and lower leg.  If you need or want compression in your ankle area this will provide you that, but if you want compression around your foot or calves, these won't work.  At least the tall ones provide compression around the full calf, which is effective during and after workouts to enhance blood flow and recovery.  It all depends on what you're looking for in the product but I was expecting more compression in the foot area but these only compress the ankle area.

"I have been struggling with achilles issues for a year now. I was a 7 mile a day runner and had to completely stop running for the past year to allow my achilles to heel.  When I started to slowly run again I could feel the pain coming back so I backed off for a couple months.  I did some research and found this CEP Rx Achilles Brace.  I like CEP's compression products a lot and know they have high quality products so I decided to give this brace a try, despite the steep price. I actually ordered 2 of them, one for each foot.  When I initially tried them on I was surprised that they didnt provide more compression so I contacted CEP and they informed me that this product is more for support than compression and is not meant to be as tight as their socks and other compression products.  The first time I ran with this brace I IMMEDIATELY felt a difference.  The gel material that surrounds the achilles on the back of the brace helps to keep it supported and tight enough to now allow a lot of movement, therefore preventing injury.  It also helps to prevent any irritation of the achilles. I also have not experienced an post-workout swelling or inflammation of my achilles as well. I honestly wish I had found this a year ago.  Not only do I feel the difference during and after my workouts, but I feel more confident wearing this knowing I have the support. This is a great product and definitely worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24GH4CW7HEBBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JT7J2Y#wasThisHelpful","R24GH4CW7HEBBR","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this to add to my tools to help relieve my achilles pain and tightness.  It definitely feels good, is easy to use, and helps to stretch out the tendons and muscles in the bottom of of the foot.  I have tried to put it in the freezer after seeing other reviews that the using it cold provides extra relief but I dont feel it gets very cold and the little amount of cold it absorbs fades pretty fast.  It is smaller than I thought from the picture, about the size of a hot dog bun in length, but it's fine for use on on the bottom of the foot. If you need something to throw on the floor and roll your foot around on to relieve foot tension, plantar fascitis, or achilles pain, this is a nice little tool to have on hand.

"Ive had achilles tendonitis for about a year and getting inserts was one of the things I learned I needed to help support my arch and heel.  Last year, I researched the Superfeet line an ended up getting the berry ones because I thought they were more tailored toward women.  After using them a few months I didnt feel like they were helping so I decided to try Sole inserts.  The Sole inserts you heat up in the oven and they are supposed to mold to the shape of your feet. I liked them at first but the more I wore them the problem I found is that they felt really bulky.  They made my running and workout sneakers tight and uncomfortable. I recently decided to give Superfeet a try again but get the highly rated Green Superfeet after seeing on their website that there actually is a different in the amount of support from Green to Berry. Now I wish I would have gotten Green a year ago.  These inserts have completely extinguished the achilles and heel pain I feel during a workout. I can't even believe it.  They are amazingly supportive but at the same time they do not make my sneakers tight and uncomfortable.  I already ordered a second pair and will probably put them in every shoe that allows for replaceable inserts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZMFZCHP89VYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002T0072U#wasThisHelpful","R2ZMFZCHP89VYJ","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All this is, is a strap with some loops in it. That being said, it is so incredibly helpful to use during stretching exercise.  I am and always have been a very active and healthy individual, but stretching has always been my weak spot.  I finally decided I needed to start integrating stretching into my day for my own good and due to constant tight muscles.  Because I am so inflexible, I decided to get this strap to help me out a bit and now I use it every day.  I use it to help stretch out my legs, calves, quads, and any muscle I can in my legs.  But the biggest help has been with my upper back and shoulder tightness.  I basically go out onto my deck and throw this strap around the deck rail and lean back and put all my weight backward while looping the straps around my arms and it stretches out all of the muscles in my upper back. It has helped with the tightness in my upper back and shoulders IMMENSELY. Far more than even massages have helped, stretching has provided far more relief and this simple strap helps me to do the stretches I can't do on my own.  This is a great supplement to a stretching routine and I highly recommend it.  It's simple but extremely helpful and effective with stretching.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9E0KO9UYSU31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00065X222#wasThisHelpful","R9E0KO9UYSU31","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this Stick to help me with my stretching and loosening up my calf and quad muscles.  Not only does this stick do a great job at loosening up muscles but it does it while feeling great at the same time.  Its like getting a massage that is the perfect amount of pressure. I have also used this on my neck and it feels great there too. You can probably use it anywhere although you may need someone else to use it on  you for the touch to reach spots like the back.  If your someone who wants a little extra help with stretching and muscle relaxation this is a great tool to help do so. It really helps loosen up muscles and feels great at the same time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZE278D6KVHQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001O0H436#wasThisHelpful","RZE278D6KVHQU","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased 2 of these Dns Night Spints with the hopes they would help with my recovery from achilles tendonitis.  The first thing I will say is that these do not actually stretch out your achilles.  I tightened them as much as possible and it left my foot in a comfortable 90 degree angle, which is not enough of an angle to actually stretch the achilles, not even a little stretch. I felt nothing as far as a stretch.  Irregardless, I tried to wear these for one night and I made it about an hour into sleep before I had to take them off.  I was so uncomfortable and I wasnt going to let a product that didnt provide an effective enough stretch to make a difference disrupt my sleep.  I am someone who likes to find the cold spot in my sheets for my feet and these splints just were too hot and bulky for me.  Some may be willing to put up with the uncomfortableness but if you're looking for a splint where you can feel the stretch, these will not give you that. I ended up returning them both unfortunately.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19MMVODTA7MKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015TESE4#wasThisHelpful","R19MMVODTA7MKM","A20BC3R2NBN646","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20BC3R2NBN646?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"OK, so you have had your phone for a while and the micro USB connector just doesn't fit well anymore.  It get's disconnected due to vibration in the car, and you have to hold your tongue just right to charge your phone.  Why not use a wireless charger you say?Yes, this is wireless in regard to the idea that you don't have to plug a wire into the phone, but it has a wire to provide power from your power source to the charging pad.  This device IS more efficient than wireless chargers, as it relies on direct physical connection to your phone case rather than transmitting electricity using electromagnetic waves (which causes some energy loss in the form of heat).  BUT, you now have to line up your phone case directly on the pad to make those little pins line up.  That can be hard to do since you can't see them when the phone is on the pad.  In addition, vibration on the road (I have a gravel road) can make those connections fail.For my purposes, a Qi wireless charging pad is more utilitarian, and more forgiving in regards to placement of the phone on the pad.  In addition, I can use any phone back cover (I like to pick ones with style and flair) instead of a proprietary cover that has those electrical connections on it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D8MNV55ZUXPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5WJS4O#wasThisHelpful","R3D8MNV55ZUXPS","A18WUUFY45DOWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18WUUFY45DOWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these tires at Ford Quick Lane, they installed for 13.68 each.  Free road hazard, balance and rotation for life.  70,000 miles warranty tire was less than I had hoped for - but after several experiences feeling jipped when I took a 100,000 tire for a warranty exchange (they find all kinds of reasons to discount the warranty, (eg sidewall damage, road hazards, uneven tread wear, etc.)  I went with these.  I have to say, they exceeded my expectations.  This is a nice quite tire that handles water well, drives up my gravel road in mud and dirt conditions with no problem, and seems to retain reasonable traction in icy conditions.  Quick lane also offered a 70.00 rebate which they doubled for a total of 140 back- my out the door cost for 4 tires was 228 and change - Good price, great tire, and free road hazard warranty ( a $20 upcharge per tire normally ).  (*price before rebate was $368 including tax).  Please do shop around for your best price, but when you finish - BUY THIS TIRE.  It performs, and that's what really matters - your safety.I've run top of the line Michelin and Uniroyal tires on my Camry in the past and these ride just as good, and perform as well or better.  The Pirellis I tried were a poor performer on my car (less than half the advertised treadwear), and the goodyear tires were nice for the first 50% of tread wear then very poor in rain.  After all that, I'm just now buying my second set of Hankook tires, and I'll likely be putting them on all my cars in the future.  Oh, and yes, I got the full 70,000 miles out of my tires before I had to replace them - not due to loss of traction, but more a sense of propriety as lincoln's head was nearly visible on my ad hoc 'penny test'.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BGZ49FND9P2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QL6ATY#wasThisHelpful","R3BGZ49FND9P2H","A18WUUFY45DOWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18WUUFY45DOWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This cane is sturdy in spite of being collapsible.  It's light, yet functional, and I find that the glow in the dark handle and tip are actually helpful at night.  In addition, the metal is solid enough I'm certain poking an assailant with it would injure him enough to deter him.  I have considered filling it with sand or epoxy as I don't break it apart much.  I think instead, a solid bit of rebar would do the trick nicely - the lightness doesn't matter to me that much, and it would present quite a surprise to someone thinking me a defenseless old man!  I've also considered a high powered LED flashlight inside the handle, which is hollow with a DRIVE labelled cap on it.

"The product website shows this being used inside a home, this I do not recommend.  The propane odor is evident after just a few minutes, and the possibility of personal injury is high if you do so.With that lone caveat, I must say that I wholeheartedly recommend this product for your home.  It comes with a lengthy propane tube, regulator, nifty lid and carry handle.  It works very well.  I have found that it's lacking an piezoelectric ignitor is not an issue.  I put a dab of hand sanitizer on a rock, light that, then turn on the gas.It puts out a lovely yellow/orange flame, the rocks (unexpectedly) glow a brilliant orange and retain heat for quite some time.  For short periods you could use in inside - we did during a freeze in Georgia.  We had a large space with ample air flow though.  I used to use firewood in a firepit on the deck during evenings for gatherings.  Now I use this.  The amount of time and effort I save is AMAZING!!!On high, a full 20lb propane tank burns for about 12 hours.  On low make that closer to 20.  DO NOT BUY THE REFILL TANKS.  Take your tank to a hardware store and refill it.  The exchange tanks hold 12-15lbs propane, a hardware store will fill you up to 25lbs for much less money, and you get more propane for the bargain!  A refill tank only lasts about 8 hours.  We did several continuous burns and this was an obvious difference for us.  If you just used it intermittently, you might have let the exchange tank company rip you off and not noticed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT2XK9J5IMV2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KY4S388#wasThisHelpful","RT2XK9J5IMV2T","A18WUUFY45DOWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18WUUFY45DOWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife loves wine.  I open the bottles.  We've been married over 20 years - I've opened a LOT of bottles.  At first glance this appears to be just a standard corkscrew type opener.  IT IS NOT.Standard openers get strained as you pull the cork - just above where the corkscrew goes into the cork, the corkscrew bends.  The actual metal corkscrew bends.  Either that or the hinge where the metal lever you place on the bottle top fails.  Every time.  One of these two parts fails in time.This corkscrew is different.The reason standard corkscrews fail is that when you fully insert a corkscrew into the cork (*as you must do with real corks to prevent breaking the cork in the bottle) you are exerting force on the handle at an angle so that your pull isn't straight up out of the bottle.This corkscrew resolves that issue.  It has a springloaded hinge midway on the lever that you place on the bottle.  Once you fully insert the corkscrew, you push the spring loaded portion onto the bottle top and pull the cork part of the way out.  Release the spring and pull the cork the rest of the way out in the conventional manner.  In many cases the cork is out enough already that I simply grasp it and remove it by hand.The shorter lever arm allows the corkscrew to pull the cork straight up out of the bottle with less total force than used in a conventional corkscrew.  You aren't wasting any effort in angular motion bending your tool!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTUAPFD8NIW0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00400OL92#wasThisHelpful","RTUAPFD8NIW0T","A18WUUFY45DOWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18WUUFY45DOWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The difference between this unit and mine is the added features, if the pump is on the drum WATCH OUT!ALERT ALERT ALERT - BEFORE YOU BUY A SAMSUNG READ THIS - ALERT ALERT ALERTHi folks - I hate to be an alarmist, but I have information you NEED TO KNOW about Samsung and other washing machines of this general manufacture.  I bought the 50 version of this washer (WA50) and after 2 years it failed.  It wasn't anything we did, it was a KNOWN issue with the manufacture of the machine.  You see, when it's ready to drain there's a pump that pushes the water out the exhaust tube into your drain pipe.THAT PUMP can easily crack, break, and fail - causing the machine to dump all it's water onto the ground.Until that happened this was a perfect washing machine for our family, worked flawlessly, saved water and energy, we were happy.How can you know if you got a model with the crappy drain pump?  In general the crappy pump is attached to the tub itself, right on the drum.  You simply tilt your machine up and look.  Follow the water exhaust/discharge hose from the outside of your machine to a cylindrical device that's (hopefully) attached to a hose that goes to the drum.  If the pump is on the drum, you got a bad one!The Samsung repair guy came out to repair mine and told me all about this issue.  I asked what makes the decision whether you repair one out of warranty (I was at 2 years the machine has a 1 year warranty - because the pump isn't part of the DRIVE TRAIN 10 year warranty.)  His response: whether the customer complains enough.Yes, my machine got fixed - but the customer service gave me a serious run around (over 4 hours on the phone).  One of the managers even had the audacity to call me, and left me the wrong return phone number THREE TIMES!!!  (*or does Samsung market time shares?)Their stellar lack of customer service and desire not to stand by their defective merchandise has earned Samsung this negative review and my warning.  Be sure your pump is mounted to the machine frame at the base of the unit NOT THE DRUM.  It makes sense if you think about it.  The drum sees a lot of vibration, a plastic pump mounted to that vibrating behemoth is bound to fail.SAMSUNG customer service works for Samsung, not you.

I asked what makes the decision whether you repair one out of warranty (I was at 2 years the machine has a 1 year warranty - because the pump isn't part of the DRIVE TRAIN 10 year warranty.)  His response: whether the customer complains enough.Yes, my machine got fixed - but the customer service gave me a serious run around (over 4 hours on the phone).  One of the managers even had the audacity to call me, and left me the wrong return phone number THREE TIMES!!!  (*or does Samsung market time shares?)Their stellar lack of customer service and desire not to stand by their defective merchandise has earned Samsung this negative review and my warning.  Be sure your pump is mounted to the machine frame at the base of the unit NOT THE DRUM.  It makes sense if you think about it.  The drum sees a lot of vibration, a plastic pump mounted to that vibrating behemoth is bound to fail.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NNYO6DDPWOHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMHZK1Y#wasThisHelpful","R1NNYO6DDPWOHJ","A18WUUFY45DOWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18WUUFY45DOWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I published a review about these discs several days ago, but it is no longer available on Amazon.  For some reason they purged all reviews.  Fortunately for you, I have the time to post a new one.In addition, I've learned more about these discs that you NEED TO KNOW BEFORE BUYING:The BD-R discs are compatible with most existing BD-R drives.  HOWEVER THE CD-R and DVD-R are NOT!!!!!!!!!!Ritek(dot)com provides this information on their website for Mdisc.  Look in their FAQ section, the third item explains it.(*Good thing I bought the BD-R!)Now to the GOOD PART:  Assuming you can burn an Mdisc BD-R you save a TON of money using them - providing keeping your data is important to you.  Prior to the MDisc you had to reburn your BD-Rs and DVD-Rs every 6mos to 1 year to prevent data loss due to degradation.  Mdisc claims 1000 years durability - but even at 10% of that you save money and a TON of time.  At the current cost of $6 per disc, compared to .50/BD (quality stuff not mass-trash manufacture) over 100 years you pay $6 for an Mdisc, and as much as $100 for conventional BD-R media.  When you factor in the possiblity of spending $1000 for the full life of an Mdisc, and all the time you spend recopying all those BD-R 1-2 times a year....  Wow these become a no brainer.This year I backed up 2.5TB of pictures onto Mdisc and gave them to my wife, with a backup copy now in the safe deposit box.  I also put all our financials and all of our tax returns for the last 15 years onto another separate disc now in that safe deposit box.  I filled that disc out with our wills, medical information, and complete list of our assets.  I also created a trust for a local charity, with a brief video of my intent with the donation I made so that those who benefit hundreds of years from now can understand the mindset of this benefactor from their very ancient past.I baked one of these discs into our Christmas Lasagna - Quite a way to unveil my present to the family - an enduring history of our lives.  IT PLAYS!!!Imagine your reaction today if you were to find a 30 minute movie made 1000 years ago.  Perhaps Leif Ericson discovers ""Vinland"" (possibly L'Anse aux Meadows, Canada) reputedly becoming first European to reach North America!  Maybe you see the supernova witnessed by ancient Egyptians, or perhaps you get to see Cnut the Great (or Canute), King of Denmark, claims the English throne after the death of Edmund 'Ironside'.  No, I doubt my poor efforts will ever compare with these great moments in history - then again, perhaps they will.  BECAUSE THEY WILL SURVIVE.  I did preserve a nice video of the geminid meteor shower from this year as well as my disdain for our current president.  Who knows, maybe some kid in the future will be prompted to understand what a 'government' was as a result!Remember the episode of Star Trek when V..G.ER returns from the other side of the galaxy as a sentient artificial life form>?  These discs are supposed to last longer than that space trip took!

"The keychain lights are dim, but a nice bonus gift - as is the box.  That said, the LED lights are worth it by themselves.  Last year I bought 14 of these on Amazon for about $5.50 each.  The deal I am looking at has them at $11 with bonus items.  In addition, I have tested these lights - which you will find rated at 300 or 500 lumens.  I ordered some of the 500 lumen models to test them and with an AA battery they put out the same brightness of light I got from my earlier purchase lights that were rated at 300 lumen.  The brightness in both the old and new flashlights increased with the 14500 battery.  As such, and in the absence of contradictory information, I would recommend purchasing some rechargable 14500 batteries and a charger to go with these flashlights.  They last longer and put out more light on these batteries.As an afterthought I disassembled the heads of the old and new lights - the LED appears to be the same size with comparable electronics controlling it.  I have yet to note any adverse effects from using the 14500 batteries in my older 300 lumen flashlights as well.Hope this information helps you to make your buying choice wisely!I did a little investigation on the various forms of CREE bulbs currently in these small flashlights.  Light output at a given voltage and amperage does improve as you move up to better 'bulbs' you can go right to the cree website and check my information if you wish.  Basically the newer the CREE technology the better it is - but those differences can be small compared to the cost of the upgrade.  These go in ascending order for brightness as follows:  1 MC-E  2 MT-G2  3 XB-D  4 XM-L  5 XM-L2  6 XP-C  7 XP-E  8 XP-E2  9 XP-G  10 XP-G2  11 XR-C  12 XR-E  13 XT-ENow, the LUMENS - or brightness the LED emits is also dependent on power supplied to it.  For example a CREE XM-L T6 bulb at 3000mA produces 975 Lumens max, whilst a more expensive CREE XM-L2 T6 produces 341Lumen at 700mA.  (*It can produce 1100 lumens at 3000mA power).Why did I go into all this detail?  BECAUSE YOUR BATTERY POWER SOURCE MATTERS.  If your battery can produce more mA for the LED, then you get more light.  (*Providing the circuit supporting the LED doesn't limit power going to it.)All that means is that my result using a Lithium battery, which supplies slightly higher voltage and amps in these little flashlights got me a LOT more light - even though they were only rated at 300 lumens, that rating was for a standard alkaline AA battery.  Pop a high power photography grade lithium into it and you have a device that's bright enough to cause eye damage!!!  One caveat to my fellow light hungry buyers, though.  Light comes at a cost - the brighter it burns, the shorter both the battery and LED life will be.(*at under 6 bucks each, I can afford to burn up 10 of these before I'd be able to afford a Streamlight with a bulb that can handle such power over decades without burning out - plus my flashlights are always new =)So, in order to get the best bang for the buck out of these flashlights - put the best battery you can afford to fit into it's casing into it.Hope that helps you to 'see the light' too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6GEYP8PYZL6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHCVXE0#wasThisHelpful","R6GEYP8PYZL6N","A18WUUFY45DOWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18WUUFY45DOWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought 14 of these in black with 3 mode switches quite some time ago and have had excellent luck with them.  Each produces at least 200lumens compared to US made LED flashlights, has a dim, bright, and flashing mode, and much to my surprise - the outer bezel slips outward to allow you to zoom your light for a farther 'throw'.I gave them all to local police and firefighters - then ordered a batch direct from China to save money.  (*Note, the price on Amazon has gone up $2 since my initial order.)  I wouldn't hesitate to mount any of these on the rail of a gun, put a long life AA battery in it as an emergency light in the car, or to give one to a loved one for times of need.  Be sure to use extra long life batteries.  I know a lot of people review these badly - it is my opinion that Amazon may be grouping reviews of differing lights with these.  I bought the ULTRAFIRE single AA battery powered 3 mode black flashlight from a company named Grace Marketing.  I hope that helps you guys out!  I'm about to buy another batch of 100 for this year's gifts!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S1N5SH7Z73R8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006E0QAFY#wasThisHelpful","R3S1N5SH7Z73R8","A18WUUFY45DOWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18WUUFY45DOWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought mine over a year ago and have just now thought to review it.Before I bought it I read the negative reviews - just a few tips on those:1) completely disregard any negative review based upon damaged goods that were likely due to packaging Amazon used.2) pay attention to reviews about how well it filters water, manufacture, and durability3) as with all items of foreign manufacture, closely inspect for any signs they may have used hazardous materials in making your item - foreign manufacturers do have different standards for shipping items to the US vs Europe.Now applying the above filters, my review:Even with the preponderance of negative reviews, I chose to buy this.  Free returns with Prime had my back if I got a dud.  My pitcher arrived in good condition without damage to the box or the pitcher within.  I was, however surprised enough that it had very little in the box to protect it to remember that surprise even now.  I can see how it was easily damaged for other reviewers.  Upon unboxing I rinsed my filter, and installed PUR water filters into it - they filter slower but at the time of my purchase filtered out smaller stuff. Normally, with other pitcher water filters I removed the top part at this point to see if I have any water leaking from where the filter attaches to the fill basin - I could not do this with the stainless pitcher, so I shined a flashlight thru the clear window and looked - no leak noted.How well does it filter water?  At least as well as any pur filter usually does - which was good enough for me at time of purchase - more on this later for those of you who want some real detail.A couple things to consider, since the plastic water fill basin doesn't come into contact with the filtered water unless you grossly over fill, I wasn't overly concerned about BPA contaminants at time of purchase.  I have since learned that this plastic is BPA free.  I have not been able to ascertain whether the clear view window is BPA free, however - and it does come into contact with the water.  I am, however, fairly confident that it is BPA free though - since bisphenol A is used to manufacture FLEXIBLE polycarbonate plastics and the window is rigid plastic.  (*Note here - if you are worried about BPA check out your canned foods - those plastic lined cans are a major cuplrit of contamination by BPA)  Furthermore, BPA leeches out rapidly when the plastic is heated, I tend to prefer to filter cold water.  BUT you should still be concerned about the pitcher contaminating your drinking water.  It's steel.  Stainless steel has iron, chromium, nickel and manganese - non food grade stainless can even have lead in it.  I still don't know if this pitcher is made of food grade stainless - if it were of US manufacture it would be.  I can tell you this, I sent a water sample from my well after running it thru this filter and before filtration - both tests produced identical results save the filtered water has fewer minerals.  (*I have a very good well and filter only as a precaution against contamination.)  In addition, we never heat the water in our stainless pitcher - it's got plastic in it after all!  All of the studies I have read that showed any significant release of metal into food were done at high temperatures.  There's a really good article on this I mention at the end if you are interested.So, after over a year, how do I like it?  I'd buy another - but I don't need to, since there's nothing wrong with it.  I change my filters often and use it every day with 2-3 refills per day.  We drop it 4-6 inches occasionally onto our granite counter tops and it still has no dents cracks or leaks.  The kids use it and if I were to voice any complaint it would be that they fail to fill it when they use it.  Fortunately, they are growing out of that bad habit!I hope this review helps you make an informed decision on your purchase, please rate it accordingly if such is the case.Now some detail if you need to know a bit more about filtering water.  You see, before you filter the water it may prove useful to know precisely what it is you want to filter out and whether your filter is capable of doing so!Although the EPA regulates 91 water contaminants, there are many that still find their way into the tap water we use every day.  Other contaminants commonly found in tap water include lead, copper, sulfate, nitrates, pesticides, herbicides, arsenic, industrial solvents and trihalomethanes, a chemical known to cause colon and bladder cancer in large concentrations. Contrary to popular belief, municipal water treatment facilities were not designed to take out contaminants such as synthetic organic chemicals and toxic heavy metals like lead.Well water sources are typically not regulated at all, making it the responsibility of the well owner to test and evaluate the safeness of their well water.  Well water sources are susceptible to contamination from septic tanks, farms, pesticides and herbicides used in the surrounding area and can also have high instances of iron, calcium and magnesium which cause hard water. Hard water and scaling can damage home appliances and plumbing, as well as leave stains and spots on clothing, dishes, and surfaces in your home.With this in mind, if you don't live in the middle of the woods or on a lonely mountaintop - you're getting some chemicals in your water that aren't good for you.  Most of us don't have to worry so much about bacterial contamination, but those pesticides, chlorine, lead, and other contaminants can be bothersome.  I implore you to evaluate your water source, then select a filter designed to reduce the contaminants you have in it.  Unfortunately, for those of you on city water - that chlorination will fry your water filters fast, so be prepared to replace them often (*recommended about 50gal normally, so every 25 gal or so?)  And bear in mind that none of the pitcher water filters currently filter out Mercury, Asbestos or Chloramines well - although the PUR filters with MAXION do reduce cyst contamination and pharmaceuticals and I'm sure the other manufacturers whose filters fit this pitcher will soon do so as well.  If you've read all this - you're probably going to want a reverse osmosis filter for your drinking water - see pic.Finally, if you want to learn about the potential of stainless steel to leech metals into your food look for the 2010 study by the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, titled appropriately: Review on Toxicity of Stainless Steel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OUW99LPY7S7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005I2AS84#wasThisHelpful","R1OUW99LPY7S7L","A18WUUFY45DOWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18WUUFY45DOWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this printer for the sole purpose of printing on CDs - I wanted to get near photo quality to produce our Christmas mailing to family and friends, as well as with an eye to help my daughter promote her singing career. Overall I was very impressed with it's ability to perform this task. Considering the printer costs about as much as replacing the ink cartridges with max capacity ones, I could not have beaten it for this price point ($90). What follows are some tips and tricks to help you get yours up and running properly, as the quick start guide is a little lacking as well as a few issues you need to be aware of when using this printer to facilitate your understanding before you choose to purchase this product.UNBOXING: it fits tightly in the cardboard box, and you will be tempted to use a box cutter to help - DONT. They used odd places on the styrofoam around the printer to tape things like ink, the software CD, and the power cord to. Be safe and just get a helper to hold the box as you pull it out. Then carefully look at all of the surfaces on the styrofoam for all your ink cartridges (5) the CD, the manual and quick start guide, and the included power cable. NOTE: no USB printer cable is included, and one will dramatically speed your printer setup. It's possible to set up wifi only, but problematic. Just use an old cable or buy one for a couple of bucks (I literally found one for under $2). (See pic) This cable connects at the back of the printer on the side opposite the power cord. With it you can easily set yourself up to use the printer wireless with all of your other devices. Please note, it's fairly common for network devices to need tethering to a computer during initial setup - and usually easier for devices that can be done without tethering as well.REMOVE ALL THE TAPE: Most of the tape is fairly obvious - some on the front to hold the paper tray shut, some to hold the control panel, which tilts up and down to allow you to access the paper slots below. (More on this later) and a couple on the back to hold the thing secure back there. BUT DONT MISS THE ONES INSIDE! Yes, you have to lift the scanner bed cover and remove one, then you have to lift the scanner glass up - it hinges at the back and is easily lifted from the right side at the front. Inside on the right you will find two more pieces of tape and a bit more styrofoam and cardboard - presumably to keep the print heads from banging around during shipping.CABLES: Connect that USB printer cable to your printer and the computer following your computer manufacturer's recommended proceedure, then plug the power cable into the printer and finally into your surge protected power source of choice.RUN THE CD: It actually has some useful software on it, like a CD printer - into which you can import your own pictures and add text or background should you so desire, not to mention the absolutely essential printer monitoring software.LOAD PAPER: Flip the control panel up, tilt the paper tray cover panel down, push the lower cassette in and then slide the paper tray out. Wait, what? Time to explain a bit. This printer handles lots of kinds of materials, and you need to know where each one goes to prevent jams. You won't want to try to print a CD from the paper or envelope trays, CD's don't bend well. From top to bottom you have 1) a removable CD printing tray that slides into it's slot for printing when that has been selected (*it has some resistance to it when you use it - scared me thinking I was forcing it until I got used to this), 2) the paper path output tray for envelopes and regular paper, 3) the envelope input tray for odd sized paper (envelopes, 3x5 photos and such), and 4) the rather small paper tray that holds your 8.5x11 paper. The paper tray can be hard to get out, so slide the tray above it forward 1/2 inch or so, then slide it out. Be sure to replace both trays so that they completely overlap each other when you close the paper tray! When I saw that it only holds 40-50 sheets at best I was very glad I have a laser printer for bulk printing! Don't overload it - just put in 1/4 in or so of paper.BEFORE YOU PRINT: Double check the back of your printer and insure that the paper feed rollers are properly in place - mine had shifted a bit during shipping, but this was easily fixed by pushing the sliding spring loaded releases toward the middle, pulling it out and re-inserting the whole little assembly.USE THE SOFTWARE AND PRINT A TEST PAGE: Really, if you don't do this any future problems are completely your fault - this is where you check your printer to see if it's a lemon or not.From here you should be good to go. I've included photos of the things I've talked about here, as well as a picture showing at 4x magnification what the output looks like on Verbatim printable CD's. You don't see these printer lines with the unaided eye, and the round line at 1CM around the spindle side of the printable edge is on the CDs not due to the printer.NOW SOME THOUGHTS:1) In general inkjet printers cost a lot more per page than laser printers - if you do a lot of printing you need to consider the cost of your supplies more than the printer or the printer's expected lifespan. If you only print 100 pages a year at .15 per page, $15 a year isn't bad. If you print 10,000 though - WOW - you pay more for the supplies than you did for the printer - time to get a better printer! This printer is a bit of an ink hog, so I'll be using after market inks on the first refill. Epson rates the cost at 13.4 cents per page, but I noted that the inks have to clean about every 7 CD's when printing and about every 15th page printing - that burns a lot of ink. I'd put the cost at about .20 per page based upon this empirical observation.2) Like all inkjets if you look at the print closely you get some banding (horizontal lines) and dithering (graininess) but overall they look great to the unaided eye.3) Page speed is comparable to most other inkjets at 5ppm black, 70s for a 4x6 photo, 36s for a CD photo - but BEWARE - those cleanings often mean you have to power down the printer, and back on - with a LONG wait for the sucker to be ready again (forgot to time it, but it's about 5 min). In addition, CD's must be individually loaded and that takes more time than it does to actually print them.4) Some inkjet manufacturers sell their printers with tiny little trial ink cartridges this printer seems to have come with more than that. I've printed 40 CD's photo quality premium and have over half full showing on my cartridge status. That's pretty good!If this review has helped you in any way, please rate it as helpful - thanks!My initial review was denied because I mentioned a brand name quite a pain to add all those photos only to have Amazon deny the review because I mentioned the brand of CD-R I used.  I took a bunch of photos to help you guys with this but there's no option to add the photos in the 'Edit my review' dialogue so I can't add the promised photos, sorry!

"These inkjet friendly CD-R have a minimal blank space around the spindle hole and a thin unprintable outside edge. This is the largest printable surface on a CD I've seen to date. Using a new printer, I am able to obtain matte finish photo quality CD's rather easily with them. They appear to burn well too, my computer has had no difficulty burning at up to 52x with no unusable CD's or 'coasters' produced. Why not a 5 rating? See my tips below:1) They come shrink wrapped, without a spindle. My shrink wrap broke in shipping and several were scratched as a result. When you order 100, they really should put a dowel or something in the hole to prevent this issue. You will also need a spare spindle or two on hand to store them when you get them.2) Before you buy, make sure your printer is capable of printing on CD-R's. These probably won't work well or safely in a lightscribe recorder and must have a straight paper path printer to print on them. (Go figure, but CD's don't bend well!) If you haven't used a printer capable of printing on CD's before, prepare to learn a new skill set. The epson printer I got requires you load the CD onto a thin plastic tray then slide it into the printer 'just right' in order to work. At this writing, I am unaware of a printer that can accept a stack of CD's and neatly print on them.3) With inkjet printing on these CD's be prepared to wait at least a day for the ink to dry. You wouldn't want gobs of ink flying around at high speeds inside your CD player because you were impatient, would you? I waited 2 hours and put one in a sleeve, guess what? It smudged. Patience!4) Other than normal inkjet odors, my rather sensitive nose detects no smell from these during printing. The discs do warm a bit during printing though. Most plastic used in CD's does give off rather toxic fumes upon heating, so don't print a ton in an enclosed space - if you must, get out and breathe some fresh air often.5) Finally a tip on content to print on your CD's: Most of the time when we take pictures we do so with a regular picture frame in mind. It helps us to visualize our end result. That would be an error when you want to print on a CD. When you take your photo remember that there is a fairly large hole in the center of your image, so offset it a bit to one side. Furthermore, the outer curve tends to cut off your subject unless you plan for a round field of view in your shot. I've found that slightly offset photos work pretty well, and I've given you some images so you can see the process required to print. If you zoom in close, you can see the droplets of ink that got on the unprintable surface of my cd because I had the printer set to zero margin for spindle rather than the slightly larger size required to account for the narrow unprintable surface. You can also see a faint ring about 1cm outside the printable edge closest to the spindle, and you can notice clearly the inkjet printer lines - but bear in mind this is at 4x zoom. To the unaided eye, the circle at about 1cm is visible only if you tilt the cd to reflect light off of it, and the printer lines are not visible. (Besides, this is a review of the CD's not the printer - so the circle that shows near the spindle is more of an issue than printer lines for this review.)Anyway, I hope this helps you get the excellent results you desire - if you found this helpful at all please give the review a thumbs up!PHOTOS TO FOLLOW LATER AMAZON DENIED FIRST REVIEW BECAUSE I NAMED THE PRINTER BRAND - SORRY.

"This horn is definitely loud.  I wouldn't call the sound it makes a ""bad boy"" though - it's more of a ""naughty child"".  I bought this horn expecting to hear a deep BASS grumbling horn reminiscent of hearing that semi pull up behind you and lay on his horn, but what I got was a decidedly high pitched kazoo blown really hard by a mean kid!After some thought though, I should have expected the smaller sound.  This is a very small compressor after all.  Air VOLUME is required for a deep baritone sound, and small compressors just don't have that.  It's loud though - and that's what you really need from it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD28AQZWB8URL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F5DQWY#wasThisHelpful","RD28AQZWB8URL","A18WUUFY45DOWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18WUUFY45DOWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The wires were long enough, two of them were EXACTLY the length needed (*no margin for error) and two needed to be cut.  Using this made installing a new air horn quite simple.  This simple relay wiring kit makes remotely controlling any number of car electrical systems a breeze (additional circuit to flash your headlights or to install a car starter come readily to mind.)

"cheap plastic horn construction throughout - doesn't come with wiring harness which is required for install on most cars, horns sound like Erkel's car - not an impressive air horn sound, more like an extended clown nose sound.Why do you need a wiring harness?The compressor pulls more juice than the circuit wired into most cars.  It needs a direct connection to power supply (either battery or alternator wire) to get that juice.Will the horn button on my steering wheel still work?yes, if you install the wiring harness.  It wires to the battery for power (+) with a red fused wire, to the horn (+) with a red non-fused wire, and uses two gray wires to attach to your vehicle's existing horn wiring.  There's also a black wire for ground to deal with.  The horns in this review DO come with a relay to plug into that harness.What is a relay?A relay is a switch.  Generally, relays are used to extend the range or power capacity of an existing circuit.  In this application, it allows a low amperage circuit (your existing horn wiring usually 10-15 amp) to control a higher amperage circuit (the new horn compressor and it's wiring harness).  When you send a signal to the relay by pressing your horn, that current travels on the grey wires on the WOLO wiring harness to the relay (which you plug in quite easily), the relay then switches on power to the red and black wired circuit (30 amp) to power the compressor, which blows the horns.Can I use this without the relay and wiring harness?  (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005I4DNP2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_18)Yes, if you don't mind blowing fuses and maybe messing with your car's computer.  It will likely sound weak if it works at all.  Some trucks, however have 30 amp horn fuses and would be fine to use these horns basically as a plug and play device.  (*they sound almost comically weak though, so why would you do that to your truck?)After going to all the trouble to install this wiring harness, I ended up removing these horns and buying another - the wiring harness worked just fine for that horn, and the exchange took just about 5 minutes.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36K945DVLKFUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006IV6CAW#wasThisHelpful","R36K945DVLKFUZ","A18WUUFY45DOWA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18WUUFY45DOWA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hardcover with nice, sturdy color pages. Everything is in color in the book, and the pages are thick and smooth. Lots of pictures, both photos and illustrations. I like that it's a variety of both, as well as the fact that the images are laid out almost scrapbook style. Each image is accompanied by some kind of fact about the country, its people, food, wildlife, etc. Again, there is a variety, so not every country focuses on the same topics.I really love that the book is organized by continent. I intend to use this as a supplement to our geography curriculum (we homeschool) and I want to study each continent individually.The book is a good size, too. Not terribly thick, or crammed with far too much--200 pages with a different country for each page. The book lies open well on a flat surface (the pages don't try to flip toward the front or back).My only complaint is that the print is a bit small. Probably not a problem for kids--the reading level is well past that of an early reader, so no need for a huge font, and kids old enough for the reading level will be fine with print this size--but for us parents....","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIERI0XR2MOE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743607741#wasThisHelpful","RIERI0XR2MOE5","A2O0ZDILYOJP6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O0ZDILYOJP6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave this to my 15 yr old son to use with his PS4. He was really not crazy about this.The only real positive comment he made was that the layout of the buttons was very logical for the game itself. But they feel ""loose"" (his word) which makes them easier to push, but worries him  that they'll wear out quickly (something we noticed actually has been a problem for other reviewers).The controller has no joystick, and my son prefers to use a joystick. Of course, that's more personal preference.The controller is corded, and he's very used to wireless controllers so that really bugged him.His biggest complaint was that the right side of the controller is ""stubby."" It was uncomfortable in his hand, an awkward having the sides two different sizes.The overall consensus was that if this were inexpensive--like $15--it might be worth it for the button layout and/or if you prefer to play this game without the joystick. However, for the price, it's totally not worth it as the standard controller works well and is much more comfortable.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HMC7Y478UE4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKTHZB4#wasThisHelpful","R2HMC7Y478UE4I","A2O0ZDILYOJP6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O0ZDILYOJP6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband absolutely loves this. He says it's the best work light he's ever owned. Sturdy and well-built. The light is extremely bright, all LEDs. I mean really, really bright! The battery is rechargeable and so far has lasted well.It's fairly narrow--easy to grip and fits in tighter spots. The ""handle"" part is about the diameter of a paper towel roll tube, and has a slightly rubberized surface. It has a hook built in on one end, and another one that clips on to the other end, so you can hang it from either end or use both and hang it horizontally. There is also a heavy duty magnet on the side.Definitely recommended.

I love the shaped edges!They all come in a lovely box--black matte on the outside, royal blue on the inside, and definitely a great presentation if the ring is meant as a gift. The ring itself is well-made, nice and shiny at the polished parts, and the dark parts add depth. The details are definitely paid attention to.

"OK, I can't fully give this a five-star rating, but I can't tell you why it didn't quite hit the mark without spoilers, and since this book is a *mystery* I consider it doubly wrong to include spoilers in a review.That said, I really enjoyed this novel. I stayed up far too late last night so I could finish it--I just had to know the ending before I went to bed.I thought Nova, for the most part, was a likable character. And the romance that developed flowed naturally in the story. The other relationships were kind of hit and miss for me. I know teen friendships and such can be full of drama so it was realistic, but at times I got a little annoyed by everyone hating everyone.I really liked that Nova had a good relationship with her mom. And her brother. It was nice seeing a family that, despite less than ideal circumstances, including an out-of-the-picture father, were basically happy and got along and supported each other. I particularly liked Nova's grandfather, too.Anyway, even though I thought the story had a few minor speed bumps, I'd definitely recommend it! (A recommendation reserved for older teens, though, due to some thematic elements and sexual situations/references.) The writing is solid, the characters realistic, and the voice true teen--and it's a genuine mystery, not just a romance with a mystery in the background.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3404IMEAA9EJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633751651#wasThisHelpful","R3404IMEAA9EJG","A2O0ZDILYOJP6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O0ZDILYOJP6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is pretty cool. Rolls out nice and smooth, and sticks well. The surface is smooth and easy to write on and erase. Haven't tried cutting it, because we like the size, but it's very thin and I can't imagine it wouldn't cut well.What I don't understand is whether or not this is designed to be moved at all. It seems that it's meant to be stuck and stay in one place, but the package doesn't say that explicitly, nor does it say it's meant to move around.We've already stuck it to the wall (drywall painted with satin paint), then moved it to a semi-gloss painted door. It fell off the painted wall, but stuck well to the door. Still on the door, the corner is easy to peel back, leaves no residue, but the back of the whiteboard sheet still feels sticky--so I imagine we could move it at least one more time. My guess is it entirely depends on the surface it's being stuck to, and the number of transfers would be limited. Either way, nice to know that if you do decide to remove it it's likely that it's not going to permanently damage the surface.Anyway, I think this is a clever product. An easy way to replace the surface of a whiteboard, or to give yourself some whiteboard space on odd surfaces without putting holes in the walls or doors or whatever.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DKE74ZEWSXM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC1D5YM#wasThisHelpful","R1DKE74ZEWSXM8","A2O0ZDILYOJP6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O0ZDILYOJP6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Finished this a few weeks ago, and had a hard time gathering my thoughts on it for a review. I'm on the fence about Christian fiction in general--being a Christian and a writer myself who likes the faith elements very subtle, often to the point of completely buried in symbolism. I tend to shy from books where the Christianity is overt, usually feeling preached at while reading.This book was overt, but it was one of the more genuine Christian books I've read. The main character is a teen boy, who happens to have superpowers, and also happens to be a Christian. He attends church, and hangs out at youth group...and competes on a reality show against other kids with super powers.The story concept is unique. I mean, a reality show for super heroes, in which they're assigned tasks to perform on live TV. And each week, one is voted off. How cool is that?The characters are well fleshed out. I definitely connected with Robin (aka Failstate). He's a real teen, with real teen problems, with real teen friends, even amongst all the superhero stuff. His life is by no means perfect, and he not only deals with taking out villains, but also struggles with his relationship with his mom and brother.The writing is good, with a unique voice, and the pacing kept me turning pages. Plenty of action, without sacrificing a well thought-out plot. Definitely has me interesting in continuing the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM0NKB2X1NS8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007QYA17U#wasThisHelpful","RM0NKB2X1NS8R","A2O0ZDILYOJP6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O0ZDILYOJP6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This watch is big. That's a good thing in my case. I got this for my son, who is 15 and over 6 feet tall with long arms and big hands (think Great Dane in human form) and the watch looks great on him. Yes, we had to take some links out of the band. We've never bought a watch that hasn't needed that (other than watches with leather bands, of course) and between my husband and I that's quite a few watches over the years.The watch came packaged very nicely. An outer cardboard box--sturdy, yellow--and inside a huge yellow, hinged watch box. There was a cloth covering the watch, and all the polished steel surfaces had plastic either wrapped around them or stuck to them (that clingy plastic). Great care was taken to protect this watch during shipping, that's for sure.And it was worth it. The steel is shiny, the crystal perfect. Everything is smooth, well made, and really good looking. The face is definitely easy to read, with such big numbers, but it doesn't look clownish or anything--this is a really handsome watch. My son LOVED it.For the price, this is definitely a good deal. Obviously, I can't tell you how long it will last, but it does have a one-year warranty, and I can't imagine a watch this solid-feeling falling apart.

"Got this watch last week, and so far I love it. I am tall with long arms, so women's watches often look too small on me. But I don't want to wear a men's watch--partly for style, and partly because they tend to be a smidge too big for me. This is just the right size! The band is nice and comfortable.I love the look of the watch. Very basic and classic. The face is easy to read, although the numbers are not as bright as they appear in the photo--the image makes it look like white numbers against pure black. But in person, the black isn't fully black and the letters are dark silver like the case, but reflect well in the light.Re: ticking issue is that other reviewers have complained about. I don't hear ticking at all from this watch. Maybe it's something that has been corrected because of the complaints?

"High-priced-hotel towels. That's what these make me think of. They are bright white, super thick, very soft. The edges are sewn really well. Quality. And not insanely expensive, since you get two good-sized bath towels, two hand towels, and two wash cloths for about $52.Because they are made partly with bamboo (rayon from bamboo is what they say, along with cotton) they have a very slight odor when they arrive. I may not have even really noticed it, but we have a pillow that's made from bamboo and its odor was quite strong (easily fixed by 20 mins in the dryer), so the scent of these towels was faint but familiar. Totally gone after the first wash, though.I didn't bother reading the washing instructions. I always wash towels in hot water and dry them on high heat, and these came out perfectly.Using them makes me feel like I'm at a spa or something. Very cozy and absorbent.

I thought making the setting on Earth somewhat futuristic and dystopian while having Aster move into a fantasy world was original. And his series of adventures would definitely appeal to this age group.On of the issues I had, though, was the jumpiness of the story--yes, I get that he is literally jumping from place to place, but the way the plot flowed, it felt like it wasn't really heading in a direction, at least until the end. Also, there was a lot of information dumped on Aster by other characters. The whole, ""Wait you don't know that? Let me explain...."" got a little tiring. Lastly, there was something too adult about the voice at times. Aster is an unusual child, not allowed to experience life the way other kids do because of his illness (which, btw--don't want to give spoilers, but the way the author handled this was very cool), but too often in the book it felt like the story was being told by an adult.I would definitely read the next book in the series, because the ending picked up for me, and I would hope there would be less explaining since so much has been set up already in this one. And again, I think this would appeal to the target audience, even with the occasional stiffness in the writing. There's just so much action, and adventure through different lands, and Aster is the kind of kid you want to root for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPN5D6STA17F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990692515#wasThisHelpful","RPN5D6STA17F4","A2O0ZDILYOJP6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O0ZDILYOJP6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grabbed this thinking my daughter (she's 12) would like the color, and she does. I'm not crazy about it, but I will say it's prettier in person than it is in the picture. On my screen, this almost looks like a cream color with the slightest hint of yellow. In person, it is a light yellow with the slightest hint of minty green. Very summery.The polish is nice and shiny, but it goes on streaky and thin. It put three coats on my toenails and there are still some spots that aren't opaque. I know that's an issue with light colors in general, which is why I'm giving this three stars instead of two. (If it were a dark color doing this, it'd get knocked down a star.)My daughter used this on her fingernails and went with four coats. She said it stayed on pretty well. But it being so thick with multiple coats, she was basically able to peel it off when she got tired of it.It's not a color I would use again--partly because of the color itself, partly because it requires so many coats. But my daughter likes it, and it will definitely get used again by her.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VPPS1QY9Z4I3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WR5RR34#wasThisHelpful","R1VPPS1QY9Z4I3","A2O0ZDILYOJP6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O0ZDILYOJP6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love this ring. The box it comes in is lovely--actually, it's a box inside a box--a very sturdy smooth matte black cardboard with a blue lining, and the part that holds the ring is a soft black fabric-covered foam cube.

The writing is tight--no words wasted--but there is plenty of vivid description and character development in these short stories. All in the horror genre in one way or another, they had atmosphere and a great writing voice.

"Well, I barely got to try this because my 15 yr old son devoured the container. He's not vegan, but he's not much of a meat eater--just doesn't like it that much. So, this has been a good way to get protein in him without resorting to whey-based protein powders--I like that this is vegan and made of actual *food*.The taste is pretty good. I was afraid my son wouldn't like it, that it wouldn't be sweet or chocolate\y enough, but it's plenty sweet and chocolaty without being overly so or artificial tasting.My son tried mixing this in milk, but switched to water because it didn't dissolve well in milk. When I finally tried it, I used rice milk and found I had to stir it quite a bit and it still was kinda gritty. But my son said it mixes well with water.Overall, it's been a very good product. No negative effects for my son--no allergic reactions, no digestive issues. And he drinks them voluntarily. (Actually, I discovered he was drinking them twice a day.) I would definitely recommend it as a healthier alternative to a lot of the protein powders out there, especially if you want to keep to natural ingredients without sacrificing taste.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24C4F9NZS4192/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WW8ZA30#wasThisHelpful","R24C4F9NZS4192","A2O0ZDILYOJP6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O0ZDILYOJP6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This does fit the YA category it's put in, but it really is a book that crosses over into adult readership. The story starts with Fig at six years old and carries through until she's seventeen, but the focus is so unlike most YA books. This is very much literary, very much a character-focused story, deeply emotional, and presented in such a way that would appeal to many adult readers who don't generally read YA.Fig's mother is schizophrenic, and while she has ups and downs, the trend throughout the novel is down. As Fig, who is highly intelligent and has OCD, grows up she adopts different ways of coping with watching her mother deteriorate. She cannot turn to her father, as he is so focused on her mother and the farm they own. Her grandmother is somewhat harsh with her, although many of her acts show just how much she loves Fig. Her Uncle Billy is her rock in many ways, but for a long time she doesn't see that. She has no real friends, and she feels out of place just about everywhere. The only time she feels release from the pressures of her life and at ease with herself is when she is making herself bleed.No, this is not a story about cutting--although Fig does try cutting once in the book. I want to be clear on what she does do, because if you are like me you may appreciate the warning (which I did not get from the book description or reviews and wish I had). Fig's self-mutilation comes in the form of scab-picking, and the detail at which it is described was at times too much for me. The other negative for me was the last chapter. The very ending just didn't fit quite right for me.The writing, however, is beautiful and haunting. Fig is a deep character and the author submerges you in her mind. The other characters are fully-developed as well, and the setting rich and realistic. I definitely recommend the book for the writing, but be prepared for a rather intense experience and a book that reads like a memoir--it is Fig's life, not a plot to be played out.PS--if you like to read author acknowledgments before reading/finishing the story as I sometimes do--this time don't. There are spoilers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q0K3R07P2ALP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481423584#wasThisHelpful","R1Q0K3R07P2ALP","A2O0ZDILYOJP6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O0ZDILYOJP6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not someone who believes there is a magic pill for weight loss (or anything else, for that matter) but I am completely open to the idea that some key nutrient or chemical component may be missing from my diet that has my metabolism wonky. Or my appetite has gone amok because I'm in need of some key nutrient. So I decided to give this a try.Let me first say: I'm not overweight. I would like to lose maybe 10 lbs--any more and I'd be officially skinny. So I was not looking to this as some kind of miracle. I already eat healthy, and I am active and exercise moderately on a regular basis.All that said....this product did nothing. No appetite difference, no weight loss.

"I went into reading this with two biases: 1) I adore Maggie Stiefvater's writing and art, and 2) I abhor unicorns being made into narcissistic overgrown My Little Ponies with horns (something I've found in multiple books and cartoons). I feel like those things kinda cancel each other out, making my review unbiased :).So, the book starts out with Pip at school during career day, and one of the parents breeds unicorns and bring a few with them for the students to see. Pip can understand and talk to magical animals, and while trying very hard to get to know the unicorns, she inadvertently creates an Incident that prompts her parents to spend the summer with her aunt, who is a magical creature veterinarian. During Pip's time there, a situation arises with the presence of a pesky creature and Pip must figure out how to save the day using her ability--which no one else believes she actually has.My inner nine-year-old was squeeing with delight through this whole book (with the exception of the narcissistic overgrown MLP-like unicorns) because of the creatures and the fun adventures. I loved the pages with creature illustrations and descriptions that come out of Pip's favorite book, Jeffrey Higgleston's Guide to Magical Creatures. I loved how Pip added her own notes to the book, and those notes are included in some of the illustrations. (And yes, I was happy to notice Maggie Stievater's voice in the descriptions and notes on those pages as well.)The story itself--I'll admit I found the writing in the opening chapter to be just okay (which may have, admittedly, had something to do with the focus being so much on the unicorns). Pip came to life to me right away, but found myself skimming all the description of the chaos created during the school event.That said, the writing and story picked up for me immediately with the next chapter when Pip heads off to her aunt's. The other characters are well-formed, each with their own distinct personality. I liked that Pip and Callie didn't always get along, but still worked together. I liked that while a lot was done by Pip and her new friend Tomas alone, the adults were involved with much of it, and they showed mutual respect--the adults listening to the kids, and the kids listening to the adults. Of course the creatures were pretty original, and it was fun seeing Pip getting excited about learning new things about them.The ending was a little abrupt. I would have like a bit more of a denouement after everything gets solved. Just another page or so. Either way, I can see this becoming a series, with Pip adding and adding to the Guidebook and helping to solve more critter crimes. I would definitely recommend this for elementary age kids. I know I would have loved it at that age.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L29MMQ1KLGJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545709261#wasThisHelpful","R1L29MMQ1KLGJX","A2O0ZDILYOJP6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O0ZDILYOJP6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, better. The first book I loved. The second book, not so much. I still enjoyed reading it, and still liked Rory, but the whole book just felt like a bridge between books one and two. Now that I have read the third book, I clearly see the second book was a lot of set-up for the third book. I really wish the author had found a way to combine these two books.Anyway, this book has an actual story and actual resolution (that book two did not have), and the secondary characters are back in full-force (they were kinda lost in book two). It still wasn't as good as the first book, and the ending makes it clear there will be more in the series. I will likely keep reading because I like Rory and the whole ghost thing is really cool.

"Cute, and the colors pictured are true to what they look like in real life. A pretty gray and a nice cream color. They're a little bigger than I expected--I didn't read the exact measurements and expected something about as big around as one of those foam coolies for holding canned drinks. They are about 4"" across and about 4"" tall. The knitting is well-done, nice and tight. The yarn is a polyester, so it is smooth and I would assume it'd be somewhat stain-resistant. They stand up well. I was worried they'd be too soft and somewhat floppy, but they're stiff enough yet have a soft look. The striped one stands straighter. The solid gray one has a divider inside it, which is handy, but seems to contribute to its slight crookedness.My daughter pointed out that they would make great travel containers for make-up brushes and such because they fold up. There is a loop inside the striped one. I had no idea what it was for, but my daughter said she'd use it for her favorite make-up brush. Maybe it's to secure a larger or longer one?Overall, I think they make nice little accessories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BDIWC8XVSIE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFDFM24#wasThisHelpful","R2BDIWC8XVSIE4","A2O0ZDILYOJP6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O0ZDILYOJP6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I discovered Rick Yancey through his Monstrumologist series, which is, imho, one of the best YA fiction series and some of the best horror writing I've ever read. When I learned he'd written another series, naturally I wanted to try it. THIS SERIES CAME FIRST. So, as expected, it's not quite up to the level of the Monstrumologist.That said, I'm very much enjoying this so far. It's the kind of book you read just for fun. Fast-paced, a lot of action, a few over-the-top characters. Exactly the kind of book that would appeal to the target audience of a book with a teen boy protagonist who saves the world over and over.The first book really ought to be read before this one. It explains how Alfred gets involved with the organization he's fighting alongside in this one, as well as the whole Arthurian legend tie-in that his history is based on. However, this book only uses elements of that, and focuses on Alfred and company fighting demons who get released into the world (I won't say why because of spoilers). I will say, this gets a little darker than the first book--I see hints of Yancey's penchant for horror writing in this one.Again, this isn't amazing literature, but it's loads of fun and Alfred Kropp is a really likable character. I'll definitely be continuing the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L7TVRYKTRY3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004INH3YQ#wasThisHelpful","R3L7TVRYKTRY3L","A2O0ZDILYOJP6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O0ZDILYOJP6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I felt the language was stilted. I didn't see all this beautiful description all the reviewers mention. All I saw was a lot of arguing, and parents who needed to be smacked up-side the head. The mom needed to grow a spine and the step-dad needed to wake up and see what a problem his daughter was. I understand there is some reconciliation in the end, but I just couldn't get that far because I found the writing boring and the pacing far too slow, without real character development.

"I debated about giving this a full five stars. I'm not sure it's 100% there, but close enough. There were small issues, like jumps in point of view that bothered me. But the fact is, I found the story intriguing from start to finish. Sometimes dual story lines are frustrating because you enjoy one but not the other. In this case, I kept going back and forth between which I liked better. Both were dark and deeply personal. The idea of a generations-long curse borne from a family of circus performers--very cool.The story of Simon is told in first person present, while Amos's story is told in third person past tense. I thought it was really effective and worked well to separate the voices of the two. I loved the detail of the circus life in Amos's story. And the way his story was told was perfectly paired with the reveal of information in Simon's story. The characters were all fully-fleshed and believable. No one too perfect, no one so flawed you couldn't empathize. I admit I had the ending figured out, at least most of it, but that did not leave me feeling unsatisfied. It progressed naturally.Anyway, I am not sure what else to say about this book. It was one that kept me thinking about it when I wasn't reading, that I felt the itch to pick back up. The writing is very good and the pacing and placement of clues was just right.Now...for the thing that absolutely bugs me: The cover. I normally don't mention book covers--you know the old saying--but this one just bites. It's so generic. It does nothing to reflect the depth and tone of the story inside. It looks like a cover for a YA novel, which this most definitely is not. The advanced reader copy I have has a MUCH better cover that's actually representative of the story and its genre. Dear Publisher, what were you thinking? Gah. I hate this cover.

A deep, pearly burgundy. Of course, you only see that for a few seconds until you lather up. And I'm not crazy about coating myself in artificial coloring. I'd really rather it not be so loaded with dye.

"So I really kind of love this vacuum. Let me start out by saying this: The online price is $139.99, and as I write this review, Amazon is selling it for $99.99. So, we're not talking top of the line, high-end vacuums here. Yes, it's not built like a tank. It's not meant to be!That said, this thing has really impressive suction. Makes the big, heavy Hoover I've been pushing around seem kinda pathetic. The only problem I have with that is it totally sucks up my throw rugs. Guess I'll have to just shake those out instead of vacuuming them.It's super lightweight. As in, when it arrived on my doorstep, I though, ""This can't be the vacuum...."" It weighs almost nothing, unlike most tanks. But that makes it SO easy to push and carry around. It really rolls smoothly across both my carpet and hard floors.Very easy to assemble. It comes in several pieces, all of which just snap together. No screws, no bolts. Again, not tank-like. Does this mean the body of the machine is not going to last for ages? Likely. But it's the price you pay for light-weight.You have to turn a dial to switch from floor to tools, but I think that actually is one reason the suction is so great. The big Hoover I have sends all the suction the same way--through the tubing used for the tools--and the more direct route in the Eureka makes way more sense. That said, the tools aren't all that snap-off, snap-on. You have to make sure the hose clips in right and doesn't tangle with the cord when you're putting it away. The tools themselves each have a place to store, but everything is so tight together on the small body, it can be a little annoying. But they work very well.The machine is bagless, and it's very easy to snap the container on and off to dump out the dirt, although it feels like it's not entirely secure when putting it back in place, imho. Again, we're back the light-weigh vs sturdy thing. So far, despite the way it feels, the container holds tight.The one thing my Hoover has over this is the retractable cord. Oh, I love retractable cords! But retractable means you have to pull the cord out bit-by-bit, and of course it makes the machine heavier and bulkier. This one has a tab at the top of where you wind the cord--it flips down and the cord drops off easily. The cord itself is nice and long.Overall, the minor inconveniences are totally made up for by the light weight, smooth rolling, and awesome suction. I can finally use a vacuum through my whole house--which is mostly hard floors except for the master bedroom and a large area rug in the living room--and not be sweating when I'm done. And I know the dirt is picked up because the machine is so powerful. Very happy so far!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HWO83BQN8P5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5TM69K#wasThisHelpful","R1HWO83BQN8P5T","A2O0ZDILYOJP6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O0ZDILYOJP6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using the Avery ""Ivory Business Cards"" (27883, which uses the same template number) and have been happy--until I tried these. The Avery ""Ivory Two-Sided Printable Clean-Edge Business Cards"" proved themselves in one printing. I printed a sheet of the other along with a sheet of these, and there is such a difference.First, I must say, as I've seen mentioned before--the ivory color IS different. This product is significantly lighter. I happen to like that, but if you've been using another Avery product and need the ivory colors to match, well....That said, because the color is lighter my images showed up clearer and truer in color.The images and words were crisper on these than the other business cards. Granted, this one is smooth and the other is slightly textured.Breaking the cards apart was SO easy compared to the other. The trade-off may be that these are a little thinner. But they are by no means too thin. Edges nice and smooth, too.The paper went through my Canon inkjet printer with no problem. I haven't tried printing double-sided yet but I see no reason there would be an issue. Everything lined up as it should and the paper is the same on both sides.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BSZT3GU3KVVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008XPHB#wasThisHelpful","R3BSZT3GU3KVVG","A2O0ZDILYOJP6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O0ZDILYOJP6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I suppose for the price this is a pretty good little item. It's fairly easy to use--my 14 yr old son figured it out in minutes. There are two modes: chime and alarm. In the chime mode, you cannot disarm the device, but in the alarm mode you can set a four digit code for arming/disarming. I like the disarming feature and do not understand why that would not be available in chime mode, as the only other way to turn the thing off is to take the batteries out, or switch to alarm mode, which still requires taking the battery cover off. If this could disarm in chime mode, I'd give it another star--sometimes you want to BE where the thing is pointed and don't want to listen to incessant dinging.A fifth star might be there if it had a volume control--at least two or three different settings. That, I could see requiring the battery cover to come off, so an intruder couldn't just walk up and turn the thing down. But again, I'd guess if an intruder were going to do that, they'd likely just smash the thing anyway, eh? Which, frankly, is what I was tempted to do the first time we testing this out--it is LOUD.

"Background: I'm one of those girls who doesn't wear full makeup on a  regular basis. When I do, though, I wear Maybelline or Cover Girl liquid-powder makeup as a foundation, then regular powder on top. The rest of the time, I wear neither.I've been wanting to try some different brands, so when this came through on Amazon Vine, I jumped at it. So glad I did. It's very nice over the liquid-powder makeup, but what I really like is that it's great on its own. Yeah, I have to admit, I'm at that point where I need *something* on the days I normally wear no makeup at all. This has been perfect. Not heavy, but covers well. The color looks natural.The only thing I'm not crazy about is having to open a separate compartment to get the applicator pad. And the mirror is with that as well, so putting on the powder when you don't have a large mirror would be difficult as you'd have to keep going back and forth between compartments. Still, five stars because I like the product itself so much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QRHJ2702VMN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFCTIAQ#wasThisHelpful","R1QRHJ2702VMN1","A2O0ZDILYOJP6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O0ZDILYOJP6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wanted to be blown away by this book, after reading such glowing reviews. And it did have some good moments. But for the most part, it read like a series of after-school specials. While I did connect to some of the characters, they too often felt one-dimensional, each of them going through the same pattern: pages of angst, followed by an a-ha moment, and then feeling suddenly that everything is going to be just fine, all amid a world where adults are complete mental cases. The tie-together is that everyone in the book either gives someone the finger, or is on the receiving end. While I don't find that particularly clever, it is an unusual idea, and unusual intrigues me, but too often the finger incident in each chapter felt contrived. The writing is overall actually pretty good, so I'd consider giving another book by this author a try, but I would not recommend this book to any of my fellow YA fiction fans.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY62R0Y5TFBK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763663875#wasThisHelpful","RY62R0Y5TFBK0","A2O0ZDILYOJP6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O0ZDILYOJP6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Given To Me For An Honest ReviewerTrue Tails II from the Dog Park by Max & Luther is another hit out of the ballpark and I was fortunate enough to read the first book by Max and Luther. I have to say that was the beginning of a great series. In this book Max and Luther share many interesting facts about dogs. I sure learned a lot. They also take us to the dog park and around their homes to share some of their fun times. Luther loves the mud after a good rain. His mom isn't too happy about but what can she do? When it rains, he's back out in the mud again. Now Max loves to dig holes and run around them. Why? Even he doesn't know why ----- all he says is it's fun. They both share games, they play with their moms, other dogs and even two frogs. Included in each chapter are great facts about dogs. Some of these facts I never knew. Two that I liked are:*  The largest recorded dog was Zorba, an English Mastiff, who weighed 343 pounds and was 8 feet 3 inches tall.*  The smallest dog was a Yorkshire Terrier that weighed only 4 ounce and was 2 and 1/2 inches tall.This book was not only fun to read it was very informative too. This would make a great addition to your child's book collection. It would also be a great gift to give anytime of the year. I loved reading th book and I just love Max & Luther.

I've read each of the books, had this installment on my Kindle and finally got around to it, although out of sequence which didn't matter, at all. Fiona is totally readable, even out of order (which she normally is while committed to solving the most ingenious crimes). Once you have a feel for her you expect the unusual.Harry Bingham does it again as this is a terrific story with a cast of mostly bad guys who don't hesitate to kill in their drive for ill gotten gains. The story begins with Fiona discovering a body which leads to another that intrigues Fiona who, of course, sees that there is more to it and leads the reader deeper and deeper still into a complex criminal structure.

"Frankly, I couldn't wait for my first glass of wine using the 'Coravin Model Two' and I'm truly impressed with the ease of using this Wine System. The included directions are easy enough to understand. However, if unsure of how it works and how to go about doing it there is an excellent video available on ""youtube"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kphRqanm74I). The simplicity of it surprises me it hadn't been thought of much earlier. I've enjoyed but a couple glasses using this system and I've put the bottle away for a bit as I enjoy different wines for different purposes. And that's the main reason for the Coravin; wine will last and last because the argon gas replaces what air would've filled the empty space in the wine bottle: air in the bottle will cause wine to deteriorate.There are caveats, though: the system won't work with artificial corks, or bottles without corks, and there is a reportedly remote possibility of bottle breakage for which a bottle covering sleeve is included for that possibility.And I, like many before me, wonder why Coravin employs a proprietary connection for gas the cartridge which is considerably more expensive to replace than readily available replacement cartridges. I hope Coravin corrects that, if for no other reason than for PR purposes. The system comes with the Coravin Model, two cartridges, a sleeve and needle clearer/cleaner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W0QFVPCFSLL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168AT5HE#wasThisHelpful","R2W0QFVPCFSLL4","A23E9QQHJLNGUI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23E9QQHJLNGUI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am most definitely a fan of Harry Bingham and his Fiona Griffiths crime dramas. I've just now finished the 4th installment, and, ""This Thing of Darkness"" is so very good a read that I, sometimes, find myself thinking Fiona just can't be a fictional character: Mr. Bingham has made her so seemingly alive.I don't think this the best story of the lot; perhaps there is too much happening and so much to tie together. But Fiona, with all her personal psychological difficulties and quirks makes it all so wonderful to read about.The author's finesse in weaving the intricacy that is Fiona; her problems, history and how she does or, often, doesn't cope, the crimes she solves, and, dare I say, commits.

"Update: 10/29, 2nd. photo. 3 seed pods have sprouted, basil & dill. The dill is taller and is leaning toward the center of the light where red & blue lights are brightest.I've only just now completed putting together the ""AeroGarden"", from AeroGrow, and it's an attractive setup. The included photo shows the result of that. I've added water with nutrient and installed the different seed pods with plastic covers. And it was quite easy as there are very good directions along with pictorial diagrams. The lights are on 16 to 18 hours daily, dependent on which option you choose, determined by the type of plants you have growing. At what time the lights come on is also an operator option and it's common to schedule them for your awake hours.The LED lights, about 96 in all, are very bright. There seem to be 9 blue and 24 red, the rest being white, and I can't say why there are so many white LED's as, to my understanding, white (or full spectrum) light isn't necessary for plant growth and just contributes to energy waste, and cost, as plants primarily absorb light from the blue and red regions of the light spectrum.

"I enjoy cooking, and sharing the results with family and friends. And although I've only had this 'Stanley Vacuum Crock"" for a short while I've found it's just as advertised. For me, this ""food jar"" is unsurpassed for transporting soups or sauces, just about anything, without worry of spillage. And it'll keep food hot, or cold, for a reasonable length of time, too.This is really solidly built without being heavy and it's a very nice size, as well, able to contain more than 3 quarts (12 cups). Certainly big enough for any of my needs. The lid, when closed, creates a good seal to the body and has 4 latches so you know it's secure. There's also a hook conveniently placed at the bottom of the lid for keeping near while serving. And I've not experienced any difficulty closing or opening the lid, either. It truly does ""work great"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD9ULGR5RDEV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPISUJQ#wasThisHelpful","RD9ULGR5RDEV4","A23E9QQHJLNGUI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23E9QQHJLNGUI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm unhappy with this very short, only 169 pages, third book in the quartet of 'The Giver', by Lois Lowry. It's much smaller in size than the others, and is so out of place. Where the other installments promise spiritual uplifting this ""Messenger"" book teases sameness but not only doesn't deliver on the premise but diminishes it, considerably.The short story, small book, substantial differences between what had been the unassertive preternatural is now in-your-face magic, suggesting a change in what the original story was leading to.

"After a minor adjustment of the invisible safety light and having put it all together I plugged it in and  was totally amazed that everything worked, perfectly. Not to suggest I didn't encounter any difficulties, which I did, minor ones, though. And not due to this garage door opener, from Chamberlain. It was an entirely new installation for me and I had a bit of electrical work to do: My garage light was exactly where the opener was to be placed and, needing extra lighting for the back of the garage, I moved the light and mounted an outlet close to the opener.I installed it without help and can't imagine it being any easier to do. I have, however, a technical background. But I'm not one to get along solely with written instructions, either, so I relied a lot on the 'youtube' video which really is very informative.The door flow adjustment, from open to closed was intuitive and WiFi set-up went without a hitch, too. I've no complaint with the battery back-up, glad there is one, though, and it's nice that the wall mounted control includes a clock, thermometer, light adjustments and movement sensor options.

And after familiarizing myself with the machine, and it's parts placements, setting it up for 1st. time use was very easy: adding the provided 4 stroke engine oil with the also provided container and flexible hose was a no brainer. Gas input on the top is also easy to use. 2nd. pull and it's running nicely, push in the choke and this generator is running smooth. Had it running for a couple hours checking it's ability to run small tools, i.e. sawsall, and then the freezer. Generator speed increases and then recoups, running smoothly after freezer compressor kicks in; idles easy, too. LED's provide info and there's a reset. Stability isn't a problem when a level setting is provided.Directions indicate there's a dip stick, for checking oil level, but on this unit it's just the plug.

"Update 8/26/15: Constant operation most nights since purchase and working perfectly.Purchased new locally, at a big box store, at a better price than offered here, and I'm happy with it's operation the few days I've had it in use. But, of course, I had to tote it home.However, that's not the whole story. This is the 2nd LG Electronics Portable Air Conditioning unit I've purchased from the same store. My initial purchase ended abruptly as the unit didn't produce any cold air. But upon unpacking this 2nd unit I noticed it was packaged better and suspect the 1st unit had been a repackaged defect. No telling who's at fault there, either the store or the 1st purchaser.Regardless, this 8000 BTU unit is working just fine cooling my 169 cu. ft. bedroom. It's attractive, of a small enough size, and unlike other air conditioners this unit comes with a long enough exhaust tube so there's no need to elevate it.

I found the directions to be explicit and all small parts (screws, nuts & bolts) were secured within a blister pack. The box itself is made of a tough plastic with pneumatic assisted metal hinges that ensures easy and safe closing, and it's lockable, too. It's interior size fits my needs and it will keep contents dry from inclement weather, but not from flooding. It looks really nice at the side of the patio, too.

"Torn between giving this 3 or 4 stars as ""Lightless"", by C.A. Higgins is a good story. It's just that it took almost two thirds through before it really became interesting. Before that it seemed to promise it would get better. Why I stayed with it.Not so much science fiction as it is a mystery and a psychological thriller. The build-up is relentless, but unnecessarily verbose, about worlds run by a 'system' being fought by rebels. The entire story takes place within a single and special space ship, there are only a few people within the ship, and there is the ship itself. All characters are developed nicely, but somewhat sketchily, at first. However, over time, the plot develops and not until the last third of the book is everything revealed, almost grudgingly.I liked the story, with it's twists, turns and plots within plots, but, did I mention it was a bit long in the telling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N27KAQ259CXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553394428#wasThisHelpful","R2N27KAQ259CXR","A23E9QQHJLNGUI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23E9QQHJLNGUI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Instead the story is novel, creating it's own lore and the author keeps the action moving by providing a rich assemblage of good and bad characters, mixed together with a bit of confusion.Those who inhabit this story of mystery and mayhem are well developed and interesting, especially Alexander, the protagonist, who is suffering an intermittent form of Alzheimer's.

"Aside from terrific acting and visuals, the main thing that makes Jurassic World superior to both of the previous Jurassic Park sequels is indisputably its ability to stand on its own two feet, while also hearkening back to the theme of man vs nature started in the original film.The original 1993 Jurassic Park was, in many ways, a futuristic retelling of the Mary Shelley's classic novel, Frankenstein. In both Spielberg's film and Shelley's novel, we see the march of human progress for good or ill, and the inevitable contest between science/man and nature/god, in which (spoiler alert) man loses. In both stories we see human's attempt to harness primal forces that they cannot hope to control, and in the end wind up paying the price.Picking up years after the events of Jurassic Park, Jurassic World in a sense tells the same story. Not in the overly-derivative way that the previous sequels did, with talking dream-raptors and cheesy Godzilla parodies, but with a fresh story that continues with the next logical step of the original theme, that is, human beings playing god. Only now, instead of bringing dinosaurs back into a world that isn't ready for them, they've used genetic modification to take it to the next level, creating super dinosaurs, but without taking the responsible precautions necessary to ensure safety.The film isn't perfect (I think the subplot about weaponizing dinosaurs has been cliche since Alien 2), as I believe the original Jurassic Park to have been, but all in all it's much more grounded and clever, as well as honest to Spielberg's original vision, than its two predecessors. The film is able to bring the original into the background via the musical score and some callbacks to the first set, without allowing itself to be overshadowed. For example, the scene in the control room with the old Jurassic Park shirt and the subsequent conversation was an excellent callback to the stunning use of practical effects in the first movie, without coming off as apologetic for the use of CGI in the new movie.All in all I think Jurassic World is an excellent way of (hopefully) closing the circle that started more than two decades ago now. The final shot of the film, the T-Rex roaring over the island while the classic song plays, is an excellent shot to end the park's fated saga on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U1AA365X84MP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYC5II0#wasThisHelpful","R3U1AA365X84MP","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The thing that you have to understand about the Babadook to really understand the movie, is that the monster and many aspects of the story are mostly metaphorical. This is not your typical horror movie. What the Babadook represents is a psychological concept called the shadow self, or ""shadow aspect.""The shadow self is the darker parts of our personalities that many of us like to pretend doesn't exist. In the case of this movie it manifests in a mother's desire to kill her problem child. Ignoring the shadow self doesn't make it go away, as repeatedly said in the movie, ""you can't get rid of the Babadook."" The only way to deal with the shadow self is to face it, and acknowledge it's there, hence the end of the movie.This movie is terrifying in both its exploration of the darker aspects of the human psyche, and with how terrible it can be to lose a loved one and be stuck raising a difficult child.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IYV72UUBTVD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S4YGWD8#wasThisHelpful","R1IYV72UUBTVD4","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Guardfather Spike is a pretty cool gadget, and in a pinch I suppose it could be used as a defensive tool, but there are a few things you should be aware of.First, this is a fun gimmick, but not something I'd stake my life on. If you feel the need to carry a defensive tool other than a firearm, I'd stick with a knife, pepper spray, or taser. That being said, if you are a collector, like myself, or want a cool ice pick to show off at parties, you could do worse.Second, and more important, the trigger mechanism is a little sensitive. It once deployed inside a drawer that I shut too hard. Since the spike deploys extremely hard and fast, it could be dangerous if you're carrying it in a pocket, especially a shirt pocket facing your throat . . . you know, where most people carry pens.All in all, I'm quite satisfied with my purchase. It's a very reasonable price for a very unique and fun item.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WFXY0UBTKYQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S27Z17K#wasThisHelpful","R1WFXY0UBTKYQ3","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Now a lot of people have made some pretty harsh criticisms about the originality (or lack thereof) in Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle. In this review I would like to refute some of these unfounded and unfair accusations. The main one of course being, that the series is a rip off of Star Wars.The series is about an order of ancient warriors called Dragon Riders who hold allegiance to no nation and use their martial, magical, and telepathic powers in the service of peace and justice. Now at first you may think they sound like Jedi, but they're not. You see Jedi use lightsabers, where as dragon riders just sue multi-colored indestructible swords. Totally different.About a hundred years before the start of the series an evil sorcerer named Galbatorix, not Palpatine, destroyed the riders, and established an evil empire. He did this with the help of a group of evil dragon riders called the Forsworn, the first of which was named Darth Morzan.The first book opens from the perspective of a young, sandy haired farm boy named Eragon. He is absolutely not Luke Skywalker, even though he was raised by his aunt and uncle, who are murdered by servants of the Empire shortly after he finds a mysterious object that belongs to the Empire, prompting him to flea home on a quest for vengeance.Accompanying him on this quest is Bromi-Wan Kenobi, the grouchy yet wise olf former dragon rider who gives Eragon his father's sword and teaches him just enough of the ways of the forc- I mean the ways of magic to get by, before he gets killed in the second act.After Bromi-Wan's death Eragon and his friends travel into the heart of Empire and rescue a princess named Arya, NOT Leia, that Eragon was having visions of (see, it's a VISION, not a hologram). With the princes Arya in tow, our heroes head south, to join an ALLIANCE of REBELS, called the Varden and combat the Empire's evil forces.This bring us to the second installment, where things start to get really unique and original. After an initial battle where Eragon and his companions manage to thwart the Empire, our hero travels to the homeland of the elves to meet his second teacher, who is not Yoda. UnYoda turns out to be yet another surviving dragon rider, who teaches Eragon deeper secrets of magic and telepathy, turning him into a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately Eragon has to leave because he finds out his friends are in trouble, but before he does he promises to return to complete his training. Eventually he does return just long enough for UnYoda to reveal a secret about his family, and then die shortly later.At the climax of the book we find out something truly shocking. The Empire has managed to hatch a second dragon, a RED one, and the rider, reveals himself to be Eragon's brother, which means that Darth Morzan was his father! You see it's really nothing like the end of The Empire Strikes Back at all...Well things don't look too good for the Varden, but eventually Eragon manages to fight his way to the Emperor himself and challenge him. Unfortunately Eragon is totally outclassed by his more powerful opponent, but just when things look their worst, Darth Murtagh turns against the Emperor and saves him.Now in all seriousness, while Christopher Paolini managed to write a decent story, he did rip off many of his central plot points and characters from Star Wars, Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings, and many others. That being said, if you can look past this, the story itself isn't that bad. My biggest problem with it is the utter lack of originality, and not just with the blatant plagiarism. The story adheres to almost every cliche and fantasy trope in the book. For young reader's it's okay, for more serious readers who want actual intellectual stimulation, I would suggest Wheel of Time, A Song of Ice and Fire, Malazan Book of the Fallen, The First Law Trilogy, etc.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KERWR4GYIEZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375826696#wasThisHelpful","R2KERWR4GYIEZW","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When True Blood began it was a compelling show with morally ambiguous characters and a plot that wasn't afraid to take risks. Each season seemed to get better and better, with deeper and more complex villains and stories.Sadly, that show is no longer around. The writers no longer seem to know what they want to with either the characters, or the general plot. Whenever they decide they want to force a new ""twist"" down our throat, they either kill of a random side character, or throw two random people together in an extremely forced romance, only to have them separate again by the beginning of the next season.Plus the show is generally trying too hard the past few seasons to be Buffy the Vampire Slayer. When I heard that they were planning on bringing the series back to its roots for the final season, I was at first hopeful, but quickly found myself disappointed. The interpersonal relationships have gone from artificial, to laughably absurd. Andy and Jessica have a buddy cop type adventure and all the sudden bygones are bygones, Sookeh and Beel are back, Jason and Jessica are bouncing off each other again, etc etc. I won't even get into the stupid ghost Tara story. And the big villain of the final season? Sarah Newlin and the Yakuza. Yes really.Thus far the final season of True Blood has been one disappointment after another, and I doubt that the last two episodes are going to save it. The three stars I gave it are for the three brilliant seasons that the show started with, everything after that you can either skip, or go on Netflix and watch the better version. It's called Buffy the Vampire Slayer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OI76WA29FWTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPY2I1E#wasThisHelpful","R1OI76WA29FWTJ","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a fantastic season of Game of Thrones this was! So much happened. Every season has one really big episode that everything builds up to, but this one had several. The acting was top notch, maybe the best since the show started. At first I didn't think Game of Thrones would have a chance at this year's Emmys since they're competing against last year's Breaking Bad finale, but then I saw Tyrion's trial. WOW, the emotion, the betrayal, the hurt, is all palpable. The Mountain vs the Red Viper fight was amazing, and the ending just as shocking as it was in the book. Arya and the Hound absolutely stole the show this season by the way. If they made a separate show just about them wandering the countryside murdering people, I would watch that show. The battle for the Wall was every bit as epic as the Blackwater, and let's not forget Daenerys and her ever more difficult to control dragons.I also want to give a nod to Jack Gleeson. We all hated Joffery, which is kind of the point. The kid is a terrific actor to bring such a rotten little monster to life and make us all revile him so much. It was great to see the little turd get what he had coming, but in a way I think I'm actually going to miss him. He certainly brought something to the show in the form of a memorable villain.I simply cannot say enough good things about this season of Game of Thrones.Not much to say so far about the box set itself, but I LOVE the cover art). There are at least two deleted scenes thus far that we know of, and more of the typical extras. An interview with the man himself, George RR Martin, a look back at the effects that the Red Wedding had on the war in season 3, commentaries of course, a thirty minute documentary about the battle for the Wall, a look at some of the cast members and their character's deaths, and more history and lore from the books that the show skips over.I'll update this review with more information when it's released, and of course when I have the box set in hand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VWLS2MVW16EM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHWSB5M#wasThisHelpful","R2VWLS2MVW16EM","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this out of desperation (heard good things about healing scars and overplucked eyebrows). I had maybe 10% faith, but because at that moment I couldn't afford the more expensive chemical concoctions, I chose this. After few months I swear by this and other natural oils, and I'm the type of person who normally scoffs at natural remedies.It smells like sesame oil, and is really hard to spread. Put too much on and you'll break out from the greasiness clogging your pores. But use tiny drops and this is amazing. I put mine on those cotton pads and gently dab all over face, then rub over eyebrows and lips. Let me tell you what it does for my sensitive skin:Mosquitoes love me. I always get huge bumps that inflame and itch pretty bad, lasting for days. I rub the oil on and they go down within 20 minutes, no itching, no redness.I bit my lip, hard. Rubbed a bit of oil and the thing never swelled like it usually does. Can be used instead of chapstick. A lot healthier and less addictive.Dry nostrils or dust/pollen allergies? Forget the addictive nose-spray. I just dip a q-tip in the oil and swab my nose. Instant moisturizing relief that lasts for days and I like to thing it purifies the boogers.Over-plucked eyebrows and/or thin eyelashes? I put this on once a day for a few months, and my brows grew back and got thicker (yay) and my lashes got longer. If you stop applying it on the lashes, they'll go back to being thin. Depends on you.Got red/itchy eyes and no visine or lanoline on hand? I put a wee bit in my eye. It's better if you do this before bed, otherwise your vision will suck and your eye area will be greasy and gross. The redness doesn't fade right away, but it helps with the pain and infection.Sunburned and no aloe vera? Rubbed this on my burnt shoulders and neck, the next morning the redness and pain was completely gone. My fiancée couldn't believe my sunburn was gone that fast. It also smoothes out the wrinkles I have on my shoulders from too many sunburns, so I imagine it will work well for the older folks. Also great for those dry, rough and itchy spots on your knees and elbows!Overdried hands and brittle nails from too much dishwashing? Dry, achy, swollen feet from running around all day? Soak them in a warm bath, and massage a generous portion of heated (warm the bottle in hot water) castor oil into them for a few minutes, and then put on cotton gloves and socks. Go to bed wearing those. Wake with sweet baby hands and feet, and reinforced nail cuticles. Thank me later.You can also mix this with other oils to create a super cream. I have yet to combine it with coconut/avocado/grapeseed/almond oil, whatever else I stocked up on. They're all good on their own though. Also, if the smell bothers you, put in few drops of your favorite essential oil.I heard the best use of this is for hair, but my scalp is pretty good anyway and I find it hard to apply and even harder to wash out, and it limps on me (medium length wavy fine hair) so maybe this is better for you ladies (and guys) with long, thick, dry, wild hair. I heard it works for some balding guys, too, but I can't vouch for the hair properties at all (excluding eyebrows and eyelashes!)The big bottle is a good deal too. Had it for few months and not even 1/4 way down yet.Oh, and please don't ingest this, unless you want to pay homage to the porcelain god.Also be careful to not get it on clothes, it's pretty hard to get the stain out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRIADO4PL82EP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003COAFPQ#wasThisHelpful","RRIADO4PL82EP","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a yellow lab who won't play with/chew on anything. I feel bad because besides petting and walking, there's nothing for him to do and he looks bored sometimes.I've tried kongs, smart kibble dispenser, empty (ignored), or with tempting treats (tries for 3 minutes and gives up, letting our other dog entertain herself with those). The only thing he will chew on for hours are rawhides, and that's only because they're edible. He'll ignore a stick or an antler too.I bought the nylabone in high hopes he'll have a treat/toy that will last him a lot longer than rawhide, while cleaning his teeth and not upsetting his belly. He was excited when I gave it to him, but got confused within 5 minutes when it didn't yield to his chewing and didn't give off any flavor. He then dropped it and got pretty sour like I tricked him.

"I have gone through this box in less than a month. I am already an avid tea drinker (3-5 cups daily), and I love exploring different flavors and varieties of tea, and this was a great present to receive.The box is very beautiful, a nice green color tied with a ribbon, the lid stands up when you open it, letting you read a little bit of info about each tea present. There are many varieties of black, green, white, or herbal teas, from Indian to English to African, many wonderful fruit teas (I never cared for herbal teas until this tea came along), so one will never get bored sampling.There are two stories in the box, that are easy to take out, and you can repurpose the box once you are done.The sachets themselves are pyramids of high quality (better than regular sachets), with a cute little twine leaf made out of paper that clings to your cup's lip as you pour water into the cup. I found it adorable and appreciated not having to burn my fingers trying to get the bag out. The tea's contents are clearly visible, pretty to look at, and they do not skimp on the ingredients (I easily saw whole heads of dried chamomile and other fruits/spices).My only nitpick was I could not find brewing instructions (as different teas/different brands steam longer than others), so I had to estimate the brewing times myself. This could stump someone who is new to tea, so here's the general idea: black tea 3-5 minutes, green tea 4-7 minutes, white and herbal 5-8 minutes. Any longer than that and your tea will be too bitter, especially the black and green. Herbals and white are mild in flavor, so if you take them out too early, you'll be drinking colored water. Just a heads up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34EH4DRUS6IXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003S86KVY#wasThisHelpful","R34EH4DRUS6IXM","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fantastic movie, easily my favorite of all the Avengers tie-in sequels. Loads of action, but still with a sense of humor. Lots of twists as well. Some of them you will see coming if you're a comic fan, but many others will still surprise you. old school comic feel, but with a contemporary message. In particular I enjoyed the Winter Soldier.

"Before I say anything else, it's important to note that this DVD contains no English subtitles or voice acting. This is strictly Japanese only.Comes with three discs. The first is the R18 version of the film, the second is the censored version, and the third is special features. Contrary to rumors, the censored version does not have additional content. The reason that the censored version has a longer run-time is due to the music video at the end. Most of the other differences are during the eclipse, some of the gore is censored, and there are shadows covering Casca and Femto during the rape. Better special features than the BRs that Viz has released so far. Some commentary from the creators and behind the scenes stuff. The cardboard cover is hand drawn by Kentaro Miura himself, and features an alternate version of the Berserk Volume 12 manga cover. My one complaint is that the R18 version doesn't support surround sound, which is a shame because I really enjoy watching these movies on the big screen with full speaker use.Regarding the film itself, all that I can say is WOW! It's mind blowing. Easily the best of the Golden Age trilogy so far. Possibly the most graphic anime I've ever seen. The infamous rape scene is horrifying and heartbreaking and grotesque all at the same time. The demon massacre is every bit as horrific as the manga. This is the Eclipse that Berserk fans have been waiting for, not to mention that we finally get to see the Skull Knight animated. Speaking of SK, he easily stole the show here. They managed to capture that mix of creepiness, mystique, and heroism that makes his character so cool in the manga. My favorite scene in the entire movie is the one where Griffith breaks down and the behleit activates. You can feel his complete and utter despair when he tries to kill himself in the lake. Among the other notable scenes I feel the need to express praise for the Zodd/Skull Knight fight, the Godhand intros, Griffith's mental collapse within the Eclipse itself, the Skull Knight's attack on the ceremony, Gaiseric, and Silat.All in all great movie. The biggest criticism I have for the content itself is where they ended it. In my opinion, it would have been better to extend the movie by 10-15 minutes, and show the birth of the demon child. Instead, it ends with Guts fighting off spirits with the Skull Knight, then skips to him departing as the Black Swordsman after the credits. I will be VERY disappointed of they skip the demon birth and Guts' first apostle kill and move on to the Black Swordsman arc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J1KX7UEM5U0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDHBV10#wasThisHelpful","R3J1KX7UEM5U0X","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unless you've been living under a rock, you're probably aware of the monumental impact that Attack on Titan has had on the anime world since it's premiere. As somebody who has been viewing and reviewing anime for a long time, I can say that this is the rare series that actually lives up to the hype. People will complain about pacing issues about a third of the way in, but these problems, if you even consider them to be such, are minuscule compared to the overall levels of quality put into the series.As far as the story goes, while it does have elements of other previous projects, such as Gantz and Claymore, it still remains a unique concept in and of itself. At it's core, Attack on Titan is a story about survival and humanity's refusal to die out, even against colossal odds. It brilliantly mixes elements of post apocalyptic, medieval fantasy, revenge, and even a little bit of steam punk, and it all comes together to form your classic 'hero versus monster' story. The voice acting is very well done, and I cannot say enough good things about the soundtrack. Above all else, I'm grateful that they had the good sense to put the series on hiatus while the manga continues, rather than giving us endless episodes of filler, that nobody really wants to see.Not much word yet on what this box set will actually consist of, but I will be coming back to edit this review as necessary when more information is released, and of course when the set itself is in hand.As a final note, I would like to encourage anybody that has already enjoyed the series to buy this product. With piracy at an all time high, it's becoming more and more difficult for anime to prosper in the US and Europe, so supporting truly excellent shows like this are more important now than ever. I think we all remember the sting of having to wait so many years to get the dub of Hellsing after Geneon went under, and even now it's almost impossible to find the box set of Higurashi without dropping hundreds of dollars. So please, if you love anime, and you love Attack on Titan in particular, buy the set and show them your support.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SR8HEGOLBH7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FXBL1IQ#wasThisHelpful","R3SR8HEGOLBH7U","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

One day, she is approached by an alien named Lan who asks her to pilot a robotic aircraft to defend mankind against an evil force.

"American Horror Story: Coven premiered this week, and boy did it come back with a bang! If one thing was made clear by the opening episode, it's that this season will be continuing, and increasing, the series trend of ""can they really show this on TV!?"" Now if you like happy little fairy tales, then you might not find this show appealing. But if you like horror that's dark, and brutal, and at times sickening, then boy is this the show for you.I love the set up for this season so far, and I'm happy to see so many of the cast that we love so much back again (although I'm still hoping to see Zachary Quinto and Dylan McDermott).Now all this said, you can't judge the whole season by a single episode, so I'll be coming back once a week to edit and update this review as necessary as the season progresses.I would especially encourage those who stream or torrent the episodes to buy the set, in order to support the series. Not that the show is hurting for popularity, especially after the explosive success of season 2, but even so we should all try and support the creators and show encouragement for brilliant but non-mainstream shows like this.*Spoilers Start Here*UPDATE 10/31/2013:Ok, so the first half of the Halloween episode just aired, and wow has the season thus far lived up to promises made in the premiere. So far we've had weird snake sex, weird Minotaur sex (well almost), weird cross-generational zombie incest, mass murder, a lynching, and the beginnings of a big old race/turf war between two clans of witches. The best way I can describe this carnival of carnage is that it's an all female Harry Potter on bath salts. That's what I've always liked about Ryan Murphy, Glee aside, he's never been afraid to ""go there"" on a lot of his projects, which to me, is perfect for a show like this. Horror is supposed to scare, shock, and/or disgust you, and this being the case, American Horror Story more than does its job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24VEUBLDGPLEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FQY4KSI#wasThisHelpful","R24VEUBLDGPLEG","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Absolutely loving the start to book 2 so far! In particular, I'm glad that we've gotten to get away from Republic City for a bit. After all, part of the charm of The Last Airbender was getting to travel around with the Gaang, and see the different architectures and cultures of the four nations. I also enjoy the dichotomy of light and dark represented in the spirits, and alternatively expressed in the civil war between the Northern and Southern Water Tribes. More than anything else I notice a lot more humor in this season. The platypus-bear pooping money, and the demented quasi-romance between Bolin and Eska had me dying. Thus far we are only four episodes in, but I'll be editing this review as the season progresses with my continued thoughts. Based on what I've seen so far alone this season deserves the 5 stars I gave it. Absolutely love Avatar, and love Korra!UPDATE 10/18/2013:WOW, I just finished the two part episode ""Beginnings"" and I have to say that not only is this the best episode of Legend of Korra so far, it is also easily one of the best episodes in Avatar history, including those from The Last Airbender. This was truly some Hayao Miyazaki level, eastern mythological storytelling. In this episode we are introduced to Wan, the very first avatar, and how he became the bridge between the spirit and human world, as well as how humans gained the ability to bend the elements. It even clears up some plot holes from The Last Airbender about the Lion-Turtle. At first the stylized animation threw me a little bit, but mid way through the first half I came to love it.UPDATE 11/16/2013:I absolutely loved the finale. The spirit forest was my favorite part, it was like Miyazaki and Tolkien had a baby together. I wont go into too many details so as not to spoil it, but suffice it to say that the season absolutely does not wind down after The Beginnings. If anything it picks up speed. The final four episodes were absolutely fantastic, and so was this entire season. In addition to being introduced to some awesome new characters, we've been able to see some of our old friends as well. I'm definitely going to be picking this season up on Blu Ray, and I would encourage anybody who loves Avatar to purchase it on BR/DVD as well, especially those who stream it online, so as to show support for this awesome masterpiece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FOCWITBZU2Q8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8PTBZC#wasThisHelpful","R3FOCWITBZU2Q8","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bullets are boring. You see bullets on every television show these days. Anybody can win a fight with bullets. Beating your enemy with duct tape however, that's a move only Michael Weston can accomplish. Who is Michael Weston you ask? Well, he used to be a spy, until they burned him. After losing his job, his money, and all his resources, and being stranded in Miami, Michael Weston has vowed to use his skills as a spy to help those in need, as well as to bring down the evil, quasi government agency responsible for destroying his life. Helping Michael along his journey is his sexy, gun running, on again off again girlfriend, and former bomb maker for the IRA, Fiona Glenanne. There's also Michael's best friend, a former Navy Seal named Sam Axe. Eventually they are also joined by another burned spy named Jesse Porter. In addition to the main team, there is also Michael's neurotic (and surprisingly badass) elderly mother, a metrosexual money launderer named Berry, and Michael's screw up brother Nate.In addition to a fantastic cast, Burn Notice has become famous for its very unique MacGuyver like fight sequences. Whether they're making a rocket launcher out of a pipe and soda cans, a claymore mine out of a microwave and some silverware, or a tracking/listening device out of a tiny pink cell phone, there's just something immensely satisfying about watching Mikey and his crew deal with their enemies via a combination of making weapons out of household objects, advanced special forces hand to hand combat, and general cleverness. More than anything else our heroes outfox their enemies into destroying themselves.Burn Notice is a great show to just sit back and enjoy the fun fight scenes, the funny moments, and the touching ones as well. And all seven seasons for just a touch over 100$ is an absolute bargain. I highly recommend both this box set and this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R271QP37W90Y6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECGEGGM#wasThisHelpful","R271QP37W90Y6R","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a sad year 2013 turned out to be for television. Breaking Bad and Dexter both ending within the same month. Dexter is one of the greatest shows ever, and this box set looks so cool! I love the design, which they based off the blood slide box that Dexter keeps inside his air conditioner, containing all of his trophies. The special features that are new to the complete set include:- Behind-the-Scenes Cast Interviews, Features and Promos.- The Evolution of Dexter Morgan, an all new documentary chronicling the titular character of Dexter and his dark passenger.- The Code, an all new documentary featuring the creation of Dexter Morgan and his world.- Exclusive Grafix book featuring artwork and photography from 8 seasons of Dexter.- Unique box set design based on Dexter's blood slide box from the show. A paper tab stands out to separate each season from each other.To those who are coming new to Dexter, I cannot recommend this series enough. The show follows the path of Dexter Morgan, a serial killer who channels his dark urges onto the guilty. Dexter was different ever since he was a small child, and sensing the darkness inside of him, his police officer father, Harry Morgan, helped Dexter channel his desire to kill by teaching him a code, that dictates he only kill other murders. While many would think of Dexter as a monster, he still has a lot of humanity. In fact many times over the course of the series, you will find yourself emphasizing with Dexter, which is sort of the whole point of the show, that there's a little bit of him in all of us. Each season tells a different story, and brings Dexter into conversation with a different aspect of his dark side and how it relates to ""human"" issues.Season One:Season one introduces us to Dexter Morgan and the people he surrounds himself with. We are introduced to his girlfriend Rita and her two children, which he describes as more of a disguise or normalcy than anything else. He also has a foul mouthed adopted sister named Deborah, or ""Deb"" for short, who he describes as the only person that really loves him. The first season explores Dexter's hidden desire to be normal, to be accepted, and involves a game of cat and mouse between Dexter and another serial killer known as the Ice Truck Killer. As the season progresses Dexter learns more and more about his past, and about the terrible events that made him into a monster, and through doing so, he discovers a connection between himself and the Ice Truck Killer that goes far deeper than a passion for human dismemberment.Season Two:Season two opens with a twist, several months after killing his brother, Dexter is off his game, but he snaps to when the police have found Dexter's dumping ground for dead bodies, and have officially opened an investigation into the serial killer deemed The Bay Harbor Butcher. The season focuses mainly on Dexter trying to sabotage the police/FBI investigation from within. Given that he works as a blood spatter analyst for Miami Homicide, and that his sister is a detective, he is of course in a prime position to be on the inside track of the investigation. This is unfortunately complicated by the meddling of Sargent James Doax. Doax doesn't trust Dexter, as he believes he had a connection with the Ice Truck Killer, and has always sensed that there was something off about him. A large theme here is Dexter trying to juggle his life as a serial killer, while keeping it from Doax and the police, while simultaneously dealing with issues in his personal life. New to the cast is a dangerous woman named Lilah who becomes obsessed with Dexter's dark side. She's sort of depicted as Dexter's polar opposite. While Dexter has a thing for the cold and air conditioning, Lilah is a pyromaniac/pheliac who is obsessed with fire.Season Three:The third season focuses on Dexter as the family man. Learning in the first episode that Rita is pregnant with his child, Dexter tries to imagine what his life would be like as a father, and takes on an increasingly more parental role in the lives of Rita's children Aster and Cody, and even proposes to Rita. Dexter also takes on a sort of protege this season. He's able to make his first real friend, a district attorney named Miguel Prado, who believes that Dexter killed the man who murdered his brother. Dexter is initially delighted to have a real friend, and even takes Miguel out killing with him, however before long we start to see that two monsters can't really be together for too long before turning on each other, and Dexter and Miguel wind up at each others throats. The new serial killer this season is called The Skinner, and is rampaging around Miami doing exactly what you think, skinning people. He and Dexter really don't come into contact with each other until the end though, he serves more as a nemesis for Deb throughout most of the arc.Season Four:The fourth season is widely regarded as not only the best season of Dexter, but some of the best television ever filmed. This season focuses on Dexter trying to balance his new life as a father and husband with his other life as a murderer. The killer this year is known as Trinity, and is one of the oldest and most successful serial killers of all time. Trinity is also a family man, and Dexter believes that he can learn how to balance his two lives by studying him. This season demonstrates that you cannot be a father, husband, and killer. It either leads to the complete destruction of the family, as with Trinity, or constant lying and being stretched to the limit as with Dexter. Here we also see Deb begin to uncover the truth about who Dexter is, finding out that his brother was the Ice Truck Killer and about the way his mother was killed. The way that this season ends is one of the defining moments of the series. It's surprising, and brilliant, and tragic all at the same time. What makes the final scene so heartbreaking is that right before Dexter comes home to find what Trinity has done, he is speaking for the very first time every about someday having a life without his dark passenger. His final words too ""I'm what's wrong"" show the parallels between him and his sister Deborah.Season Five:Season five picks up immediately where season four left off. Beginning here we see Dexter trying to deal with Rita's death, and with the loss of his family, as Astir and Cody move away from Miami with their grandparents. Dexter bonds with a woman named Lumen Pierce, who was raped and tortured almost to death by a group of people, when Dexter kills her captor and rescues her. Dexter and Lumen eventually form a romance together. Unlike Rita, Lumen knows exactly who and what Dexter is and still loves him for it. We see more of Deborah beginning to subconsciously accept the real Dexter here, when she confides to him that she wants to kill the barrel girl murderers herself. She even allows the two killers to go free after discovering the body of one of their victims (not knowing that it was Dexter and Lumen). I have to say, this season surprised me with how good it was. I initially thought that seeing Dexter immediately hop to a new woman would be forced, but seeing them form an awkward killer bond, and watching Dexter his his own pain by helping her deal with hers is absolutely marvelous.Season Six:A lot of people didn't like season six, but I think it was just misunderstood. Taking place about a year after the events of season five, Dexter, whose life has finally reached a semblance of balance and order, now explores some of the greater mysteries behind the meaning of life, and if there can really be light within his darkness. The villains of this arc are two religious zealots who become known as the Doomsday killers. The Doomsday killers want to bring about the apocalypse by reenacting some of the more gruesome parts of the book of Revelations. Along the way we get to see some pretty narley murders, which is always fun. This season explores the best and worst aspects of religion, the worst in the form of the Doomsday killers, and the best in the form of a reformed murderer named Brother Sam, who teaches Dexter to look for the light in the darkness. The most memorable moment in the series comes in the final moment. I won't say it here, but it leaves us hanging on a huge cliff-hanger.Season Seven:Season seven picks up immediately where season six leaves off, Deborah has just witnessed Dexter killing Doomsday and he has some explaining to do. At first it seems Dexter is able to BS his way out of the situation, but by the end of the first episode Deb knows that he's a serial killer, and the Bay Harbor Butcher. This season has some of the best moments between the Morgan siblings. After all this time, we finally get to see Deborah and Dexter talk about who and what he is. The season centers a lot around Deborah trying to change Dexter, and then later coming to accept him for who he is. We also meet Hannah McKay, yet another blond that Dexter Morgan falls for. Hannah and Deborah spend a lot of time at odds, and Dexter finds himself having to choose between his sister and a woman that he might be in love with. Oh did I mention Hannah is also a serial killer?Season Eight:The final season disappointed a lot of the fans, and I'm sad to say that I do include myself in that. I won't spoil the ending, but the ending does a fairly decent job of ruining itself. It was just a bad way to close the series, a sour bite to and an otherwise fantastic meal. I still recommend Dexter to anybody though. We had many great years, and the show will always hold a special place in my heart.My one beef with this box set, is that it's pretty expensive. I would wait for the price to go down, or maybe for black friday.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZI8VKAO1G2U6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DXOHR6K#wasThisHelpful","RZI8VKAO1G2U6","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

About a week after it arrived it would randomly disconnect, and would only reconnect if I jiggled the wire.

"*If you're already familiar with Breaking Bad and just want a review of this box set itself, scroll to the EDIT*To quote the lead actor Bryan Cranston, ""the term 'breaking bad' is a southern colloquialism and it means when someone who has taken a turn off the path of the straight and narrow, when they've gone wrong. And that could be for that day or for a lifetime."" This show- well actually to call it a show would be a great understatement, I should say this masterpiece, follows the story of Walter White, and how he breaks bad. Walt is a high school chemistry teacher, and first portrayed as kind of a loser. He's emasculated by his family, disrespected by his students, and bullied by his boss. Forced to work two jobs to take care of his pregnant wife and disabled son, Walt soon finds out that he has terminal lung cancer, with only a few months to live. In order to save money for his family to live off of after he's dead, Walt teams up with his former student, Jesse Pinkman, to cook crystal meth.What follows is a roller coaster ride to Hell. Watching Walt's transformation into his drug lord alter ego, Heisenberg, is one of the most masterfully executed character arcs in television history. Through a series of subtle, and sometimes not so subtle, shifts, we see this previously sympathetic character become something mosnterous. Vince Gilligan has etched his mark forever in entertainment history with this series. When most people want to show a character turn dark, they tend to rush things, and show drastic changes in a short amount of time, sometimes only a season or two. Not here. It's piece by piece, that Walter White tears off the mask of the harmless family man, to reveal the beast lurking behind a visage of meek compliance. Bryan Cranston brings this character to life in shocking, amazing, and breathtaking ways. He is the one who knocks.This isn't to say that Walt is the whole show. Aaron Paul plays Walt's protege, Jesse Pinkman, a juggalo without the makeup whose dialogue consists mostly of the words ""Yo,"" and ""Bitch."" Although while Jesse might start off as a bit of a clown, his character turns out to be so much more. Even though he's the one initially identified as a scumbag, Jesse without a doubt has one of the biggest hearts on the show. Between himself, Walt, and their many criminal associates, Jesse is often the only one portrayed as having a conscience.A constant and intriguing element of the show is also Walt's brother-in-law, DEA Agent Hank Schrader, portrayed by Dean Norris. Hank is a typical alpha male tough guy, sort of character, although he is also often brought in for comedic effect and is without a doubt a force of good. What makes the Hank element so truly marvelous though, is the fact that while he maintains a close friendship with Walt, he is constantly hunting his alter-ego, Heisenberg. Hank describes himself as Popeye Doyle, waving goodbye to Frog-One.Now I could sit here and go over every one of the amazing characters in Breaking Bad, from Walt's pain in the ass wife Skyler, to the ever so polite and refined drug kingpin, Gustavo Fring. But to do so would be to go beyond the scope of what this review is supposed to be. Breaking Bad is patient, it makes you wait for the payoff to come, and when it does come, it will blow your mind. For example, in some of the early episodes you see some tension between Walt and his old college friends over a company called Grey Matter, and it's not until season five that Walt explains the history there, in one of the most powerful scenes in the entire series. ""I'm in the empire business."" The show also makes good use of symbolism, such as the fly and the pink teddy bear (you'll just have to watch and see). Every time you watch through the series, you gain something new from it. For example (spoiler ahead) if you look at the titles to all the episodes in season 2 that have a 'flash forward' to the finale, the titles form the sentence ""737 down over ABQ.""As I'm writing this review, it's three episodes before the series finale. I will come back and edit this twice, first when the series is finished to give my final thoughts, and perhaps compose a more in depth review, and then again when the box set is actually released in November so I can give my thoughts on this product itself.UPDATE 9/9/2013:So they released some pictures of the box set. I have to say, it looks really cool. It's designed in the shape of one of the barrels that Walt buries his money in towards the end of the series. Although I suppose it could also be a chemical barrel or one of the ones that they use to dissolve dead bodies in if you use your imagination. It also comes with a commemorative coin designed by Vince Gilligan and (my personal favorite) a Los Pollos Hermanos apron.The special features include:- No Half Measures, a documentary detailing the filming of the final 8 episodes.- Bad memories, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul talk about the final episodes and their feelings and thoughts on the show.- Scene Envy, the cat tells us which scenes they wish they could have been in.- Shocking Moments, the cast reveals the moments that shocked them the most.- From Walt to Heisenberg, A montage showing the transformation from Walter White to Heisenberg.- How Will It End? Prerecorded predictions from the cast on how the series is going to end.- Avenging Agent: Dean Norris as Hank Schrader.- Scene Stealer: Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader.- A Criminal Attorney: Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman.- Jesse's Journey: Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman.- Skyler Breaks Bad: Anna Gunn on Season Four.- Growing Up in the White House: RJ Mitte on Walt Jr.- The Ultimate Chess Match, a look back at the battle between Walt and Gus.- Looking Back: A Season Four Retrospective, the best of season four.- Ted's Wipeout, Christopher Cousins explains how Ted's head injury was filmed.- The Truck Attack Storyboard Comparison, storyboards for the episode Bullet Points, and an in depth look at the attack on the Los Pollos Hermanos truck.- Walt and the Challenger Storyboard Comparison, a look at the filming of Walt doing donuts in Walt Jr's car.UPDATE 10/9/2013:Here's some big news folks. The studio just announced that this set will include a 3 minute alternate ending! I'm sure there will be lots of speculation on what this could be, so i won't get into my own theories here. Can't wait to see what it is though!Vince Gilligan also personally confirmed that we will get to see some scripted scenes that were left out of the final seasons, one of them from the final episode itself where Walt confronts one of his former students at a gas station who recognizes him on his way back to town!UPDATE 11/26/2013:BOX SET IS IN HAND! I absolutely love this thing. You can tell just by holding it that it's made from high quality materials. When you open it up, the Breaking Bad logo on the inside is actually the companion booklet, with a personalized letter from Vince Gilligan inside. Each season is in these magnetized sea through plastic cases that look like coasters, and when you take out all the discs and put them together, they make a picture from the show! (flying pants, pink teddy bear, etc). When you open the top, there's an extra disc inside the disc with some backwards numbers (from the POV shot of Walt looking at his GPS). On the disc is a bunch of extras, including the never before seen 2 hour fifteen minute documentary of the making of Breaking Bad. Underneath that is an insert that makes it look like the barrel is filled with money. Inside of the insert is a full sized Los Pollos Hermanos apron. Also inside is a Breaking Bad challenge coin.This is by far the best box set I have ever seen, and not just because it contains the best show ever made. If you love Breaking Bad then this is a must own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX7VZIZ57SNA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EEDNA4M#wasThisHelpful","RX7VZIZ57SNA5","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This film is one of the most incredible, beautiful, and heart wrenching works of art I have ever seen. Whether you're into anime or not, anybody should be able to appreciate this fantastic movie. This is a story about love, and familial bonds, and just how strong those forces can be. Don't watch if you aren't prepared to cry like a baby. The animation is stunning. It has that kind of older, hand-drawn feel that we saw a lot of in the 90s, with the high definition that can only come with more recent projects. The soundtrack is fantastic, giving feelings of both elation and devastation when appropriate. The Japanese voice cast is great, and while I can't as of yet speak for the English dub, I will be editing this review with my thoughts on that, as well as the box set itself and the features, when the product is actually released.A final note that I want to drive home. In a time when piracy is at an all time high, it has become extremely important to support official releases, especially in the American anime market, which in particular suffers from the perils of the information age. So please, don't just stream this online and not bother to support the company. This isn't to say don't watch it online at all, but if you do, and you enjoy it (and I don't see how you couldn't) please be sure to purchase the official release.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KUMSQHTH4QIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENNUC9Y#wasThisHelpful","R2KUMSQHTH4QIO","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I say anything else, it's important to note that this DVD contains no English subtitles or voice acting. This is strictly Japanese only.Comes with three discs. The first is the R18 version of the film, the second is the censored version, and the third is special features. Contrary to rumors, the censored version does not have additional content. The reason that the censored version has a longer run-time is due to the music video at the end. Most of the other differences are during the eclipse, some of the gore is censored, and there are shadows covering Casca and Femto during the rape. Better special features than the BRs that Viz has released so far. Some commentary from the creators and behind the scenes stuff. The cardboard cover is hand drawn by Kentaro Miura himself, and features an alternate version of the Berserk Volume 12 manga cover. My one complaint is that the R18 version doesn't support surround sound, which is a shame because I really enjoy watching these movies on the big screen with full speaker use.Regarding the film itself, all that I can say is WOW! It's mind blowing. Easily the best of the Golden Age trilogy so far. Possibly the most graphic anime I've ever seen. The infamous rape scene is horrifying and heartbreaking and grotesque all at the same time. The demon massacre is every bit as horrific as the manga. This is the Eclipse that Berserk fans have been waiting for, not to mention that we finally get to see the Skull Knight animated. Speaking of SK, he easily stole the show here. They managed to capture that mix of creepiness, mystique, and heroism that makes his character so cool in the manga. My favorite scene in the entire movie is the one where Griffith breaks down and the behleit activates. You can feel his complete and utter despair when he tries to kill himself in the lake. Among the other notable scenes I feel the need to express praise for the Zodd/Skull Knight fight, the Godhand intros, Griffith's mental collapse within the Eclipse itself, the Skull Knight's attack on the ceremony, Gaiseric, and Silat.All in all great movie. The biggest criticism I have for the content itself is where they ended it. In my opinion, it would have been better to extend the movie by 10-15 minutes, and show the birth of the demon child. Instead, it ends with Guts fighting off spirits with the Skull Knight, then skips to him departing as the Black Swordsman after the credits. I will be VERY disappointed of they skip the demon birth and Guts' first apostle kill and move on to the Black Swordsman arc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J7EZ0VN46IH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDH9VEE#wasThisHelpful","R1J7EZ0VN46IH0","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Been waiting on Elfen Lied on Blu Ray forever. At just two dollars more than the DVD set, this is a bargain. The BR quality is a noticeable improvement over the DVD. Some anime just take to high definition, and Elfen Lied is one of them. Something about seeing that blood, bone, and brain matter splatter across the screen in 1080p just brings a warm fuzzy feeling to my heart.Odds are, if you're considering this product, you've already seen Elfen Lied. If you already own the old DVD sets, or you aren't that huge a fan of the series, then maybe the bumb to BR quality isn't worth your money. However if you enjoy the series, and you haven't already purchased a box set, I encourage you to buy this one. In today's age of torrenting and streaming, it's more important than ever to support the shows you enjoy. Especially in America, where anime isn't as popular as it is in Japan. We all had the ache of waiting for new Hellsing dubs after Geneon went out of business, and Darkhorse stopped printing the old Berserk volumes because not enough people buy them. Can it really be that brilliant, artistic shows like these and Elfen Lied struggle for support while shows like Naruto and One Piece make millions of dollars on the DVDs alone?On the other hand, if you haven't seen Elfen Lied, then I cannot recommend it enough. Before Gasai Yuno came around, Lucy was the original pink-haired, split personality psychopath. This series is violent, beautiful, emotional, and bloody as all Hell. Due to its dark nature, Elfen Lied is not for the feint of heart. However, if you like dark, gorey, thrilling, and psychological stories, then this is the anime for you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ISM490E4VJPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D44IQQE#wasThisHelpful","R3ISM490E4VJPY","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very cool sticker. Good quality, stays right there on your window.One thing was strange though. I got stuck in a traffic jam for like three hours, with the sun beating down and no air conditioner. When I looked in the back seat, the face on this sticker had rearranged itself, and it had bloody tears streaming down its cheeks. Suddenly the blazing sun was blocked out by the moon, a solar eclipse! Next thing I knew, five Hell-Gods showed up, and offered me a deal. They claimed that the sticker had always belonged to me, and was meant for me my entire life, before I even bought it, and that it was merely waiting for the time when I most craved my own power, an opportunity presented by hellish traffic jam! They offered me the chance to have power and immortality, in exchange for sacrificing all the other cars on the road. Before I could accept their generous offer however, some biker with a skull helmet came and interrupted the whole ceremony, really put a damper on the whole thing.The stickers still pretty cool though, really makes my car stand out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EGONY2GY9THM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007GGGCKS#wasThisHelpful","R1EGONY2GY9THM","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for now about the anime itself. Those wanting to see a review of the box set itself should come back once it's released and I have a chance to get a hold of it ;)Those who are coming into this expecting a series about a cute little girl with pink hair that does silly things, are going to find themselves disappointed. A true successor to Death Note, minus the disappointing second act, Future Diary, aka Mirai Nikki, is a darker, more emotional, and more thought provoking story than one would think at first glance.The anime centers around two characters, Amano Yukiteru and Gasai Yuno, who are caught up in a high stakes game of life or death. Deus ex Machina, the God of the Future Diary universe, is dying, and he's set up a game to determine who will take his place. Each of the 12 contestants is given a 'future diary' that, as the name implies, predicts future events and records them as diary entries, each in a slightly different way. The goal of the game is for each contestant to kill the other 11, and the last man (or woman) standing is the winner.The great thing about Future Diary is that it gives you a little bit of everything, and holds it together well. The show has a great mix of romance, suspense, comedy, drama, and even horror. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it even has a straight up shonen, super saiyan beat down towards the end.The characters as well, are one of the places that the series excels at. Even the villains or characters that you hate, will absolutely make you fall in love with them by the end. One in particular comes to mind, one of the first villains you see shows up doing some of the most terrible things in the series, and by the end still manages to come off as not only sympathetic, but one of my personal favorite characters in the series. One of the main characters as well, Yuno, is absolutely exquisitely written. She's adorable, and terrifying, and hilarious, and psychotic all at the same time.Don't make the mistake of thinking you know what's going to happen either. With a Hunger Games-ish story like this, you can fall into the trap of identifying the main character, and assuming that he's going to win the game and that everybody else is dead.

"If you need a knife as a general EDC or utilitarian tool, pass this one up. However if you need a good fixed blade to defend yourself with, you can't beat the Cold Steel Chaos Tanto. Based on the WWI Trench Knife design, this product features the old school design, with streamlined Cold Steel craftsmanship.To reiterate, this is not a utilitarian blade. The tanto tip is designed for stabbing and maximum penetration, and the handle doesn't lend itself to detail work at all. However that only makes it all the more functional for self defense. The knuckle duster can serve as an effective non lethal weapon, and will also protect your fingers. The glass breaker on the bottom is fully functional as well.This comes super sharp right out of the box, and remains so after driving it into wood for over an hour. The blade here runs full tang and has so far held up to all the punishment I could inflict on it.As to some confusion in my previous review, the handle is not made of rubber, it's full metal. I was, at the same time, typing out a review for the Cold Steel Cutlass machete and my words got jumbled.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PMD8IS9NNGS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BD50S3K#wasThisHelpful","R3PMD8IS9NNGS2","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When purchasing a tactical or survival shovel, one may be tempted to go with the more popular, folding ""E Tool"" model used by the US military, manufactured by Gerber or one of the other companies that makes a similar design. The only advantage of this design is that it will save you space when storing it in a pack. Nine times out of ten, the Cold Steel Special Forces Shovel will prove superior. The reason for this is that with less moving parts, the special forces shovel will be far less likely to break. This design is basically just two pieces, the handle and the shovel head. Furthermore, should the wooden handle break, it's attached to the shovel head in such a manner, that you can basically carve out a tree branch or a thick stick, and use it as a replacement. This isn't to say that it will function as well as with the factory handle, but you can still make it work in a pinch.As far as this product in and of itself goes; I find it fantastic, as expected from anything by Cold Steel. I've used this to dig several holes, in particularly rucky areas, and the blade has held up without chipping or breaking. I've also tested its function as a hatchet, and it works great. You can chop away at branches and trees and not worry about snapping the handle. This guy now has a permanent place in the trunk of my car.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WJF9X7TNG7KO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00169V99K#wasThisHelpful","R1WJF9X7TNG7KO","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great romance, but hidden beneath a big layer of pervert. I love this anime, it's funny and sweet and the character's are compelling.

"This review is for now about the anime itself. Those wanting to see a review of the box set itself should come back once it's released and I have a chance to get a hold of it ;)Those who are coming into this expecting a series about a cute little girl with pink hair that does silly things, are going to find themselves disappointed. A true successor to Death Note, minus the disappointing second act, Future Diary, aka Mirai Nikki, is a darker, more emotional, and more thought provoking story than one would think at first glance.The anime centers around two characters, Amano Yukiteru and Gasai Yuno, who are caught up in a high stakes game of life or death. Deus ex Machina, the God of the Future Diary universe, is dying, and he's set up a game to determine who will take his place. Each of the 12 contestants is given a 'future diary' that, as the name implies, predicts future events and records them as diary entries, each in a slightly different way. The goal of the game is for each contestant to kill the other 11, and the last man (or woman) standing is the winner.The great thing about Future Diary is that it gives you a little bit of everything, and holds it together well. The show has a great mix of romance, suspense, comedy, drama, and even horror. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it even has a straight up shonen, super saiyan beat down towards the end.The characters as well, are one of the places that the series excels at. Even the villains or characters that you hate, will absolutely make you fall in love with them by the end. One in particular comes to mind, one of the first villains you see shows up doing some of the most terrible things in the series, and by the end still manages to come off as not only sympathetic, but one of my personal favorite characters in the series. One of the main characters as well, Yuno, is absolutely exquisitely written. She's adorable, and terrifying, and hilarious, and psychotic all at the same time.Don't make the mistake of thinking you know what's going to happen either. With a Hunger Games-ish story like this, you can fall into the trap of identifying the main character, and assuming that he's going to win the game and that everybody else is dead. This story has an ending that you will never see coming, although all the clues are there (hint, watch the opening credits closely).The Japanese voice acting is great, and the animation and soundtrack are both superb. Each perfectly compliments the tone of whatever you're watching, being silly and bubbly one moment, and creepy or suspenseful the next.If you enjoy series like Gantz and Death Note, then Future Diary is for you, and even if you don't I can't imagine anybody really not liking it. I'll be editing this review once the DVD itself actually comes out to give my thoughts on the box set and the dub.UPDATE 8/27/2013:Still waiting for the special edition of the box set to be released, but here are my thoughts on the dub. The editing is very well done, no awkward lip flaps or anything like that (so far). Same with the subtitles, no mistranslations or misleading phrases that I've been able to pick up on.The voices themselves however, I'm not a huge fan of. Most of the actors are okay, but I have to take issue with the choice of Brina Palencia as Yuno. This isn't to say it's a bad actress, because I very much liked her role as Natsuki in Summer Wars, but she is wrong for this part. Part of Yuno's charm is that she is a complete psychopath, but she sounds and looks like some cute little non-threatening schoolgirl. I'm not saying that the actress has to be as high pitched and cutesy as the original in order to be effective, but miss Palencia really cannot do cute and bubbling very well at all. Yuki and Deus are decent enough, although I still prefer the Japanese versions. Murmuru is barely audible at times. Minene's is great, I instantly fell in love with her English character. In the end I think that this is fairly typical for a dub. Those who prefer subs will hate it and those who prefer dubs will like it.The good news is that Funimation has given us the uncensored version. A big complaint about what we've seen so far on Hulu and some of the Japanese releases is that the gore and nudity is blanked out, which kind of ruins the immersion factor. Many people have feared that Funimation would be following this trend (ala Deadman Wonderland). However, I'm pleased to report that you will get to enjoy all the blood and gore (not to mention Minene's boobs) in the way that they were originally intended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5PK0AZFQIROQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CU6WBEK#wasThisHelpful","R5PK0AZFQIROQ","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This movie is not funny. This is just a poor attempt at appealing to the most base type of humor. It's all testicle and poop jokes, and not even funny ones. Filthy jokes can be funny, but they still have to be jokes. You can't just show balls and poop on screen and expect people to laugh. Worse than Bruno.For the record, I'm not a prude. If this movie was full of dirty jokes that actually made me laugh, I would be rating it five stars. This was complete garbage, not even funny.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R236X0JCZGDE4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPXW4KO#wasThisHelpful","R236X0JCZGDE4Y","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm sure many fans of the TV series are tired of hearing the elitist opinions of those who have read the books. I'm fully aware of the type of person who falls in love with a book, or graphic novel, or video game, or whatever, and finds any adaptation that deviates in any way from the source material to be complete and utter crap. I want to begin this review by saying that I am not this type of person. The first two seasons of Game of Thrones I found to be utterly brilliant. Even the filler, or the areas in which the show deviated from the books was marvelous. The acting was superb, even the child actors for this show are in rare form compared to what you see in shows such as The Walking Dead. The first season blew everybody away, both long time fans of the book series, and those new to the world of Westeros. The second season cashed the check that the first season wrote, building upon the epic promise of the first season finale. Then came season three...Before I get into the specific failings of the third season, I'm going to state for everybody the underlying cause of 90% of this season's problems. Greed. The studios trying to gouge more money out of the fans (and they have the balls to charge 40% more for the DVD/BR?!). The third book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, A Storm of Swords, has a lot happening in it. So using this excuse, the studio decided to divide the book into two seasons in order to show all the content. Since one thousand pages obviously does not fill 20 hours of television, they gave us lots of filler in order to fill time, like Margery and Sansa talking about boys. Furthermore, the actual content from the book moved at a snail's pace. Jon Snow took an entire episode just to climb the wall.Now I would be able to forgive this, if it weren't for the fact that they actually cut out some of the important characters and things from the book. All the jokes about Podd's bedroom performance could maybe have been cut to actually give real screen time to Mance Rayder or Tormund? One of the most important plot points in the book is Jon's conflict between his oath to the Night's Watch and his sympathy for the Wildling cause. The show makes Mance Rayder seem like the typical generic tribal warlord, and Tormund is just some giant ginger whose name is only mentioned once. I want to see Mance playing the flute, and Tormund telling outrageous stories about his member. The only wildling that is portrayed as even remotely sympathetic is Ygritte. And even that seems less so after she shoots Jon half a dozen times with arrows. Not to mention we get to see barely anything of Barristan Selmy. And who is Strong Belwas again?One of my biggest complaints here is also they they butchered (no pun intended) the Red Wedding. The most infamous scene in the entire series, and they messed it up. First of all, it would have been cinematic gold had they actually played the Reins of Castemere during the massacre, rather than playing the entire song, and then beginning the killings. Putting the right music to the right scene is something that you can only get in film or television, and it would have been something even the books couldn't show. Huge opportunity missed there. I also felt as though the gore and blood were unnecessarily cartoonish at some points. The throat slashing effects were straight out of Sweeney Todd, and the stomach stabbing scene felt unrealistic and awkward. Finally the scene were Robb actually gets stabbed. It would have been more dramatic to show Roose approaching him while he was on his knees, as it did in the books, then to just have him pop on screen and then off again like the 1990s animated Batman.Now this isn't to say that the season didn't have its high points. The scene where Danaerys liberates Slaver's Bay and gains her unsullied army was one of the best in the entire show. In fact most of the Essos scenes were well done. Although I wouldn't mind seeing a bit more of Barristan Selmy. Also the scene where Jamie saves Brienne from the bear was fantastic. Ultimately though, the glowing parts of this season were bogged down by too much crap. The worst part is that they've painted themselves into a corner where season 4 is concerned, once again working only with half a book. Hopefully they will find a way to better manage their content.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25K5P03MKC0Y0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C8CQTJY#wasThisHelpful","R25K5P03MKC0Y0","AYP5082JDMAHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYP5082JDMAHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like the Mary Janes better than these Betsy Lou, but Nufoot are wonderful to wear around the house, whether your floor surfaces are hard or carpeted.

I think that, on a metaphysical/energetic level, we do better will real contact, like being in contact with the surface we walk on is like moving in the ground of our being.

"These beads are exactly as imaged in the listing.  Just so you know, they measure slightly over 12"" to the foot and if you order more than one foot, it comes in one piece.  That's nice.  The 2' I ordered was around 1"" longer than that.  It had 54 beads - the exact number I needed.  But because the wire of the loop had been cut on the last bead, I can only use 53 of them.  So I will probably remove all the wires and just use the beads for a project other than what I bought it for some day.  If you want to make a rosary or half mala (which is what I wanted to do) with these beads, you'll need 3' since they only sell by the foot.The wire is very, very thin.  I don't know that these would stand the wear of daily use for prayers.

"In the headband's favor, the material is nice.  But this headband is way too small for a grown woman's head.  My head is 21"" measured like you measure for a hat.  That is exactly what an average adult woman's head measures.  This headband does not stay in place.  Because it isn't long enough, it slides up in the back, back in the front and that doesn't feel or look good.  Very disappointed in this.I'd asked a question before ordering the headband and got 2 replies.  The one from the seller said it fit a grown woman's head.  That's about all they said.  Another customer said it fit her adult head fine.  Maybe if a woman had that nice, prominent curve to the back of their head this would stay in place.

"What I love about this book is Chesterton's well-reasoned arguments and his writing style.  His arguments are down-to-Earth with a universal appeal - there's no high-brow, mind-bending gymnastics here.  He's as straight-forward about explaining his thinking and reasoning as is that marvelous character he created in his Father Brown fictional murder mystery stories.There was at least one point of religious thought I don't agree with Chesterton about, but he makes me think - about things and in ways I didn't think on my own.  And a couple of things that gave me pause, I had to change my mind about by the time I was finished with the book.Oh - there's this other thing.  Even if you don't care about Christian apologetics, read this for the language.  It is beautiful.  It is tasty.  It is so satisfying!  This book is an intellectual delight, but written for the ordinary person on the street.  It is not like a spiritually edifying book read for inspiration.

"This is my go-to, favorite tea.  It is inexpensive, but has lovely complexities and nuances that Lipton and Luzianne don't even approach.  It is a hearty tea.  I drank Bewley's Irish Breakfast Tea for years until I tried this Afternoon Tea.  I even like it better than a mid-range white tea that costs a lot more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14C6YRSYL2ZT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008KYQBNS#wasThisHelpful","R14C6YRSYL2ZT6","A3HKZA48V9HMCA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HKZA48V9HMCA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have some criticisms of the book and author, but all in all, I enjoyed reading the book.  I am a many-years-long devotee of Vesta.  Although it is presented as if for women with husbands and children, I believe the same principles are easily applied to and by anyone, whether they live alone or with others.  We all need the protection of our homes to nourish our spirits as well as our hearth/kitchen stoves to prepare the foods that nourish our bodies.  Where else better to cultivate the sacred in our lives if not in our own homes?My problem with the author is that she seems to think this was all her idea, or the idea of the wonderful old Italian woman, Camilla, who passed the flame to her at Vesta's temple in the Roman Forum years ago.  The author claims to be educated, but she is mistaking her law degree and surface investigation of the imperialistic period of ancient Rome for knowing and understanding.  Vesta as a national protector was not claimed by Romans until Rome itself was a metropolitan city and prior to that temple being constructed, there were no Vestal Virgins - every home had its own Vestal altar, for prayer, offerings, and expressions of gratitude.  That worship, ritual, and reverence for Vesta was ancient before there were real towns in Italy.  The author seems completely ignorant of the larger neo-Pagan community in the world, some of whom follow ancient Roman traditions and gods and certainly Vesta, or by other names in other countries - Hestia or Brigid, all names in other languages of that same spirit of heart and home.The author keeps apologizing for her new-found faith as if no educated person in their right mind would have faith and seems to be trying to justify it to her college sorority sisters.  At least in this first book, she still thinks of Vesta as a human-devised construct rather than a self-aware spirit in her own right.  She is afraid of seeming naïve, but her lack of deep spiritual understanding reveals how limited she is by the narrow scope of her university education - as if that was the only kind of education that legitimizes a human being.  Oh - and lets be clear.  The ancient Romans never anthropomorphized their gods until the Imperialistic period under the influence of the Greeks.  Before that, Roman gods were never shown in human form - they were known to be what they were: self-aware spirits or energies with specific attributes, therefore jobs.  Roman homes did not have images of Vesta in the form of a human woman.  Her symbols are the heart, naturally, and keys, as in the keys to the home and stores.My other problem is that throughout the book she makes comments about Christianity based on assumptions she's formulated since childhood, being raised in a atheistic family as she was.  She claims Mary in her aspect of the Immaculate Heart was something the Catholic Church dreamed up to take the place of Vesta in early Christian days - that aspect has Mary's heart with blazing flames.  But the Immaculate Heart was not venerated until the Middle Ages - many centuries after veneration of Vesta was outlawed under Church influence.  I'm a pagan, not a Christian, but I am a student of religious history and am annoyed with such shoddy scholarship by someone who keeps claiming, throughout the book, to be educated and have done the research.This should not keep you from reading the book.  It is inspiring, heartfelt, and a wonderful story of redemption and lives put to right through loving attention to one of mankind's oldest, most personal, and greatest gods.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LZL3HYBUPQL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=150328946X#wasThisHelpful","R2LZL3HYBUPQL7","A3HKZA48V9HMCA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HKZA48V9HMCA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like some of these sprout seeds.  But some of the mixes have seeds that germinate at such hugely different times that they don't come off timely and are unusable.

"I love this tarot deck.  The artwork is lovely to look at.  Although the included booklet modifies some of the cards' meanings a little, there is nothing in the cards to pull away from what I personally attribute to each card.  I've been reading professionally for nearly 40 years, so this is important in a deck I want to use regularly.The cards 'read' true.  While I haven't changed the basic meaning of the cards as I've read for 40 years, the Paulina Tarot cards have pulled me into a deeper level of their meaning.  This was a delightful surprise.  Who doesn't like a cool and attractive tool that makes you work better?!Paulina Cassidy is such a talented artist and visionary.

"How can editors allow a book to go to print without editing?  And how many times, on a single page, then page after page, chapter after chapter, can you say the same thing and call that a book?  The thoughts and method, in the hands of a writer, could have been presented in an interesting and engaging way and filled the space of an article in a magazine or blog.I had expected something more sophisticated, with anecdotal information about the specifics of how cleaning up the stagnant 'pools' of unused stuff in the home affected other areas of life.

"Hagiography at what was normal 100 years ago.  The fact is, there is very little historical information about this wonderful saint.  I don't particularly like writing about someone that is so far removed from any lived life.  But St. Rita is my patron, I rely on her and she's been my guide for years, so while this story of her life is way over the top and unreal, I'm still glad I got it.This is what I expected.

He has plunged deeper, spread broader, and expressed more clearly the depths of what it means to be Christian than in his previous writing (I know - if you have read earlier works, this may seem unreal, but it's true).
