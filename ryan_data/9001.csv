"â€œSometimes the innocent ones are guilty only because the world didnâ€™t give them a chance to stay innocent. Maybe Iâ€™m the one you should think about saving.â€I rarely fall in love with an authorâ€™s writing after only reading one of their books, but some writers are that outstanding, some books are that unforgettable, and L.H. Cosway is most definitely that kind of author. We met them in passing in King of Hearts, but their story finally unfolds in this bookâ€”Karla and Lee are two people belonging to two very different worlds, but their attraction is immediate, absolute, and greater than the sum of all the reasons they should stay away from one another. A story of opposites attracting, of two hearts colliding and being incapable of letting go, against a backdrop of two worlds that could never co-exist, and of two realities that will forever stand at opposite sides of the abyss called life. From its compelling characters, to the competent prose that holds us rapt cover to cover, this is a book I could not put down, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a splendidly written tale of a love fighting to triumph against all odds.â€œI may not have been the strongest woman in the world, but Iâ€™d always prided myself on living my life by a firm set of principles. Then Lee came along and threw a bomb on my rules, reducing them to a pile of meaningless rubble.â€Karla Sheehan is a young police constable trying to leave her mark in a male-dominated profession where her gender will always be her greatest weakness. Criticised and discouraged all her life for all she ever wanted to be, she is obstinate in her desire to prove her worth to herself and to all those who do not believe in her, but her greatest determination stems from a deep-seated need to help and protect those who cannot do it for themselves. Her clear-cut existence is thrown into a spin, however, when a cocky thug enters her life, set on seducing her.â€œIf you come, Iâ€™ll make you come with my tongue, and I wonâ€™t expect anything in return.â€Lee Cross has never had an easy life, forced to protect and put food on the table for his three brothers ever since he was a kid himself, and that life has taught him that in order to survive, heâ€™d have to live by his own set of rules. Finding himself in a pickle with the law is something that Lee is all too familiar with, but finding himself having feelings for the very law enforcer whose duty is to dismantle his operations is nothing he could have ever prepared himself for.â€œYou, meâ€¦us, it would never work, you know that, right?â€â€œNot sure I agree.â€â€œYeah, well, youâ€™re not the one with a reputation to uphold.â€â€œOh, really? What do you think my boys would say if they knew I was sleeping with a cop?â€As Karla and Lee fight their attraction as much as they keep succumbing to it, and as their worlds keep pulling them apart more and more each day, they are forced to question everything they stand for and everything they hold dearest in life. A romance between a policewoman and a criminal has disaster written all over it and for Karla and Lee, loving each other means finding themselves caught between a rock and a hard place time and time again.â€œâ€¦being with him made everything else in my life a lie, and yet, the idea of being without him made everything seem empty and grey.â€Ms Cosway has made these charactersâ€™ inner struggle so real, so very palpable and poignant, that you cannot help but wish for them to find a common ground to build their happily-ever-after upon. The sexual tension between them literally sets the pages on fireâ€”the perfect blend of scorching passion and heart-warming tendernessâ€”but their journey to the finish line is never rushed, never forced, and never veers away from the very essence of these characters. The more they get to know one another, the clearer it becomes that their lives might have led them down two very different paths, but what is in their hearts makes them more alike than they ever expected.â€œâ€¦when I look at you, I see a little piece of myself, but braver. Thatâ€™s why I like you.â€I wished at times to have more insight into the heroâ€™s character as well, to see some crucial scenes through his eyes and hear his thoughts too, finding myself inexplicably drawn to the many facets of his complex personality and curious to find out even more. It would have made this story even more compelling, made him less of a â€˜bystanderâ€™ in some situations, in my opinion, and added even more angst to certain scenes. This did not affect my overall enjoyment of this wonderful tale, however, Karla and Lee being two characters you cannot help but love and cheer for from the very first page, and their every interaction made my skin tingle. This is such a wonderful addition to a truly exceptional series, exquisitely written and with storylines that are as varied as they are unique, and while this book can easily be read on its own, I would advise reading King of Hearts beforehand as these stories happen somewhat simultaneously and they complement greatly one another.â€œGive me a chance, and Iâ€™ll prove to you that everything you think you see is blurred by perception.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UO0VVZDCU81H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016QYD3XE#wasThisHelpful","R3UO0VVZDCU81H","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œYou love a man, Millie, you believe in him, you take him as he is. You go on his journey with him no matter what happens, even if that means you have to walk through fire.â€Never underestimate the power of a great writer because the moment you step into one of their books, your every emotion is at their mercy, but when that writer also happens to be one of your favourite contemporary authors at present, their every single word has the power to annihilate you. And this book did just that. I have never cried so many times and so desperately as I did while reading this breathtaking story, every aspect of it touching everything that I am, everything that I dream of, everything that I fear the most as a woman. Ms Ashleyâ€™s unparalleled insight into the female psyche and her ability to infuse a womanâ€™s innermost vulnerabilities as well as strengths into her stories, celebrating both in equal measure, is the very reason I keep coming back for more, the thrill of diving into one of her stories never wearing off, never dimming, never becoming anything less than a true craving. Whether youâ€™re a fan of MC romances or not, it does not matter in this caseâ€”this is a story that first and foremost celebrates women for their resilience, for their selflessness, for their ability to love without limits, all the while underlining the meaning of true love.â€œI met my perfect man at age eighteen and I had him for three years. Then I sent him away.â€Millie Cross once had it allâ€”a man who adored her, a man she adored in return, the kind of future sheâ€™d always dreamed of within her graspâ€”but the course of her life changed with a single sweep of fateâ€™s cruel hand, spending the next twenty years simply going through the motions of living, her heart never even beginning to recover from losing its other half. So, when a chance sighting of the man she never stopped loving suddenly brings back all the memories sheâ€™s fought hard to suppress, she becomes convinced that only facing him would heal her wounds, and perhaps even give her a chance to move on in life. Because the one thing Millie never told him was why she left him.â€œI needed to right that wrong. He needed to know. And I was the only one who could tell him.â€Logan â€œHighâ€ Judd was only a young recruit for the Chaos motorcycle club when he met an eighteen-year-old Millie at a party, but it took him merely an instant to know down to his soul that she would be the only woman heâ€™d ever love. After three years of blissful happiness, however, his heart was torn out of his chest when she sent him packing, throwing all their dreams away. For the next two decades, High moved on, settled down, tried to build all that he once dreamed of having with Millie, but the hole in his chest never went away, never allowing him to forget the pain he felt from losing the love of his life.â€œMillie,â€ he called.I kept my gaze to the yard and replied with a, â€œHmm?â€â€œSafe with me.â€My attention cut back to him.â€œNever wonâ€™t be, babe,â€ he went on softly. â€œNot ever. Hear?â€When High finds himself suddenly facing the woman who broke his heart, he channels all heâ€™s ever felt for her into anger, wishing to hurt her over and over again for all the pain heâ€™s had to endure since she left him. He uses her bodyâ€™s reaction to him to punish her, to humiliate her, to make her feel as insignificant as sheâ€™d made him feel all those years ago when she pushed him away without an explanation, and she suffers every blow, every hit to her dignity, starved for his touch, for his love, for his tenderness, knowing there is nothing of her left to break. Until there is and she is forced to tell the man she never stopped loving why she left him when they seemingly had it all.â€œIâ€™m done walking through fire for you, High! Iâ€™m done not because Iâ€™m done but because thereâ€™s nothing left of me to burn. You have it all! Youâ€™ve always had it all! I gave up everything so you could have it all! Please! God! Leave me to my nothing! And if you gave one single sh** about me, ever, make them let me have my nothing!â€And this is where my own heart broke into smithereens, crying for a heroine who never deserved the fate life served her, or the punishment she endured as a result of it, and hurting for a hero who spent twenty years of his life never really knowing why he lost it all, or how much he had truly been loved all those years. This is a story of second chances at love, at happiness, at a happily-ever-after that was theirs from the beginning and it always remained theirs, showing us that time cannot touch true love, and that great sacrifices often bring even greater rewards in life. This is also a story of forgiveness, of acceptance of what we cannot change. In true Kristen Ashley style, we are given two characters who are so multi-faceted and compelling that their journey very much becomes our own, and I felt every up and down right in my gut.â€œI love you. Loved you then. Love you now. Never quit lovinâ€™ you in a way I know I never will. You were it for me, the only one, the only woman I ever loved, and you never quit beinâ€™ it.â€With a colourful plethora of secondary characters from previous instalments in the series very much playing a vital role in Millie and Highâ€™s story, and proving once again the unbreakable bond connecting them all to one another, Ms Ashley has given us another unforgettable tale that will undoubtedly be added to the â€˜re-read pileâ€™ for many. I was drawn to re-visit several scenes right after I first finished this book, unwilling to bid farewell to this story and to these charactersâ€¦because if you keep re-reading a book, it never really ends, right?â€œIf we can walk though fire, baby, we can do anything.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KGTZDAKI33TW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3E76II#wasThisHelpful","R1KGTZDAKI33TW","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œWe were terrible people who did terrible things to each other. We were slaves to hate because hate was strong and we sacrificed love to fuel it.â€O. M. G. There are simply no words to describe this story and do it justice. A dark, gritty read start to finish, I felt like I was having an out-of-body experience for the most part because I found myself enjoying things I most definitely shouldnâ€™t have, and I am now convinced that Karina Halle could make me jump out of an airplane with a handkerchief instead of a parachute, because she makes Quentin Tarantino look like Walt freaking Disney. If youâ€™re not afraid of an unconventional love story, one that wonâ€™t just push the boundaries of your comfort zone, but completely incinerate them, and still leave you smiling like a fool, I canâ€™t recommend this trilogy highly enough. But like youâ€™d take your shoes off at the door, walk into this story free from everything youâ€™ve ever come to expect in a romance and allow yourself to enjoy the rideâ€¦in all its wicked depravity. Because with superb writing such as this, you wonâ€™t even want a seatbelt.â€œThe wife of a drug king. The queen of corruption.â€The love story between Luisa and Javier Bernal has never been a hearts-and-flowers kind of romance, their turbulent affair forged in the cauldron of the violent Mexican drug cartels, but while they were once partners and confidantes, the past year and a half has created a deep fissure in their marriage, turning them into two strangers living under the same roof. Once a ruthless, cunning, merciless man who was also capable of great tenderness towards his wife and loyalty towards his men, his twisted code of morals dictating his every decision, Javierâ€™s grief over losing his beloved sister Alana has now turned him into a loose cannon. Unpredictable and blood-thirsty, violence has become his only outlet, making him no longer trust himself around his wife. Believing that there is no place for love in his life and that his feelings for her have become his ultimate weakness, the only thing capable of hurting him any further, he pushes Luisa away, seeing emotional distance as the only way of protecting them both.â€œShe had become my family, my confidante, my lover, my friend. She had become everything to me, in bed and outside of it. But she was a weakness, my weakness. She was what the would go after next, the last thing I could possibly lose. Unless I lost her first.â€Heartbroken and lost, Luisa keeps hoping Javier would find his way back to her, even though the loss of his affections is slowly making her lose herself and her purpose in this new life. She remains willing to forgive him for all his mistakes, to give him all of her, whichever way he needs it, just to have his love back. The distance between them, however, only seems to grow as time passes, driving Luisa to make desperate mistakes of her own.â€œPlease. Be rough. Hurt me. Make me bleed. Give me something.â€But while they are both busy licking their own wounds, a snake in the grass lies waiting, ready to strike and take all theyâ€™ve built together away from them. And once he does, this story explodes into an out-of-control inferno of events, each more shocking than the next, yet each fitting of this story and of these characters. This book is prickly, confronting, brutal more times than not, but it never pretends to be something itâ€™s not, consistently zealous and out-of-the-box, and forever true to its premise. Stories like these are what nightmares are made of, but Ms Halle still manages to add a compelling human dimension even to the scariest of her monsters. And to paint even the most depraved of actions with a romantic brush. Gory, twisted, horrific from the get-go, this is not a fairy tale, each of these characters inherently flawed and damaged, but the beauty of this story lies in their self-awareness, in their ability to adapt to their circumstances, to forgive each other, to constantly push the limits of their own moral codes and keep redefining themselves in the process. Do yourself a favour and immerse yourself in this story with an open mindâ€”you might end up loving it just as much as I have.â€œIt was only him and it was only me. King and Queen. Thatâ€™s all that existed in this rusted, bloody space, between these two tortured, filthy souls.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S42GXT88GZTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015D8LL3S#wasThisHelpful","R2S42GXT88GZTD","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œForget the prince and princess. I always imagined the real story was between the witch and the dragon.â€From an author whose every story manages to touch the deepest recesses of our hearts, we are given another extraordinary tale that steals our breaths away and holds us spellbound cover to cover. This is the story of a marriage of convenience between an enchanting little â€œwitchâ€ and a grumpy old â€œdragonâ€, a marriage designed to benefit both, but be in name only, until a â€˜love spellâ€™ is cast and a game of make-believe turns into a real-life fairy tale. And while there are in fact no real witches or dragons in this book, thereâ€™s nonetheless a dreamy, almost fantastical quality to this love story, reminiscent of so many childhood fairy tales, and its message just as inspiring. I was enthralled by these characters, emotionally invested in their every high and low, and utterly smitten by the magic that is woven between them. This is a book I loved loved lovedâ€¦and then loved some more.â€œI have a business arrangement to offer you.â€â€œA business arrangement?â€â€œYes, well, in actuality, Mr. Hawthorn, Iâ€™m here to propose marriage.â€Kira Dallaire is twenty-two and broke. Born into a life of privilege and luxury, she has left her old life behind to become her own person and make a difference in the world, determined to be free from the controlling and intimidating influence of her powerful father. But with no college education or any employment prospects in sight, she is driven to concoct a plan born out of sheer despairâ€”to marry a complete stranger for money. With a trust fund that would go to her either when she turns thirty, or when she gets married, Kira makes an offer of marriage to a man she does not know, a man she is inexplicably drawn to from the moment she lays eyes on him, a man who needs that money just as much as she doesâ€”proposing to split her inheritance once they are married, and then after one year, simply go their separate ways. But as attractive as her offer is, her soon-to-be husband only unenthusiastically agrees, openly resenting her for becoming a constant reminder of his failures in life.â€œHe looked like every hero in every fairy tale Iâ€™d ever dreamed, come to life. And, God, I wanted to believe in heroes again. But sometimes, I supposed, a girl just had to be her own hero. Especially when the hero in question turned out to be a dragon.â€Grayson Hawthorn has never known what it feels like to be loved, raised by parents who reminded him every single day of how unwanted and unworthy of love he was. When he is left the family winery in his late fatherâ€™s will, he vows to himself that he would do all he could to bring it back to its former glory, believing the gift to be his fatherâ€™s way of atoning for a lifetime of unkindness and of making him feel worthy for the very first time in his life by entrusting him with such a great responsibility. Determined to make his father proud, but with the winery teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, Grayson is willing to do all it takes to fulfil his vow, even marry an entitled, selfish, spoiled little princess with fiery hair and bewitching emerald eyes, whose defiant spirit seems to set his temper alight.â€œNext time you offer to marry someone, you should try to be a little more meek. A man likes some obedience in a wife.â€â€œWhat was that now? I want to make sure I get every single word of wise advice. Meek, was it? Does that have double e or is it ea? I can never remember.â€But first impressions can be deceiving and the longer they live under the same roof, the more they uncover about one another, soon discovering that they have a lot more in common than just their financial predicament. Grayson quickly learns that he might have misjudged his â€œlittle witchâ€, her upbringing not so dissimilar to his own, thus leaving deep scars on her self-esteem and sense of self-worth, while Kiraâ€™s regard for her husband grows tenfold when she discovers how little love heâ€™s known in life. They argue, they bicker, never conceding to one anotherâ€™s will, but their every heated exchange also stirs a deep yearning in them both, slowly blurring the lines of their fake marriage and making them wish it was all a little less â€˜pretendâ€™ after all.â€œIâ€™d sleep on the floor in this dusty shack if it meant getting the best of Grayson Hawthorn.â€What sets off almost as a BrÃ¶nte novel in a present-day setting, with a marriage of convenience resulting in a new wife feeling unwelcome in her neglectful husbandâ€™s home, the prickly touches of unrequited love quickly turn this story into a moving modern fairy tale that pulls the reader in with its irresistible blend of pleasure and pain. A story that is entirely character-driven and told in both their voices, with frequent dashes of witty dialogues and light-hearted humour, we fall for Kira and Grayson almost immediately, and the more we get to understand them, the more attached we become. With a feisty but kind-hearted heroine whose decision to marry for money weighs heavily on her conscience, longing to be loved and cherished, but forced to forgo all childhood notions of marrying her Prince Charming one day to a loveless connection to a â€œman-dragonâ€ who can barely stand the sight of her; and an irritable, judgemental hero whose cold, unforgiving façade conceals a man starving to feel worthy of love, respect, and kindness in his life, until a little â€œwitchâ€ shows him what selfless love truly looks like, turning his colourless existence into the life he never dared to dreamâ€”this was a winning formula from the start for me.â€œLove. Fierce longing rose in my chest. For just once to be cherished.â€There are so many delightful facets to this story, so many puzzle pieces that keep us engrossed in its every word, and for me, it was one of the hardest books to move away from in the end as I desperately wished I could have stayed in their world forever. A breathtaking example of the healing power of love, and of how only pain can sometimes make us recognise true loveâ€”I simply adored this wonderful book and would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone seeking an exquisitely written story they would never forget.â€œLove can be piercing. Love means exposing yourselfâ€”all of yourself, every tender partâ€”to being hurt. Because true love is not only the flower, true love is also the thorns.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRPWXE46DBAMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155Q0LWA#wasThisHelpful","RRPWXE46DBAMJ","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"He whispered more words in her ear, words sheâ€™d never heard before, in a voice she always wanted to hear. He was gentle with her, in a way heâ€™d never been before, with a touch she could learn to live for. And as he breathed life into her veins and new thoughts into her mind and different feelings into her soul, there was just one phrase repeating itself in her head.â€œâ€¦ we donâ€™t have to be these people anymore â€¦â€While not always in the mood for Romantic Suspense novels, this authorâ€™s extraordinary writing in My Time in the Affair made me pick up this book without a secondâ€™s hesitation, already certain it would be a thrill-ride of a lifetime. And how right I was! An exhilarating reading experience from the very first page, there was not a moment in this story that adrenaline was not rushing through my veins or my heart was not beating a million miles an hour. Action-packed start to finish, divinely written, raw and gritty but somehow romantic and sexy at the same timeâ€”this book was unexpected in its beauty, given the violent backdrop of the story, and I was literally left panting in the end. Panting from excitement because their story was not over, panting from all the emotions I had felt while reading this incredible story, panting because my heart felt like it had run a marathonâ€¦barefoot. A truly breathtaking tale of two enemies turning into lovers, battling their way across North Africa, trying to stay alive in order to complete their missions, as long as they donâ€™t kill one another beforehand. A must read!â€œThe were destined for two very different paths.â€Marcelle â€œMarcâ€ De Sant and Liliana â€œLilyâ€ Brewster are mercenaries, hired by the Russian mob for a heist, Marcâ€™s job being to steal blood diamonds from a Liberian gang, and Lilyâ€™s to smuggle them out of Africa. On their last night in the same city, as Marc completes his assignment and Lily is about to start hers, they share one night of toe-curling passion, a night meant to be expel a monthâ€™s worth of sexual tension and desire between them, knowing that after than night theyâ€™d never see one another again.â€œâ€¦that woman will f*** your world up. She looks like a pin up, f***s like a porn star, and fights like Tyson.â€But in a world where trust and trustworthiness are rare commodities, and itâ€™s every man for himself, Lily and Marc soon find themselves facing each otherâ€™s gun barrels, fighting to separate lies from the truth, all the while running from the very men who set them off against one another. As we follow their gripping journey from Liberia to Morocco, we watch the two lovers-turned-adversaries learning to rely on one another, even put their lives in each otherâ€™s hands, their differing agendas becoming more and more aligned as they become closer.â€œTell me what do, Marc, Iâ€™ve been making decisions for too long. Have they all been wrong? Tell me what do.â€The most badass heroine I have ever come across, Lily is no damsel in distress in any given scenario. She holds her own in every fightâ€”punching, kicking, shooting her way out of any perilâ€”determined to fulfill her final mission. Yet Marcâ€™s dominant, protective traits also awaken the vulnerable young woman in her who has been looking after herself for five long years, never trusting anyone to make decisions for her or to have her best interest at heart. She craves to give herself to a man who truly understands her, a man who would take her far away from the life she has chosen for herself, and as they grow closer, their priorities start shifting, bringing them into uncharted waters they are both uncertain how to navigate. Or whether they are even capable of doing so.â€œI made promises to yesterday. I canâ€™t start giving away my tomorrows.â€A compelling, fast-paced roller-coaster ride that never tapers off, never loses steam or fails to hold us willing captives every step along the way. With an intriguing, multi-faceted cast of characters and exhilarating action on every page, this is first and foremost a love story, born against all odds, a love story between two people who somehow manage to preserve some of their humanity in the midst of a life where being human is seen as the ultimate weakness. Love made them see a better life, but the journey to believing in that life remains ahead of them as their story continues and concludes in Out of Plansâ€¦They were like magnets, fighting against each other one minute, then stuck together the next. Whatever it was, it was tangible, and powerful, and very real, and very present. He was the first person to ever make her question her plan. To ever make her wonder if maybe revenge wasnâ€™t the answer.â€œâ€¦ we donâ€™t have to be these people anymore â€¦â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8K4GC1HBRNKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013KWCNL8#wasThisHelpful","R8K4GC1HBRNKX","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"He shuddered out my name, pressed himself fully inside, and waited for one long breath.â€œAre you okay?â€ His words were painful and tight, gritted out between his teeth, and I nodded, unable to form words, unable to do anything but worship at the altar of Cole Masten from that moment forth.â€œGood,â€ he moaned. â€œBecause Iâ€™m about to unleash hell.â€With each new Alessandra Torre novel, I seem to fall more and more in love with this authorâ€™s extraordinary gift, and this book is no exception. A light-hearted, somewhat less intricate love story than her other works, this is a book that shows us that even when she sets to write â€œlight and funnyâ€, she does it with impeccable attention to detail, and the kind of flawless character development that could carry any storyline forward. This is a heart-warming tale of opposites attracting, of two people fighting their attraction to one another, only to fail at every turn, and of life proving true the old adage that when one door closes, another opens in its stead, just as long as we have the courage to walk through it.The story takes place in the sleepy little town of Quincy, Georgia, home to sixty-seven original Coca-Cola investors-turned-millionaires who have continued leading quiet, unpretentious lives, regardless of their heftier bank accounts. Life remains simple and predictable in Quincy, until a Hollywood superstar decides to shoot his next movie there, bringing attention to a town that has always valued peace and anonymity over the limelight.Summer Jenkins grew up in Quincy, but never in her twenty-nine years of life has she felt truly accepted by the small town sheâ€™s called home ever since she was a child. Shunned for a moment in time when she allowed her emotions to get the best of her, she now lives a quiet, humble life with her mother, with no ambitions or grand plans for the future, except leaving Quincy one day and starting a new life somewhere else, somewhere far away from the resentment, the whispers and the sideways looks that follow her everywhere she goes.â€œI wanted something different. I wanted to be someone different, someone without scorn, someone without a past. Someone with a future.â€From the moment Summer hears about the upcoming movie production in Quincy, she becomes determined to turn it into her ticket out of town. She is willing to work any job, big or small, as long as it makes her enough money to put her on the road, never expecting that her feisty Southern belle charm is all that is needed. Especially when directed at a certain Hollywood superstar whose arrogance and uncouthness bring out the worst in her.â€œKiss me like that again and Iâ€™ll rip your eyes from their sockets.â€He held up his hands with a hard smile. â€œNo worries, princess. I have no desire to repeat that experience.â€ He leaned forward slightly, enjoying watching her bristle. â€œAnd Iâ€™m not talking about the cheap shot. Iâ€™m talking about the kiss. Iâ€™ve had better. Much, much better.â€It was a lie. That kiss, that brief moment before violenceâ€¦It might be worth losing sight over.Cole Mastenâ€™s whirlwind acting career has made him a household name all around the globe, adored by fans wherever he goes and continually pestered by the paparazzi, his high profile marriage to a fellow actress only bringing his personal life even more into the public eye. But when his seemingly perfect life comes to a standstill as he suddenly finds himself facing a messy divorce, his salvation comes in the form of his next movie project, one he is passionate to see succeed.â€œIt was natural for the girl to look at him, for her attention to divert from Cole, especially when he had asked her a question. But still. Three Oscars in his storage unit. Her gaze could have at least lingered.â€His arrival in Quincy is marked by nothing more than some passing chatter, the townsfolk entirely indifferent to his celebrity status, and while at first she might have not shared the townâ€™s lack of interest in finally meeting Cole Masden the actor, it only takes a few minutes spent in his presence for Summer to dislike him at first sight. And the more she gets to know him, the more her antipathy towards him grows. Their every encounter turns into a quarrel, Coleâ€™s every word rubbing Summer the wrong way, unbeknownst to her that he continues to provoke her on purpose, her fiery, no-nonsense personality drawing him to her like a moth to a flame.â€œI thought then, my hand resting on the doorknob, looking out on the front porch that held two of the sexiest men I had ever seen, that there was something there, in him, something whole and raw and beautiful. Now, I know what I saw. I know what that something was. It was ***hole, pure and simple. It was spoiled rottenâ€”I get what I want because I deserve it, you are beneath meâ€”***hole.â€As their lives suddenly become temporarily intertwined, we get first row seats to one of the sexiest, most entertaining enemies-to-lovers scenarios Iâ€™ve ever come across, where the leading characters donâ€™t know whether to kill one another or rip each otherâ€™s clothes off. Ms Torre keeps building the sexual tension between Cole and Summer scene after scene, to the point where our hands start shaking as we impatiently turn the pages in search of a climax. This tension never declines, never fizzles, never loses momentum, every fleeting touch between the characters buzzing with promise and only sweetening the anticipation.â€œThere should be laws against men who could kiss like that. With a mouth that dominated yet begged. Tongue that teased yet delivered. Tastes that dipped into an addiction stream and hooked a woman after just the first hit.â€Itâ€™s a story that focuses on setting the foundations for the emotional connection between the two main characters, not on instant gratification, to such a degree that once we reach the apex of the storyline, there is no doubt in our minds that these characters belong together. Overall, this story might lack that edgy, spicy tang that we have come to expect from Ms Torre, but her character development is no less thorough, no less compelling or seductive, and her prose is as polished as ever. The celebrity-falling-for-the-girl-next-door scenario is nothing we havenâ€™t seen before, but this authorâ€™s take on it has her signature stamp all over it. She has given us a fearless, outspoken heroine who is in no way intimidated by the heroâ€™s fame or riches, and a strong, dominant leading man whose self-awareness compels us to like him from the get-go, which coupled with Ms Torreâ€™s vibrant writing styleâ€”and her ability to â€˜reinventâ€™ it with each new projectâ€”has made this book an addictive delight start to finish.â€œI was raised to believe that â€˜real menâ€™ had manners, and werenâ€™t picky, and didnâ€™t wear aftershave that attracted mosquitoes.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIK59V4IX1THF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UA70U8#wasThisHelpful","RIK59V4IX1THF","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œWeâ€™ve dealt with the dark desires spun from our worst secrets and found ultimate pleasure in them, together.â€One of the most fascinating, well-written, carefully thought-out stories I have ever come across, the Asking For It duet is nothing short of electrifying, and it owned my breath cover to cover. While its key theme might deter some readers from tipping their toes into this story, I remain in awe of the authorâ€™s ability to handle a rather problematic topic in such meticulous detail, intelligently and responsibly, never glorifying any vile acts, but rather giving her characters a chance to express themselves in all their damaged glory, free from judgment and condemnation, and even find some self-acceptance in the end. If youâ€™re not afraid of the taboo, if you are able to perceive some themes in fiction as just that, without giving them the unnecessary dimension of reality, if you enjoy exploring on occasion a darker but not any less titillating brand of erotic romance, I urge you with all my heart to give this crazy-wonderful story a chance. You might find yourself loving it just as much as I did!â€œThe hands that caress me hold me down; the moan of satisfaction I imagine turns into screams for help, screams no one hears. As the fantasy becomes more savage, more brutal, I glory in it more and more.â€Vivienne and Jonahâ€™s relationship had reached an impasse at the end of their first book, leaving us with the lingering question whether the darkness that brought them together and forever tied to one anotherâ€”the fantasy that they both hate but cannot seem to escapeâ€”would ultimately tear them apart too. As we remain in the heroineâ€™s head, we continue witnessing the inner struggle that has been Vivienneâ€™s constant companion in her adult life. Even though she has slowly come to terms with her bodyâ€™s response to her sexual fetish, to the violent aspect of it, and its intoxicating effect on her mind, she continues berating herself for needing that fantasy every single time in order to achieve sexual gratification. She struggles to reconcile her sexual desires with the kind of independent, emancipated woman she is outside the bedroom, that dichotomy tearing at her self-esteem and leaving her powerless.â€œJonah understood what I needed and how to give it to me. He let me become a victim; I let him become a monster.â€We also get to finally peel off more and more layers of Jonahâ€™s complex personality, even glimpsing his greatest demons first hand and the source of all the relentless anger and pain churning inside him, but once we discover what hides within his darkness, that knowledge only serves to leave us even more uncertain of the fate of their relationship.â€œJonah is like one of the dormant volcanoes he studiesâ€”solid as stone, proud as a mountain, seemingly implacable but with a fire deep within that could erupt at any time.â€With each step they take forward as a couple, letting one another deeper and deeper into each otherâ€™s secrets, and loving each other unabashedly, it becomes clear that their connection goes far beyond their mutual desires and the ability to please and understand one anotherâ€™s needs as no one else could. But they also become increasingly aware that while their sexual attraction and compatibility could never be questioned, the fire blazing between them could end up swallowing them whole.â€œWe are bound together and yet parted. Two halves that canâ€™t be glued into a whole. Maybe thatâ€™s how it is when you find someone whose wounds are the same as your own.â€This is an outstandingly conceived story of self-acceptance, of embracing our own wounds, scars, flaws, and finding comfort in the knowledge that being damaged does not make any of us â€˜abnormalâ€™ or unworthy of love. No matter how deep their wounds are and how permanent their effect is on their psychological make-up, characters like these show us that they can become more than just the sum of their weaknesses, that their love can transcend it all, empowering them to become functional individuals in every sense of the word, rather than crippling them and pushing them even deeper into their demonsâ€™ arms. A daring tale that was truly impossible to put down, showcasing not only Ms Paceâ€™s impressive storytelling skills, but also her ability to frame a personâ€™s most startling shortcomings as sources of strength and powerâ€”I am afraid I could never fully express how much this story has amazed me with its honesty, fearlessness and insight into a dark theme I never expected to quite enjoy so much. Stories like these give us hope that no matter how much harm is inflicted upon us, we are never truly broken. And only we can put the pieces back together. Bravo!â€œMy power over him comes from my powerlessness in his arms. The paradox intoxicates us both.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32II84LB4ZW9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI026JC#wasThisHelpful","R32II84LB4ZW9W","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œHold on tight, Cherieâ€¦ Donâ€™t let go.â€When you open a new book and you find yourself gasping for air, your chest clenching only a few pages into the story, you know youâ€™ve hit the mother lode of great reads. Once again, in true Kristen Ashley style, we are given a story that owns us from the start, our hearts fluttering to the rhythm of the powerful emotions driving every scene, every sentence, every word exemplifying this authorâ€™s distinctive and truly remarkable prose. I always take my time reading a KA book, but I gave myself even more time to savour this particular story, to absorb every hidden layer, to fully appreciate every facet of these two characters that are so unlike any of her others, because I knew she had saved some of her best work for last. A truly splendid conclusion to a phenomenal series, if you havenâ€™t ventured into it yet, it is time you pay The â€˜Burg a visit.â€œI was the kind of girl whoâ€™d never dreamed because, even when I was little, I always knew I was the kind of girl whoâ€™d be stupid to dream.â€Cherie â€œCherâ€ Rivers stopped dreaming of a knight in shining armour a long time ago, learning very early in life that the only person she could ever truly depend on was herself. A single mum in her mid thirties, a hard worker, a loving parent, a woman confident in all that she is and all that she would ever be, she lives her life unapologetically and true to herself, knowing that all the sacrifices she has ever made were done in good conscience and for the good of one person and one person aloneâ€”her beloved ten-year-old son Ethan. Having pushed all her dreams of finding a good man and being loved by such a man aside, all Cherie now dreams of is giving her son a good life, teaching him how to be a decent man, and making him feel loved every single day of his life. But as closed off as Cherieâ€™s heart might appear to be, it secretly pines for a man whoâ€™s only ever seen her as a friendâ€”a good man, a loyal man, a trustworthy man, the kind of man she would fight with all her might to keep in her life. Just not a man whoâ€™s ever showed any signs of loving her back.â€œA man who liked me. A man who laughed at my jokes. A man who smiled at me regularly. Who teased me often. Who shot the s*** with me. A man who liked me a lot. A man who was my friend. A man who thought of me as a friend. The man I loved more than breath.â€Lieutenant Garrett â€œMerryâ€ Merrick has only ever loved one woman in his life, but heâ€™s never believed in happy endings. Losing their mother as young children has marked the Merrick siblings deeply, leaving them both terrified of loss, and thus prone to self-sabotaging their own happiness while in pursuit of emotional numbness. But while his sister conquered her demons and got her second chance at finding happiness, Merryâ€™s hang-ups have led him to watching the love of his life getting engaged to another man and not wanting to do anything to stop it. Except drowning his sorrows in an expensive bottle of whisky with a friend, and opening his eyes to the possibility that the one whoâ€™s been in front of him all along might be exactly the kind of woman he didnâ€™t even know he was looking for.With their inhibitions lowered and their bodies aching to seek comfort in one another, Merry and Cherie share one night of unrivalled passion, a small taste of the bliss to be found in each otherâ€™s arms that neither of them can deny, but a new day brings them two very different outlooks on the night theyâ€™d sharedâ€”one of them daring to dream of more, and the other dismissing it as a one-night stand that should have never happened.â€œIt wasnâ€™t walking out of a house into a taxi or your car in your clothes from the night before that was the walk of shame. You wanted what you wanted, you went after it, you got it, then you left it and went on with your life. There was no shame in that. None. The shame was lying naked in your own bed listening to a man be quiet while dressing because he woke up next to you not wanting one thing to do with you.â€Cherieâ€™s pain from allowing herself for one fleeting moment to hope a man would want to look after her, share her load, love her and her son, and then seeing that dream vanish even before it took shape, leaves a deep scar in both her pride as well as her fragile heart, only strengthening her conviction that she is just one of those girls who would never find that kind of happiness in life, even though she would give anything to have it.â€œâ€¦ heâ€™d never give me what I wanted. I forgot. I forgot I wasnâ€™t the kind of girl who got what she wanted. Not once. Not in my whole f***ing life. Yeah, Iâ€™d forgotten that.â€But the moment Cherieâ€™s heart closes off again, Merryâ€™s suddenly becomes wide open to falling for a woman who now spends equal time fighting her attraction towards him and plotting his murder for making her feel everything she refuses to feel for him. And when a Kristen Ashley alpha male sets his eyes on a woman, get the popcorn ready and make yourself comfortable, because resistance is futile from the get-go and itâ€™s going to be a ride like no other.A woman scared of any more heartbreak in her life, reluctant to let a man see her vulnerable side and trust him not to hurt her, and a man who didnâ€™t even know that all he ever needed in life in order to let go of his past was a woman who would stick by him through thick and thinâ€”Merry and Cherie are two damaged, lonely people who find everything theyâ€™ve ever dreamed of in each other, if only they can see past their fears and embrace the rare beauty theyâ€™ve uncovered in each otherâ€™s arms.â€œThatâ€™s life. You have no clue what youâ€™ll get along the journey. But you wonâ€™t get d*** you stay in one place, spinning your wheels.â€I have loved all the stories in this epic series by an author who never fails to rock my world, and this was not just another great addition to the seriesâ€”it was the perfect finale, the perfect conclusion, the perfect send-off to a remarkable group of characters whose stories have become some of my favourite re-reads. The epilogue alone acknowledging all the other couples in the series was far more than just the proverbial icing on the cake, the closure gained from seeing their lives fast-forwarded before our eyes leaving me in a happy daze of nostalgia laced with bittersweet tears. Each one of these stories touched me deeply in its own right and in its own way, and the beauty of Merry and Cherieâ€™s story did not disappoint. Not by a long shot.â€œGod, did he know? Did he know that he was the dream come true a girl like me would never dare to dream?â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UZNQKDRQGO3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YUR6BUM#wasThisHelpful","R3UZNQKDRQGO3X","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œAre there any more?â€â€œThereâ€™s a seven.â€â€œAnd?â€She smiled as if she were picturing it in her mind.â€œOh, Katie.â€ His voice sounded like a purr. â€œIt must be really good.â€â€œThe number seven is when you kiss me when youâ€™re inside me. It feels incredible.â€â€œDo you know what sounds really good for dinner?â€ he asked, nibbling her ear.â€œA number seven with a side of letâ€™s order in?â€â€œYouâ€™re so quick,â€ he said, easing her off his lap and pulling her toward the bedroom. â€œI really like that about you.â€Shame on me for almost forgetting how much I loved this authorâ€™s writing style in On the Island, because she never stops surprising me with the freshness of her ever-evolving prose, the way her characters embed themselves into our hearts so effortlessly, and the uplifting quality of her stories that always make us wish they never ended. This story surprised me at every turn, and I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone looking for a beautifully written book to make their hearts smile. And skip a few beats on occasion too.Kate Wattsâ€™ future might have been paved for her since she was a child, expected to follow her fatherâ€™s footsteps all the way to the Supreme Court, but her thrill-seeking heart was never one to settle for a job that would not inspire her every single day of her life, so she leaves a promising career as a corporate attorney behind to open a food pantry for the underprivileged. However, hard work, dedication and personal sacrifices are not enough to keep this venture afloat and fulfil the needs of all those whoâ€™ve learned to rely on Kateâ€™s organisation to keep their families fed and clothed, bringing the food pantry to the brink of having to turn people away. Until an anonymous donation saves the day. And then does it again the following month.â€œWho are you?â€â€œJust a man with a mission.â€â€œIndependently wealthy, or does the money grow on a tree in your backyard?â€â€œI steal from the rich to give to the poor.â€Determined to find out the identity of her mysterious benefactor, Kate sets to catch him in the act of dropping his next donation, only to find herself facing a man who knows a lot more about her than she would have ever expected him to. And resolved to know even more. Yet all she gets to know about him is his first nameâ€”Ianâ€”and the fact that he is a computer hacker. As they spend more and more time in each otherâ€™s company, we get to witness a truly heartwarming romance slowly take shape, entirely driven forward by their witty dialogues, their undeniable chemistry, and the heroâ€™s charming persistence that leaves us swooning at his every word.â€œGet out of my computer immediately. Iâ€™m willing to move past the fact that you hacked me, but it ends now.â€â€œNo more backdoor?â€â€œNo more backdoor.â€He appeared crestfallen. â€œEver?â€â€œNever,â€ Kate said firmly.â€œNot even on my birthday or like a special occasion?â€â€œAre we still talking about my computer?â€ she asked.â€œYou probably are.â€But the more she falls for him, the more Kate remains aware of not knowing anything about her new boyfriend beyond his incorrigible charm, his playful and very demonstrative disposition, and his generosity of heart. His true identity and the nature of his work remain under a veil of secrecy at all times, making her question the longevity of their attachment. And whether she could ever truly trust a man whose life would forever be laced with mystery.â€œAlways chose love. Always choose the adventure. Youâ€™ll never regret it.â€As Kate and Ianâ€™s budding romance becomes the most important relationship in both their lives, the reasons behind our heroâ€™s insistence on secrecy become even more justified as his foes start closing in on his activities, putting everything theyâ€™ve built between them into jeopardy.A truly beautiful, heartfelt story that left me once again smitten by this authorâ€™s brand of storytelling, this was one of the most delightful reads of the year for me, with also some of the wittiest and most engaging dialogues Iâ€™ve ever had a chance to enjoy. Ms Garvis Graves knows how to perfectly pace her stories, giving a romance time to grow organically before our eyes, never rushing them or cornering them into unrealistic scenarios. By the time she is finished, we believe in the charactersâ€™ unbreakable connection, we understand them, empathise with them, cheer for them no matter what happens. And the love she wove between Ian and Kate is entrenched in their every action. This is a story that shows the unwavering trust that is built between two people whose love rises above all, making them willing to pay any price for the happiness of the other. I was completely besotted by this story, my heart beaming from the very first page, and I found myself wanting to do a heel-click Mary-Poppins-style when I realized their tale would continue in White-Hot Hack, regardless of how satisfying the ending was.â€œSomeday youâ€™ll sit beside me and know you can trust me no matter how fast weâ€™re going.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T1GZAXZB3BTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCUGPXK#wasThisHelpful","R3T1GZAXZB3BTL","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œYou were always with me, Grace. I never found a way to let you go.â€It only takes one visit to New York City to understand why so many timeless works of fiction happen to take place here, why so many unforgettable love stories are inspired by this city, and just how many recognizable icons of this great metropolis are now reminders of some of the greatest books weâ€™ve ever read. And we can now add another one to that list of greats. A love story spanning over more than a decade, this is the tale of two young people who simply met too soon in life to truly appreciate what they had found in one another, whose lives take off in different directions, but eventually bring them back to each other again, where they belonged all along, because their hearts would and could never love another. Itâ€™s a story that shows us that some loves have no expiry date, that some people are meant to be with one another no matter what, even when time is stolen from them, even when they are robbed of memories that could never be replaced, even when nothing could ever make them forget the bitter taste of regret from losing one another for so long. This was one of the most heartwarming romances I have ever read, a story I adored, and it made me miss the bustling streets of New York City even more, but knowing that next time Iâ€™m there, Iâ€™d be seeing it through these charactersâ€™ eyes too.â€œYou canâ€™t re-create the first time you promise to love someone or the first time you feel loved by another. You cannot relive the sensation of fear, admiration, self-consciousness, passion, and desire all mixed into one because it never happens twice. You chase it like the first high for the rest of your life. It doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t love another or move on; it just means that the one spontaneous moment, the split second that you took the leap, when your heart was racing and your mind was muddled with What ifs?â€”that momentâ€”will never happen the same way again. It will never feel as intense as the first time.â€Matt Shore and Grace Starr met on their first day of senior year at college, and from the moment they laid eyes on one another, they became inseparable. Both creative, strong-willed and independent, their shared quirkiness makes them perfect partners in crime, always encouraging each otherâ€™s artistic affinities and ambitions, and becoming each otherâ€™s muses and greatest fans, until the connection between them inevitably outgrows the bounds of their friendship and transforms into a romantic one. But as their final year of college comes to an end, their relationship all too quickly falls apart, leaving them heartbroken and mournful of all they had lost, forever wondering if theyâ€™d ever find such happiness again as the one they had found in each otherâ€™s arms.â€œWe were victims of bad timing. But here we are again.â€Fifteen years later and now both in their mid thirties, they see one another again for just a moment in time, and suddenly nothing can stop the memories of their time together from invading their every thought. But when they finally find each other and all the lingering questions about those missing years are answered at last, they are left with even more resentment and regret, their love having survived it all, but once again put to the test as their hearts struggle to forgive for all that was stolen from them.â€œI missed everything, Gracie. I missed everything.â€A heart-wrenching, truly unforgettable tale of second chances at love, of two people whose love never died, never even dimmed, even though what was taken from them could never be given back. I rarely connect with two characters this wayâ€”I loved their every quirk, their every imperfection, their every insecurity, but I loved loved loved the way their hearts loved each other the most. Ms Carlino has a flair for dreamy, passionate love stories that warm our hearts and feed every romantic bone in our bodies, but this time around, she has given us a true gem, a timeless tale of a never-ending love set against the backdrop of a magical city she captured oh-so perfectly, a tale that I suspect will become a favourite for many.â€œNew York has an energy that takes root inside of you. Even a transplant like me gets to know the different boroughs, like theyâ€™re living, breathing organisms. Thereâ€™s nowhere else like it. The city becomes a character in your life, a love you canâ€™t take out of you. The mysteriously human element about this place can make you fall in love and break your heart at the same time. When you hear her sound, when you breathe in her scent, you share it with all the people walking beside you on the street, in the subway, or gazing from a tall building across Central Park. You know at once that you are alive, and that life is beautiful, precious, and fleeting.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TSS3AXEWUUFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O65X7MI#wasThisHelpful","R3TSS3AXEWUUFI","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"â€œLoveâ€™s hard to find, and when you do, you donâ€™t throw it away.â€Ever since I finished this book, I havenâ€™t stopped smiling. Smiling because stories like these fill me with an indescribable sense of hope and positivity. Smiling because some stories are just so wonderful in every single wayâ€”inspiring, brave, honest, relevantâ€”that they fill my heart to bursting. Smiling because some love stories touch us so deeply that we never want them to end. And this is a book I wanted to grow old reading.â€œâ€¦he was a gay man buried so deep in the closet he questioned if he would ever find his way out.â€Dylan Reeves is a married man in his late thirtiesâ€”a man married to the same wonderful woman for the past nineteen years, a father to three well-adjusted kids, a successful businessman on the verge of the greatest professional accomplishment of his careerâ€”and yet he has been living a lie all his life. Dylanâ€™s marriage, as supportive and loving as it is, has been a sham from the start, an arrangement between two best friends who agreed on living separate lives while raising together the three people they love the most in the world. But while his wife has given herself permission to find true love outside their marriage, Dylan has denied himself the same, putting his childrenâ€™s happiness before his own, and living by a strict moral code of always doing the right thing, at all costs.â€œâ€¦they didnâ€™t ask to be born. It wasnâ€™t their fault I didnâ€™t have the balls to be me.â€While on a weekend business trip, as part of his companyâ€™s merger negotiations with one of the most successful technology companies in the world, the last thing Dylan expects to find on the other side of the negotiating table is a man who suddenly makes him forget all heâ€™s pretended to be for so long, awakening all his suppressed yearnings, and igniting the very sexual man he was born to be.â€œIâ€™m in troubleâ€¦â€â€œThat you are. I think we both are.â€Tristan Wilder is a man at the top of his professional game, a self-made computer mogul who has the world at his fingertips, but his success has also cost him his personal life, rarely finding the time to engage in anything more than commitment-free trysts with men who never ask more of him. Until a closeted man walks into his life, and ends up turning it upside down. Never one to have to pursue his conquests, Tristan finds himself in uncharted territory as he romances a man struggling to let his desires consume him. But the more time they spend in each otherâ€™s arms, exploring each otherâ€™s bodies and stealing each otherâ€™s hearts, the more it becomes apparent to them both that their weekend together would end up changing their lives forever.â€œThereâ€™s no way this will end well for me, but not taking the few moments youâ€™re willing to give me seems like a far worse fate.â€And this is all I will tell you about the storyline because even a peep about what comes next would deprive you of the very special way this story unfolds and eventually comes together, of the way these characters react in certain pivotal moments in the story, of the way their unique bonds are attested, because it is those unexpected actions and reactions that make this book so extraordinary in its approach. This is not a story that trivialises the vows of marriage, or validates infidelityâ€”this is a truly inspiring story about living oneâ€™s truth, about the kind of selfless love and devotion that puts most of us to shame, about finding the courage to showâ€™s oneâ€™s most vulnerable side to those we love the most. Love does not always mean an easy road ahead, but stories like these make us believe that there might be a happily-ever-after for us all. There is something truly uplifting about tales like these, tales that show us how life should be, the life we should all have the right to live, and I am always astonished by the sheer beauty of these authorsâ€™ stories, consistently inspiring but inexorably sexy. Whether a seasoned m/m reader or new to the genre, this story should be on top of your reading list.â€œIâ€™ll wait for you, however long it takes. I donâ€™t care.

"â€œI canâ€™t walk away from you even if I wanted to. And I donâ€™t want to. You are reality and sweet oblivion wrapped up in one annoyingly argumentative, always-bloody-right, classy, gorgeous-as-f*** package.â€Six full length novels, six couples I loved from the get-go, six unforgettable love stories that will forever remain some of my favourite books of all time, and we now say goodbye to the wonderful world of the On Dublin Street series with this unputdownable finaleâ€”a touching friends-to-lovers tale that had me either squirming in my seat from the unrelenting chemistry between the characters, or clenching my chest from all the angsty emotions it stirred in me page after page. I loved this book, loved it so much I couldnâ€™t help but re-read parts of it right after I first finished it, leaving me with a bittersweet smile on my face knowing I was saying farewell to a â€˜realityâ€™ I learned to depend on whenever I was in need of a true romance to warm my heart.â€œIâ€™d worked hard to become my own person and not a shadow of the girl lost in the manipulations, cruelty, and neglect of her family.â€Grace Farquhar is a young woman who left her privileged past and the person she once was behind to embrace the woman she always hoped to become. Having grown up in an disparaging environment that left her with serious self-esteem issuesâ€”raised by parents who either ignored her or belittled her continually with demeaning comments and self-serving expectationsâ€”she was forced to sever all contact with her family in order to heal and become her own person. But years of feeling inadequate and never speaking out her mind have left her fearful of confrontation, constantly craving the approval of others. So when a very loud new neighbour moves into the apartment next door, his late night sex antics keeping her awake night after night and leaving her too tired to work during the day, she reacts uncharacteristically, having no qualms about expressing her distress and frustration at his behaviour. Even when her words seem to fall on deaf ears and her new neighbourâ€™s mocking stance only serves to aggravate her even more.â€œLogan MacLeod is the least likely candidate for boyfriendhood of any man in the entire world.â€Logan MacLeod is not the man the world believes him to be. One mistake in his life, one act of fierce protectiveness towards a beloved sister, has cost him two years of his life and a lifetime of shame, but behind the bad boy façade hides a man looking for forgiveness, self-fulfilment, and a fresh start in life. When the cute spitfire next door confronts him about his late night shenanigans, he is instantly drawn to her, but the more life pulls them closer to one another, and the more he gets to know her, the more he believes that she deserves someone better than him, someone worthier, someone whose past is not weighing heavily on his shoulders, making him wish he were a better man for her. Even though in Graceâ€™s eyes he is all sheâ€™s ever dreamed of finding in life.â€œAlthough I was actively looking for the man I wanted to spend my life with, I wasnâ€™t looking for a fantasy man. I was looking for someone understanding, protective, and funny. I didnâ€™t expect perfection. I just wanted to like the person I was dating, and I wanted him to be kind.â€When Loganâ€™s past comes unexpectedly knocking at his door, changing his future forever, Grace becomes the person he learns to lean on the most in life, her kindness and generosity helping him face a reality he never believed possible. But as their lives become more and more intertwined, their attraction grows as well, leading to a climax of epic proportions. One which only one of them doesnâ€™t regret in the end.â€œIâ€™d fallen in love for the first time. And he didnâ€™t love me back.â€This is a very emotional but also downright scorching tale of a love born suddenly, unexpectedly, a love free from judgement and prejudice, whose sheer magnitude heals both young lovers from the ugly scars from their respective pasts. Itâ€™s also a story that shows the true definition of a family, of the incomparable power of friendships, and how much the two can sometimes become one in life. Grace and Logan break the cycle they were born into by becoming the kind of people they always wished their parents would have beenâ€”two people who love selflessly and unconditionally, and whose love and devotion to those closest to them becomes the one thing they are most proud of in life.It is with a heavy heart that I let these characters and all the wonderful couples who came before them go, certain of many a re-read in the future. Ms Young has given us the perfect kind of closure for all six storylines, and even though there will never be another Jocelyn and Braden, Johanna and Cameron, Olivia and Nate, Hannah and Marco, Shannon and Cole, or Grace and Logan, I am certain the best is yet to come from this truly extraordinary author whose words never fail to blow my mind.â€œI never thought youâ€™d light up for the likes of meâ€¦ Iâ€™m going to f*** you until you see stars.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13JB31NK8EDBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5DLY42#wasThisHelpful","R13JB31NK8EDBM","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œNot all fantasies are things we want in reality.â€Iâ€™d like to think of myself as a reader with very few boundaries when it comes to picking my next book, only a few things in life triggering emotions I choose not to feel while indulging my mind with its next great escape. So, when I came across this book, my mind tingled from the get-go, yelling at me to dive into this story blindly and see where it would take us. And what an exciting ride this has been! A perfectly written, masterfully assembled storyline that captures your attention with its brutal honesty, somehow making the unthinkable sexyâ€”this is a book that I devoured in its entirety and would urge anyone to sneak a taste of it before dismissing it at first sight. Its entire premise might turn many people away, but nothing about this story glamorises what it shouldnâ€™t, dealing with a problematic theme capably, sensitively, with purpose rather than for kicks, often pausing to reflect on scenes rather than forging ahead thoughtlessly. I am drawn to the taboo, that I will admit, but I never lose the magnifying glass, the critical eye with which I read these stories because in order to enjoy them I need to perceive them as love stories rather than stories of the forbidden, and this book never crossed that line. It intrigued me, fascinated me, owned me start to finish with its beautiful prose, and it left me pondering on it long after it ended.â€œI wanted the dirtiest, filthiest brutality, and I want it badly. Wanted it for so long.â€Vivienne Charles is a twenty-five-year-old woman with a secret. While in possession of a healthy sexual appetite, she is incapable of experiencing sexual gratification unless a certain scenario is metâ€”Vivienne needs to imagine being raped. But while her sexual fantasies have always remained just thatâ€”fantasiesâ€”a random encounter with a handsome stranger on a deserted highway changes everything, turning into an unexpected offer to fulfil each otherâ€™s dirtiest fantasies with no strings attached.â€œYou like to play one role. Iâ€™d like to play anotherâ€¦ On your terms, and within your limits. But I think we could . . . satisfy each other.â€Vivienneâ€™s handsome stranger might be exactly what she has always dreamed of finding in a man, intuitively sensing all her darkest desires, and satisfying them one by one, but Jonah Marks has also found exactly what heâ€™s been looking for in the woman whose body he reads so well. Their fantasies complement each other perfectly, igniting a purely sexual relationship that inevitably leads to more, becoming the most honest and gratifying relationship either of them have ever had. They feed each otherâ€™s dirtiest fantasies, fulfil each otherâ€™s most repressed desires, their role-plays becoming the only way to silence the memories that both of them fight to forget.â€œThis fantasy that dominates meâ€”itâ€™s sick, and itâ€™s twisted, but itâ€™s not going away. Fighting it hasnâ€™t done any good. So Iâ€™m giving in. Surrendering.â€But once they grow closer to one another and the unspoken secrets between them start itching to come out in the open, the very reason Vivienne and Jonah connected in the first place becomes the wedge that eventually drives them apart.â€œEach of us assumed the other was simply indulging a kinky fetish, when in fact we were shepherding each other through our nightmares.â€Since Vivienneâ€™s inner voice is the only one we get to hear, her character is the one we feel closest to, her doubts, fears, and insecurities adding a very â€˜realâ€™ element to a story that can be at times difficult to relate to. The author has gone to great lengths to make us understand Vivienneâ€™s mind and the way it has somehow merged rape and arousal into one, making her unable to peel them apart anymore, and eventually turning the very event that has changed her sexual nature altogether into her ultimate sexual fantasy. Given great character introspection, we are able to perceive Vivienne and Jonahâ€™s relationship as a romance, albeit a very dysfunctional one, but a romance all the same. The guilt and the shame associated with their respective fantasies and the unveiling of the events they stemmed from play a vital role in this first part of their story, setting the scene for so many possible outcomes, and inevitably leaving us gasping for more. This was such an unexpected treat, a story I never expected to delve so deep into the human condition, and I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone with an open, judgement-free mind and an occasional taste for a darker, out-of-the-box kind of love story.â€œItâ€™s your fantasy, and mine. Chances like this donâ€™t come along oftenâ€”two people twisted in the same exact way.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y94T0PQGNMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4CRO#wasThisHelpful","R1Y94T0PQGNMO","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œHow rough can you take it, Lourdes?â€Thereâ€™s something utterly decadent, in the best possible way, about revisiting a beloved fictional world, and getting to peel off more and more layers from a reality that already captivated us, mesmerized us, kept us engrossed beginning to end. The Wild Side trilogy was one of those delicious reading escapes for me that was impossible to put down and inevitably left me starving for moreâ€”more insight into the characters, more uncovered truths, more angles from which to untangle the plotline, not to mention seeing some of the secondary characters get their chance to tell their story. This book gave us just thatâ€”it gave us back two characters we couldnâ€™t help but notice and become intrigued by in the midst of Iris and Dairâ€™s whirlwind romanceâ€”and it made us fall in love with them. Lourdes and Heath are as unlikely a match as they could possibly be, and yet their very differences make them so perfect for one another. My heart raced from the first page, every word in this sinfully exhilarating romance making me forget the world around me and immerse myself blissfully in yet another scorching R.K. Lilley story that I adored.â€œWhat Iâ€™d give to have a man love me like thatâ€¦ What Iâ€™d give to have a man look at me like that, with his whole heart in his eyes.â€A successful woman in her forties, Lourdesâ€™ messy divorce has left her apprehensive about trusting men again in her life. Her romantic heart has always dreamed of finding a great love in her life, of being adored, cherished, protected, even though she never believed sheâ€™d be lucky enough to find such a man. So when a mysterious stranger, sixteen years her junior, walks into her life, determined and relentless in his forceful pursuit of her, Lourdes battles with herself as her mind and heart pull her in different directions. But it becomes very clear from the start that her stranger is not a man easily dissuaded from his intentions, his every touch, look, command awakening her body as never before.â€œDonâ€™t make me regret this.â€â€œYou wonâ€™t. And you wonâ€™t forget it, either.â€Stoic, dominant, unreadable at the best of times, Heathâ€™s remarkable self-control makes him a very confusing and often exasperating man to be around, but Lourdes is drawn to him like a moth to a flame, his ability to affect her body as puzzling as his unwavering concern for her emotional wellbeing. While he dominates in the bedroom, he is surprisingly gentle in his handling of her outside of it, making her feel protected and treasured whenever within his reach. Everything about him cautions her to safeguard her heart from him, and yet she inevitably falls for him more and more each time they are in each otherâ€™s arms.â€œIâ€™ve lived a violent life. But, Lourdes, listen very carefully, because this is a promise: Iâ€™d never hurt you. Okay?â€But Heath is a man drowning in secrets, his life a horrific collection of traumatic memories and lurking dangers, and the more Heath and Lourdes start to feel for one another, the more his reality drives them away from one another, breaking Lourdesâ€™ heart more and more each time Heath disappears without an explanation.â€œIâ€™d taken in a wild animal. How could I be surprised Iâ€™d been bitten in the process?â€Ms Lilley has given us a heroine with an astounding level of self-awareness evident in her every thought, doubt, impetuous act born out of nothing more than instinct and courage. Her character is meticulously and perceptively framed start to finish, making it easy for us to connect with her on every possible level. She remains mindful of every complicated trait present in the broken man she is slowly falling in love with, and yet she keeps putting her heart on the line, confident it wouldnâ€™t steer her wrong.â€œIâ€™d be alone for the rest of my life before Iâ€™d settle for less than a man who flat out adored me.â€An electrifying story that kept me on the edge of my seat page after page, with just the right balance of sizzling sex and mounting emotional attachment between the characters, not to mention an impressive insight into the charactersâ€™ psyche. I loved the way Lourdes and Heath are allowed to grow individually, as well as a couple, and the only thing that I would have loved even more would have been to hear Heathâ€™s inner voice as well on occasion, an insight into his complex personality a welcome addition to the heroineâ€™s. As they help one another overcome what is holding them back from having a life more complete, Heath and Lourdes also teach each other the true meaning of ever-lasting, selfless loveâ€”that love changing every aspect of their existence.â€œHow could the way someone looked at you change the way you saw your life?â€While this story could theoretically be read on its own, it connection to The Wild Side trilogy is impossible to ignore, many aspects of Heath and Lourdesâ€™ story completing that of Dair and Iris. Their parallel timelines are designed to fit perfectly into one another, filling each otherâ€™s gaps and offering a more thorough understanding of the overall plotline.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30U32F9NEOPGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y9MGGC6#wasThisHelpful","R30U32F9NEOPGO","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œSpencer Ryan is not a man you fall in love with. Heâ€™s a man who can rock your world for as long as you can resist the urge to stab him. And when the urge finally gets too much, you walk away before you get yourself a criminal record.â€When half of our lives seem to be spent interacting with others online, it comes as no surprise that there would eventually come a book about a modern-day romance stemming from social media. But do not be mistaken, this is not your motherâ€™s kind of romance novelâ€”there is no knight in shining armour in this story who professes his undying love to a helpless heroine minutes before they ride off into the sunset. This hero is no gentlemanâ€”he flirts, teases and peacocks around, his gigantic ego only overshadowed by the mouth-watering â€˜selfiesâ€™ of his flawless body that he shares unashamedly with his horde of female followers worshipping his every move. And his heroine is no damsel in distress, her only weakness being her attraction to this exasperating but utterly persuasive â€˜anti-heroâ€™, their chemistry setting the pages on fire, and their sexy banter making us feel like voyeurs in this playful, engaging, funny but sexy-as-hell â€˜enemies-to-loversâ€™ romance with a twistâ€”because these characters remain â€˜enemiesâ€™ until the very end, and their romance never really becomes very romanticâ€¦ish.â€œMarriage is a fate worse than death as far as I can see. No woman is getting her claws in me anytime soon. But if sheâ€™s wearing those heels on the wedding night, I could think of worse ways to go.â€Spencer Ryan is a self-made social media personality, his self-absorbed and flirtatious posts gaining him thousands of female followers to feed his ego and fill his free time. But no one really manages to grab his undivided attention until a mysterious girl with a pair of killer heels as her profile picture starts toying with him online, the cut and thrust of their daily banter being the very thing Spencer loves the most in a woman. Her sexy shoes coming in a close second.â€œItâ€™s just a shame youâ€™re not the full package, isnâ€™t it?â€â€œBabe, you donâ€™t know the first thing about my package.â€His â€˜Shoegirlâ€™, however, just so happens not to be a random follower at all. Jasmine â€˜Jazzâ€™ Parker is a young woman stuck in the rut of her own fear of change. But when forced to quit a job she always hated anyway, she is presented with the perfect opportunity to finally take a leap and give her dream of owning her own business a chance. With her entire life at a crossroad, she escapes into the harmless fantasy of a man who shows no signs of self-doubt, a man who makes her feel sexy and desired, a man who distracts her from her own reality with his light-hearted teasing and blatant flirtingâ€¦until fantasy and reality unexpectedly overlap, crushing her fantasy into smithereens.â€œIâ€™ve never pretended to be anything Iâ€™m not.â€â€œOther than a nice person, you mean?â€With only one of them aware of their online friendship too, they begin a very sexy game of cat and mouse, where their undeniable attraction ends their every encounter with them against a wallâ€¦ or a mirrorâ€¦or a kitchen counterâ€¦or in a shower togetherâ€¦but their animosity towards each other only seems to worsen as their attraction grows, feeding the spiteful hashtags exchanged between them online as much as the passion that makes them unable to keep their hands off one another.â€œThis girl is amazing though; curvy, beautiful and she hates me. The deadliest of combinationsâ€¦ If she wasnâ€™t such a bitch, sheâ€™d be in big trouble.â€They play, they fight, they sc*** each otherâ€™s brains out every chance they get leaving no surface safe to their sexy romps, but there is a fine line between love and hate, and eventually there is nothing left of it apart from a whole lot of unspoken feelings and old demons making them fearful of opening their hearts to one another.â€œI thought you were better than this, Spencer.â€â€œI knew I wasnâ€™tâ€¦â€I so loved this racy â€˜enemies-with-benefitsâ€™ story, and once I started reading it, there was no way I could put it down. Spencer and Jazzâ€™s unconventional brand of romance pulls you in with its witty, mischievous charm, irresistible from the get-go, and refreshing in all its flaws until the very end.â€œ@TheSpencerRyan: I took a hot shower this morning.

"â€œIâ€™m not who I used to be, Finley.â€â€œThatâ€™s a shame, because you used to be wonderful.â€Opening a new Fisher Amelie book is an adventure in itself, perhaps akin to the feeling of standing upon a cliff, high above a whimsical but luring sea, basking in the beauty of the landscape before us, while pins and needles tingle our skin from the sheer magnitude of the jump that is ahead of us. We know that once we leap forward, the free-fall might exhilarate us, but the sea will inevitably then greedily engulf us and force us to fight for our next breath. And yet nothing compares to the thrill of those few stolen breaths, of those powerful moments of struggle against a mighty foe, because we know, we just know we will eventually come up for air, find the sun again, and immediately start looking forward to climbing our next cliff. Every story in this extraordinary series has brought light to a â€˜great foeâ€™, a social issue that is quietly bringing our society to its knees, humbling us daily and putting our entire lives into perspective. But in every story a bright beacon of hope has also emergedâ€”powered by love, self-sacrifice, kindnessâ€”and this story is no exception. From the angry ashes of loss and despair, a phoenix of courage is born, boldly taking flight and thus freeing itself from the shackles of its own pain. This is a story of two broken people who find their way to each other by facing their worst fears and embracing a new purpose in life. Itâ€™s a story of hope, forgiveness, atonement and a once-in-a-lifetime kind of loveâ€”pure, selfless, compassionateâ€”a love that erases all hurts and fills all voids. I adored this book, as all its wonderful predecessors, and remain in awe of the thoughtfulness it takes to write a story such as this.â€œThe fury raging in my blood was more than I could contain.â€Ethan Moonsong is an angry young man, drowning in a sea of uncontrollable rage and resentment because he is incapable of voicing his pain. Unable to cope with the loss of his fiancÃ© to another man, and still clinging to a romanticised idea of what that relationship meant to him, he has channelled all his anger into a misguided need for revenge, with each passing day losing more and more of himself to the fury that boils inside him. Until an auburn-haired spitfire re-enters his life and shows him all that heâ€™s been too blind to see.â€œDonâ€™t you want forever with someone who burns for you the way you burn for her? You deserve that just as much as she does.â€Finley Dyer has never let her painful past define her, bravely shouldering the weight of her memories and making the most of each day in her life with a bright smile on her face and a spring in her step. Straightforward, confident, and full of life, she comes across as fearless and uninhibited, but deep inside this young woman hides a suppressed anger even more destructive than Ethanâ€™s, an anger that makes her feel lonely, unloved, an anger that she has learned to control, but is yet to fully rid herself of.â€œSo you got your heart broken. So what! There are worse things, you know. There are things out there that would curl your toes to know about, Ethan.â€Finleyâ€™s past takes them far away from the safety of their small home town in Montana, to a place where their most basic instincts come to life, in search of retribution, justice, hope, and a little peace for Finleyâ€™s broken soul. But igniting Ethanâ€™s inherent protective streak and thus unleashing the fury brewing inside him proves to be both a blessing and a curse, each day his conscience growing heavier, and the marks on his soul etching themselves deeper and deeper as he tiptoes the fine line between right and wrong. Each day he fights to erase Finleyâ€™s scars, to make himself worthy of her love, but in a world where justice is always a step beyond their grasp, his every action only puts the young loversâ€™ future in jeopardy even before it started.â€œSheâ€™d become more important to me than myself.â€An extraordinary tale that I cannot even begin to analyse without giving too much away and depriving you of some crucial twists and turns in the storylineâ€”this is a book I awaited for so long and it did not disappoint in the least. Ethan and Finley are two characters that I understood, empathised with, became invested in. I loved the subtle manner in which their romance was presented to the reader, almost platonically, where all focus remained on the nature of their connection and little or no importance was given to the more intimate aspects of their relationship. I understood the reasons for such an omission, even though I would have wholeheartedly welcomed that facet of their romance too. A beautiful friends to lovers story, a great addition to the series, an unforgettable journey.â€œI love you. I love you because I can, because itâ€™s my right to. I love you because I want to. I love you because it was my choice. You are my choice, Ethan.â€[4.5 STARS]","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM95Y2CNJFQII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X4ERKSO#wasThisHelpful","RM95Y2CNJFQII","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

DorkGrayG: Thatâ€™s Cupcake to you, Special Sauce.I am officially a New Adult genre addictâ€¦again. And it comes as no surprise given the phenomenal writing style that makes this authorâ€™s books so impossible to put down, placing them into a category all of their own, somewhere between â€˜when-I-grow-up-I-want-to-write-like-thisâ€™ and â€˜how-many-times-can-I-reread-a-book-before-it-becomes-unhealthyâ€™. After The Hook Up, I didnâ€™t really think I could enjoy a college romance more than Drew and Annaâ€™s captivating love story, but I was wrong. Gray and Ivy are two characters that we fall in love with on the very first page, their playful banter making us grin like lunatics, and as their story progresses, their every facet makes us love them more and more. This is the type of read I will always be in the mood for and cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone seeking a feel-good, confidently written, sweet but achingly sexy friends-to-lovers tale that makes you want to read it in a single sitting.â€œI just like her. I really like her. Sheâ€™s the first person I want to talk to. Every day.â€They might have bonded over a bubblegum-pink Fiat 500 and the shenanigans that may and may not take place inside this powder-puff car, but it was clear from the very beginning that Gray Grayson and Ivy Mackenzie would become best friends. Their friendship started before they ever even met, their endless text messaging and ability to open up to one another unreservedly thus weaving a rare thread of affection and trust between them that had been missing from both of their lives. So, when they finally meet, the awkwardness their expected to encounter between them immediately dissipates, leaving in its wake a heart-warming feeling akin to coming back home.â€œIâ€™ve just officially met Ivy Mackenzie, and I realize Iâ€™ve missed her for what seems like years.â€But being best friends with the only person in your life who has ever made you wish of things you never thought you would want, proves to be a constant challenge for both of them. The world might see him as a popular jock, the larger-than-life star player on a championship-winning football team, but there are so many sides to Gray Grayson that no one but those closest to him ever get to see. Highly intelligent and innately talented in much more than just playing football, Gray is determined to live life to the fullest by pursuing a career in a sport he truly loves, his motto of working hard and playing hard allowing him to always live in the moment and never needing to look forward to anything in his lifeâ€¦until Ivy.â€œAm I really living for the moment? Or am I running away from reality?â€Ivy grew up surrounded by sports legends, her lack of â€˜fan-girlingâ€™ tendencies making her a rare sort of female in Grayâ€™s life. Her no-nonsense attitude and ability to see through his macho act make her the first girl to see the real Gray. Her hidden vulnerability awakens the natural protector and carer in him, his need to look after her as strong as his aching desire to be taken care of by her. Their unique bond grows exponentially each day, their easy communication making them utterly addicted to one another and to each otherâ€™s opinions, but when that addiction starts blurring the lines of friendship they so carefully drew between them, it becomes apparent that those self-imposed boundaries might have been nothing more than â€˜lines in the sandâ€™ they were destined to cross from the very beginning.â€œâ€¦all I wanted to do was kiss her, explore the gentle curve of her lower lip before sucking on it. And Ivy would have flipped out. Because friends do not maul other friendâ€™s mouths.â€I am a sucker for friends-to-lovers romances, and this one might just be one of my all-time favourites now because I loved these characters as friends even before I wished for them to become more. No aspect of their friendship is sacrificed in order to feed the romance storyline, and it is that loving, selfless, honest connection between them that won me over in the first place. The way their friendship is put first, before everything else, and the way they fight to safeguard it, often even against themselves, was a fresh and truly touching angle that I didnâ€™t see coming. When their friendship is finally allowed to evolve into a love affair, my heart was already bursting at the seams, and it is through heart-shaped lenses that we then â€˜liveâ€™ their romance, regardless of how steamy and utterly mouth-watering it gets.The faultless character development and the quirky dialogues are what sets this book, as well as its prequel, apart from many books of this type. The greedy reader in me would have wished even more insight into Grayâ€™s problematic family background and the way those relationships then changed, but we were given enough knowledge of those events in order to form a realistic and credible picture of that facet of his personality, and anything more would have just been icing on the cake. I cannot believe I am saying this, but I loved this book even more than The Hook Up, which I adored, and that is all you need to know.â€œYouâ€™ve owned me from â€˜Shenanigans,â€™ Ivy Mac.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6TJL7H8F7FB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTQDFDM#wasThisHelpful","R6TJL7H8F7FB","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So, when they finally meet, the awkwardness their expected to encounter between them immediately dissipates, leaving in its wake a heart-warming feeling akin to coming back home.â€œIâ€™ve just officially met Ivy Mackenzie, and I realize Iâ€™ve missed her for what seems like years.â€But being best friends with the only person in your life who has ever made you wish of things you never thought you would want, proves to be a constant challenge for both of them. The world might see him as a popular jock, the larger-than-life star player on a championship-winning football team, but there are so many sides to Gray Grayson that no one but those closest to him ever get to see. Highly intelligent and innately talented in much more than just playing football, Gray is determined to live life to the fullest by pursuing a career in a sport he truly loves, his motto of working hard and playing hard allowing him to always live in the moment and never needing to look forward to anything in his lifeâ€¦until Ivy.â€œAm I really living for the moment? Or am I running away from reality?â€Ivy grew up surrounded by sports legends, her lack of â€˜fan-girlingâ€™ tendencies making her a rare sort of female in Grayâ€™s life. Her no-nonsense attitude and ability to see through his macho act make her the first girl to see the real Gray. Her hidden vulnerability awakens the natural protector and carer in him, his need to look after her as strong as his aching desire to be taken care of by her. Their unique bond grows exponentially each day, their easy communication making them utterly addicted to one another and to each otherâ€™s opinions, but when that addiction starts blurring the lines of friendship they so carefully drew between them, it becomes apparent that those self-imposed boundaries might have been nothing more than â€˜lines in the sandâ€™ they were destined to cross from the very beginning.â€œâ€¦all I wanted to do was kiss her, explore the gentle curve of her lower lip before sucking on it. And Ivy would have flipped out. Because friends do not maul other friendâ€™s mouths.â€I am a sucker for friends-to-lovers romances, and this one might just be one of my all-time favourites now because I loved these characters as friends even before I wished for them to become more. No aspect of their friendship is sacrificed in order to feed the romance storyline, and it is that loving, selfless, honest connection between them that won me over in the first place. The way their friendship is put first, before everything else, and the way they fight to safeguard it, often even against themselves, was a fresh and truly touching angle that I didnâ€™t see coming. When their friendship is finally allowed to evolve into a love affair, my heart was already bursting at the seams, and it is through heart-shaped lenses that we then â€˜liveâ€™ their romance, regardless of how steamy and utterly mouth-watering it gets.The faultless character development and the quirky dialogues are what sets this book, as well as its prequel, apart from many books of this type. The greedy reader in me would have wished even more insight into Grayâ€™s problematic family background and the way those relationships then changed, but we were given enough knowledge of those events in order to form a realistic and credible picture of that facet of his personality, and anything more would have just been icing on the cake. I cannot believe I am saying this, but I loved this book even more than The Hook Up, which I adored, and that is all you need to know.â€œYouâ€™ve owned me from â€˜Shenanigans,â€™ Ivy Mac.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NM1OGQHFB1PU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTQDFDM#wasThisHelpful","R1NM1OGQHFB1PU","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œAre you trying to buy your way into my good graces?â€â€œYup. And excellent pun, by the way.â€â€œI wasnâ€™t punning. My name just happens to be a homonym.â€â€œI love it when you talk homonyms to me.â€There are books you read in a week, there are books that you might even finish over a couple of days, and then there are those addictive little gems that you inhale all at once, reading non-stop, often in the wee hours of the morning, showing complete disregard for your real life responsibilities, and loving every blissful moment of it. Flawlessly writtenâ€”as Iâ€™ve now come to expect from this terrific author after the pleasant surprise that was The Dealâ€”this is a story that had me grinning cover to cover, and while it had the perfect combination of engaging plotline and fulfilling character development, this was first and foremost a fun, heart-warming read. One I will definitely want to re-read very soon, whenever the fussy reader in me starts aching for a book to make me smile.â€œHeâ€™s John f***ing Logan, one of the most popular guys at Briar. And Iâ€™m Grace f***ing Ivers, one of thousands of girls who are crushing on him.â€Grace Ivers is a good girlâ€”cautious, responsible, always in control, a freshman in collegeâ€¦and a virgin. She is the girl no one notices because she does nothing to attract attention, even though she would give anything to be seen by her one and only college crush, the star defenseman of the hockey team. But good girls like Grace are not even on John Loganâ€™s radar these days, his relentless pursuit of â€˜easy laysâ€™ whose name he is not even expected to know being the only kind of â€˜relationshipâ€™ he appears to be interested in. Secretly, however, Logan craves the kind of intimacy and emotional bond his best friend and teammate, Garrett Graham, has found in his life, to the point of convincing himself of being in love with his best friendâ€™s girl.When Logan and Grace accidentally meet, they are both pleasantly surprised by how effortless and enjoyable it is to spend time in each otherâ€™s company, their flickering attraction gaining momentum quickly and irresistibly, and while one kiss is all it takes for it to ignite, one confession is all it takes to destroy their budding relationship. As quickly as it started, it all ends in an instant, leaving them both heartbroken and full of regrets.â€œI was your distraction?â€Not a man to give up easily on what he wants the most in life, Logan then commences his stubborn and utterly entertaining pursuit of the woman who has captured his heart like no other before her, determined to make her forgive him and give them one more chance. He woos her unashamedly, becoming his teammatesâ€™ running joke, but Logan is a man on a mission and he refuses to give up until the one who has stolen his heart is his once again.â€œGive me another chance. Let me prove to you that Iâ€™m not an egocentric a**.â€There are so many fabulous layers to this story, all working perfectly together to deliver an engaging, uplifting, unputdownable tale of opposites attracting, of two people being exactly what the other needs, in good times and in bad, and never giving up on each other. Ms Kennedy has given us two characters who steal our hearts from the get-goâ€”a popular jock, reformed womaniser whose loyalty and selflessness make him impossible not to adore, and a strong, independent, kind-hearted heroine who loves fiercely, but respects herself the same way. The hilarious banter, the heart-warming romance, the skin-tingling sex scenes, the colourful array of secondary charactersâ€”this book excelled in every aspect, keeping me enthralled for hours, and it again left me craving for more from the irresistible Briar boys and their kickass leading ladies.â€œI donâ€™t want anyone else.

"â€œItâ€™s just me, Boyce. You donâ€™t have to do anything to impress me.â€â€œBecause you already think Iâ€™m awesome, or because you never will?â€â€œYou saved my life. Iâ€™ve been impressed with you since I was five years old.â€I feel like my heart is glowing like a Christmas tree from the sheer exquisiteness of this beautiful, oh-so romantic and yet very tantalizing story, a story that sneaks up on you unhurriedly, pulling you in deeper and deeper, as you lose yourself in a swirl of emotions and truly superb prose. A tale of second chances, of finding the courage to give oneâ€™s heart what it desires the most, this is a love story that spans over fifteen years, showing that even some of our most painful memories can become our most treasured ones. This book left me beaming, bursting at the seams with child-like delight, knowing Iâ€™d found a story I would never ever want to forget.â€œWhen are you going to stop being afraid to love your life, Pearl?â€Pearl and Boyceâ€™s lives have been gently intertwined since they were children, when a seven-year-old boy saved a little girl from drowning. But growing up in two very different families, from opposite sides of town, meant that their everyday lives had very little in common, their unlikely friendship born over the years as a secret they both guarded fiercely, rather than nurtured openly. As their story is given to us in snippetsâ€”their past and present intermingling continuously to slowly but purposefully paint the picture of their shared history before their future can truly be understoodâ€”we unravel their past through both their eyes, both their hearts.â€œBoyce Wynnâ€”my guardian angel, the imaginary best friend of my childhood, my unprofessed adolescent crush, my dirty little secret.â€We watch a young girl from a privileged upbringing fall desperately in love for the bad boy at school, because while everyone else only ever sees her faÃ§ade, he sees the person she hides from the world. He understands her like no one else ever has, his bluntly honest and often cantankerous attitude spurring her to open up to him and express all her doubts, fears, and wildest dreams. He makes her feel safe to be herself, to take chances in life, and to follow her heart, their secret friendship evolving over the years into a young romance that never quite takes flight, never gets a chance to blossom. And eventually, Pearlâ€™s education takes her far away from Boyce, leaving them both full of regrets over the many missed opportunities they had.â€œIn four years, nothing had erased or even dimmed my memories of Boyce. His kiss. His touch. The disorienting intensity of his gaze.â€When Pearl returns to her home town after college to pursue a childhood dream, thus giving up the one she was always expected to blindly follow, she finds herself seeking the help of the only man who has always only protected herâ€”Boyce. As their lives become once again entwined, this time more than ever before and in ways they never even dreamed possible, every new step forward in their budding relationship stems out of a shared memory from the past. They remember it all, every kiss, every stolen smile, every moment spent in each otherâ€™s arms, as they gather the courage to finally open up their hearts to one another and confess what theyâ€™ve been hiding for so long.â€œIâ€™m gonna kiss you. Unless you tell me not to good and loud right now. Iâ€™m gonna kiss you, and Iâ€™m not gonna be sorry.â€But old insecurities and fears lurking behind them never stop making them question everything they mean to one another, everything theyâ€™ve always meant to one another, forcing them to fight, for once, for their place in the otherâ€™s life.â€œIâ€™d rather her be happy the rest of her life without me than be the thing that made her sad.â€Ms Webber is a very unique storyteller, her narrative structured in a way that not only felt new and different to me, but also utterly gripping. Through frequent flashbacks of sorts, generously dispersed all throughout the storyline, she marries her charactersâ€™ past with their future, each sliver of their shared story fitting perfectly together to form a heart-warming picture like no other. She gives us both their voices, a window into both their hearts and minds, and she makes us love them both, equally, unequivocally, leaving no gaps in their emotional growth and character development in general. I cannot believe that this is my first novel by this extraordinary author, a real shame I waited so long to experience her astonishing writing style, but it will not be my last.â€œI was a man whoâ€™d loved this girl from the moment sheâ€™d come back to life and saw no one but me.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRE5YVYFNGO23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6G47SA#wasThisHelpful","RRE5YVYFNGO23","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œWould it have been better if I had never left? Would you still love me if I kept living a lie?â€Ah, the sweet sorrow of seeing one of your most beloved series come to an end! I have to admit, I was a late comer to the Fall Away â€˜partyâ€™, having discovered this phenomenal group of characters only very recently, but from the moment I dove into their world, I have been utterly bewitched. It all began with Jared and Tateâ€™s tumultuous teenage romance, and in this stunning conclusion to the series, we revisit these characters and watch them fight once again for their happily-ever-after. Itâ€™s the kind of scenario no fan of this series really wanted to ever see happening, but every aspect of this story was just as it should be, true to the characters and their personal journeys, thus cementing my love for this authorâ€™s consistently perfecting writing style and her uplifting brand of storytelling.â€œI love you. I love you so go***mn much. I justâ€¦I just need time, some space, to figure out who I am and what I want.â€At twenty years of age, Tate and Jared have their whole lives ahead of them. They have grown up together, overcome their worse fears while finding their ways to one another, and ultimately discovered the kind of love that defines them, shapes their every decision in life. But somewhere along the way, Jared lost himself. Torn between what he believes is expected of him and what his free-spirited nature calls him to do, he makes the ultimate sacrifice for the sake of the woman he loves more than life itself, hoping that by making the right changes in his future and thus finding himself in the process, heâ€™d give Tate the man she deserves to have at her side.â€œI hate feeling like Iâ€™m a lost puzzle piece. Where the hell did I fit?â€Two years go by, two years of heartbreak on both sides and endless longing, and when they meet again, they are no longer the kids they once were. They are stronger, more confident in themselves, finally certain of what they want out of life, but their love has not changed at all, regardless of all the resentment obstructing their path towards each other. Having channelled all her anger and pain into her passion for racing cars, Tate is no longer the hesitant little girl who once allowed a bully to make her life miserableâ€”she now thrives in situations that used to intimidate her, drive her to tears, and having to now face each day the man who broke her heart and left her behind only draws out even more the tenacious fighter in her.â€œThe players might be the same, Jared, but the game has changed.â€But this is not a story of heartbreak, as heartbreaking as Jared and Tateâ€™s separation is to witness. This is the story of two halves of a whole finding their way to one another, of having enough self-awareness to see where their life was inevitably heading and enough courage to make the necessary changes. There is no pointless angst or superfluous drama aimed at putting these characters through the wringer and back. Every aspect of this story is character-driven, their inner battles just as crucial to the development of the story as their occasional confrontations, and we feel their pain, their uncertainty, their desire, their anger, their hope, and their determination. We feel it all and our hearts rejoice in every little dagger that is aimed their way, every heart-clench, every moment of skin-tingling emotion that makes this story so addictive and impossible to put down.â€œI left so I could be a man for you. So I could come back to you.â€This story, quite simply, makes sense. It adds a wonderful new layer to a tale that, in hindsight, would have felt incomplete without it, showing us that sometimes one needs to lose their beacon in order to learn to navigate through life as a complete person, without crutches or lifelines, and that no amount of time or distance can erase true love. While in their first book we heard only Tateâ€™s voice, and in the second one only Jaredâ€™s, in this book, we hear both, never losing our connection to both these characters and the insight into the emotions driving their every action. Everything about them is different this time aroundâ€”their maturity levels, their levelheadedness, their willingness to fight for one anotherâ€”making this chapter in their beautiful story only even more compelling and appreciated.â€œIâ€™m a better man, but thereâ€™s never been a better woman for me. Thereâ€™s never been anyone like you.â€But this is not only Tate and Jaredâ€™s grand finaleâ€”we get to see again all the other couples as well, as their fates remain forever closely intertwined, leaving us with the goofiest grins on our faces. A spectacular ending, a much needed closure, a series that only kept getting better and better, becoming one of the finest examples of the New Adult genre.â€œEverything else may change, but never the way I love you.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZS270BU8SAES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZ0TO0S#wasThisHelpful","R1ZS270BU8SAES","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œItâ€™s yours, you know.â€â€œWhat is?â€â€œMy heart, of course, but also my body. My hands, my lips, my c**k. I trust you with all of it more than I even trust myself.â€My mind is still reeling because this book was my complete and utter undoing. I am writing this review while literally still hugging my now beloved paperback copy, secretly hoping that the beautiful words in it would somehow escape and infuse themselves into me forever. With one of the most phenomenal writing styles of our generation and flawless, iron-clad character development, this talented writing duo has given us once again an unforgettable, emotionally engaging storyline to become addicted to, this time with two incredibly intricate characters and a perfectly paced, meticulously crafted relationship that is never rushed, never even hurried, and solely driven forward by the charactersâ€™ emotional growth and self-awareness. I gobbled up every word, immersing myself into a story that had my attention from the get-go, and I fear I will never be able to fully express how much I truly adored this book.â€œIâ€™d been wrestling with my Niall Stella crush for six months, and I was pretty sure he still didnâ€™t know that I was an employee at the firm rather than a regular takeout delivery girl.â€Ruby Miller is a twenty-three-year-old American intern at one of the largest and most successful engineering firms in Europe, now living in London. Attractive, smart, wittyâ€”Rubyâ€™s open and honest personality shines through her every action, but is regularly stilted by her ongoing and downright distracting infatuation with her office crushâ€”the very handsome but unreachable, Niall Stella. Fully aware that the object of her affections might not even be aware of her existence, she is happy to appreciate him from afar, relishing every moment spent in his presence, every stolen glimpse of the man who feeds her most intimate fantasies, but still secretly hoping that one day heâ€™d notice her.â€œWhat was it you said about repressed sexual energy?â€â€œEnough to power the whole bloody city, if you ask me. Thatâ€™s where his real urban planning skill would come inâ€”hooking himself up to the grid .â€Niall Stella is distinguished, reserved, his every step measured and poised, but behind that firm façade lies a man who is stuck in a rut of self-imposed boundaries and expectations, a man who struggles daily with regret and self-deprecation, his failed marriage having left a deep emotional scar that makes him question whether he could ever make a woman truly happy. His old-fashioned view on relationships and love in general is shaken from the moment Ruby enters his life, her vivacious and unrestrained personality, coupled with the kind of openness and honesty that is foreign to him, drawing him out of his shell and forcing him to push his own limits.â€œDo you think Iâ€™m weird?â€â€œYes, weird in the sense that you are unexpected and I am rarely surprised by people. I think you rather exquisite.â€When they find themselves together on a month-long business trip to New York City working alongside each other every single day, they quickly discover that their greatest difference lies in the way they perceive relationships and the way they each process the growing emotions they feel for one another. An extrovert by nature, Rubyâ€™s honest and communicative disposition shake the very foundations of Niallâ€™s introverted, quiet reserve, making him feel adventurous, interesting, fun for onceâ€”sides of himself he never got to see during his decade-long marriage to a woman he barely knew. Everything he feels for Ruby is new to him, part of the uncharted territory of his inexpressive personality, thus forcing them to commence a carefully paced, open and honest exploration of what a sexual relationship between two such opposites might entail. And what it would take to overcome all the emotional hurdles standing in their way.â€œIf I wanted to make love to her tonight, I could. If I wanted to feel myself deep in her throat, I could. If I wanted limits, I would need to be the one to set them. But did I truly want limits, or did I think I should want them?â€What starts as a sexy, rather flirty storyline, quickly morphs into an even sexier but deeply emotional romance that is truly remarkable in its approach to the way these characters learn to discover one another, and themselves in the process. We hear both their voices throughout the story, that precious insight into both of these characters making us appreciate their deepest fears and hang-ups a lot more intimately.I laughed, I cried, I felt my body burn from the sheer sexiness of too many scenes in this book to count, never knowing a guy merely touching a womanâ€™s calf could make me literally combust in my own skin like that. And I felt every single emotion these extraordinary authors had expertly woven into this story. Their signature climax in the end carries that sweet punch of angst that weâ€™ve become helplessly addicted to, perhaps even pricklier this time around as it left me a sobbing mess in its wake, only standing to show that there is no emotion these authors are unable to stir in their readers. A beautiful read, an astonishing love story, a couple whose journey I understood and felt from beginning to endâ€”this is a book I would recommend with all my heart.â€œAnd what if after the rush of conquest wears off, youâ€™ll realize that Iâ€™m not what youâ€™ve built me up to be?â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWWBRA9M993UC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHA1HHW#wasThisHelpful","RWWBRA9M993UC","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œIâ€™m not interested in a relationship, but I am interested in you.â€Justâ€¦ WOW. Talk about total sensory overload! One of the hottest stories Iâ€™ve read in a while, with possibly some of the best written sex scenes I have ever come across, this is a book I devoured in every possible way. And loved every delicious moment of it. Steamy, romantic, exhilaratingâ€”every twist and turn in this mouthwatering story was delivered just right, penned to perfection, and kept me hypnotized cover to cover. One of my most exciting reads of late, this is exactly the kind of erotic romance I tend to completely lose my mind over because apart from a fresh and interesting storyline, the sex scenes in it never bored me, they never stopped stretching my comfort zone, and I never stopped clinging onto every single word in them. Sometimes repeatedly.â€œI was about to become a whore.â€Evelyn Russell loves her job. As a talented young designer at a prominent design agency, she is hungry for success and willing to give her all to achieve it. But when one simple mistake puts all her hard work into jeopardy, Evelyn is forced to sell her body, for one night only, at an exclusive BDSM club, where clients pay thousands of dollars for sex. The only catch is that she is to be blindfolded and bound during the act, as per clubâ€™s policy. Apprehensive but desperate, Evelyn is determined to go through with it, even secretly a little aroused by the idea of surrendering all her inhibitions to a man in such a wayâ€¦but nothing prepares her for that man to be the one who pushed her into that predicament in the first place.â€œSomeoneâ€™s requested a hold be put on you. Heâ€™s not a member of the club, and only members have that privilege.â€Evelynâ€™s â€˜buyerâ€™â€”whom I wonâ€™t name so that you are not deprived of the thrill from discovering his identity on your own and at the right momentâ€”is a man accustomed to getting his own way in his professional life, but craving that level of control in his personal life too. Evelyn is everything he hopes to find in a woman, the allure of her courage, willpower and confidence being his ultimate siren call, but he finds himself overwhelmed, both physically as well as emotionally, by the lustful vixen blindfolded before him and the ecstasy he finds in her arms as they consummate their one-night only arrangement.â€œSo, yeah . . . That was the best orgasm of my life.â€And so he takes off her blindfold and what follows is a oh-so sexy exploration of sexual tastes and fantasies, with only three simple rules guiding them through it, designed to challenge and explore the very essence of their self-control. As their relationship takes flight, what they eventually find in one another is exactly what they never even dreamed of needingâ€”a person they would be unable to live without, in and out of the bedroom.â€œYou donâ€™t get to ask questions, no matter whatâ€¦ Rule two is you answer my questions, and you have to answer them honestlyâ€¦ The last rule is your body belongs to me, so that means your orgasms are mine. You donâ€™t come without my permission.â€I rarely enjoy such a relatively low level of angst and drama present in a story, but this story was truly an exception. It was exactly as I needed it to be for the sexual connection between the characters to take centre stage and thus become a crucial component of the evolution of their relationship, without sacrificing the emotional aspect of it all. These characters discover themselves through their sexual connection, and as sizzling as those scenes are between them, there is no doubt in my mind that this is first and foremost a romance, a love story between two people who found their perfect match in each other, and who are willing to put in the work for their relationship to survive.I loved this book, unexpectedly so, and cannot praise it highly enough for the way it so seamlessly â€˜marriedâ€™ titillating erotica with heart-warming romance, all wrapped up into a flawlessly written, impressive little gem.

"â€œNo matter what, I will always find my way back to you.â€The hardest thing to do when you find a book you end up loving body and soul is not to turn your review into an ode to the author and all the ways her words have moved you, thrilled you, inspired you, but I fear that I will fail miserably by the end of this review because this book took my breath away, and made me fall in love all over again with Tara Sivecâ€™s spellbinding writing style. Heartfelt, gut-wrenching, romanticâ€”this is a story that enthrals you completely, shutting out the world around you and overwhelming you emotionally until you cannot think of anything else. An epic love story like no other, Lucy and Fisherâ€™s tale will forever hold a very special place in my heart, and it still brings tears to my eyes every time I think about it.â€œMy life has been spent waiting for this man to come back to me.â€Lucy and Fisher are high school sweethearts, each otherâ€™s first loves, each otherâ€™s only loves, but after Fisherâ€™s five tours of duty over a fourteen-year span, the bulk of their marriage has effectively been spent living apart. Every single deployment has left Fisher just a little more broken each time, the horror of his memories continuously tormenting him and stripping him of his ever-waning grasp on reality. Until his terrifying fantasies start bleeding into his everyday consciousness, completely blurring the line between his past and present, thus putting in danger his very reason for livingâ€”his beloved wife.â€œShe is my heart, my soul, my everything and I know itâ€™s only a matter of time before I do something that could possibly kill her.â€Lucy has spent her entire adult life as a military wife waiting for her husband to come back to her after his many deployments, making sure he had a loving place to come home to. In her early thirties, the owner of her own business, she has always worked hard to stay independent from her husbandâ€™s family legacy and wealth, the only thing she ever wanted out of life being her husbandâ€™s safe return and his love and devotion. But war has slowly changed the man she has loved since she was sixteen years old, chipping away at his sanity and the man who eventually returns after his last tour of duty is not the man she once knew.â€œIâ€™ve never felt so alone, even when he was halfway across the world. Iâ€™m living in this house with my husband and I get to see him every day, but it feels like Iâ€™m living with a ghost.â€As their past is revealed to us in snippets, their present and their past interlaced with one another and told simultaneously, we see their marriage as it came to be, we watch it survive distance and separation, and eventually succumb to the effects of the many traumatic events Fisher has lived and survived through, not to mention how little they know of one another by the end of it. With astonishing insight into the darkness of his mind and his struggle to keep it rooted in reality, we get to hear not only Fisherâ€™s voice as he tries and fails to break free of the prison in his mind, but also the magnitude of Lucyâ€™s heartbreak from the demise of her marriage and the gradual loss of her one and only love.â€œI want to take away his pain, to stop the hurt that fills his heart and his mind, but I feel like Iâ€™m so far out of my depth that Iâ€™m drowning.â€And eventually, we see them lose it all. But this is not a story of lost loveâ€”this is a story of two people who have fought hard to stay together, to expel the demons tearing them apart, and who are forced to fight even harder to find their way back to one another. This is a story of second chances, of remembering the good and the bad that brought two people to a particular point in their relationship, and of never forgetting the great, once-in-a-lifetime kind of love that never allowed their bond to be truly broken.â€œHow many people get a second chance at love with the only person theyâ€™ve ever held in their heart?â€With impeccable, emotionally inspiring prose, Ms Sivec caught me by surprise with this novel, her once witty and entertaining voice now replaced by a more mature, confident writing style that made me regretful of having missed all the undoubtedly brilliant steps in the evolution of her craft. Even though this story is told in constant and often disjointed leaps from past to present, we are never distracted or confused by those leaps, as their tale becomes a puzzle that forms effortlessly in our minds, each new fragment of their past adding new layers to our perception of their present. By giving us a window into the psyche of both these characters, we grow attached to both of them in equal measure, our hearts breaking at their lows, and rejoicing at their highs. We get to feel the powerful love between them, and all they are willing to give of themselves in order to never let their bond wither away. This was one of the most intense, heart-wrenching stories I have ever read, as well as one of the most exquisite ones, and I wish there were a way to read it for the first time all over again.â€œIâ€™m going to remind her why weâ€™re perfect for each other. Iâ€™m going to show her that thereâ€™s no one else on this earth that can love her like I can.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTRKYPSFPIYOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3OL4G6#wasThisHelpful","RTRKYPSFPIYOW","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œMs. Baird, have I or have I not made it clear that I would like you in my bed?â€When you put together a former pro rugby player turned CEO, a timid but mouthy assistant, and enough all-consuming sexual tension to burn up the pages, you get quite a delicious little package already. But add to that some rather phenomenal writing and flawless character development and you are in for a real treat. A sweet, slow-paced, very sexy romance between two people who are drawn to one another from the moment they meet, this story is not as straight-forward or as predictable as it might seem. Gently and sensitively interwoven with some heavier, much more intense emotional undertones than I ever expected to find in a story of this kind, this was a book I found to be absolutely impossible to put down. I adored the characters, I loved their unique connection, the snarky humour that colours their every exchange, and I was utterly charmed by the way their relationship slowly but surely takes hold, never rushed, never forced, thoughtfully and realistically mapped out from the start. A book I will most definitely re-read many a time, I urge you to meet and fall in love with Charlie-mouse and T-Rex.â€œA petite but tempting morsel. Too bad she was terrified at the sight of him.â€Charlotte Baird is the girl no one notices in the office. Petite, unassuming, cloaked by figure-drowning clothes that are designed to make her feel invisible, she is self-conscious and unobtrusive, but behind the timid little mouse hides an intelligent and witty young woman, capable of much more than people give her credit for. Her traumatic dating past, however, has made it so that she now deliberately avoids attention of any kind, her bashfulness and fear of men being something she cannot control or escape from, both in her personal as well as her professional life. Her quiet existence is thrown off balance by the arrival of her new boss, a man hired to salvage the struggling company Charlotte works for, but one look at him and there is no doubt in her mind that he is the most compelling man sheâ€™s ever met. And the most intimidating one too.â€œGabriel Bishop was a gorgeous manâ€¦ Too big and muscled and dangerous, but gorgeous. Like a tiger was gorgeous. Right before it ate you.â€Gabriel Bishopâ€™s reputation precedes him wherever he goes. An ex-rugby star turned ruthless businessman, he is smart, driven, confident and successful in all his endeavours, but very few people in his life truly know the man behind the muscles and the tailored business suits. What comes across as arrogance and callous drive is a need to never again feel like that little boy whose whole life changed the day his father abandoned his family and left them fending for themselves. From the moment shy little Charlotte steps in front of him, he cannot get her out of his mind, the hidden fire in her eyes stirring something in him, a hunger heâ€™s never known before, but it is her occasional smart mouth that intrigues him the most. So he makes her his new PA, forcing her to work daily alongside a man she is terrified of as well as viscerally attracted to, both being a constant challenge for Charlotte, especially since her new boss is also determined to get her in his bed. And has no qualms about expressing it. Unequivocally.â€œIf you tell me you donâ€™t want me, Iâ€™m going to demand you give me your panties to prove theyâ€™re not damp.â€In a sexy game of â€œT-Rex and mouseâ€, we watch their relationship change over time, cross boundaries and evolve into what they both desperately want. But Charlotteâ€™s hang-ups are a real obstacle to any intimacy between them, forcing Gabriel to handle her with patience and care, teasing, tempting and charming her out of her shell, thus allowing her to bloom under his loving touch at her own pace.â€œThe seeds of terror were hidden within her, could burst open at any time.â€I am still stunned by how much I not only enjoyed this story, but also felt emotionally invested in every aspect of it. There is a delightful streak of light-hearted humour tied in with the intense emotions driving this story forward, and it is this perfectly balanced contrast that hooked me in and kept me enthralled until the end. The characters are well-rounded and fascinating, and their very differences are what makes their connection so magical and touching at times. A mighty â€œT-Rexâ€, larger than life and deceptively rough around the edges, falling for a gentle little â€œmouseâ€ and treating her with such loving care and sensitivity that it wards her demons away and makes her whole againâ€”this is a story that will warm your heart and make it race all at the same time, every part of this story done just right, and every eloquent word penned by this gifted author making you want to read everything else sheâ€™s ever written.â€œWhen you look at me like that, I want to do everything you ask me.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14HMR0KT44PVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6BPLQM#wasThisHelpful","R14HMR0KT44PVM","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œI didnâ€™t believe life was worth living â€˜til I met you.â€I donâ€™t know why I am even surprised anymore when I fall in love with another novel by this extraordinary author because it happens every single time, and I always end up walking away a total wreck, unable to pick up another book for days to come. An unexpected but truly phenomenal reading treat, this was a story I loved with all my heart, and even now, days after I first finished it, I am drawn to it again, aching for the characters, for more of their life journey, for more of that unique, exquisitely poignant feel a Jane Harvey-Berrick novel possesses beginning to end. This is a book I want to urge everyone to read, to drop everything and not wait another minute, because beautiful, inspiring stories like these are rare finds these days, and it baffles me why they are not on everyoneâ€™s lips when they truly deserve to be.â€œWhat would it do to a person, living day in and day out surrounded by nothing but memories and hatred?â€Torrey Delaney does not believe in love. Her parentsâ€™ broken marriage and her motherâ€™s subsequent abandonment when she was just a young girl have taught her that relationships are undependable, that hearts are expendable and that the only person she will always be able to rely on is herself. But while such a life mantra has protected her so far from heartbreak and disappointment, it has also caused her to act recklessly when picking her casual hook-ups, her latest affair finally driving her to leave her old life behind and to start afresh somewhere else. With limited resources at her disposal, however, Torrey is forced to make a small town on the gulf coast of Texas her temporary new homeâ€”the very town in which her estranged mother happens to be the local preacher. Perceived by everyone as the preacherâ€™s trashy daughter, she does nothing to dissuade others of that opinion of her because it gives her the freedom to behave as she choosesâ€¦until she crosses paths with a young man who cannot escape what the whole town thinks of him as his every move is judged and condemned.â€œI wouldnâ€™t want a guy like me spending time with my daughter either.â€Jordan Kane has spent the last eight years of his young life serving a prison sentence for one careless act that cost him the life of his beloved older brotherâ€”the townâ€™s golden boy. Now treated as the local pariah by everyone he once knew, Jordan is met with disdain and disgust everywhere he goes, but no one hates him as much as he hates himself for getting to live the life his brother never got to live. Alone and broken in a town that wishes he were dead, he struggles daily with the burden of his memories and his newly found freedom, clueless as to how to assimilate into a world that keeps rejecting him at every turn. Until an outspoken firecracker breaks through his defences and teaches him how to live again.â€œIn prison Iâ€™d kept to myself; out here, I didnâ€™t know what the boundaries were anymore. It was a game of life where I didnâ€™t know the rules and couldnâ€™t work them outâ€” and I was losing. Big time.â€A friendship born out of loneliness and curiosity soon becomes a powerful bond that neither of them can deny, or live without. But while Torrey struggles to recognise her feelings for the sad, broken man she is slowly falling for, for Jordan she represents everything he never dared to hope he would find in life, and everything he believes he will forever remain unworthy of. Torrey eases his despair, her no-nonsense attitude forcing him out of his self-imposed purgatory, and the more time they spend together, the more he no longer feels all alone in the world.â€œIf I could, Iâ€™d take you somewhere real upscale. Thereâ€™d be a starched white cloth on the table, napkins folded into fancy shapes, and candles all around us. Iâ€™d order champagne and the best food on the menu. Weâ€™d eat and laugh and talk, and Iâ€™d take you dancinâ€™ till dawn. Then Iâ€™d lay you down on soft sheets and love you till the sun was high in the sky.â€Living in a small town determined to never forget or let him forget his sins, however, remains a constant test for their budding romance, and while our hearts melt with delight as we watch them fall irrevocably and passionately in love with one another, they also break every time their love is met with hostility and intolerance. A story of forgiveness, of second chances, and of letting go of anger and self-hatred in order to be truly free to embrace all that life has to offerâ€”a story like this is simply my favourite kind of reading escape. Confidently and eloquently written, addictive cover to cover, every emotional word of this oh-so wonderful tale stole my breath away and even though it was my undoing on more than one occasion, it left me with the goofiest grin on my face. I cannot recommend it highly enough.â€œâ€¦the only thing Iâ€™d miss if I went back now would be you.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35COEWB3GBYZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3E9WGY#wasThisHelpful","R35COEWB3GBYZS","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œAll my life, I was the girl who everyone thought had everything or could get it. But the only thing I ever wanted was a man like you.â€To encapsulate all the feelings that a Kristen Ashley novel stirs up in me is always an ambitious feat in itself, her stories being an extraordinary emotional journey beginning to end, and this book did not disappoint. Mickey and Ameliaâ€™s story moved me deeply, just as I expected it would, but the sheer beauty of their romance caught me by surprise. I never expected to relate so completely to two characters representative of this particular point on the age spectrum, and while their sizzling chemistry is truly something to behold, the emotional aspect of their connection, specked with just the right amount of heart-pricking angst, took my breath away on more than one occasion. This is a story about life, about the unexpected journeys that life takes us on, about the curveballs, about the direct hits and the pain they bring, but it is first and foremost a story about second chances at finding happiness, about finding the strength to be whole again and fighting for what matters the most in life. A truly splendid example of this authorâ€™s inimitable style of storytellingâ€”I walked in these charactersâ€™ shoes, I felt all they felt, my heart roared every time they â€˜soaredâ€™, and in the end, I did not want to say goodbye to them.â€œThere is nothing guaranteed in life. But the only leaps worth taking are leaps of faith on love. So look where you leap, beautiful, and happy landing.â€Amelia Hathaway is a woman in her late forties, an heiress, a mother, a scorned wife. The unexpected demise of her marriage made her lose herself in her anger and pain, turning her into the kind of vindictive individual her privileged upbringing taught her she should be, but while reeling in self-pity and fury, Amelia lost herself along the way, the ultimate cost being the affections and respect of her two beloved children. In a desperate attempt to start anew, to beat back the anger and bitterness that poisoned her mind for too long, and to give her children the kind of mother they could not only love again, but also be proud of and learn from, she moves to Magdalene, the small coastal town her ex-husband and their children made their new home.â€œNo matter what it took, no matter how much time, no matter that it made me bleed, no matter what it cost me, no matter that it would take everything I had and force me to find more, I had to do what Iâ€™d come to Maine to do.â€But a new house, new friends, a new purpose in life mean little when oneâ€™s confidence has hit rock bottom, and Ameliaâ€™s wake-up call arrives in the form of a handsome firefighter neighbour, whose striking looks and protective demeanour make her wish heâ€™d see her the way a man sees a woman he wants in his life. But she soon realises that before anyone can see her that way, she needs to like what she sees in the mirror.â€œHe didnâ€™t need me in his life. I didnâ€™t even like me in my life. Alas, I couldnâ€™t escape me.â€Mickey Donovan is a single dad, a natural provider, a man who works two jobs in order to give his kids the life they deserve, even when doing what he loves means living a more modest life than the one he was born into. The slow downfall of his marriage has made him question all he can offer a woman, especially a woman like Amelia Hathaway, knowing he could never give her all that she has been accustomed to having in her life. But Ameliaâ€™s insecurities put a different spin on Mickeyâ€™s reluctant behaviour.â€œHe didnâ€™t want me, plain and simple. I was just hisâ€¦â€˜attractiveâ€™ neighbor.â€When they finally take a leap and give in to their attraction, they inevitably connect on every level, but they donâ€™t rushâ€”they take their time, they show consideration for the people in their lives such a union would affect the most, and they give themselves time to get to know one another. The true beauty of these characters is that they are two formed, adult individuals who know what theyâ€™d gain by taking a chance on such a love, what they risk missing out on if they donâ€™t, and who are now prepared to work their hardest to hold onto the rare magic they found in each other. The slow evolution of their relationship is as it should be, gradual and organic, each emotional milestone sinking deeply into our hearts and making us smile in delight. And there is so much to smile about in this story!â€œâ€¦ there is no safer place than in my arms and when youâ€™re here, Amy, you can give me anything.â€This is the tale of a woman who always had a lot in life, and yet all she ever wanted was a loving family and a man to stand by her and accept her for all that she is. And it is the tale of a hard-working man coming to terms with the fact that some women are not looking for glitz and gold in life, but the simple joy of loving and of being loved by a man who understands them and provides for them in ways no money could ever buy. With so many aspects of this story designed to tug at our heartstrings, this was not a book I was able to read in one sitting, taking my time to fully absorb the magnitude of some particularly emotional scenes in the story. While this might be in essence a love story, this is also a tale of broken families, of healing families, of new families. And it is a story of redemption, showing that we are not defined by the mistakes we make, but by the steps we take to correct them.â€œI am who I am. I have what I have. And one of the things I got that I wanna keep is you.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RRD5A6NONIXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5B70BS#wasThisHelpful","R1RRD5A6NONIXR","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œIâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll never feel this again with anyone else.â€â€œIâ€™m scared you will.â€I have a confession to make. I started reading this book at least half a dozen times over the past two months, and every single time I could not get past its very first scene. I am a glutton for angst, I seek and devour stories that make me feel, that move me one way or another, thus leaving a small but memorable trace of themselves in me long after I finish reading them, but I do not enjoy scenarios that hit too close to home, the finality of which leaves me without any hope left, and where the pain I experience while reading those few pages adversely affects my experience of the entire book. I am a diehard fan of Colleen Hooverâ€™s brand of storytelling, her endless imagination and irrefutable skill at penning little masterpieces of â€˜mass destructionâ€™ always leaving me speechless and in awe, but I simply could not connect with this story as well as I hoped, and even though I enjoyed it in the end, it did not keep me enthralled as her stories normally do because I failed to connect with the characters on too many levels. And yet, given the very subjective nature of my â€˜objectionsâ€™, Iâ€™d recommend this book in a heartbeat as I donâ€™t doubt it for a moment that most readers will love this story with all their hearts.â€œIâ€™m so tired of having to give up the only things in life I want.â€The sum of all its heartbreaking puzzle pieces, this is a story like no other I have ever read. Auburn Reed is a young woman in her early twenties whose past six years of her life have slowly crushed her spirit, leaving her unsure of herself, vulnerable, and stuck to the choices she was forced to make. The helplessness of her situation, however, has not completely extinguished that tenacious spark in her that drives her to believe her future could be brighter one day. And it is her resolve to better her life that brings her to the door of an art studio in downtown Dallas with a â€œhelp wantedâ€ sign in the window.Owen Gentry is an artist, a loner, a young man who drowns his demons in the striking art he creates by drawing inspiration from other peopleâ€™s life stories rather than confronting the reality of his own. But not even the weight of his own self-reproach could ever erase the selflessness of his heart, or his fiercely protective nature. Finding Auburn at his doorstep is something he always hoped for but never dared to believe could happen. We are told their story from two very different perspectives, aware from the very beginning that their perceptions of their fated encounter are nothing alike, but the connection they both feel from the moment they set eyes on one another is the sameâ€”visceral, irrefutable, unfaltering.â€œIâ€™ve never felt stronger than I feel when Iâ€™m with her. Iâ€™ve never felt like I had purpose like I feel when Iâ€™m with her.â€As they dare to explore the attraction between them, we slowly discover what their lives truly entail and why being together is perhaps something they were never meant to have. They selflessly give their hearts to one another, that love palpable in their every stolen touch, every lingering glance, every playful word, but some loves come at too high a price to bear, and Auburn and Owenâ€™s love might have been ill-fated from the very start.â€œIâ€™ll take whatever youâ€™re willing to give me. Because I know that if you walk out that door, then ten years from now . . . twenty years from now . . . weâ€™ll wish we had listened to our hearts when we think back on tonight.â€â€œThatâ€™s what scares me. Iâ€™m afraid if I listen to my heart once, Iâ€™ll never figure out how to ignore it again.â€Colleen Hoover has created another unforgettable story exploring the human condition and, in this case, how much of themselves a person is willing to sacrifice for the ones they love. Her trademark sense of humour, her familiar literary techniques, the very recognisable tone of her characters, are all there to pull us in and leave us incapable of putting this story down, but I found myself unable to connect with Auburn and Owen as well as I needed to in order to become completely invested in their story. I felt we were offered only snippets of their colourful personalities, as well as of some of the secondary characters, but not enough to make me understand them in their entirety. There was an intensity to this story that was missing in my eyes, especially given its themes, many vital aspects that could have made me feel closer to the characters often only hinted at or brushed over too quickly. The confident straightforwardness with which this author always tells her tales did not fit the story, in my opinion, leaving me wishing for more emotion, more passion, more highs and lows that neither of these characters got to express, especially given the helplessness of the situations they both found themselves in.A very touching tale of two people whose lives have been intertwined for longer than they realise and whose hearts are forced to battle what their every instinct tells them to feel, this is a story that will greatly please most readers, and even with my own inability to connect with some aspects of it, I have to admit that I could not put it down. There is a great balance to this story that leaves us filled with hope and bittersweet positivity, showing us that for every act of thievery that life inflicts upon us, there is a gift offered in its stead.â€œShe deserves better. So much better. She deserves me. If only she knew that.â€","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11Y0EMIYSM513/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OHE0#wasThisHelpful","R11Y0EMIYSM513","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œI never expected her. Sometimes people sneak up on you and suddenly you donâ€™t know how you ever lived with them. How you went about your day and hung out with your friends and f****d other people without having this one important person in your life.â€Time and time again, my reading history has proved to me that all I need for a book to make me pay attention is a confident, articulate writing style and multifaceted characters who take shape in my mind, regardless of how distant their reality is from my own. But for a book to truly make me fall in love with its story, there needs to be a certain synergy of all its elements, an undeniable spark flickering between the characters that arouses my interest immediately and makes me unable to step away. And this book had it all. I can honestly say that very few stories end up truly satisfying the picky reader in me to such an extent that I see no faults, but this heartwarming, funny, unexpectedly profound little gem took me by surprise and ended up rocking my world. Deceivingly nothing more than a clichÃ© college scenario at first glanceâ€”a jock falling for the â€˜invisibleâ€™ girlâ€”this is a story of courage, inner strength, of paving oneâ€™s own way in life, and of loveâ€¦unplanned, unequivocal, impassioned love that you feel all the way to your toes. I read this book in one day, sporting a permanent smile on my face because everything about this story made me happy, and at the end, I so desperately wanted to re-read it all over again.â€œYouâ€™re not talking.â€â€œI donâ€™t want to scare you off.â€â€œDude, youâ€™re standing there naked in front of me with your d**k in your hand. If that doesnâ€™t scare me, I doubt anything you say will.â€Hannah Wells is not a popular girl. A college junior and music major, she has spent the last five years of her young life battling the emotional remnants of one single night from her childhood, a night her innocence was stolen from her and her familyâ€™s lives changed forever. And yet, Hannah does not hide from the world or shy away from attention, never letting the past steal her future away from her or prevent her from giving her heart to someone. But when her latest crush happens to be the star wide receiver of the football team, she is clueless as to how to make him notice her. Until another jock makes her an offer she wishes she could refuse.â€œFor the love of God, Iâ€™m not tutoring you.â€â€œSure you are.â€ I shrug. â€œI just need to figure out what you want in return.â€â€œI want to not tutor you. Thatâ€™s what I want.â€Garrett Graham is a star athlete, the captain of the hockey team, a cocky flirt used to women throwing themselves at him and never refusing him anythingâ€¦until he meets Hannah, the only girl on campus who doesnâ€™t go gaga over his every move. Or any of his moves for that matter. Desperate for her help in order to pass a course he is suddenly failing, and thus putting his sporting career in jeopardy, he strikes a deal with her that would benefit them both, but in two very different waysâ€”her tutoring services for his help in getting her crush to finally see her. But the closer they get to his goal, the further they both want to be from hers, their banter and bickering soon replaced by mutual attraction, protectiveness and affection. And then one kiss changes it allâ€¦â€œYes, Hannah and I are friends. In fact, sheâ€™s the only female friend Iâ€™ve ever had. And yes, I want to keep being Hannahâ€™s friend. Butâ€¦I also want to sleep with her.â€It might appear like a typical college romance formula, but nothing about this story felt predictable or overdone. The leading characters, as stereotypical as they might seem within the New Adult framework, are well rounded and dynamic, fresh and unique in every way. The smug and gregarious hockey star hides a world of hurt under his confident faÃ§ade, and the one thing that the sassy, outspoken geek wants the most in her life is to feel safe and whole again, and these unexpected layers to their personalities are what endears them to us. They are opposites, but what attracts them to each other are not those differencesâ€”it is the way they empower one another, and the way their hearts are capable of loving, regardless of their painful pasts. There are so many heartbreaking layers to this story, so many themes to ponder on, but even more reasons to smile and walk away with a spring in our step. If youâ€™re looking for a flawlessly written book with the perfect blend of light-hearted humour, heart-warming romance and a convincing storyline, I cannot recommend this story highly enough. And no matter what you hear, Garrett is mine.â€œLiving well and being happy is how we get over the s*** in our past.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N9D0UZQXG5W9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TG1CZFC#wasThisHelpful","R2N9D0UZQXG5W9","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œYou donâ€™t throw away the love of a lifetime because someone gets injuredâ€”thatâ€™s when you prove what your loveâ€™s really made of.â€Garth Black. This dark, troubled, smart-alecky cowboy stole my heart in Finders Keepers, but I have to admit that getting a continuation of his story was equally thrilling as it was terrifying at first, because every protective bone in my body did not wish any more harm to come to these beloved characters. Garth and Josieâ€™s love story had been a lesson in perseverance, of stubbornly fighting for what we want most in our lives, and of breaking the self-disparaging cycle we might have been born into. But their tale was not over, as blissfully as it had ended, and one more hurdle was needed for Garth to recognise and truly embrace the unconditional love a woman like Josie was offering him. An intensely emotional and thought-provoking story, sugar-coated with light-hearted humour and sarcasm, it never steered away from getting across a very meaningful message of hope and courage, of learning to grab life by the horns instead of fearing it, of living to the fullest regardless of what the future has in store for us, and of seizing every minute of every day like it were our last. I fell in love with these characters all over again, and I still find myself smiling from time to time as certain scenes unexpectedly flash through my mind, because this superb, feel-good story stays with us long after we turn the last page.â€œI had nothing to compare to the way she loved me, and thatâ€™s what made it so special. No one but her had ever come close to loving me like that. No one had ever believed in me the way she did. Her love was so big and overwhelming that each day with her erased another day of pain and failure from my past. Her love was magic, healing me as it lifted me up, and though she tried convincing me otherwise, I knew I could spend ten lifetimes trying and failing to give her what sheâ€™d given me in a yearâ€™s time.â€Garth and Josie have found their happy ending in each otherâ€™s arms and with a hopeful future before them. But, after a childhood void of affection and approval, and having been told all his life that he was nothing, Garth still struggles with his self-esteem issues, especially when it comes to truly believing that he could ever be worthy of someone as wonderful as Josie. He plans of handing her the world, of making every single one of her dreams come true, thus making her as happy as she makes him, and his career as a bull rider is his means to that very end. But one moment, one flash in time, steals his dreams away and leaves him facing the kind of future he has dreaded all his life.â€œMy whole life, everything Iâ€™d been and everything Iâ€™d wanted to become, was spiraling away from me. Fragments of the man Iâ€™d been and the man Iâ€™d wanted to become were gusting out of reach. My life as Iâ€™d known it was over. My life as Iâ€™d hoped it would be would never come to fruition.â€As we watch him reverting to his old, sarcastic, self-destructive ways in an attempt to cope emotionally with his own helplessness and inherent pessimism, we also watch him push away those he loves the most in lifeâ€”his Josie most of all. Convinced that she would be better off without him and determined to give her the life he believes she should want, he becomes his cantankerous old self, the man he knows Josie should not love. But all his plans fall through one by one as he realises that the firecracker he loves more than life itself is not a woman who can be told what to feel or what to do. And that her love comes with no conditions.â€œJoze, you and I are more alike than both your mother and father pray every night weâ€™re not.â€â€œAh, thatâ€™s the sweetest thing youâ€™ve ever said to me. Nothing says romance like implying your womanâ€™s the a$$hole equivalent of you with boobs.â€Ms Williams has given us a kickass heroine that created the perfect character balance to the heroâ€™s often belligerent and gloomy ways. Josie is Garthâ€™s perfect match in so many ways, defusing his negativity with her sharp tongue and quick wit, disarming him with her bubbliness and playfulness, and mending his broken heart with her endless love and devotion. Even in his darkest hour, she is the beacon that pulls him out of his own misery.â€œMy God, Joze. Youâ€™re the best damn woman God had the audacity to go and create. How did I end up with you?â€There is something so emotionally fulfilling about a story like this oneâ€”even the sadder moments leaving us bursting with hope and positivityâ€”but it is the sheer magnitude and beauty of the love present on every single one of these pages that captured my heart irreversibly. This inspiring, uplifting, touching love story was great before, but now it became a sight to behold. I cherished every moment and was only too happy to discover that one way or another, we would not be saying goodbye to these beloved characters just yet, as they would inevitably play a minor role in the final chapter of Jesse and Rowenâ€™s story in Heart and Soul. This is a book for the heart and mine is overflowing right now.â€œNothingâ€™s fine without you, Joze. But with you? Everythingâ€™s perfect.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YXCLO8FBR75N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY6FO5W#wasThisHelpful","R2YXCLO8FBR75N","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"â€œSheâ€™s everything I never knew I wanted. Sheâ€™s everything I never knew I could have.â€It is truly rare to find a series that delivers so consistently and at such a remarkable level one book after another, each story unique, gripping, unforgettable, a series that never stops getting better and better. So it came as no surprise to me that this last (fingers crossed that it is not!) book would become my personal favourite of the lot. Reese and Benâ€™s story had all the magic of its â€˜predecessorsâ€™â€”a strong, independent female lead; a charming, irresistible hero who changes his bad-boy ways for the woman he cannot stay away from; a whirlwind romance with all the right ups and downs to make us hopelessly addicted and clinging onto every single word. But this story had something more for me, an added pinch of angst that made me wholeheartedly invested in these charactersâ€™ ultimate happy ending. There is so much bittersweet emotion driving this story forward, so much hidden self-deprecation in these characters, all under the guise of fearlessness and over-confidence. Mesmerised by all the beautiful layers of this story, and once more, by this authorâ€™s inimitable trademark humour and flawless prose, I was in book heaven cover to cover.â€œI was smart. Some may say Iâ€™m still smart. But Iâ€™ve made so many wrong turns along the way, I donâ€™t know how many right ones it will take to course-correct.â€Reese MacKay has been a thorn in her social-climbing motherâ€™s sight ever since adolescence, her rebellious, reckless shenanigans landing her in hot water time after time, and so we meet her in the middle of her latest trouble, at a police station, arrested for destruction of private property, her only hope of getting herself out of this situation being to call a man who raised her, but whom she hadnâ€™t seen for nine long years, ever since he divorced her mother. But her â€˜get out of jail free cardâ€™ comes with conditionsâ€”to come to work for him as a paralegal and start sorting herself out, away from the pain of her past and all the reasons she acted out in the first place. Six months later, she is on the cusp of getting a fresh start in life by starting her new job, in a new city, living with and working for the only quasi-parent who has ever seen her true potential. But during her twenty-first birthday celebration in Mexico, her last act as a careless youth, she meets a cocky playboy whose wide grin and steely blue eyes become her undoing. Their connection is immediate, their attraction indisputable, and yet all she walks away with is the memory of one embarrassing night spent in his room hugging the toilet bowl, too drunk to do much else. Two months later, that same cocky guy walks into her office, and he does not waste a second reminding her of their one disastrous night together.â€œâ€¦ Iâ€™m trying to control the hyperbolic flashback that took weeks to suppressâ€¦ as the walking, breathing proof of one of my most mortifying nights stands in my office.â€Ben Morris is the confident new lawyer hired by Reeseâ€™s stepfather. His good looks and flirty personality have made him a hit with the ladies, something he did not mind in the least while working nights as a strip club bouncer to pay for his law degree. But his obnoxious swagger is only a playful façade he enjoys teasing Reese with, riling her up having soon become his favourite past time.â€œHave you always loved yourself this much?â€â€œI had an awkward year in â€˜ninety-nine, but I got over it quick.â€As they play a delicious game of cat and mouse, their daily interactions quickly blur the lines that Reese is so adamant to preserve, especially when her cheating ex-husband enters the scene and she needs someone to be her fake boyfriend. One kiss is all it takes for them to re-ignite the spark between them, something that no friends-with-benefits agreement can suppress. The more they pretend to be in love and the more they try not to fall for one another, the more they canâ€™t keep their hands off each other.â€œReese, well .  .  . sheâ€™s all angry and fire-breathing bitchy until her lips find you, and then youâ€™re sure she must have a cocaine-laced tongue because you canâ€™t get enough of her sweet mouth.â€Reese and Ben are polar opposites in so many ways. While Ben is like a ray of sunshine any minute of the day, having been raised by a mother who loved and supported his every decision, and nurtured his interests in life, Reece has never felt that kind of unconditional love from a parent. She craves for someone to make her come first in their life, for someone to finally choose her, love her, make her their priority. Everyone who ever counted the most has always let her down, made her feel rejected and thus naturally distrustful of people around her. Ben is the first person in her adult life who makes her feel wanted, appreciated, good about herself. His cheerfulness and protectiveness towards her ground her and make her blossom as a person. Reese, on the other hand, is the first woman in Benâ€™s life to make him want to believe in something he has always looked at with disdainâ€”love.â€œI think Ben has a strange power over meâ€” the ability to balance my chaos. And, the more time I spend here on the groveâ€” in his lifeâ€” the more I think that his entire world seems to stabilize me.â€A truly beautiful, light-hearted and yet deeply emotional story of two people quieting each otherâ€™s demons and becoming one anotherâ€™s anchors in lifeâ€”this is one of those books that warms you from the inside out and draws you to re-read it whenever you need a story to make you feel happy. From two charismatic leading characters to one of the most colourful casts of secondary characters I have ever encountered, this is a tale that shows the true meaning of family bonds as much as it is a love story, all laced with a delightful undercurrent of humour and wit. I am besotted, I am in awe, and I cannot recommend this book, as well as the series as a whole, highly enough.â€œâ€¦ if you have to fight over a guy, heâ€™s not worth it. Go for the one whoâ€™s waiting for you.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS19MT52443PT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPM7U26#wasThisHelpful","RS19MT52443PT","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œNever settle, baby. Never, ever settle.â€Second chance at love stories are my personal weakness. I love when characters are given a chance to re-do their lives, mend their broken hearts, correct the mistakes of their youth by choosing a different path in life, a better one, a happier one, and embrace a happy ending that should have been theirs in the first place. These stories literally make my skin tingle and while many have moved me and kept me enthralled, very few have truly left a mark on my soul as this beautiful tale has. Couple that with an exquisite writing style and a myriad of characters I adored, and I was in book heaven. This is one of those timeless love stories that shows us how unique true love is, how hard it is to find it, or let go of it. I giggled, I swooned, I fought to catch a breath while sobbing like a baby, and I have loved, loved every single moment of it. One of my favourite books of the year, one of my favourite stories ever.â€œWhose life was I living? Mine or my motherâ€™s?â€Julianna â€œJulesâ€ White is a woman in her early forties, a mother to a rebellious teenager, a small business owner, a divorcÃ©e. She lives a normal life in the same small town where she was born and raised, the same normal life her mother lived, the same normal life her mother expected her to live. But everything in Julesâ€™ life has been the result of one bad choice, one moment in time when she trusted someone else to make the right decision for her, and she has felt the crushing weight of regret in every breath she has taken ever since. And then, after twenty-six years of living a half-life, everything comes to a standstill when the love of her life comes back to town.â€œOnce upon a time you thought youâ€™d die without him. Then you thought youâ€™d crumble into dust if you ever saw him again. Well, heâ€™s back. And youâ€™re still standing.â€Noah Ryan is the boy who stole Julesâ€™ heart when they were just kids, and he never gave it back. He is the boy who left her heartbroken, confused, angry, alone at seventeen and forced to forget every dream they ever made together. Her choices drove him away, but the day he left her swearing never to return again was the day Julesâ€™ life became everything she never wanted. She closed her heart off to everyone who ever tried to love her, giving only part of herself to them, because her whole heart never stopped belonging to the one who got away. And now, as a forty-three-year-old woman, she is faced with the biggest ghost from her past as he returns with the proof that he has moved on in life.â€œItâ€™s been a lot of years. Everything got put awayâ€”doors locked up tight. But now you fall out of the sky and knock all those doors open. And suddenly Iâ€™m not sure where I am half the time.â€What follows is a heart-warming, comical at times, sexy, moving, somewhat bittersweet tale of giving love a second chance, but also of parenthood and finding that golden balance between overprotectiveness and letting your child make their own mistakes in life. Jules is not just a woman fighting to get her heart to beat againâ€”she is also a mother desperately trying not to make the same mistakes her mother made, and to be the kind of parent she has always wished she had.â€œAnd the romp in the rain?â€ she said, gesturing to the door. â€œThat wasâ€”what?â€â€œMe finding him in the park,â€ I said.â€œBecause that was your obligation?â€I huffed out a breath. â€œNo, Nana Mae, that was me looking to help a friend who was hurting.â€â€œBy falling into his mouth.â€I stared at her. â€œSoâ€”my daughterâ€™s having sex right now.â€She paused and raised her eyebrows as she looked down. â€œBetter subject?â€â€œFrighteningly so.â€Every part of this story got to me, every part of it made me feel, and what I loved the most was how imperfect the premise of this story was, how heavily tainted by one single mistake these charactersâ€™ lives have been, and how heavy the price of some happy endings can be. I was left smiling through my tears, replaying all the what-ifs in my head, knowing that this story was the best example of human resilience, forgiveness, and unconditional love. This is a book you will want to hug, revisit, tell your friends about. And it is a story you will forever hold dear in your heart. â€œIâ€™ve spent two decades living behind lines I never crossed. Twenty years of holding back, not giving my heart completely, not even to my husband. Not ever wanting to feel crushed like that again. And fifteen minutes with you blew all that away.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R361YOC2LKINFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMKD6YQ#wasThisHelpful","R361YOC2LKINFP","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œI didnâ€™t fall in love with youâ€¦ I flew.â€I am ruined.I would like to think that after more than half a dozen books read and loved, I could call myself a seasoned Colleen Hoover reader and thus be equipped for all her â€˜mind trickeryâ€™, and yet nothing, nothing in this world could have prepared me for the emotional avalanche that is Ugly Love. This is a book like no other in this authorâ€™s impressive repertoire, a book that gets under your skin from the very first sentence, and then page after page, it just keeps stripping you of every semblance of control you might have thought you had over your own feelings. Itâ€™s a book that annihilates you from within, slowly breaks your heart into so many pieces youâ€™ll need tweezers to pick them all up, and then it simply stuns you into silence with one of the most unexpected, soul-shattering book moments in history. Every element of this story is so brilliantly thought out, so cleverly executed, so skilfully assembled into one of the most perfect stories I have ever read. Colleen Hoover is on an emotional rampage this time around, and she will ruin us all in the best possible way.â€œLove isnâ€™t always prettyâ€¦ Sometimes you spend all your time hoping itâ€™ll eventually be something different. Something better. Then, before you know it, youâ€™re back to square one, and you lost your heart somewhere along the way.â€The story is split into two parallel timelines, one in the present and one in the past, and it follows two distinct voices all throughout the book. They are each so vivid and persuasive in their impact on the reader, that it often becomes difficult to reconcile them in our minds and see how one can coexist with the other. In the present, our heroine is a young woman in her early twenties, a student nurse who has just arrived in a new city to pursue a postgraduate degree and find a job. Tate Collins has never put relationships before her professional aspirations, her career always coming first, and she remains determined not to let love distract her from her goals. But on her very first day there, as she is moving into her new home, she meets her neighbour Miles, a young pilot and a close friend of her brotherâ€™s, and from that moment onwards, her heart doesnâ€™t stop doing summersaults every time they run into each other. But Miles is not interested in love, now or ever again, and while their attraction is sizzling and at times difficult to rein in, he remains clear on two pointsâ€¦â€œDonâ€™t ask about my past. And never expect a future.â€In the past, we meet an eighteen-year-old Miles Archer, at the very moment he meets his first love. Through brief but particularly attention-grabbing little snippets of that past, we get to witness firsthand the heartwarming experience of falling in love for the first time through the eyes of a young Miles and itâ€™s the very innocence of it all, the untainted joy and excitement of those feelings, that stand in stark contrast with the events and the Miles we get to meet six years later.â€œItâ€™s not that I donâ€™t like youâ€¦ I just donâ€™t want to like you. I donâ€™t want to like anyone. I donâ€™t want to date anyone. I donâ€™t want to love anyone.â€While in the past we see our hero free-falling into love, carelessly and enthusiastically, in the present scenario we see him holding back every one of his emotions from the woman who each day reluctantly falls herself deeper and deeper in love with him. As emotions start bleeding through, blurring the lines of the friends-with-benefits arrangement they have agreed on, Miles and Tateâ€™s relationship becomes more and more complicated as time goes by, bringing them each day one step closer to Tateâ€™s inevitable heartbreak and disappointment. Unspoken questions keep piling up, unrequited feelings keep getting suppressed, and eventually all that is left between them is the ugly side of love.â€œMake me leaveâ€¦ You donâ€™t need thisâ€¦ I just donâ€™t know how to stop wanting you. Tell me to go, and Iâ€™ll go.â€I will stop here and tell you nothing more about this story. This is a book that will keep surprising you, devastating you, leaving you breathless by simply never allowing you to relax or foresee what lies ahead, and I assure you that you will never see the next blow coming. They are all delivered with such precision, I felt like I was on the receiving end of a knife throwing act. Itâ€™s a story that shows the resilience of the human spirit, regardless of how terrifying the ghosts of oneâ€™s past may be, and the healing power of love. The sheer brilliance of this book also lies in the language used, in the quirky dialogues, in the unique monologues, in the word repetitions, even in the extraordinary visual arrangements of words aimed to imprint the meaning of those words into our souls and leave us shivering in their wake. Nothing is accidental and everything is just right.â€œI hope she remembers the momentshebecamemyeverything.â€By the end of this book, my hands were hurting from being balled into fists for so long, my heart was aching and rejoicing at the same time from the countless emotions it had been exposed to, my body was hurting from not having moved an inch for so many hours at a stretch, and I had developed an unhealthy animosity towards italics in general. This is the sexiest, most heart-wrenching Colleen Hoover book to dateâ€”a book that shows us a brand new side of this authorâ€™s writing genius, and it is in my humble opinion, her best work thus far.I am so ruinedâ€¦ and I loved every single moment of it.â€œIf I were capable of loving someone . . . it would be you.â€[6 HEART-STOPPING STARS]","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VW65WZ90I4G1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HB62MC0#wasThisHelpful","R1VW65WZ90I4G1","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""I don't know why the f*** I put up with you.""I shrugged. ""No, me neither. But you keep paying me so I keep hanging around.""She's done it again! Kylie Scott has given us another absolutely flawless instalment in the Stage Dive series and this one just might be my new favourite. It's a story that made me laugh as many times as it made my heart clench, and every part of it, every single word was just perfect. There are scenes I have read so many times, I could recite them by heart, and on every single re-read I experienced a new emotion, saw a new side of the characters' multifaceted personalities. This is in essence a story of unrequited love, of two people falling for one another very differently--with different perceptions of their own rapidly growing feelings for each other and with different emotional capacities to deal with those feelings. I loved being in these characters' heads, loved dissecting their strengths and weaknesses, and I absolutely adored how much attention was paid to the natural progression of their relationship. This book is the very best example of the kind of story that leaves me breathless and makes me never want to stop reading.""Fancy falling for someone you didn't even particularly like half the damn time. Who did something so stupid?""Lena Morrissey stopped believing in love when her heart could no longer bear the constant disappointment from always falling for the wrong kind of man. She is sarcastic, strong-willed, and she does not let others walk all over her, even if her stubbornness ends up costing her her job. But when her outspoken, sassy personality is the very reason she is offered to become a live-in assistant for the lead singer of Stage Dive, she is not sure whether this is a joke or the best thing that has ever happened to her. Shortly after meeting the grumpy and yet utterly irresistible rocker, however, she fears she might be in more trouble than she ever bargained for.""Verbally sparring with Jimmy was fast becoming more fun than I'd had with most other men naked.""Jimmy Ferris' perfectly groomed appearance might give him an air of poise and self-control, but behind closed doors Jimmy is moody, hot-tempered, hard to live with on the best of days. His poor emotional coping skills have resulted in addictions that cost him dearly and almost made him lose everything he has ever valued in life. Unable to work with any of his past sobriety companions, he is coerced by his bandmates into hiring Lena into that role, knowing all too well that he has met his match. His dynamic with Lena is one of constant bickering, both personally as well as professionally, but when faced with his first meltdown while in his employ, she proves to be the only person he trusts to see his deepest fears and triggers. He lets his defences down with her, showing her the man very few people in his life get to see, and their bond grows.""Don't hate me, Lena,"" he whispered. ""You want to be mad at me when I do dumb things, that's fine. But don't ever hate me. I couldn't take that, not from you.""As their relationship changes over time and Jimmy begins to depend on her strength in his darkest moments, so does Lena's growing infatuation with her boss. She falls in love with him silently, reluctantly, fully aware that she should not be feeling that way, but incapable of fighting it. She knows that he would not return those feelings, so she hides them, pines after him secretly and pretends that nothing has changed between them. But when her secret is no longer that and their working arrangement is at risk of ending, the only solution to their predicament is to find ways to make Lena `get over' her crush... even when the only thing that remains to try is to sleep with one another.""Lena, focus. What was the frown for?""I stared at his c***, mesmerized. Even incased in rubber it remained a thing of true beauty. Had I any talent with a pen, I'd have written in poems. A haiku perhaps.""Lena?""I was hypnotized, helpless. C***-struck.One of the main strengths of this story is the way the author shaped these characters, subtly but impeccably, and the way she made their differences the very thing that makes them so perfect for each other. She gave us a plus-sized heroine whose physical appearance in no way defines her as a sexual woman or diminishes her fearless personality. And then she gave us a hero who is physically flawless, but a complete mess inside, unable to cope with emotional closeness and harbouring unresolved abandonment issues. Their every interaction is explosive, hilarious, unforgettable. As a couple, they clash at every turn and yet they make complete sense. The dialogues in this story, as in all the previous books in the series, are simply fantastic, carrying Ms Scott's signature humour in almost every character interaction. They are clever, unforced, and always fresh. I simply couldn't get enough of them.I rarely find myself loving and connecting with every layer of a given story, but in this case, I truly adored every last word. This series keeps getting better and better, which is rather scary since it was perfect from the very beginning. An absolute, super enjoyable must-read.""You okay?"" I asked.A nod.""Feeling a little emotional, huh?"" I petted his hair. ""That's okay. It was an emotional blow job.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCX4ABCET7U5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILYTJS6#wasThisHelpful","RCX4ABCET7U5V","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œAs long as I have breath in me, youâ€™re going to be my princess.â€Whoa. Why was I not told Iâ€™d need one of those walk-in freezers while reading this book? Apart from being one of my most scorching reads of the year, the â€˜realnessâ€™ of the love story took me totally off guard, and held me captive until the very last word. This is a book I expected to like, and found myself obsessively devouring. The level of emotion, the raw chemistry between the characters, the insight into both their personalitiesâ€”this book was the total package for me and one Iâ€™d recommend unreservedly.â€œI get up every morning and put on my perfect face and promise myself to have the perfect day and to someday have the perfect family. But Iâ€™m failing.â€We met Melanie Meyers in previous instalments of the series as Brookeâ€™s loyal best friend, but it is not until now that we meet the real Melanie and the hopeless dreamer behind the mouthy vixen. Melanie has always been the perfect daughter, the bright hope in her parentsâ€™ life, perennially bubbly and optimistic, her appearance and attitude reflecting that positivity and cheerfulness. Deep down, however, Melanie feels like a fraud, unworthy of the life she was given because she keeps failing at the one thing her parents wish the most for herâ€”finding a good man and falling head over heels in love with him. She keeps â€˜kissing frogsâ€™ in the hope of finding the man of her dreams, but all she is ever left with is a string of one-night stands and a heart that keeps breaking from the constant sting of disappointment. And yet, Melanie never stops hoping that her perfect man would suddenly walk into her life and love her the way she craves to be loved, the way she sees her friend Brooke being loved by her husbandâ€”completely and desperately.â€œI am prepared to fall, and fall hard, if only I would just find him.â€Her loneliness and desire to have at least some parts of her life fall into place drive her to make the kind of mistake that puts her entire future in jeopardy, the very mistake that brings a dangerous man like Greyson King into her life.â€œF*** her prince charming. Sheâ€™s getting me.â€Greyson is the â€˜heir apparentâ€™ to an organisation that sets up fighting events all across the country, called the Underground. They are also in charge of all gambling activities related to the fights, and Greyson is their collector, a ruthless man with very particular talents and an unmatched success rate. But Greyson never wanted the life he was forced to live or the future he is now asked to embrace. When his only weakness is used against him, he accepts a job that makes him cross paths with the only woman who has ever made him wish he were someone else.â€œShe makes me feel like Iâ€™m not a robot, like Iâ€™m flesh and blood, a man, not a number, not a job . . . not a monster, not a bastard, not a zero.â€What starts as just one night of earth-shattering passion, slowly grows into an emotional connection neither of them can deny. When they are in each otherâ€™s arms, nothing else matters, they belong to one another body and soul, but when they are apart, their personal demons try to pull them apart and make them doubt what their hearts have known from the very beginningâ€”they belong to each other. While Greyson is convinced that his hands are too dirty to be worthy of a woman like Melanie, she allows her insecurities to make her believe that a man like Greyson could never love and want to keep someone like her, regardless of how much of her love, of herself she gives to him.â€œHe is the one. The one whoâ€™s going to wreck me. Hurt me. Demolish me. The one who is going to remove every inch of the girl in me. He will be the memory I will never forget, and good or bad, he will be THE one I dream of.â€Iâ€™ll be honest, I never expected to find this story, or rather, the intensity of it, when I first started reading this book. The way these characters were developed so flawlessly and so meticulously made me feel like I understood their every move, their every though, their every emotional struggle. I simply got them. And donâ€™t get me started on the chemistry between them because it is electric. Devastating. Epic. The sex scenes between Melanie and Greyson are so powerful, urgent, almost savage in the way these characters part with their inhibitions and self-control while their bodies take over. This author has a very unique talent for transforming even the most explicit of sex scenes into moments of pure emotional vulnerability and demonstrativeness which end up only tying these characters even further to one another. I was overwhelmed, utterly ruined by those scenes, everything about them being just right for my taste.â€œI look at him, and he doesnâ€™t scare me. He lures me. He tempts me, exhilarates me. He makes me want to claim him as if Iâ€™m claiming back a part of me that was once lost. Makes me want to tame him. Let him tame me.â€There is also something extremely appealing to me about a heroine who is so emotionally unguarded and yet so resilient. Melanieâ€™s strength of character, her unwillingness to let go of her dreams, even after so many disappointments, and her courage to put her heart on the line time after time, are qualities that made me love her from the very first page. Greyson might have been the dominant â€˜alpha maleâ€™ in this scenario, but it is Melanieâ€™s persistent heart that was the true hero of the story. I loved their romance beginning to end, every component of it fit just right, including the language used by the characters, and I found myself without objections.â€œYou are so f***ing mine you donâ€™t even know how mine you are.â€A deeply emotional story, a story that caught me by surprise and made me adore every delicious, dirrrty moment of it. I was enthralled, I was moved, I was bewitched, and I never wanted it to end.â€œWhoever you end up with, just know you were mine first. A part of you will always be mine. When you find your prince charming, the one who has everything youâ€™re looking for, perfect, youâ€™ll still be my f***ing princess and not any otherâ€™s.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15KKL260H92C4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D0MZXDO#wasThisHelpful","R15KKL260H92C4","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œQuit fighting against this, Dair, and start fighting for it.â€In a spellbinding finale to a truly addictive erotic serial that had me manically guessing and collecting clues from the very beginning, we finally find out everything. We find out Irisâ€™ real identity, we find out why she keeps running away from Dair, and we find out what the future has in store for them. Every single detail has been untangled, every little secret unveiled, and we are now left retracing our steps and wondering whether it was the sizzling, off-the-charts chemistry between the main characters or the thrill of the enigma itself that clouded our vision and made us enjoy the ride so thoroughly, even though we were blissfully ignorant for the most part of it. I adored the fast pace of this story, the way we were kept in the dark right along our hero, knowing as little as he did, making the same presumptions, having the same suspicions, and getting hungrier and hungrier for the truth. This story is the ultimate wild ride, one I enjoyed tremendously and one I would recommend to anyone looking for a flaming hot read, heavily infused with romance, and a delicious zing of mystery.â€œThere was a bit of truth in every lie, and even if it had been fed to me in the smallest increments, I wanted, needed to remember the real Iris.â€Iris has been gone for two months, leaving Dair counting the days since her sudden disappearance and grieving her absence profoundly. He is unable and unwilling to move on, hoping each day that Iris would come back to him, just like she has done so many times before. As little as he truly knows about Iris, Dair cannot deny the fact that it is not just his body that misses her more and more each day, or that he would be willing to do anything to get her back.â€œRegardless of the absence of its desire, my heart was already involved elsewhere.â€When finally presented with an opportunity to see her again, Dair goes without a second thought, prepared to risk his own safety just to hold her one more time. And that is when Irisâ€™ story starts slowly unravelling. We start catching small clues, we are given a few long-awaited answers here and there, but the puzzle pieces donâ€™t come together until the very end to give us the complete picture of Irisâ€™s life.â€œHow could you be in love with a person you didnâ€™t really know? Someone that had fed you nothing but lies? Someone you knew with certainty you couldnâ€™t trust?â€As much as this book is all about the truth finally coming to light, this is also the book where Dair comes to terms with his feelings for a woman he knows almost nothing about, apart from all the reasons why they shouldnâ€™t be together. He is desperate to know more about her, save her from her predicament and protect her with his life if needed, but he also keeps struggling with the knowledge that she has lied to him from the very beginning and that their connection might be based entirely on lust.â€œIâ€™m more than an age, Dair. I'm a person, a woman, and I'm in love with you.â€I devoured this final instalment in the series ravenously and I only wish it had been longer. One of the most passionate erotic thrillers I have ever read, I am not sure what I loved moreâ€”the intensity of the storyline or the superb writing styleâ€”but I was addicted to every part of it from the very first page and cannot recommend it highly enough. And just wait for that Epilogue...â€œMy love for you is the realest thing I know. Iâ€™d like for you to remember that.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVKVEAL69PM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4M2PIM#wasThisHelpful","RVKVEAL69PM0","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œI want to love all of my life as much as I love this night.â€I must say that it stuns me that even after so many books read and loved, a story can still take me by surprise so completely and so unexpectedly, and end up being the very opposite of what I thought I would find. When I picked up this book, I expected light-hearted humour, I expected romance, I expected a fun read. Well, as much as those elements were all present, this book is first and foremost a stunning insight into human nature, into short-term escapism versus the vivid reality of everyday life. It is a stunning testament of how even the rarest of human connections need a mutual commitment in order to work out, and how love is as much a reward after a journey travelled as it is a â€˜winning lottery ticketâ€™ of sorts. I devoured this book, even re-read parts in order to fully absorb every layer of this story and not miss a word. From impeccable character development, to a truly stimulating storyline, from sizzling sex scenes that had my skin-tingling and my pulse racing, to an engaging writing style that left me craving for more from this talented writing duoâ€”this was a book I could not put down and even before I finished it, I knew it would forever remain one of my favourite reading escapes.â€œWe have the rest of our lives to be sophisticated, but only the one weekend in Vegas.â€Mia is a woman in her early twenties, fresh out of college, and at an important crossroad in her life where she is about to pick the road that someone else has set before her and embark on the kind of future she never wished for herself. A former ballerina, her dreams were suddenly cut short due to injury, but the performer in her still craves to be â€˜in someone elseâ€™s headâ€™ as she has never felt as liberated and as free to be herself as while pretending to be someone else. During her last weekend of reckless abandon, she goes to Las Vegas with her two best friend to celebrate their graduation and be irresponsible for the last time in her young life, never expecting that a one-night-stand could change the rest of her life.â€œI want to have a different life tonight.â€From the moment Mia sees Ansel from across a crowded bar, the spark between them is hard to ignore. They meet, they flirt, they have too much to drink, they talk, they flirt some more, they have wild monkey sex all night long on every surface of their hotel suite, andâ€¦ they get married. A typical night of fun in Vegas and up to this point, this story was exactly what I expected it to be. But once the bright morning light sets on the reality of everything that has happened between them, the more Mia remembers of their night together, of the person she became while in Anselâ€™s arms, of the freedom and passion she felt while talking and making love to him, the less she feels inclined to have their marriage annulled and erase that way the only act of spontaneity in her adult life.â€œI have no idea what to do with you.â€From the bright decadence of Las Vegas to the sophisticated elegance of Paris, France, we follow the young couple into their new life together, as temporary as it may be, and from the moment Mia steps onto the plane taking them back to Anselâ€™s home town, they are faced with the harsh reality of being married to complete strangers, of knowing very little about each other, of having only one thing still tying them to one another, apart from the gold bands on their fingersâ€”the memory of the spark between them.â€œI might not remember every touch, but my body certainly does. I can feel his fingertips tattooed all over my skin. They're in the bruises I can see and theyâ€™re invisible, too: the echo of his fingers in my mouth, dragging along my legs, pumping inside me.â€And this is where this book becomes truly spectacular. Mia and Ansel are faced with the impulsiveness of their decisions, struggling to connect now as spouses rather than each otherâ€™s one-night-stands. They have to work on their communication, on facing the secrets that could potentially tear them apart, on setting a pace in their marriage that leaves both of them resentment-free even when constantly making small sacrifices along the way, and they have to rediscover each other, from the very beginning, their sole foundation being the memory of a perfect night together. I had to stop on several occasions simply to absorb the intensity of those scenes, to reflect at times on a single sentence exchanged between Mia and Ansel, because their every exchange is so meaningful, so electrifying, and yet always charged with underlying issues that they are both committed to resolve.â€œWhat we know is dimly lit bars, playful banter, the clean, crisp sheets of hotel rooms. What we know is the unrequited possibility, the temptation of the idea. The make-believe. The adventure. But when you choose the adventure, it becomes real life.â€The absolute highlight of this book for me is the way these characters strive to understand each otherâ€™s needs and wants, how much they are willing to do to recapture the magic between them, never attempting to change one another in the process. Even during the most electrifying sexual scenes between them, there is always an undercurrent of unconditional mutual acceptance that deepens the meaning of every single touch, every kiss, every stolen breath. I will not deprive you of the indescribable thrill from discovering how they learn to communicate with one another, but I will tell you that I have never been so moved and yet so aroused all at once.â€œI reach for my bag, pulling out gum, but he quickly moves to me, sliding his hands up my neck to cup my face. â€œDonâ€™t.â€ He leans close, sucking on my mouth the way he seems to like so much. â€œYou taste like me. I taste like you.â€ He bends, licking my tongue, my lips, my teeth. â€œI like this so much. Let it stay, just for a bit.â€A deceivingly predictable scenario which turns into one of the most real and realistically told stories I have ever read, this is a book I adored. I laughed, I sighed, I fanned myself, and I even choked up on occasionâ€”the story of Mia and Ansel is what happens when a modern fantasy is faced with the starkness of everyday reality. Reading this book made me happy and it is a top recommendation from me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y2RJ0VBXRNF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEEB5WS#wasThisHelpful","R2Y2RJ0VBXRNF4","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œBeing with you makes me forget who I really am.â€I always say that an outstanding writer can make me fall in love with pretty much any reality they create, as farfetched as their imagination will travel, but only a few can truly capture me with their words to such an extent that I feel the characters, empathise with them, understand their every thought process, and walk in their shoes cover to cover. Willow Aster is an author whose writing I simply adore, her perfect prose enthralling and astounding me every time I open one of her books, so it came as no surprise to me that this story, this quirky, unusual, out-of-the-box story held me so captive and made me love everything about it. A curious tale of self-discovery and learning how to cope with oneâ€™s idiosyncrasies, a rare but splendid kind of romance, a bittersweet comedy of sortsâ€”Maybe Maby is a book Iâ€™d recommend to anyone seeking a story to warm their heart and add a tinge of hope to their everyday life.â€œThe only way I find any relief is by counting â€¦ everything â€¦ repeatedly.â€Maby is a young woman in her late twenties who suffers from an obsessive compulsive disorder, brought about by a particularly stressful event in her adult life and then exacerbated by subsequent traumas. Mabyâ€™s everyday compulsions, such as repetitive counting of everything around her, excessive hand-washing, or repeatedly organizing her closets, help to somewhat alleviate her anxieties and neutralise the urges that rule her every thought, but they do not help in any way with the intense sense of shame from having to carry out these persistent compulsions or the occasional bouts of depression caused by her mental condition. Behind all these oddities lies a heartbroken young woman who does not see herself as worthy of the love she dreams of finding, convinced that all that is â€˜wrongâ€™ with her would only inevitably end up damaging the people who get close to her.â€œI donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I donâ€™t want to be anymore. I pray God will untether whatever is holding me afloat and just let me drift into nothingness.â€Maby lost control of most aspects of her life at the same time when her compulsions started, her love life and her career becoming casualties in the endless struggle that is her almost comical day-to-day existence. A fickle and selfish ex boyfriend, an unreliable best friend, a self-centred bossâ€”Mabyâ€™s life is filled with barriers to her happiness and as it keeps getting more and more complicated, her condition also keeps getting worse and worse. One day, however, the right person steps into her life and for the first time since her only parentâ€™s untimely death, Maby experiences the very thing she craved to feel the mostâ€”hope.â€œThereâ€™s something about him that cuts through my hardened heart and makes me believe in moreâ€”something more than shattered fragments of a life and the endless emptiness.â€Torn between an all-consuming sense of helplessness and bleakness towards her own future, and the overwhelming joy from being loved, cherished, and never judged for her imperfections for once, Mabyâ€™s struggle to accept and feel worthy of the life that is being offered to her brings us to our knees as readers. Her every self-deprecating thought strikes us like a dagger, making us feel protective of this broken young woman who cannot make herself believe anyone could ever love her as completely as she hopes to be loved.â€œHe makes me believe I can be good. Or at the very least, that my ugly is really not so ugly at all.â€At the core of this quirky tale lies a truly beautiful love storyâ€”a story of patience, perseverance, honesty and unwavering affection. Itâ€™s a love that makes Maby believe she can have the things she never thought she could, a love that acts as an anchor in the stormy waters of her troubled mind, a love that she can depend on and draw strength from. I lived this story from beginning to end, I felt Mabyâ€™s pain in my soul, and I never stopped cheering for her. Ms Aster has also given us an extraordinary hero for our beloved heroine, a man who is almost too good to be true, but who perfectly balances someone as complex as Maby. This is a story that made my heart race, skip a beat, rejoice, shatter on so many occasions, and it never stopped making me love every word in it. A rare gem of a book, one I wholeheartedly recommend.â€œThisâ€”this is the best night of my life.â€â€œYou always say that.â€â€œI always mean it.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZVQ74CNGONCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LR4ZIGO#wasThisHelpful","R1ZVQ74CNGONCD","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œShe was soothing chaos. Like that first taste of anaesthesia, before you lost your senses. Or the venom that numbed you before it killed you. I really couldnâ€™t decide which.â€I have never read a book that left me even more clueless in the end than I was at the beginning of it. Until now. Filled to the brim with clues, hints, even small revelations, and yet I am still as blissfully perplexed as I was at the end of The Wild Side. From the moment we dive back into this story, starving to decipher the plotline and figure out the enigma that is Iris, we cling onto every word, every double meaning, every half-truth, only to realise that no matter how many theories we concoct in out heads, we will only remain privy to what the author allows us to know. Nothing is obvious, nothing is predictable, and every delicious moment of ignorance is outright addictive. I am so in love with this series, I could cry!â€œWhich one was the real Iris?â€Dair is heartbroken, lost, desperate to find the girl who turned his life upside down and changed him forever. But Iris has been missing for two months and every moment spent with her seems like a dreamlike memory. His body has craved her unquenchably every second she has been gone, but his heart has missed her even more. During the short time they spent together, she has changed him, revived his spirit and awoken the fire he never knew was in him. Before Iris, Dairâ€™s life was a predictable collection of routines, but her passion, tenderness and generosity both with her affections as well as her body have lit up a spark in him that wonâ€™t go away, even without her now in his life.â€œMe, I was simple. I was order. A very neat, efficient machine that ran on nothing but airâ€¦ And me plus Iris, that was a monster of a machine, with all gears going at different speeds, some spinning off their hinges, just going mad, but it was a wonderful madness, at full throttle, misfiring in all directions.â€And then she suddenly reappears. And we are once more running at full tilt, Dair and Iris using every stolen moment to lose themselves in each otherâ€™s arms, but the weight of every unanswered question and every doubt taints those moments, making Dair more and more desperate for answers. We are finally offered subtle hints of Irisâ€™s life, but they barely paint a picture for us to ponder on, giving us very little insight into her character. All we see is what Dair gets to seeâ€”a young woman who shows her love selflessly and freely, a woman who craves affection herself, who has found something beautiful and precious in Dair, and who is not afraid to take risks to have it, as short-lived as it may be. All she asks of Dair, all she has ever asked of him, is to accept her as she is with him, stripped bare from her past or present, and embrace the truth of her feelings for him.â€œWe arenâ€™t defined by our pasts. We are who we are. You donâ€™t have to know where I grew up, what year I was born, to know the woman in front of you.â€But as their bodies satisfy their thirst for each other, and as their hearts become more and more entwined, Irisâ€™ secrets keep feeding Dairâ€™s insecurities and his fear of losing her again, every fleeting second with her tearing him even more apart. We are left with another heart-stopping ending, one that alludes to a million different possibilities, and makes us none the wiser regarding what is to come. The mystery of this story is simply exhilarating, no other way to put it, the anticipation of what comes next being half the fun in my eyes. I am STARVING already for the final instalment and I love it!â€œIn a world full of lies, you were my truth. You were my light and my compass.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GDH7EHRX0YM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWISN5E#wasThisHelpful","R1GDH7EHRX0YM5","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œShe was young. I was old. She was wild. I was tame.â€Serials seem to be the new black of late and while most are impossible to review in installments due to the unique way that each component is designed to give us only a sliver of the overall story, some serials simply beg to be tackled individually as each piece leaves us with so many conflicting emotions, a myriad of unanswered questions, and an overwhelming need to talk about it all. This is one of those serials and from the moment I read it, I have not been able to stop thinking about these characters, internally theorizing on the many directions the story could take off on. This story is addictive, faultlessly written and structured, and it contains some of the best sex scenes I have ever had the pleasure of reading. But even those numerous scorching moments of blissful depravity never manage to distract us from the iron-clad plotline which drives the story forward, like a silent stream slowly running in the background, never making us doubt for one second that the author has complete control of our every reaction, every stolen heartbeat, every growl of impatience for not being able to figure out what is coming next. Whether youâ€™re a fan of serials or not, I cannot recommend this one to you highly enough, even if just to experience for the first time (as it was in my case) the astounding talent that is R.K. Lilley.â€œMarried twenty years to the woman, doing everything I could think of to make her happy, and sheâ€™d hated my guts. I couldnâ€™t have been particularly likeable.â€Alasdair is a forty-year-old divorcÃ©e, a successful writer and a man fairly set in his ways, his solitary life a carefully organized collection of habits and routines so as to leave little room for dwelling on his own happiness, or lack of. Having been married for two decades to a woman who never appreciated his efforts to make her happy has also turned him into someone who doubts his own worth in a relationship, but secretly hopes to find a companion again. Alasdairâ€™s quiet life comes to a halt when the very enticing, and very young, Iris swirls into his life, life a tornado, and decides to simply take hold.â€œIâ€™m still way too old for you.â€â€œYour c*** doesnâ€™t agree.â€â€œMy c*** doesnâ€™t know whatâ€™s good for it.â€â€œBut I do.â€Iris is like no woman Alasdair has ever metâ€”confident, direct, demonstrative, sweet but incredibly sexual in the way she affects himâ€”and from the moment they meet, he has no doubts whatsoever that she wants him. Or that he wants her like no other woman before her. As much as he tries to fight her advances, stressing their significant age difference as the main reason for not â€˜going thereâ€™, Iris never stops pursuing him, her gentle acts of persuasion leaving Alasdair completely at her mercy.â€œYouâ€™re not too old. Thatâ€™s ridiculous. Look at your hard-on. That thing looks like it wants to make babies right now.â€And so a very physical affair between them begins, turning Alasdair into a man who is quite simply insatiable when it comes to being with Iris, to claiming every part of her body and giving her pleasure, his hunger for her only growing each day, but as possessive as he becomes towards her, he never expresses it or burdens her with it, sensing her flighty nature and the very real possibility of suddenly losing her at any given moment. He never stops questioning her attraction to him, never stops suspecting her motives, but he is willing to risk his heart as well as his wealth even just for a short time in the arms of a woman who tilts his life on its axis. Iris is the first woman in his life who treats him with sweetness, devotion, who is interested in everything that he does and everything that he is, and who asks nothing of him except the part of him he is more than willing to give. She pushes his boundaries, challenging the way he perceives sex, life, himself, and feeding his self-esteem with attention and genuine interest in him. She makes him feel good about himself, something that no one has ever taken the time to do, her effervescent personality freeing him from the self-imposed confines of his own past and mind.â€œShe made me feel so desirable, when Iâ€™d felt so unwanted for so long.â€But at no point does the mystery surrounding Iris end, the author offering us only small glimpses into the woman behind the mask of chirpiness, this huge missing piece in the overall puzzle of their story maintaining a sense of uneasiness in the reader, never quite knowing what might happen next or how quickly it could all come crumbling down. We know from the beginning that these characters are being given only short-lived careless moments of happiness in each otherâ€™s arms, stolen from a life that demands they work for it, and we never stop dreading the moment life comes to collect.We are left with more questions than answers, our minds running in a million different directions and literally starving for more, but willing to endure the sweet torture of anticipation knowing for certain that the best is yet to come.â€œIâ€™m not here to use you. I have a feeling youâ€™ve had a bit too much of that in your life, Dair.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LTCKKIC8ZDDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGREQZW#wasThisHelpful","R2LTCKKIC8ZDDU","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œYou were mine, even when you were his.â€Kristen Ashley truly has one of the most recognisable and inimitable voices of today, and while her books carry her signature prose in every single sentence, each one of her series has a different kind of â€˜feelâ€™, a different type of â€˜undercurrentâ€™ tying the stories together, and creating a unique, addictive reality to immerse and lose ourselves in for as long as we can. I have adored every book I have ever read by this author, but this series gets to me like no other because of its inspiring themes, because of the way it focuses on families, old and new, on what constitutes a family, and on what people are willing to do for the ones they love. A story of second chances, of forgiveness, of seizing the opportunity to correct past mistakes and â€˜make it rightâ€™, of having the courage to capture oneâ€™s happy ending even when you donâ€™t believe you deserve oneâ€”this is a story that stole my heart from the get-go and made me incapable of walking away from these characters for weeks after I first read it.â€œBenny Bianchi was always going to be a promise at the same time Benny Bianchi was the prize at the end of a crazy life.â€We met Frankie and Benny at the end of At Peace, and have been anxiously waiting for their story to be told ever since. Once the girlfriend of Bennyâ€™s late brother Vinnie, Frankie has been shunned by the Bianchi family for seven long years. Wrongly blamed for all of Vinnieâ€™s mistakes shortly before and leading to his death, she has endured and carried her penance in silence, punishing herself for something that was never her fault. She has missed the Bianchis every single day, needed and longed for their love and acceptance since her own family is one she could never depend on, but it is Benny Bianchiâ€™s loathing that has stung the most. Frankie has had a soft spot for the younger Bianchi brother ever since they were kids, but after years of being ignored and hated by him and his family, she has had enough. Once her penance is paid, Frankie is ready to start over, far away from her memories, far away from everyone who has ever made her feel inadequate and unworthy, but that is the very moment when Benny finally realises what has been in front of him all along and what he stands to lose if he lets her go.â€œWeâ€™re talkinâ€™. You donâ€™t like that, I donâ€™t give a f***. Seven years Iâ€™ve been f***ing up. Right now, that s*** ends.â€Benny is not a man accustomed to women not being receptive to his advances, having successfully â€˜played the fieldâ€™ ever since he was a teenager. But he has also never wanted a woman the way he wants Frankie, nor has he been willing to fight for one the same way. Frankie is unlike any woman Benny has ever met or bedded, her feistiness making her irresistible in his eyes, but the beauty of her heart making her impossible to walk away from. Determined to heal the breach and give her everything she has ever wished for in life, he pursues her relentlessly but patiently.â€œHonest to Christ, Frankie, you think Iâ€™d wait since high school to get my shot at makinâ€™ you mine and then Iâ€™d let a four-hour drive and a f***inâ€™ year lease beat me?â€However, as desperately as sheâ€™s always wanted the kind of life Benny is now offering her, she is terrified even more of losing him and his family once again. Her feelings for him grow stronger every day, and yet she keeps succumbing to her fears and pushing him away, convinced that she would only end up being a source of heartbreak for the man she always cared for, even if letting him go would mean breaking her own heart.â€œBenny should have a good woman. Which meant he had no business being with me.â€Aware of all of Frankieâ€™s misplaced hang-ups due to her familyâ€™s emotional fickleness, Bennyâ€™s patience has no limits as he remains confident that with the right kind of love and nurturing she would eventually see herself as everyone around her sees her. The unmistakeable pace of the story allows us to get the full effect of Bennyâ€™s gentle persistence, the best kind of example of a man in love who is willing to give the woman of his dreams all the time her mind needs to catch up with what her heart has known all along. Their chemistry is explosive, making our skin tingle every time they exchange a simple touch, but it is the everlasting nature of their feelings for another that have our own hearts clenching and bursting at the seams. There are scenes that literally have our pulses racing and our knees weakening from the way they are so deliciously erotic and heart-warmingly sweet all at once. Sometimes itâ€™s an entire scene, sometimes all it takes is a simple word, but even the simplest of moments between the characters can be so emotionally charged, we are constantly fighting to catch a breath.â€œNever loved another woman. Not in my life. Waited until I got it right. I got it right.â€The love and support of a good man can be all it takes to erase a lifetime of self-doubts, and Benny and Frankieâ€™s story shows us how much true love can empower a person. And how much beauty can be found when one loves patiently but persistently. By the end of this book, I felt like I knew every facet of these charactersâ€™ complex personalities, they felt real to me, familiar. Itâ€™s a story that warms your heart from the inside out, and leaves you with a deep sigh of contentment. I kept flipping back the pages, hoping to make that feeling last as long as I could, hopelessly addicted to a high that only a Kristen Ashley book has ever been able to give me. And Iâ€™m still flippingâ€™â€¦â€œMinute by minute, honey.â€â€œMinute by minute, baby.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32TAQTY9ZPIZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXW6GFE#wasThisHelpful","R32TAQTY9ZPIZQ","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œIâ€™ve had a lifetime of wrong. Youâ€™re the only thing thatâ€™s right.â€I should probably start this review with a small confessionâ€”I was not a Beautiful Disaster groupie when everyone was proclaiming their undying love for Travis â€œMad Dogâ€ Maddox and naming their daughters Abby. Not because I did not like it, but simply because I never read it when it was first released, and thus never embraced the craze. As curiosity got the better of me and I finally decided to dive in, while I appreciated why this story was loved so desperately by so many readers out there, I think I was too old to swoon over nineteen-year-old bad boys and obsessive first loves. But I totally got it. I got why this story, this tumultuous type of relationship, appealed to such a wide and varied audience, and how it earned such a loyal cult following by providing the reader with the type of escapism that reminds us all of our first loves, of how impetuous our young hearts once were, and of how crazy and hot-headed that first rush of hormones truly made us. This book, once more, is a reminder of it all, albeit on a more subdued level, but still succeeding in re-awakening the memory of those troublesome years when we were finding ourselves, our place in the world around us, and navigating through life on our own for the very first time, regularly losing ourselves in the oblivion of it all. And all the while adamantly believing that every feeling, every emotion, every mind-blowing â€˜firstâ€™ was the sum of all we would ever get to experience in life.â€œNo one has ever wanted someone as much as I want you.â€As we return to the delicious world of the Maddox brothers and the young women who steal their hearts at last, we finally get to know Trenton â€œTrentâ€ Maddox, Travisâ€™ elder brother and the son their widowed father depends on the most. A bad boy of sorts just like his younger brother, Trentâ€™s heavily tattooed façade and hot temper give the impression of walking through life without feeling deeply or becoming emotionally attached to anyone, but nothing could be further from the truth. Beneath this defiant mask hides a sensitive and heartbroken young man whose fear of experiencing loss again, coupled with never having faced his past traumas, have made him a brewing pit of anger and irritability. But just like every fire has a source, every yin has its yang, and Trentâ€™s â€˜antidoteâ€™ comes in the form of a brown-haired pixie with curves in all the right places and an outspoken personality to match.â€œItâ€™s a small town. You shouldnâ€™t have burned all of your bridges.â€â€œThereâ€™s a few I havenâ€™t lit a fire under. Yet.â€Camille â€œCamiâ€ Camlin is the girl next door, the oldest child and only girl in a family of all boys, a young woman whose confidence does not stem from the effect she has on the opposite sex, but rather from her self-awareness and determination to be independent in life. And unlike most females of her age, she has remained impervious to the Maddox charm while growing up, and even more so in her early twenties as she has watched them add notch after notch to their headboards. Trent and Cami have known each other all their lives, but were never friends as such. His reputation has always preceded him and thus made him an unwelcome dating candidate in her eyes.â€œIâ€™d seen him flirt, seduce, and evade since we were kids. There was absolutely no trick Trenton Maddox could play that I wouldnâ€™t be ready for.â€However, when a Maddox sets his mind on something, he is not to be easily persuaded to change it, and once he enters Camiâ€™s life, Trent is there to stay. Ignoring all her insistent attempts to drive him away and discourage his efforts, he makes himself at home in her daily life, becoming a friend she didnâ€™t know she needed, loyal and protective, all the while not making it secret that he wishes for more. Or that not even Camiâ€™s long distance relationship with a boyfriend she rarely sees would deter him from pursuing her.â€œI was just thinking now was as good a time as any to acknowledge that youâ€™re perfect and it wouldnâ€™t suck if you fell madly in love with me anytime soon.â€â€œI have a boyfriend.â€â€œSpeed bump.â€The more time they spend with one another, and the more he treats her as if the world revolved around her, the more she starts questioning everything else in her life and facing it all one by one. Trent represents the mess, impulsiveness and uncertainty her past has taught her to fear and avoid at all costs, but he is also the mirror of many qualities she has always wished to eradicate in herself, and the more she allows herself to accept him as he is and all that he embodies, the more she starts accepting those traits in herself, no longer perceiving them as flaws. On the other hand, Cami is a grounding force for Trentâ€™s volatile Maddox gene, his desire to make her love him making him want to be the type of man to deserve her affections. They are opposites in so many ways, and yet when they are together, those differences are what makes them so perfect for one another.â€œHave you ever wanted something that you knew you shouldnâ€™t have? That it was wrong on every level, but you knew you needed it?â€This is in essence a story of two people becoming each otherâ€™s passage into adulthood by giving one another the courage to grow up and face their fears. Itâ€™s a story that held me enthralled from the very beginning, happy as a clam to indulge in the simplicity of the fantasy of a â€˜bad boyâ€™ falling for the â€˜good girlâ€™, of a boy pursuing a girl relentlessly, shamelessly and with all his might. I did feel throughout the entire story, however, like I was missing a vital clue, a key of sorts to unlock the motivation behind the heroineâ€™s actions, and I have to admit that until the very last page, she was a paradox to me. But then everything came together all of a sudden, the puzzle pieces all magically falling into place and I found myself speechless, frantically cataloguing the clues we were given unsuspectingly, and finally understanding her character. A few gaps in the story still left me wishing they had been explored and capitalised on more to make it an even more cohesive and emotionally richer storyline, especially references to past events that clearly affected the characters in a way that they now needed to overcome them. But I am hoping that subsequent instalments in this brand new series will fill those gaps and that as we got a new glimpse into Travis and Abbyâ€™s story, we will get a similar one into Trent and Camiâ€™s as well.This book is an absolute treat for the Beautiful Disaster fans out there, old and new, and one cannot help but fall in love with yet another Maddox brother. It left me greedy for more and with a sudden interest in getting â€œcashmere comfortableâ€.â€œIâ€™m a f***up, but Iâ€™m going to get it figured out. I swear. Just . . . donâ€™t give up on me, okay?â€","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AIQVRQEP8A65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBHSB8M#wasThisHelpful","R2AIQVRQEP8A65","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œI loved every word, every thought, and I loved you . . . so much.â€As someone who reads to escape reality and to immerse myself in emotions that are not my own, I am constantly seeking that â€˜highâ€™, that rare moment when every sensation running through me is dictated by the characters and the story they are telling. It can be a random burst of laughter, it can be the feeling of having your heart crushed and your breath stolen away from you, or it can be an overwhelming sense of joy for youâ€™ve become one with the characters and their every happiness intrinsically becomes your own. And while those moments are rare and far between, I seek them, fear them as much as I need them, loving how deeply a story can touch us as readers and even alter our perception of our own lives. So when a book comes along that essentially robs you of every figment of control you thought you had over your own emotions and pulls on your heartstrings like a skilled puppeteer, you feel like youâ€™ve just won the jackpot. This book did not just make me cry at timesâ€”it made me cry cover to cover. Once it opened up the floodgates, I never knew what would trigger the next tear. Fern, Bailey and Ambrose are characters that I loved with all my heart, their beautiful souls hopefully leaving a permanent mark on my own, as stories like these are rarely told, and even more rarely with such positivity and genuineness. This is a story that will inspire you, overwhelm you, fill you with so much faith in the human spirit, and it will show you that sometimes the most beautiful tales are found where you least expect them to be.â€œSheâ€™s not pretty. Little, funny Fernie. Sheâ€™s not pretty. Poor Fernie.â€Fern is the girl whom no one notices at school, the ugly duckling who is still more child than young woman, but whose goodness and kindness shine through in everything she does. From the day she was born, she has been joined at the hip to her cousin Bailey, a boy diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at the age of four. They have grown up as best friends, thick as thieves, but as his ability to look after himself slowly declines with age, Fern naturally becomes his carer, stepping in whenever he is unable to do something, filling his everyday life with all the experiences that he would otherwise miss out on, and helping him live life to the fullest as the day his illness would take him away from her slowly approaches. Fernâ€™s innate positivity fills their days with constant joy and laughter, appreciating even the smallest of blessings in life, her almost childlike matter-of-fact approach to the world around her never allowing her to focus on all that was not given to her, but rather embracing and cherishing all the beauty that was.â€œIf God makes all our faces, did he laugh when he made me?â€Fern knows she is not pretty. She knows what physical beauty looks like because she has loved one beautiful face in particular all her life, even though the object of her affections has never seen her the same way or returned those feelings. Ambrose Young is the popular jock at school, the captain of the wrestling team, the guy every girl secretly dreams of dating and every guy wishes they could be. And while Fern knows someone as beautiful as Ambrose could never love someone as plain-looking as she is, she never stops dreaming of the day he would finally notice her as a woman and love her the same way.â€œIâ€™d just trade faces.â€â€œBut God gave you that face.â€â€œWell, if I could, Iâ€™d make myself another. Then maybe Ambrose Young wouldnâ€™t be too beautiful to even look at me.â€Ambrose is not a superficial young man, but he appreciates and is attracted to beauty as most human beings are. His energy, dedication and loyalty to those around him make him someone others instinctively gravitate towards, his handsome face not even holding a candle to the true beauty inside him. And while he has always noticed little Fern, even felt a subtle protective streak towards her, he has never quite truly seen her.â€œDo you think thereâ€™s any way someone like Ambrose could fall in love with someone like me?â€â€œOnly if heâ€™s lucky.â€As their high school years draw to an end, the little fearless redheaded pixie becomes harder and harder to ignore, her courage and honesty igniting reactions in him that he never expected to feel. But when Ambrose finally starts noticing Fern, his life takes him far away from her and the only home he has ever known, their childhood innocence forever stolen from them. When he eventually returns home, Ambrose is a broken man, all his physical beauty gone forever and his heart so guilt-ridden, he cannot bear to be seen as anything but the â€˜monsterâ€™ he has now become. But as someone who has always loved him with her heart, not her eyes, Fern still sees the same beautiful man before her, and never misses an opportunity to show him.â€œI would really like it if, just for once, I could be beautiful to you on the outside.â€What follows is perhaps one of the most heart-warming tales of true love, of a love that is so pure and innocent, it brings tears to our eyes. Fern, Ambrose and Bailey are three characters that you end up loving equally, fiercely, protectively. They each have a story to tell, and each one of their stories is so utterly beautiful, it is dazzling at times. I will not lie to you, there are moments that are filled with such sadness that you will probably end up being a blubbering mess by the end of them like I was, but each moment of sadness is also bursting with bittersweet positivity and a message so powerful, it screams off the pages.â€œCould you belong to someone who didnâ€™t want you?â€I never in a million years expected to fall in love with a story like this, but I didnâ€™t expect to ever find a story like this in the first place. The writing style is superb, commanding in its sheer simplicity, and every single word has the power to undo you. There is a strong spiritual undercurrent driving the story forward, but it fits perfectly into the story itself, without being heavy-handed or overwhelming. Its beautiful message is so all-encompassing and so powerful that I truly believe everyone should do themselves a favour and read this story at some point in their lives. Everyone.â€œYou are still beautiful.â€â€œI think that statement is more a reflection of your beauty than mine.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N1TRGDGVST74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F0XL3B2#wasThisHelpful","R3N1TRGDGVST74","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Her lips soothed me, her heart challenged me, her eyes made me bleed. My bed was where we held our exorcisms. She brought me peace. I brought her fire.""Javier Bernal. Just that name does funny things to my insides. We met him in The Artists Trilogy, and even though I personally never stopped cheering for the other guy, there has always been something utterly irresistible about this psychotic Mexican and his brand of mischief. He never really showed any redeemable qualities, none that could truly outweigh the wickedness of his ways, and yet I always hoped he would find his happy ending and perhaps even abandon the `dark side' for the right woman. Well... I should have known from the beginning that no story with Javier as the leading character could ever be considered `ordinary' by any stretch of the imagination, and that to truly enjoy his `grand finale', one would need to abandon all hope of redemption and simply enjoy the debauchery of it all. And what a delicious ride it has been! Karina Halle has once again proven that she can make us fall in love with anyone she pleases, regardless of how depraved and morally questionable their character is, and that armed with a pen, she is the truly dangerous one.""My destiny was constantly being rewritten and it would continue to be until it was fulfilled. Until I was at the top of the world and I had everything I'd ever wanted at my feet. Until I could crush everything with none of the mercy that was bestowed upon me.""Back in Mexico and now a powerful drug cartel leader in his own right, Javier has put his past behind and focused all his energy on building the empire he has always dreamed of having. Forever hungry for even more power and influence, he kidnaps the wife of Mexico's largest drug lord, planning to exchange her life for a slice of her husband's drug trade. But nothing prepares him for Luisa Chavez, former beauty queen, and the first woman in a very long time to challenge him and make him question his ways with her stubborn defiance of him.""They could try and carve me up, they could rape me, torture me, try and confuse me with hospitality, but they would not get to me. They would not break my soul. They would not see my pain.""Luisa was born poor, but she has always been surrounded by unconditional love. Now the sole bread-winner in the family, she struggles to make ends meet in order to provide for her elderly parents, but never stops making their wellbeing her number one priority in life, no matter the cost to her dignity or pride. But when her beauty catches the eye of one of the most infamous drug lords in the country, her fate is sealed the moment he decides to make her his wife. By agreeing to marry him, she escapes the squalor of her daily life by entering a living nightmare. And when Javier kidnaps her, she then enters another.""Perhaps I should have been more afraid. I was just ... sad. Sad that my life had to go this way, sad that I could never catch a break. Sad that I'd probably never see my parents again.""Trapped, tortured and living in constant fear, Luisa is determined not to let her captors break her spirit, never showing her true emotions to any of them, least of all to the most dangerous of them all--the man who slowly awakens her body and forces her to embrace the woman dying to come out and play. Lines gets crossed, walls get cracked, but there inevitably comes a point when difficult choices need to be made, and when they are both forced to make sacrifices in the name of what they believe in the most.""Love didn't build empires, it ruined them.""A superb depiction of the gritty reality of Mexican drug cartels, this is a story that will force you to leave your own morals and beliefs at the door, and simply `swim' in the darkness of a world where it's every man for himself, where survival is the only priority in life, and where every monster has their own nightmares to keep them awake at night. There is something utterly entertaining, if not confronting, about being able to embrace a reality filled with nothing but depravity and still manage to find something beautiful in it. This is a love story. This is a horror story. And it is so ugly at times, that each rare moment of beauty is nothing less than blinding.""You were always my captive. I was always the man holding the knife.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C50G87VH4OKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7MB38E#wasThisHelpful","R1C50G87VH4OKU","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œI hate that you saved me. But, most of all, I hate that you love me because now I love you and I donâ€™t know how to make it stop.â€It doesnâ€™t happen very often, but once in a blue moon a book manages to grab me so fiercely that I not only end up spending the whole night enthralled by the story, unable to put it away, but I also cannot stop reflecting back upon it, and feeling the myriad of emotions that it stirred up in me from its very first page. Black Box is not a book about the rosy side of life, or perfect characters with perfect lives. This is a story about two damaged individuals whose fates keep touching at every crucial moment in their young lives, continually tying their destinies to one another and making them each otherâ€™s lifeline. It shows how desolate, helpless, monochrome a personâ€™s mind can become when filled with desperation, but it also gives us hope that that big, gloomy cloud does not have to determine the rest of a personâ€™s life.â€œDo you think saving someoneâ€™s life cancels out taking another personâ€™s life?â€Mikki is a girl whose bipolar disorder coupled with recurring suicidal tendencies have made her determined that her only way to escape her unhappiness is by ending her own life. Crush is a young man whose unsurmountable guilt has emotionally isolated him from the people around him, convinced that no good deed could ever erase the burden of his past mistakes. They meet at an airport, headed for the same destination, but while Crush hopes the trip would help him escape all the pretences of his privileged life and find a new direction, Mikki dreams of finally putting a stop to her own suffering. It all might have started as a chance encounter, a cancelled flight leaving two lost souls stranded in the middle of a snow storm, but the more we learn about these two characters, the more we realise their whole lives have been leading up to this moment.â€œDonâ€™t tell me I donâ€™t know you when Iâ€™ve spent the last three years trying to forget you.â€Over five short days, Mikki and Crush get to know each other and as their pasts unravel, we discover an astonishing puzzle of intertwined destinies where each piece shows the tremendous power of the human spirit and how inescapable fate can truly be. The time they spend together in their temporary little bubble gives them both an escape from their everyday lives, as well as forcing them to expose their demons and give each other a reason to seek the light at the end of the blackness of their own minds.â€œI feel like Iâ€™ve known you all my life. I donâ€™t want that feeling to go away. I want to know you all my life.â€This story deals with some very serious issues of mental illness, as well as the emotional repercussions of sexual abuse and bullying, but while those topics were handled with great care and accuracy, the overwhelming feeling this book leaves us with is one of hope and unwavering love. Mikkiâ€™s condition is not romanticised or trivialised to fit a stereotypical vision of a love story, but it is shown realistically in all its unpredictable ferociousness. It drives the story, it drives the characters and their actions, but it does not render them helpless. It only shows the true capacity of the human spirit and how much adversity a person is capable of coping with without breaking. This might be a story describing a grave human condition, but it is also a beautiful romance between two people who were born to save one another and whose connection is the very thing that anchors them to this life.A tale of beauty born out of misery, of love conquering all, this is one of the most sensitively and candidly told stories I have ever come across and it has been a true privilege reading it.â€œIn the process of finding the girl I fell in love with three years ago, I found my best friend.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AJCHT0BQZ7UF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLSV95O#wasThisHelpful","R3AJCHT0BQZ7UF","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œI can never get enough. The more I have of you, the more I want.â€If someone told me that Bella Andre was writing a book about the mating habits of porcupines, Iâ€™d be first in line, waiting for it with bated breath. That is how much I love a Bella Andre kind of fairy tale. So, it comes as no surprise that I started longing for this particular book from the moment I heard there was a New Adult series in the works. I admit that the palpable chemistry between her characters and the hot sex scenes are what first drew me to her stories, but it is ultimately the once-in-a-lifetime type of connection between the characters that keeps me coming back for more. Bella feeds the dreamers in all of us, her books are like every hot-blooded womanâ€™s fantasy come to life, and I canâ€™t get enough of them. With this first â€˜toe dipâ€™ into a much more subdued genre, she has proven once more that her stories can melt our hearts even with little more than toe-curling kisses, because no one does sweet romance like Bella Andre.â€œâ€¦ it was their sweetest, sexiest, most incredible kiss yet. One that swam through her bloodstream like a drug sheâ€™d always crave more of.â€Serena Britten is a world famous model on the cusp of a brand new acting career, and while her beautiful face has graced the front pages of countless covers all around the globe, at nineteen, she has never been in the driving seat of her own life. Managed since childhood by a mother whose first priority has always been Serenaâ€™s career, she desperately craves a normal mother-daughter relationship, one that is separate from her modelling career, one where she feels loved and accepted by her, unconditionally, rather than judged and always forced to please her. She craves the freedom to make her own decisions about her career path, her interests, but above all, she craves everyday normalcy. In her first act of rebellion in nineteen years, Serena enrols at University, leaving her modelling career behind, determined to find her true passion in life, whatever that may be.â€œSerena wanted, more than anything, to live a life that she was passionately excited about. She wanted to wake up each morning feeling exhilarated. She wanted to laugh and love and feel.â€Sean Morrison is the popular jock, the boy whose skills on the field and strikingly good looks have also made him the biggest player on campus, but behind the cocky exterior hides a wounded heart, one which is guarded fiercely from the world around him, and even more from himself. He seeks numbness daily, very few things granting him that escape from his thoughts and feelings, and during one such alcohol-induced escape from reality, Sean meets Serena and his world comes to a standstill.â€œFor the past three months, everything inside his chest felt raw. Splintered. Broken.â€Their attraction is immediate, their bodiesâ€™ reaction to each other unquestionable, but from the moment they meet they are both aware of how unique their connection is and how easy it would be to lose it all by moving too fast. A beautiful friendship is born, one that gives them both the strength to face their harshest demons and stand up to them. Seanâ€™s unrelenting support and encouragement help Serena choose her own path in life, but it is his patience and understanding that allow her to slowly embrace her sensuality and passion, thus awakening the woman in her. And in return, Serenaâ€™s trust and bravery break through Seanâ€™s defensive walls, forcing him to face his pain and learn to live with it.â€œâ€¦ when Iâ€™m with you, I forget to feel bad.â€None of the usual sizzle is present, this is a much softer version of a Bella Andre romance, but her signature touch is woven tightly throughout the storyline, making this a sweeter that usual flick of this authorâ€™s brand of magic. Her sensual prose, elegant and expressive, draws you in from the start, just like always, and her characters get under your skin simply by wearing their hearts on their sleeves. But the focus is on the journey that the characters travel, on the lessons learned and the hurdles they overcome, and on the connection that pulls them to one another, rather than their sexual chemistry. I loved every delightful moment, and even though I occasionally missed the sizzle, I believe this new series will not only please readers of this genre, but also some of the more seasoned romance readers like me.â€œYou keep talking about wanting to be normal. But I donâ€™t get why you would want to be anything other than as extraordinary as you are.â€","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20F26BMK1NVGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IS8VATQ#wasThisHelpful","R20F26BMK1NVGR","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œI want a relationship that lasts longer than a night and isnâ€™t billed by the hour!â€It doesnâ€™t happen often but it does occasionally happen that I devour a book quite literally in one sitting. Okay, I might have been on a plane when I started reading this particular one and there was really nowhere to go for a very long time, but let me assure you that only an emergency landing would have succeeded in distracting me from one of the most fascinating, engrossing, exceptionally written stories I have ever come across. From beginning to end, we are drawn into a world that is so different from our own and yet so intriguing we cannot look away, and a leading character who is so self-aware and honest that his thought process slowly becomes our own. This is a book that has the power to make our bodies overheat and turn our hearts into puddles of mush all at the same time, and it is the perfect example of how every life story, even the most unconventional ones, can turn into a splendid fairy tale.â€œHow could I be proud of being an escort?â€Hallen is a male escort. Pulled into a life of paid sexual services by mere chance, at twenty-one, Hallen is younger than most other men in his line of work, but his natural charisma, intelligence and ability to satisfy his clientsâ€™ wildest dreams have made him a highly sought after gigolo. Whether he is hired merely as a social companion or for his sexual prowess, his clients covet his services not only for his attractive physical attributes, but also because of his flawless professionalism and engaging personality. We watch Hallen enter this industry as a naÃ¯ve young man, desperate to make ends meet, and we get to witness his entire career in broad strokes, in an almost anecdotal fashion, as he tells us of some of his most memorable clients and the lessons he has learned along the way. We see his emotional detachment from the women he is paid to sleep with, the rather clinical way he views those sexual encounters, and his growing cynicism towards relationships in general.But after almost a decade in an industry where the higher the price tag, the cheaper people are made to feel, Hallenâ€™s increasing sense of humiliation over his clientsâ€™ perception and treatment of him has made him question his life choices and what he might have sacrificed due to those choices. And just when we start thinking that there might be no hope for our heroâ€™s love life, a woman twenty years his senior gives him something he never thought he would getâ€”a chance to start his life anew.â€œIâ€™ve done a lot of things Iâ€™m not proud of, but when you look at me like that I feel as if Iâ€™ve been given a second chance.â€Laura is the first woman in Hallenâ€™s life who wishes to know him, the first person who shows interest in who he is rather than what he looks like, who cares about what he thinks, likes, wants. A scorned divorcÃ©e and mother to two adults, Laura is not looking for a sexual companion when she hires Hallen for his services, so when they meet again after he has already walked away from his life as an escort, their relationship naturally turns into a friendship at first. Lauraâ€™s unassuming personality and obliviousness to her own appeal make her irresistible in Hallenâ€™s eyes, but it is her steadfast support of him and his interests that makes him fall hopelessly in love with her. She fulfils him, takes his loneliness away and inspires him to want to be a better person.â€œI was damaged goods, but being with her, talking to her, I felt like I could be more than the sum of my past. I prayed sheâ€™d take a chance with me.â€So, after spending most of his twenties being paid to be the embodiment of every female fantasy under the sun, to give pleasure to women and make them feel good about themselves, at twenty-eight, Hallen finds himself in uncharted waters, navigating blindly through matters of the heart, something in which he has no prior experience. His boyish infatuation with Laura is something he has never felt before as an adult, making him vulnerable and unsure of himself in light of his growing feelings for her.And while their age-gap relationship might be their biggest obstacle in the eyes of the people around them, it is Hallenâ€™s past as an escort and his many faceless sexual encounters that are their true hurdle, feeding every insecurity in both of them, and forcing them to take a leap of faith in order to stay together.â€œIâ€™ve had sex with hundreds of women, Laura, but Iâ€™ve only made love to one.â€This book overwhelmed me. It took my heart hostage and it did not release it until I felt every single emotion that the characters felt, every heartbreak, every doubt, every self-deprecating thought. It starts as a rather entertaining chronicle of a manâ€™s life as a gigolo, only to realise that the account of Hallenâ€™s past only serves to make him more three-dimensional in our eyes and to make us understand him better once Laura enters his life. A perfectly paced plotline, realistically sculpted characters, a heart-warming romance that managed to touch even the most cynical parts of meâ€”this is a story that stayed with me for days after I finished it and even succeeded in shaking some of my most entrenched preconceptions about life, love, age.If youâ€™re looking for a â€˜differentâ€™ kind of love story, one that doesnâ€™t come in a neat little box with a bow on top, or even meet a given stereotype, Iâ€™d recommend this book to you in a heartbeat. It shows life in all its messiness, the ugly as well as the beautiful, and it celebrates the ageless beauty of love.â€œThere was nothing I wanted in this world until I met you.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K4PJEY8SGWZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KN6GY0Q#wasThisHelpful","R2K4PJEY8SGWZE","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finding a good book is a high like no other for me, but finding a great one by pure chance is akin to winning the lottery to an avid reader like me. From the moment I read this bookâ€™s blurb, I have been obsessed with it. There is simply no other way to put itâ€”obsessed with the unconventional storyline, drawn in by the tone of the narrative, but most of all, intrigued by how a plotline of that type could be turned into a love story. And let me tell you, my skin tingled from the very first page. It is incredible that a book of this caliber could be someoneâ€™s debut novel because the writing style is flawless, competent, truly sophisticated and engaging, and in no time, the story pulls you in like a rip current and your mind does not know which way is up. Nothing prepared me for the way it manipulated my mind, shaking all my previously held beliefs and preconceptions about certain scenarios, and stretching it in such a way that I wholeheartedly adored every convoluted, complicated, messy, borderline crazy part of it.â€œA junkie. A sponger. A pregnant virgin whoâ€™d kissed her sisterâ€™s man in a fit of pique.â€Paisley is a troubled eighteen-year-old who feels unwelcome in her own family. Forever in the shadow of her hateful older sister Caroline, her every mistake stands in stark contrast to her seemingly perfect sibling. But Paisleyâ€™s rebellious nature is a mere reaction to a past marred by abuse, psychological neglect by her parents and systematic disparagement at the hands of her only sister. She has channeled all her anger and hurt into drug and alcohol abuse, coming across as a very cynical, defiant and promiscuous young woman, preferring to feed that image of her in peopleâ€™s minds, rather than show her true nature to those closest to her.When confronted with a positive result on a pregnancy test, Paisley finds herself facing impending motherhood technically as a virgin, her only sexual act not having even been one of a fully penetrative nature. Scared and confused, and drawn even more to her addictions as a means of escaping reality, Paisleyâ€™s life comes to a standstill when her sister Caroline returns home a few days before her wedding wishing to introduce her fiancÃ© James to the family. Nothing could have prepared Paisley for her bodyâ€™s reaction to her future brother-in-law, their attraction immediate and almost primal. But while Jamesâ€™ body says one thing, his verbal dismissal of her and his condescending tone deeply hurt Paisley, her jerk reaction being one of acting out her every desire out of spite, all consequences be damned.â€œMaybe one day youâ€™ll find a man who doesnâ€™t mind settling for what you offer, but even if I didnâ€™t love Caroline, you wouldnâ€™t meet my standards, regardless of how long itâ€™s been since Iâ€™ve had a screw up against the wall.â€One night of passionate love-making and drunken abandon, one case of mistaken identity, and Paisley finally loses her virginity to the only man she has truly ever physically connected with. But when the day of her sisterâ€™s wedding finally arrives, the mere idea of watching the man whom she still reluctantly desires getting married to a sister she detests, coupled with copious amounts of alcohol, lowers her already non-existent inhibitions and makes her spill the beans on their one night of passion in front of the entire bridal party, even claiming the groom to be the father of her unborn child. At this point, we are merely at the one-third mark in the storyline and the roller-coaster has just begun.Seven years later, after turning her life around and conquering her addictions while studying and working abroad, Paisley returns to London wishing to seek absolution for her past mistakes and hoping to build some sort of relationship with the son she abandoned shortly after his birth. But some mistakes are easier to correct than others, and Paisley soon discovers the true consequences of all her lies, hurting James and changing his life forever being the hardest one to accept.â€œI hate what I did to you. You offered me your friendship and I made you my enemy.â€Now, I will once more reiterate that this story is messy beginning to end, but to me in that convoluted messiness lies its true beauty. It does not pretend to give us perfect charactersâ€”they are flawed, misguided, self-absorbed and self-indulgent at timesâ€”but they also learn from their mistakes and try to make amends even when doing so could jeopardize their own happiness. The tone of the book, told in the heroineâ€™s voice, remains frank and direct, especially as she explores the depths of her own imperfections, making her one of the most self-aware characters I have ever come across. That self-awareness made me fall in love with all her shortcomings, it made me empathize with her, understand her actions, and cheer for her until the very end.â€œI donâ€™t know whether I hated him or not. Maybe I didâ€”in the way you can hate things that are forever beyond your reach.â€And amidst all that mess there is a beautiful love story, one I kept re-reading for days after I first finished this book, wishing to stay immersed in the storyline and to absorb every detail that I might have missed the first time around. There are elements of this story that I will not mention to you because they can only be understood in the context of the whole picture, but I can guarantee that at no point will this story stop holding you captive, titillating your mind and making it run in a million different directions while you attempt to come to terms with the charactersâ€™ actions and how they fit within your own set of moral beliefs. I personally loved Paisley, and I connected with every borderline crazy facet of her complex personality. But I am the type of person who is attracted to scenarios of â€˜cause and effectâ€™â€”I am drawn to characters whose actions are the result of something else in their lives, a single event or a whole history of them, and Paisley is the perfect example of a young woman who reacts to her surroundings almost instinctively, her every mistake speaking volumes about the pain she desperately tries to hide from the world around her.I walked away from this book smiling, my heart so full from some perverse sense of satisfaction that the â€˜underdogâ€™ in life got what everyone always tried to prevent her from getting. This is not so much a story about redemption or even absolution in the endâ€”it is a story about two people truly accepting each other, flaws and mistakes and all, and building their happy ending based on the knowledge that nothing in life would make them as happy as being in each otherâ€™s arms. Iâ€™m telling you again, however, this plotline is twisted, mind-blowing, far-fetched at times, but every part of it fit the story perfectly, and it was crazy beautiful in my eyes start to finish.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OGN28GS5OUFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I15VLI6#wasThisHelpful","R3OGN28GS5OUFK","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œShe had shown up and stolen a piece of my heart without opening her mouth. Then sheâ€™d consumed me. Taken it all.â€When it comes to sexy, possessive, hopelessly smitten leading men, no one comes even close in my eyes to the one and only Rush Finlay. I donâ€™t know what it is about this particular character, whether itâ€™s the bad-boy-turned-devoted-boyfriend scenario, or simply his dirty mouth that never stops leaving me speechless, but I have been obsessed with him ever since he put a roof over a penniless young womanâ€™s head and then ended up spending every waking moment trying not to fall in love with her. And failing oh-so gloriously. Weâ€™ve heard Rush and Blaireâ€™s entire storyâ€”we saw their fated first meeting, we watched them falling for one another, against a lifetime of odds, fighting for their happy ending and finally finding itâ€”but we never got a chance to dive into Rushâ€™s mind and see the beginnings of their epic love story through his eyes. Until now. A perfect addition to an already perfect series, this book filled all the gaps, answered every question, and it only cemented my Rush Crush.â€œI donâ€™t know what this is that is going on between us, but from the moment I laid eyes on you, I knew you were going to change my world.â€The son of a famous rock star, Rush Finlay is the embodiment of every womanâ€™s wildest dreams. But one night of wild passion is all that any woman has ever gotten from him. Having watched his mother discard husbands all throughout his childhood, and his philandering father use women for one thing and one thing alone, Rushâ€™s perception of relationships has always been warped, the mere idea of bedding one woman for the rest of his life never even crossing his mind. And then one day a blue-eyed angel walks into his life, and makes him question every single thing he has ever believed in.â€œIâ€™ve been with a lot of girls, Blaire. Trust me, Iâ€™ve never met one as ... perfect as you.â€Torn between his growing feelings for Blaire and his loyalty to his only sister, we finally get to see the turmoil raging in this young manâ€™s heart and mind when forced to re-evaluate his priorities in life. We have always known the depth of his devotion to his sister Nan, as heartless as she may appear to others, but in this book, we are offered an intimate insight into their shared childhood, into the events that made him her only protector and shoulder to cry on in life. Their bond becomes real in our eyes, we almost feel for her (or maybe it is just meâ€¦) in light of her dysfunctional and ultimately traumatic upbringing, but most importantly, we finally shed light onto how powerful his predicament truly is and how much he is willing to sacrifice for the woman he loves.â€œIt was like sheâ€™d become the sun, and Iâ€™d started revolving around her. She was my center.â€Rushâ€™s feelings for Blaire are as undeniable as they are troublesome to him. He fights them from the moment she walks into his house, her innocence and naivetÃ© beaconing him to her and making him feel increasingly protective of her. Their romance assumes new dimensions once we get to know his thoughts during and around every well known scene, and to me personally, reading this story once again felt like I was reading it for the very first time. It felt fresh, more profound, and surprisingly engaging given the male point of view. The â€œpeanut butter sandwichâ€ scene alone, seen through his eyes this time around, felt even more heart-wrenching and intense, reminding me why I fell in love with Abbi Glinesâ€™ writing style in the first place, and why these characters resonated with me so strongly.This is not just a book for the fans of the series. This is a book for anyone who seeks an emotional escape in their fiction, a way of letting their naughty fantasies run wild while their hearts beg for mercy. A stellar conclusion to a beloved storyline, but I will give you one piece of adviceâ€”have Never Too Far handy once you start turning those last few pagesâ€¦â€œI didnâ€™t want to hurt her. Yet I would be her biggest heartbreak.â€","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VH87D7GJ0YFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPOYENY#wasThisHelpful","R2VH87D7GJ0YFT","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œYouâ€™re here because I own you, Kyrie.â€It is with great sadness and disappointment that I write this review today. I have loved every single book that I have ever read by this particular author, her stories always having the power to transport me into a world where all my senses are heightened, my emotions no longer my own, a world where I become one with the characters. However, that was not the case with this book. From reading the excerpts, I was certain this story would be right up my alley, never doubting for a second my overall enjoyment of it. But I guess not all stories are for everyone, and this one simply was not the one for me.â€œI own you but you will submit to me willingly.â€The premise of the book itself is pure brilliance. Kyrie, a girl struggling to make ends meetâ€”the only provider for a mother who requires constant medical attention, and a younger brother who is still in collegeâ€”receives a mysterious but desperately needed cheque in the mail with no accompanying explanation. The cheques keep arriving month after month, their substantial value allowing Kyrie not to worry about money for the first time in her adult life, but the mystery behind them never lessens, four cryptic words on the first three cheques making it certain that nothing in life comes for free: You Belong To Me. And that there would come a day when someone would eventually come to collect.â€œWhatâ€”what are you going to do to me?â€â€œEverything. But nothing you wonâ€™t enjoy.â€A year later, her â€˜benefactorâ€™ sends for her, her compliance never being in question as the alternative of paying back the funds is unfeasible, and so the real mystery begins. A world of opulence and luxury, her every need and want met, an excessively affluent but tenaciously private man behind it all, whose attentiveness is only matched by his insistence on withholding his identity from her and gaining her trust firstâ€”the story is unravelled slowly and methodically, the chemistry between them being and remaining the focal point of the story itself.â€œHave you ever really given yourself to a man before? I donâ€™t think you have. And certainly never to a man like me.â€And so we set sail on this erotic adventure with no known course ahead of us or compass to guide us, no clue whether it would be a bumpy ride or relatively calm waters all the way, simply letting ourselves indulge in every scintillating interaction between the main characters, the constant enigma of the whole situation designed to keep our hearts racing page after page. It is a story of sexual discovery as much as it is a mystery for us to unveil, Kyrieâ€™s gradual but willing submission to a man she knows nothing about except her own bodyâ€™s reaction to him driving the story forward and setting its pace. It is first and foremost a game of sexual frustration and domination, the erotic component of the storyline overshadowing all others, even character development at times, leaving no doubt in my mind as a reader that the purpose of this story is to titillate the senses, rather than engage the mind.â€œYou can scream as loud as you want, sweet thing. No one can hear you.â€Regrettably, though, my senses remained unaffected. As â€˜out thereâ€™ as some sex scenes were, I failed to feel anything more than a slight shiver from time to time, their mood never quite reaching my sensory receptors. And I was desperate to FEEL. I found myself wanting to skim over the most intimate scenes between them, making me question my own sanity in the process. I never connected with either of the leading characters, nothing in their given traits appealing to me on a personal level or making me understand their actions. Their behaviour felt erratic, disjointed at times, the heroineâ€™s in particular as hers is the only voice we get to hear. Her awkward internal monologues designed to give us an insight into her feelings and doubts made me cringe, their pseudo-philosophical tone sounding out of place and forced to serve the storyline rather than providing a foundation for it. I never understood either character, simple as that, and I wish more time had been spent on moulding them into credible human beings instead of inundating our heads with unnecessary references to pop culture, garments worn by the characters or exclusive brand names. They added nothing to the overall mood of the scenes, other than a level of superficiality that I am not sure this story demanded. The entire story overflows with details, conflicting ones at times, and lacks the actual â€˜glueâ€™ keeping it together.â€œIt looked a bit like the dress Jennifer Lawrence wore to the SAG awards.â€When the time came to â€˜assembleâ€™ it all, the backstory plotline felt sudden and rushed, almost as if it did not belong in this book, and I walked away dissatisfied, unmoved, frustrated, never wanting to hear the words you are mine again in my life. And I am still unhappy. I am unhappy that this story is so inconsistent with this authorâ€™s previous works, I am unhappy that this industry is tailoring the stories that are written rather than the other way around, and I am unhappy that I am unhappy. Because all I sought was an escape and the only thing I wanted to escape from were these characters. But I also have no doubt in my mind that this book will find its willing audience that will love every moment of it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NA2IGTTIETKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRGU5OU#wasThisHelpful","R3NA2IGTTIETKK","A3J6BG42QHFD5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J6BG42QHFD5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A good read.  A few good points.Authors reject the terms Total Depravity and Limited Atonement...but they hold strongly to both concepts. Though they don't really explain, they apparently reject Unconditional Election as a term....but hold firm to the concept.  And, of course, the entire 5 points receive new terminology and a fresh coat.Well done restatement.  Kudos there.  Just not much here that demands a purchase.

"Initial Review upon 4 days of use:I went through 3 different Laptops in search of my new Notebook PC (to replace a great Dell Inspiron that I have had for 5 years).So, first question:  Why not go with another Dell?First, Dell has been slipping lately in Customer Satisfaction.  But more importantly, I was looking for a convertible notebook... something that could flip completely around and allow tablet-like operation.  At present, Dell does not have a good one of those that I am aware of.ASUS has been creating great laptops for the last many years and they keep getting better, so I had to look at ASUS in my selection process.  I also looked at 4 other notebooks in my process (5 if you count the Flex).Before the ASUS:First I looked at an i7 Sony FIT, just because it was a great price and better specs. My judgement after a week of use: Let's just say no...nothing seemed to work right with this laptop... and since it was not a convertible (2-in-1) I moved past it quickly, despite the great price for the i7. The performance was sub par and useability terrible.Next, I seriously considered the Lenovo Flex. You can get some great deals on the Flex, and it is a well made, beautiful and powerful line. Only problem?  It FLEXES only so far... so it can NOT fold back on itself... one option I really wanted  for my unique needs.  I just don't see the benefit of a 270 degree flexible PC.  I played with a friends, was impressed, but it gave me no benefit and was not a true convertible.Third, I purchased the Sony Vaio Flip... a great little 14 inch wonder that is sleek, gorgeous, and utterly unremarkable in performance.  The ""flip"" mechanism was super neat, and shows great design.  People commented on the design and beauty.  It's a stunner.  The problem after two weeks?  Horribly loud fan, problematic USB and port placement, pedestrian performance, and the killer, the saggy, mushy keyboard, that caused typing to be a chore.  (The keyboard looked great with a back lit keys, but it was impossible to type for any length of time).  The Sony Vaio FLip went FLOP and I returned it.  I really wanted to like it, I couldn't.I did look at the gorgeous Lenovo Yoga 2.  Hey, that has got to be the best convertible 2-in-1 out there!  But the HIGH PRICE TAG (north of $1K) and lack of size (13.3 screen is the best size you will get... no 14 or 15 inch screens) made the choice of the Lenova Yoga 2 impossible for me to consider.  I would recommend it to those with better bank accounts and those who love the excellent styling, super thin and light weight, and fast performance.  That leaves us number 5:  The Asus Transformer Flip.ASUS TRANSFORMER FLIP:ASUS is an outstanding brand, and when the Sony showed its true colors (infamous  ""sony"" failings), the ASUS was really my number 1 choice.  This model would need to be considered nearly a budget consideration compared to most of the other convertibles I considered.  Yet, it is clearly superior in every way to the Sony Vaio, even tho the vaio cost $300 more.  The ASUS is clearly a top-level contender.  It is fast, it is a dream to type on (no, this model doesn't have the backlit keyboard).  But the keyboard has the perfect ""travel"" for keys and is firm with the Aluminum casing.  The fan is quiet and this thing runs cool.  It is speedy, at least compared with the same spec'd Vaio and faster than the i7 Fit. The one Terabyte drive is so much faster than the 500 GB hard drive on the  vaio. (Twice the hard drive size and twice as speedy) And the wifi card seems to be substantially better as well (no wifi issues...and my internal wifi card is the mediatek...so those issues must have been resolved with the driver update).The FLIP mechanism (hinge) is sturdy and was well tested before being put into production.  Touch screen super responsive and accurate, unlike Vaio.  And the touchpad (next to keyboard) is so much better than the Sony's impossible touch pad.  Now, I still like having a mouse for serious work, but it is nice to have a workable touchpad.  Comes with Bluetooth, as well.Comes with WIndows 8.1 and updated drivers.  Now, I must confess, I downloaded the free Classic Shell from CNET's site... and I love being able to have a classic START BUTTON when I want it... need it. I heard we are to expect Windows 8.2 will have a real start button again!  I love having the brilliant 15.6"" screen, and at a full 1080P... beautiful.Cons:  None thus far. Well, it is not as thin and light as the Lenova Yoga 2 units are.  I will try to update this from time to time as I learn more about this impressive notebook.Update October 2014:  Still love this notebook! Wonderful pc.  A pleasure to use.  I will say that if you want to use this as a true tablet, know that weight will be an issue.  My tablet like use of this great PC alway's keeps it on a desk, so not a problem for me.  If you want to carry everwhere, try the Yoga. Or, I have a super lite tablet when that is what I need....This notebook is my daily work PC, it still shines with all 5 stars!As of January 29, 2015, I am still very pleased with my purchase. Since I take this with me to meetings and presentations, I still get comments on this Asus Transformer.  They love the design, the vibrant screen, the great viewing angles, the FLIP design, of course,  and the performance. It has been a great purchase for me because of the many ways I use this notebook.I did pick up a inexpensive ""compatible"" power charger (from Amazon) to leave at work (about an hour away) so that when I leave in the AM, I simply grab my Asus, slide it in sleeve, and go. The battery life has been great, but just having that back up charger available means I don't have to ever worry...and I don't have to transport the charger unless on serious travel assignments.Update: Feb. 15 2015:Cons:On my Asus, the volume level at max seems to go down over time.  Well, it has never been loud at max volume. The other day I tried listening to the same video on my laptop and my tablet (Kindle hdx) and the tablet was significantly louder.  If I cannot get a fix for this somehow,  this could be a reason for lowering one star.  Do others notice this problem?Cons UPDATE4/23/15Volume problem?  Found this simple, neat fix for my volume problem. Understand that the steps below may be slightly different on your laptop, but it will make things louder so that it is very usable.Right click on your white speaker icon in the taskbar, choose ""Volume Control Options"" (if you don't see that, try ""devices"")On the playback tab, highlight or put a checkmark in box of  ""Realtek High Definition Audio-Default Device"" and Click OK.That should bring up new window, if it doesn't, then right-click on task bar speaker icon again and choose ""Playback Devices""Realtek window will now appear. Click ""Properties"" box -- another window will appearChoose the [Enhancements] tab and you will get a selection of choicesScroll thru the choices available to the very bottom one ""Loudness Equalization"" and check the box, then click apply.You should immediately hear the difference.  It was quite substantial on my ASUS TP500L.  This is great!The above ""fix"" was on the ASUS Forums...so apparently some of their laptops have this Loudness feature off when shipped... and based on other reviews of the LP500L from ASUS, I would guess most are in need of this quick fix.JJ","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LMAROU24D0YM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYCTDMA#wasThisHelpful","R2LMAROU24D0YM","A3MFF3HWX2TB60","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MFF3HWX2TB60?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I am the first reviewer for this product on Amazon, I will rate it a generous 3.  Understand, however, I returned this laptop because of a few key issues that are worth noting.As mentioned, I returned Sony Vaio Flip for KEYBOARD and FAN issues.

The flip is a stunner. ANd it works well. I loved the design.Satisfactory performance.Beutiful styling.Cons:Styling much go with performance... performance was often laggie. REALLY? My Dell 5 year old dual-processor laptop was just as fast as this Sony. HOW?? This is an i5 Intel chip with 8GB ram!!! I had but 3 GB Ram and a much slower chip. Just being ""OK"" in performance is hardly worth the price of an upgrade. Biggest reason for 2 to 3 stars is the dull performance.If that weren't enough.. the keyboard is mushy. Ugh. Very hard to type on this long term. Yes, it has the ""island"" keyboard that so many use (and only a few have done a good job with). Sony's keyboard actually sags in the middle and this kills responsiveness. Oh, nice that it is backlit, but that cannot make up for a horrible typing experience. Main reason #2 for a score of 2-3... mushy keyboarding. Ugh.NOISY fan. I had heard about this from others before I bought. I thought... I am sure it is no worse that my 5 year old dell. BOY was I wrong. It starts out quiet and then BOOM... this fan kicks in.. I was in a meeting (conference room setting) and 3 people looked over at me when my fan kicked into high gear. Then it stays on for a long, long time. Really annoying.Only 2 USB ports? Really? Let's say you have a mouse with you and a USB stick... where do you plug in a printer or another item? Just too often (when traveling) you need an extra USB. Kudos that both usb's that they have are 3.0.And for this price point: No AC standard for the Wifi? And no SSD... I can live without an SSD actually... but at least give us a combo drive at this cost... so many have gone to a combination drive with 8GB to 32GB of SSD along with the Hard drive, producing a fast start up machine PLUS plenty of storage.. but now, now I am getting too picky. :)Really, a nice laptop... I tried all I could to keep this beauty... but I couldn't get past the limitations. Especially that horrible keyboard.PS... no trouble at all with the touch screen ... no problem with the included WiFi card in it... perhaps drivers were updated. (from other reviews).Last... I have been told that SOny is getting out of laptop market... selling to another company. Too bad. But this would give me pause of buying a current model from them.

"[UPDATE: It looks like this review is in wrong place (as are several others for the FLIP). Avoid the FLIP 2-in-1, if you can.  I will put the following review of the Sony Vaio FLip in the right place when I find it)As mentioned, I returned Sony Vaio Flip for KEYBOARD and FAN issues. Before detailing, let me cover some Pros.Pros:  Nice, beautiful display.Great idea for a FLIP SCREEN... if you are looking for a 360 degree 2-in-1 flexible convertible laptop, sony has the most unique and useful design to date. The flip is a stunner. ANd it works well.  I loved the design.Satisfactory performance.Beutiful styling.Cons:Styling much go with performance... performance was often laggie. REALLY?  My Dell 5 year old dual-processor laptop was just as fast as this Sony.  HOW??  This is an i5 Intel chip with 8GB ram!!! I had but 3 GB Ram and a much slower chip.  Just being ""OK"" in performance is hardly worth the price of an upgrade. Biggest reason for 2 stars is the dull performance.If that weren't enough.. the keyboard is mushy.  Ugh. Very hard to type on this long term.  Yes, it has the ""island"" keyboard that so many use (and only a few have done a good job with).  Sony's keyboard actually sags in the middle and this kills responsiveness.  Oh, nice that it is backlit, but that cannot make up for a horrible typing experience. Main reason #2 for a score of two... mushy keyboarding.  Ugh.NOISY fan.  I had heard about this from others before I bought.  I thought... I am sure it is no worse that my 5 year old dell. BOY was I wrong.  It starts out quiet and then BOOM... this fan kicks in.. I was in a meeting (conference room setting) and 3 people looked over at me when my fan kicked into high gear.  Then it stays on for a long, long time.  Really annoying.Only 2 USB ports?  Really?  Let's say you have a mouse with you and a USB stick... where do you plug in a printer or another item?  Just too often (when traveling) you need an extra USB.  Kudos that both usb's that they have are 3.0.And for this price point:  No AC standard for the Wifi?  And no SSD... I can live without and SSD actually... but so many have gone to a combination drive with 8GB to 32GB of SSD right with the Hard drive, producing a fast start up machine PLUS plenty of storage.. but now, now I am getting too picky.  :)Really, a nice laptop... I tried all I could to keep this beauty... but I couldn't get past the limitations.  Especially that horrible keyboard.PS... no trouble at all with the touch screen ... no problem with the included WiFi card in it... perhaps drivers were updated.  (from other reviews).Last...

"I bought this nice neoprene zippered case specifically for the Sony Vaio 14"" Notebook (the Sony Flip 14a model), and it fits perfectly.  However, there is little room left over. A nive tight fit, but not too tight.This is NOT heavy protection... it is a light-weight neoprene zippered case, no handle, and no additional pockets, but I love it.  I often have my Sony Vaio, plus a uSB mouse in that case.  If I need to bring along a charger, it will fit as well.  But this case is lumpy with these added accessories because they cause a buldge in the case.  Still, it is hard to take any points away for that.

"This is a good theological primer.  Easy to read and work through since is is broken down yo 9 key questions / topics that explore the significance of the Scriptures from the vantage point of each. Are there better theological overviews? Sure.  But perhaps none are better for introducing concepts clearly, supporting with key Scripturrs, and addressing objections to a general sudience. Only reason for the lack of one star is due to some perceived lack of discussion....but as I said, general audience may not need or want that added depth.

"Excellent drama with music of the Birth Narrative of Jesus. Your kids will love it too.This is the Birth of the Messiah...and caution: if you are expecting more...like the life of Jesus as a boy or even the flight to and from Egypt, then you will feel that it ends abruptly, but it is outstanding till then.Music is great.  The production value of animation is excellent (even if figures are all elongated).  The singing is marvelous. The Scriptural integrity is good.I have one pet peeve of most nativity depictions: Jesus was born in a house, not a stable or a cave.  Likely the house of his relative (the reason for Joseph going back to his family home).  And if this seems a bizarre notion to some, it is not some liberal non-sense but simply a correction of one poorly translated Greek word.  The word translated ""Inn"" is better translated as guest room or even guest lodging.  So, what was full that night was the guest room of his family's home, so Jesus was born in the main living room (or a two room home) where, at night, any family livestock were also brought in-doors.  so one could hope that such a new production would show Jesus being born in a house of one of the relatives... something almost all scholars agree on now (and was first posited way back in the 1890's by Greek scholar Plummer and now many current translations follow). But old traditions die slowly, I understand.So, this is pure joy to view. It is also Granddaughter approved.  :)Enjoy this new Christmas Classic. Oh, my wife (from Texas) says this is the music from a performance done yearly done there someplace.

"FIrst off, the Rat Pack Christmas is available in about 4 or 5 different versions.  Some come in 11 song collection. Christmas with the Rat Pack gives us 21 songs.  All that is well and good, but it pales in comparison to this set (which at present is NOT available via Amazon or iTunes download).  No.  To get this massive, fun 74 song collection, you must find the CD's of these classics.Now to be sure, a purest might say, ""Wait, the Rat Pack was only Dean, Frank, and Sammy... maybe Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop!"" True enough.  But they often included those who were tangental to the original three-some.  Remember, even Bing Crosby was considered a Rat Pack member when he replaced Peter Lawford in one of their movies.But to the point: Excellent music, excellent collection, excellent rendering, along with so many other Rat Pack and Rat Packish songs and singers to bring a smile to most faces.

"When I first ordered a case for my Galaxy Note 3, I didn't want to pay $30 -$50.  I really liked the idea of the Samsung Folio style case with auto-wake feature.  But...But, what I found is that case offered almost no protection. And the auto-wake feature used battery life and didn't always work.I almost immediately had a mis-hap with my larger NOTE 3 phone as I drove the phone into a side of the table, that originally case was open on the sides and that was the last time I used that case.I ordered two more cases online, one was otterbox like and I hated it.  The other was ultra slim and again, offered virtually no protection. THIS IS A BIG PHONE.  And it is an expensive phone. And I believe a case should be able to handle small mishaps. Oh, not big things... that is why the otterbox type case was just too much. It ruined the phone.Then this Spigen Bounce came to my notice. Oh, wonderful.Already it has taken a jolt from a three foot table to a hard, unforgiving ceramic tile floor hitting squarely on the corner of the case. Oh, no!  As I watched in horror (after my earlier problem), I picked up the phone and not even the case was marred. Nothing. Perfect condition. I can't say much more. This case does what I want.I like the case too. I think the back is stylish and unique and the front nearly disappears, but provides that needed bezel for setting a phone on a table and still keep the screen protected. I even love the buttonless buttons. :)  I thought I would hate that.  But they work so well that you got to like the sleek look it adds to the phone & case.Some things I think you will like:- Very lightweight and slim.  Almost no weight added to the phone.- non-slippery TPU casing, I have loved holding my phone ever since I put it on.  (Sorry, but the phone just didn't feel right til then). :)- You can safely lay the phone face-down on a table, desk, etc, as the bezel elevates.- Being able to take the S-Pen out of the phone easily was important for me... five stars here.- The manufacture (by Spigen, my new favorite case manufacturer) is clean and good. Precision cuts for openings.- Simple to put on and to remove when needed. Still, it doesn't have a problem of exposing edges or sides!  (one case I ordered just wasn't stiff enough to protect the LONG sides of this phone, leaving the edges uncovered anytime it was being handled.)- It was cheap.  Excuse me, it is well priced. Yes, I know this is just some TPU and engineering design, but this design makes a very useful and beneficial case. I love it.  Well worth the price. And still slim and attractive... something I didn't want to give up.- BOUNCE.  Yep. Bounce. The name of the case.  And if the case allows a $700 phone to bounce off a hard tile floor, that is something to love at such a inexpensive price!Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UKWAKFNP5ELX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCIY5H6#wasThisHelpful","R1UKWAKFNP5ELX","A3MFF3HWX2TB60","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MFF3HWX2TB60?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me review this case with the positives first.  That way you can decide if this case is something you want.Positives:Yes, this case is similar to the Galaxy Folio case that cost much, much more.  Such a folio case ""replaces"" the back battery of the case with its own back and then adds a flip style (book like) cover over the screen.The clear glass (glass-like?) opening in the front cover allows you to see notifications and incoming calls with the case closed.It is a great bargain compared to the Samsung branded case.  And (as far as I know) gives you everything that the Samsung case offers (though I haven't used that case, so I can't say for sure).Auto-sleep function:  Yes, this works and works well.  But no, it is not a magnetic closure that you might be used to with the iPad or the Kindle Fire HDX, etc.  The way the NOTE 3 ""knows"" to turn off the phone (when the case is closed) is with an app that uses the cell phone's proximity sensors to turn off the screen.  This does not, however, prevent a press of the power button to power things right back on.  And since it uses battery to keep those proximity sensors running, I decided just to press the power button after I close the case. This did the same thing without the added power draw.  :)Overall, if you want this type of case, I think you will be VERY HAPPY with this case. It is solidly made and does what it should well.  I was very tempted to give it 4 stars since this is true.  In short, it does what this type of case should do... at least for the most part.Negatives:The case offers very little protection from falls and other knocks and bumps.  Why?The back of the Case:The back of this case is merely a ""replacement"" back that takes the place of your current battery cover (good to know if your battery cover is cracked or damaged!).  However, think about this: THAT MEANS that this case is actually providing ZERO PROTECTION benefit on the back side.  No cushioning, no jar resistance, no bumber on the sides.  You take off your plastic back to your NOTE 3, then you snap on the new back to the Folio. Simple.  But no added protection is given. If it hits the ground, it is going to be just as bad as if your phone hits the ground with your current back battery cover on.  Not so good.  So, there is no protection there.Next, the sides are left completely exposed. This caused trouble for me almost immediately as I accidently rammed my phone into the side of a table. Ouch. No protection.Back side = 0Sides of case = 0Front of case.Truly, the front flap of this case is the ONLY protection you are getting with this case. The flap covers your Gorilla Glass 3 that your NOTE 3 comes with. OK, so the one place that you need the protection the least is best protected. But, since there is no way to keep that front flap closed, it is just as likely (if you drop it) that the front flap will fall open.  This would result in zero protection again, if so.  But, I must admit, it protects from things like KEYS in your pocket.  Still, a 1 cent Protective Film (or pricier ""Just Like GLass"" film protector) would do just as well to protect the front screen.  So, in short, you are not protecting your phone well with this ""case.""It is funny that I should complain about this because I always prefer the thinnest case... and this one is thin.  Still, I have to have SOME protection for this large and expensive Note 3 phone.While I still like thinner or lighter protection cases (I am not a huge fan of the otterbox-type of cases that are huge and highly protective), this case is so unprotective, that I can't recommend it more than 3 stars.  Your mileage may vary.What did I go with?  I with the Spigen Bounce case, thin, yet protective. The ultra slim model Spigen was just a tad less protective, though I was tempted.  The Bounce was also very economical at about ten.  If I wanted to spend more, I probably would have gone with the Spigen Slim Armor.If you combine one of these cases with a protective film over the Gorilla Glass (something some say is not necessary anymore) you will have an wonderfully protected phone and screen.  If you prefer a ""folio"" style case, then this iClover black folio case is a wonderful buy!","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13TYQ4YHGG36K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZHLG46#wasThisHelpful","R13TYQ4YHGG36K","A3MFF3HWX2TB60","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MFF3HWX2TB60?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reviewed by Ashiafor TheRomanceReviews.comPowerful and evocative, ARCHANGEL'S BLADE is Nalini Singh at her best. It's full of sex, gore and violence, but at its core, the story of Dmitri and Honor is a sweetly romantic story that would make any romance junkie swoon.When a dead vampire is found with a strange tattoo on his body, Honor, a hunter who is proficient in Ancient languages, is called in by the Tower to consult. And though she didn't want to be near vampires, due to a traumatic situation wherein she was kidnapped and tortured by vampires, Honor decided it was time to reclaim her life instead of cowering and hiding in fear. However, she didn't expect that it would be Dmitri who'd be leading on the case, as he was Raphael's second, Dmitri on whom she'd had a massive crush her whole life...Late to the series, and to Nalini Singh's books in general, I've been working through the Guild Hunter Series from Book 1, Angels' Blood. While Raphael's decision to die with his mortal was a poignant scene, nothing in the previous three books could compare with how Ms. Singh simply gutted me with the story of Dmitri's past, a past that he shares with his wife Ingrede and their children Caterina and Misha. I couldn't stop crying. No one should have to go through with what they had gone through, but as we know, such atrocities and more are still being committed these days. It is a testament to Ms. Singh's writing prowess that she could evoke such a reaction in her readers, that the scenes are arranged masterfully and in a way to elicit the most impact.Another scene that bears mention is the time when Dmitri saw the picture of the field of wildflowers that Honor had at her home...his reaction, what he did to her subsequently, and her response...Honor was broken apart totally and then she was put back together in a way that made her stronger. That was another powerful scene in a different way, what it did to both of them, but most especially to Honor.A unique, enchanting story that's a great addition to the series, ARCHANGEL'S BLADE gives us more of the amazing world Nalini Singh built from the perspective of someone other than Raphael and Elena, and it's really not to be missed. Newbies may start here, I suppose, as Ms. Singh gives enough background information plus it's about a new power couple. However, to get the full flavor of the series plus be privy to all the nuances, it's best to start from book 1, Angels' Blood. You won't regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH8NQRKCGKWC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052RHEUU#wasThisHelpful","RH8NQRKCGKWC8","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Deltafor TheRomanceReviews.comWhen I read the synopsis for this book, I rolled my eyes. Magic boots in Texas? Ehâ€¦but being a huge fan of Ms. Browning, I figured I'd give it a shot, and man, I'm so glad I did!Prophecy, TX wasn't the location that drifter Delaney Shields expected to find herself in, but she can't leave the country on her eighty-days-around-the-world tour without checking on Whit Maddox's health. She doesn't expect to see her ex Cal Maddox there with his dad, or for the jolt of anger and regret she sees in his eyes. With Whit's health dwindling, the Prophecy Boot Company finds itself without a bootmaker, and thus the town finds itself without tourist dollars. See, the PBC is known for its boots that bring the wearer good fortune and a bright future, and now that Whit is riddled with arthritis, he can no longer create the magic people waited months for and spent thousands on.But Whit has a plan: he knows who the next Prophecy bookmaker isâ€¦and she's just returned to town. Delaney absolutely can NOT stay in Texas! She's got big plans, a travel schedule to keep! But she also can't bear to leave the town high and dry by refusing Whit's pleas. And, if she's honest with herself, Prophecy is the closest thing to a home she's ever had, and Cal the closest thing to pure, unadulterated love she's ever experienced. Cal knows he has to convince Delaney to stick around, but how can you lasso the wind?A LOVE TO LAST is the first book in the the talented Ms. Browning's new series Prophecy of Love, and just like every book in her Texas Nights Series, this was fabulous! Delaney was like the wind, calm and settled one minute, restless and on the move the next. Cal wants stability, roots, a familyâ€¦the exact opposite of what the woman he's loved since he was a teenager wants. Together, the two couldn't be more different, but the chemistry between them ignites when they're together and I felt like I was holding my breath with each conversation they had. They couldn't be within 5 feet of one another without their mouths (and hands, and bodies) becoming intimately involved. Like fire and water, the two created such steam that it was almost palpable.The magic steeped in this book was well written and not only fun but also unique and something I truly enjoyed. The only thing I didn't like about A LOVE TO LAST was how petulant and juvenile Delaney acted most of the time. Her constant need to run got annoying after a point and she stopped being a character I empathized with and turned into one I wished would just leave already! Even so, the sweet passion between she and Cal was nicely done and well written, in fact, the entire book was that way.Bottom Line: A LOVE TO LAST was an interesting, unique and fun start to Ms. Browning's new series, and you can bet I'll be requesting future books the second they're available!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22IEOXAEGAYPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163PV8E2#wasThisHelpful","R22IEOXAEGAYPD","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Deltafor TheRomanceReviews.comThe SEVEN SINS anthology features short stories based on the seven deadly sins.Blaze for Me by Natalie Anderson (Envy)Pro ski phenom Nicoletta ""NV"" Valeri never meant to see the couple through the window, and now she can't help but compare their all consuming passion with herâ€¦dismal sex life. When Austin freaking Tate catches her peeping, Nicoletta is mortified! She's wanted the good doctor since she met him, and now that she's got his attention? She just wants to hide. Nicoletta almost ruined Austin's career a few years ago, but that doesn't stop him from wanting the woman with an all consuming need that almost cripples him.Blaze for Me is SCORCHING, their passion burning hot and bright enough to melt the ski slopes! For a short story, Ms. Anderson did a kick ass job making me care about the characters and their stories. I wanted to meet Nicoletta and be friends with her! I wanted to fall down and get bandaged up by Dr. McHottie. The sex was passionate and aggressive and soooo delish! I'm going to have to check out her Be For Me Series, as this one is fantastic! I would rate this story a 4.Glutton for Punishment by Amy Andrews (Gluttony)Mitch Callaghan is absolutely fine living in a Melrose Place-esque seniors community, especially if he gets to see the delicious Darcy Henderson in her one piece by the pool. The blonde granddaughter drives him to distraction, especially when she's drunk and wants to make out with him. When Darcy stumbles upon Mitch at a BDSM club, she uses the opportunity to beg him to spank her. Mitch isn't into the scene, but he'll gladly accommodate her pretty little ass anytime!Oooh, I LIKE this one! I don't typically care for books that are pretty much solely about a spanking fetish, but Glutton for Punishment is a great short story! I loved Mitch; his humor kept things lighthearted even while Darcy begged for something a bit darker from him. This story is excellent fun! I would rate this one a 4.Burned by Lust by Michele de Winton (Lust)Hade Corban is the reluctant soon-to-be leader of the Raising Hellfire biker gang, but he's anything but reluctant when he meets Lee Delevigne. The black magic woman wraps him in a spell of lace and lust just moments upon meeting her. Lee thinks Hade is just about the sexiest thing she's ever seenâ€¦and if she can use him to forget what her nasty stepfather did to her, it's a win-win. Neither expect the feels, but Cupid hits when you least expect it!I like his one too! Lee is excellent, a whole different kind of girl power than you typically see in erotic romance. She listed sex as her biggest vice, with drinking a close second. She wasn't ashamed of her very active bed, instead she embraced it and gave it her all. FANTASTIC! And the sex? Whew! Yes, please!! I'd rate this one a 5!Sleeping with the Enemy by Robin Covington (Wrath)As the first woman and youngest GM in MLB history, Kat Carter is at the top of her game. So is her longtime frenemy and one-time lover Derek Foxx, shortstop for a rival baseball team. She wants himâ€¦as her shortstop when his contract is up. Derek wants Kat for an entirely different reason, and he's tired of holding back. Derek isn't going to hold back any longer, and Kat can't help but go along with Derek's wild plans! But she doesn't want to fall for him again, especially since she wants him to sign with her team. What will they be willing to give up for love?I love the heat that is immediately generated between Kat and Derek. Their shared past and current competitiveness make their chemistry explosive! I love that Derek took the initiative and went after what he wanted. Kat is a badass! Playing with the big boys in the MLB had hardened her and made her feel like she had something to prove. I was disappointed by the number of editing errors in this short story, things that should've been easily spotted and corrected. Nevertheless, the story was sweet and steamy and I'd rate it a 3.Princess Sin by Avery Flynn (Sloth)When Cynthia Aston finds her boyfriend in bed with not one, not two, but THREE women, she should be pissed! But instead, all she feels is ambivalence, a problem that's plagued her through more relationships than she cares to admit. ""Princess Sin"" as Cyn is known, is lazy and slothful, at least that's the image she presents to the world, and her brother's BFF Hunter McKenney. But Hunter knows better. He knows she's much more than she presents to the world. And when she plays the stowaway on his yacht? She proves him right.Cyn and Hunter make a great couple! They're wild and horny and filled with lust for each other that Hunter has refused to act on, but once that ship has sailed, he immediately regrets their actions. This story was exceptionally short, but it was still super hot. I'd give this one a 5.Accidentally Sinful by Carmen Falcone (Pride)Tiffany Burrows is SO ready to unplug for a few days. Her life in NYC keeps her constantly busy, so decompressing in a Canadian cabin (with no wifi) sounds perfect. Especially when she's sure to have things on her mind other than her sinfully sexy stepbrother Santiago Cruz. Too bad said stepbrother is at said cabin when she arrives. Snowed in together, the stubborn, proud man drives her to distraction, she has no idea he's just as distracted by her. When Santiago gets mad enough to throw Tiffany over his knee for a spanking, their relationship will never be the same!Poor Tiffany! She's the recipient of a sour Santiago who takes every opportunity to be nasty to her. But he's kinda like the kid who pulls little girl's pigtails when he likes her, and if he gets too close, then he'll lose control. Despite their volatile relationship, the sparks between them light up the powerless cabin. I'm usually skeeved out by step-sibling story lines, but Accidentally Sinful was wickedly delicious. I would rate this a 4.How to Seduce a CEO by Talia Hunter (Greed)Angel Moore is determined to get the General Manager position at her company that she's come up with a foolproof plan: seduce CEO Marcus Bolton when he comes to interview her. At first, Marcus has a hard time keeping his tongue in his mouth when he sees Angel, but he knows that even though she may be the right person for the job, the board would never approve it. So Angel has to pull out the big guns, seducing Marcus right there in his office! Marcus can't believe he acted so rashly, but the more time he spends with Angel, getting to know her and hearing her plans for the business, the more he admires her and JUST MIGHT be willing to go to bat for her with the board.This is my least favorite story in this anthology for a few reasons, a big one being how obnoxiously demeaning it was to women. Angel usually gets what she wants, but when Marcus won't give it to her after she sleeps with him, she pouts and gets angry and surly. And Marcus? How does a man used to getting what HE wants, who considers himself an Alpha male, knowingly let another person manipulate him with sex and yet want to give her the world? That must be some stupendous sex. Honestly, this whole story just irritated me and made me want to throw my kindle. I'd rate it a 2.Bottom Line: Overall, SEVEN SINS is an excellent anthology with some well written and enjoyable stories that showcases the talent in the erotic romance world. It also introduced me to a few new-to-me authors that I'll be looking for in the future!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PRJAKK6QK6RI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OWZRY2#wasThisHelpful","R3PRJAKK6QK6RI","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by LiaLfor TheRomanceReviews.comShe serves a punishment for her failure to save a child. She has to save others in order to save herself and get redemption. She never wanted to hurt anyone but her love for Zach puts him in danger. It is better to keep her distance than to risk his life.This is the third story featuring Emma on her quest for redemption. Captured: A Fallen Siren Prequel explains how Emma and Zach first met and became partners at the FBI investigating crimes. Cursed: A Fallen Siren Novel is the first story featuring their partnership. I did not read them first but do recommend you to check them out if you have not already done so. I was able to pick up the storyline without too much issue but I would like to learn more about their history. I think it would increase my enjoyment of the story.Emma is a woman on a mission. She has to save others to make up for letting Persephone be kidnapped by Hades thousands of years ago. It is her curse and she never knows when it will be enough and she will go back to her old life and have her wings once again. She keeps things light and fun with the men in her life until Zach. Zach got into her heart and in order to save him, she had to take away his memories of their past. He is aware of some of their past now and is resentful of her choice.Zach is former military and is also trying to make up for his past. He wants to save lives and not take them. He is not someone that lets others in easily so Emma's rejection really hurts him. He wants to push her away but when a friend needs their help, he agrees to work with her again. They both want to save a young boy that has been kidnapped from the home of his wealthy father. The father has a past with Zach and trusts him with very private information about his involvement with a woman who operates a business catering to the kinks of her wealthy clients. He believes she has taken his son in retaliation.I enjoy the story much more when an author balances the romance and the suspense equally well. The romance and the kidnapping investigation move along at a steady pace and are well-developed storylines. It feels like the author took time to understand how a police investigation should go and added elements that give it a realistic feel. There is a good interaction with another local law enforcement officer that adds to the richness of the story.It is clear from the very beginning that Emma and Zach have strong feelings for one another. They have complicated pasts and a complicated personal relationship. Emma hoped they could retain their professional relationship but Zach feels like he can't trust his partner after she removed his memories of their time together and refuses to disclose all the information. Emma would love to be casually involved with him but he won't accept anything less than her full commitment. There is a real power struggle between them that keeps it interesting.The investigation forces them into very close company. One of my favorite parts was their infiltration of the private club. Working together brings them closer together and some of the resistance melts as they rely on one another to save this little boy's life. They have a great chemistry and the intensity burns high.The best way to describe this is as a case file in the relationship between Emma and Zach. It starts soon after he has found out about his memories being taken and he is still very bitter and angry. It does not keep him from working with Emma when that could lead to saving a young boy's life. They still have amazing chemistry and working together keeps it alive. If you are just starting the series, I think you will want to read the other stories and be eager for when the next book is released that continues their story. It is a great story of two people that belong together and are trying to find a way to make peace with their feelings.!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O3PBATQBDRU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010W1ZOB6#wasThisHelpful","R1O3PBATQBDRU2","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When he meets Leda, his normally regimented world is torn upside down.In WRECKED, author Corrine Silver pens an in-depth look into the BDSM lifestyle as Xander introduces the young medical student to a whole new way of playing doctor.Full of explosive heat, the author jumps right in, exploring some of the darker aspects of kink at the hands of skilled Doms and Dommes. Although there is a wide array of options introduced in the story, Xander and Leda take their time to find what works best for them.The struggle to determine whether they will be able to meet each other's needs was addressed well.

"Reviewed by Gabrielle Sallyfor TheRomanceReviews.comTHE HAND OF VENGEANCE by Renee Rose is the story of Good Samaritan doctor, Lara Simmons, who is kidnapped by rebel forces to help save their leader. The man who grabs her is known as the Hand of Vengeance and that he is.Mixed in with some entertaining off-world locales and non-humans is a traditional story of races of people who have been subjected to slavery and abject cruelty, all in the name of wealth; of a war that has gone on for far too long where peoples are treated as nothing more than a commodity to use and abuse. And much like here today, on earth, there are still good Samaritans out there willing to cross those borders to help those in need.However, this is most definitely an erotica story and the development of the relationship between Lara and Blade (aka Vengeance). Told from a mixed perspective (hers and his), we're given intimate details as to what they're thinking and their growing attraction to each other. *Warning, the initial ""punishment"" doled out by Blade comes quickly and well, they're all well done as are the oh so yummy sex scenes.If you enjoy off-world type stories with a great pair of leads, strong attraction, scintillating sex scenes and some delicious spanking, then look no further. You won't be disappointed. In fact, you'll want to read it again. And again.

"Reviewed by Ashiafor TheRomanceReviews.comWe're back once again to Lornai in THE CAPTAIN to continue the story of Eli/Ella and her prince.Kit had gotten better as a swordsman due to Eli's training, and he's able not only to defend himself, but to lead in the wars where people from other lands sought to kill him. His war with the dwarves was fascinating, and how he brokered peace surely is a sign of the great leader he is to become. Yet, the dwarves are but one in many who wanted to kill him. Would they succeed in bringing about his death? For his death would mean the fall of the walls, and his kingdom would be ripe for the taking. And what about his feelings for Ella? Would they finally stop denying what they feel?Here, we see highlights of momentous events that happen over the years where Kit is becoming a strong ruler/negotiator and excellent fighter/leader. There was also some growth and development in his relationship with Ella, though not as much as I'd wanted! I'd hoped for some resolution (though maybe there was some tacit understanding?), but it was not to be! Marius's actions struck me as odd, and I couldn't understand why he acted the way he did.That said, THE CAPTAIN is a good bridge book, as it continues to fan the flames of my intrigue as to how this fascinating story is to unravel. I am looking forward to the concluding book of this series.Review copy provided via Reading Alley in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T1JZYAUUG23Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014RK5V7U#wasThisHelpful","R2T1JZYAUUG23Q","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reviewed by Deltafor TheRomanceReviews.comBOUND & TEASED features two hot men, a flogger and a submissive willing to do their bidding.As a teenager, Katie Crane was terrified by the relationship that Ryland McKade and Jedidiah Malloy wanted from her. She fled, but now, eight years later, Katie is back and ready for what her men want from her. Ry and Jed have waited patiently for Katie to return home so they could finally claim her as theirs. Dominant Ry and switch Jed know in their hearts that their Katie is a submissive to her bones, and that once their mÃ©nage is complete, they'll never let her go. Katie seems unsurprised by the whips and chains and handcuffs that Ry and Jed show her, but will she be so accepting when she learns the two men are lovers? Or when the reasons she left them come back to haunt her?So, on the surface, BOUND & TEASED had everything I like in a book: an MMF mÃ©nage with delicious guy-on-guy lovin', some BDSM and a thread of suspense. I don't know what it was about this book, but something didn't do it for me. Maybe it was the fact that after not seeing each other for ten years, the three didn't have a nice long conversation about what went wrong, instead just jumping right into this weird BDSM relationship like a day never passed. Maybe it was that the three had no chemistry at all, or maybe it was that none of them were particularly likable characters. I just couldn't connect with any of them or empathize with their situations. Maybe it was that the men seemed to just like playing with as many toys as possible and having someone kneel for them more than any sort of real, lasting relationship. The sex seemed like something straight out of a ""how to"" manual instead of an erotic romance, and honestly, my switch was flipped to OFF anytime the three played. I found myself skimming the storyline instead of savoring it because it had zero depth (though plenty of gratuitous and graphic sex).And as it turns out, the thread of suspense was nothing more than a piece of lint on an ugly Christmas sweater. While it was technically written well and had only a few editing issues, there just wasn't anything about BOUND & TEASED that captivated me and made me invested.Bottom Line: I'm sure that some will find this a wildly erotic and fabulous read, but for me it fell totally flat.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CZLFKB401OBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01358LYQM#wasThisHelpful","R3CZLFKB401OBN","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Rachel's Willful Thoughtsfor TheRomanceReviews.comAs Bone Harder, Jason Bone has made a name for himself in the porn industry. When he meets Sydney Marshall, Jason has a chance for a fresh start.In PORN STAR, author Sam Crescent has written a solid story complete with plenty of spice. Because the main character is heavily involved in the adult entertainment world, the level of explicitness is balanced well with a credible storyline.Both Sydney and Jason are believable characters. The dilemma of how to deal with his profession provides a source of angst, especially as they grow closer together.It was interesting to watch Jason's character evolve. Since he is well known for his role, it's just a matter of time before he's recognized and Sydney learns the truth.As with any Sam Crescent story, the heat level is intense and raw.

"Reviewed by Deltafor TheRomanceReviews.comI can see how getting visited by your fiance's deceased mother might be a bit unnerving.Miss Amaryllis Gibson was only 9 when ""it"" happened, her first feeling. Tingles and darkness and fear making room for visions of dead people. But she couldn't have predicted that she'd be taken under the wing of Lady Wyburn, the stepmother of Paul Lindsey, Viscount Wyburn. Nor could she predict that a stolen kiss would end up with the two of them betrothed. Which is a problem, since she most definitely is being contacted by Paul's dead mother.Paul decided long ago that it's dangerous to fall in love, that it can only lead to heartache, but he finds himself strangely enchanted by the sensible and curious Rilla. There's something about her fiery hair and intelligence that calls to him. Can Paul continue to hold Rilla at arms' length, or will her unconventional ways drive him to commit her to Bedlam?NO CONVENTIONAL MISS was a different historical romance than I'm used to, combining a bit of the paranormal with the usual propriety of the early 1800's English ton. I enjoyed the change of pace, the element of dark suspense next to the sensual developments of Paul and Rilla's relationship. Rilla's visions and second sight were a fun addition, however Paul's hesitance to marry was typical of most historical romance books I've read. The pair had decent chemistry, nothing out of this world, but still a simmering attraction nonetheless. I was disappointed in the non-existent sex scenes. Just as Ms. Webster started to heat things up, she fast forwarded to the awkward morning after, even skipping the requisite post-coital glow. That was a real bummer, since NO CONVENTIONAL MISS didn't have that excitement factor that some sweet sweet lovin' would've given it. Though it wasn't a bad read, and in fact was well written and edited, I don't think another book in this series would be my personal spot o' tea.Bottom Line: This is a great book for those who like a chaste romance with a light paranormal element.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HTF06ZLPWK4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WASNLC4#wasThisHelpful","R3HTF06ZLPWK4G","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reviewed by Breannfor TheRomanceReviews.comOMGGGG. Please, someone tell me when the next book comes out. I so need to know what happens next with Nox and his gang.First, this series really needs to be read in order. But seriously, you won't regret it. It's amazing.WHO KNOWS THE DARK started right where the first book left off. Nox and his son, Sam, escaped New York, along with Cade, Mason, Rachel, and Damian. They were headed to South Carolina to stay with Cade's family farm to try and hide from the mess they found themselves in.Even though they escaped the drug lords and police that were after them, all is not well. Sam was seriously injured, Nox had some major trust issues with... everybody, and they really had no idea what they're going to do once they reach the farm. Will they be safe? Will they only bring the danger to Cade's family? Can anyone they brought along be trusted?There are so many secrets and questions, twists and turns, all mixed in with emotions running on high. Things got much more serious between Cade and Nox. They started to realize that there's more to what's between them than just sex. No matter how hot and raw their sex was, they started to rely on each other in ways they weren't ready for. They didn't like it, not one bit. I can only hope for more progress in the relationship department in the next book. Maybe even those three little words? A girl can dream. I seriously love these guys. Even when they're being stubborn fools.All that emotional stuff, and Nox also had to deal with his past and the lies he's told. Things caught up to him and now he's gotta face the music and his son. It was heartbreaking, to say the least.I really loved it all. The action, the secrets, the romance, the awesome cast of characters. Not to mention the sweet and adorable secondary romance between Mason and Sam. Gah! I just want to squish them.Tere Michaels really hit it out of the park with this one. Like I said, start with the first book and then get ready for a crazy ride.So... about book 3?

"Reviewed by Deltafor TheRomanceReviews.comFive amazing, belly laughing, gut checking stars for this brilliant read by the very talented Ms. Todd.Trust fund baby Seth Hamilton has been partying and whoring his way around Europe for the past 2 years on daddy's dime, but when said daddy calls the morning after a particularly spectacular threesome, it's time to return home to Vegas and pay the piper. After meeting his brother's girlfriend, who helps him get a job managing a hotel club, Seth can't help but smile. Vegas women flock to him just as easily as Ibiza women did, his natural setting solidly on flirt 24 hours a day. Until he meets nurse Cassidy Reynolds and is promptly dismissed, repeatedly, leaving no room for discussion. But Seth is nothing if not stubborn and persistent, used to getting what he wants, especially when it comes to women. Cassidy finally agrees to give him a shot to show her the real him, and Seth knows that his life will never be the same again.I can't believe I've not heard of this Beautiful Sinners Series, as this was a wickedly funny read that had me literally LOL'ing one minute and almost in tears the next. The story is told from Seth's POV, and he is an excellent character. Cocky and sure and confident and a true manwhore, he loves all types of women (as often as possible). In Cassidy, he finds a woman who doesn't only middle finger all of his advances, but who also makes him want to become a creepy stalker.Ohmygawd their chemistry is OOC, off the charts, the chain, the railsâ€¦pick your preference. I adored watching Seth stumble around like a socially awkward tween whenever she was within his orbit (and even when she wasn't). I usually don't completely dig the whole complete and utter manwhore vibe from my MC's, but Seth was so funny and silly and sweet and self-deprecating that I couldn't help but adore his every move. He and Cassidy's relationship was simply gorgeous. When they made love, it felt magical, when they were fighting I felt like my bff's were getting divorced. It's a rare read that gets me so worked up, but SECRETS, LIES AND IMPERFECTIONS had me glued to the kindle and refusing to even take a break till every last word was digested. This is definitely one of my favorite reads of 2015.Bottom Line: This is a must read for any fans of romance. There's no whips or ropes or safe words, no wild chandelier swinging monkey sex, no covert ops dudes rescuing a chick in over her head, it's just a story about a girl who makes a boy want to be a better man. Absolutely flawless, Ms. Todd. I'll be picking up the first in this series ASAP.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VA4IUHDGT2PO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01671KEMY#wasThisHelpful","R1VA4IUHDGT2PO","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Debra Taylorfor TheRomanceReviews.comVIKING WARRIOR RISING is a super fantastic novel that had me wanting more!This novel had the perfect blend of ancient Viking that was crossed with modern black ops super soldier scenario. Leif is a king, and the leader of a badarse band of immortal warriors. They've been here on Earth for a hundred years, sent by the Gods, Odin and Freya, to save the world by thwarting Loki and his minions. Leif meets up with Naya when she saves him. She was a fierce match for the mighty Viking warrior, and as it turns out she is his true mate, so they had some strong chemistry going on. The plot had more than one twist though, and that caused big problems.This book kicks off an ingenious new series that is steeped in Norse mythology. The dynamic stands out since it is different from from any series out there. The world building is complex, with plenty of mystery and kick arse action. It had passion, chemistry, and engaging banter. These alpha heroes/heroines are on a mission to save the world, but they are flawed enough to be believable. The writing is solid, vivid, and fast paced perfection.I enjoyed this novel immensely. This first one snagged my attention, and now I can't wait for the next one. It's Five Flying Stars for VIKING WARRIOR RISING!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WI3292LS7L2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQC2OO8#wasThisHelpful","R1WI3292LS7L2A","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Deltafor TheRomanceReviews.comYoung and old team up in this tale of murder, intrigue and gossip in a retirement community.The Hibiscus Pointe retirement community in Milano, FL is a far cry from Summer Smythe's LA roots, but she finds herself living in her deceased grandmother's condo anyway, with a new job working for cardiologist Anthony Amoretto. When he drops dead on day one, Summer is suspect nÃºmero uno. Hibiscus Pointe senior Dorothy Westin was on the scene and just knows Summer isn't Dr. A's killer. The two team up to find out who would off the very popular doc, but get more than they bargained for when suspects just keep popping up, giving them more questions than answers.CARDIAC ARREST is the first book in The Ladies Smythe and Westin Series and was a cute who-dun-it novel appropriate for any age. The character development was fun, Summer's slightly ditzy yet tenacious persona meshing well with Dorothy's more subdued yet spirited attitude. I expected some romance in CARDIAC ARREST (as I'm writing this review for The Romance Reviews), but the only sweet sweet lovin' in this book was generically implied by the dead doc's many lovers. I had hoped for some sort of connection between Summer and Detective Donovan, and perhaps that's the goal in future The Ladies Smythe and Westin books, but in this one the two barely spoke. This cozy mystery wasn't a bad way to spend a Sunday afternoon, though I don't know that I'll be first in line for future books in this series, as I like a little more spice in my reads.Bottom Line: Cute and cozy 110% vanilla mystery, appropriate for your teenage daughter and your grandma.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QYBR4XGIO4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPPGIXI#wasThisHelpful","R1QYBR4XGIO4P","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Deltafor TheRomanceReviews.comBooks about spousal abuse are tough to review, as nobody wants to say anything negative about a book that deals with such an important subject, but unfortunately for LOVE SOMEBODY LIKE YOU, there was little else going for it other than shedding light on this issue.Life hasn't exactly been easy for Sally Ryland, owner of Ryland Riding. Barely scraping by after the death of her cruel and abusive husband 3 years ago, the only thing Sally is certain of these days is that she'll never trust another man. When her old friend, rodeo cowboy Ben Traynor, shows up with a broken arm and a smile, Sally's first instinct is to make him go. But Ben senses something has happened to make Sally scared of men, and he wants nothing more than to help her heal. He has no clue that it was her seemingly adoring husband who broke her, but he's determined to break through her walls...and if he gets closer to her, well then all the better! It'll take slow hands and soft words to prove to Sally that what she went through wasn't her fault, but Ben's going back on the rodeo circuit soon. Will all of his progress be for nothing after he leaves town?I have varying feelings on LOVE SOMEBODY LIKE YOU. This story is about a woman who was deeply physically and mentally abused for years, who was cut off from friends, family and even neighbors in a possessive, obsessive attempt to control her. She has no clue how to interact with people, including her own assistant. Along comes Ben, who slowly (VERY VERY SLOWLY) pushes her out of her comfort zone and gets her to interact with people.The story itself went at a snail's pace as Sally's progress could be measured in centimeters instead of inches. And I have zero doubt that abused women have (justifiable) serious issues with themselves and others, but for this fiction book, Sally's issues just. didn't. end. I liked her progress from scared mouse to slightly normal woman, I appreciated Ben's patience and willingness to help her heal, but MAN, this story just drags on and on and on.Added to the dull factor is that the chemistry was barely a spark and the sex was only slightly sensual, so there wasn't even anything exciting to look forward to there. While technically well written, this overdone and dry novel just didn't do anything for me, though I'm sure that fans of the Caribou Crossing Series will love it.Bottom Line: For lovers of sensual, sweet stories, this may be a real winner for you, but if you like any sort of excitement and passion in your romance reads, you may want to skip this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AAU0HG0SF03O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RRT317G#wasThisHelpful","R1AAU0HG0SF03O","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reviewed by Rachel's Willful Thoughtsfor TheRomanceReviews.comErin Covington has the distinction of being the only one to deny Foster Wagner. Years have passed, but maybe it's time to see if things have changed.Author Devon Hart delivers a tantalizing read in TEMPTED BY PLEASURE. With Erin facing an arranged marriage, a visit to Lazarus, a BDSM social club, just might be what she needs. Little does she know that Foster is the one pulling the strings.Packed with plenty of surprises, this is a sizzling story that involves a cliffhanger. The chemistry between Erin and Foster is evident, but a relationship needs to be built on a solid foundation rather than deception.The idea of a virgin in a BDSM club is a bit far-fetched, but the author sets it up well. There's plenty of kinkiness in Club Lazarus, including m/f/m action and f/f.With an arranged marriage looming on the horizon, the clock is ticking for Erin to either take a detour or be stuck forever.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UREDW4VRMEJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y1R4O6Y#wasThisHelpful","R3UREDW4VRMEJ8","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Ashiafor TheRomanceReviews.comARCHANGEL'S CONSORT continues where Archangel's Kiss left off, about 3 to 4 months after the stunning fight that left Beijing a crater.Here, we see Elena and Raphael continue to develop and build the foundation of their relationship. Raphael still continues to push at boundaries, but Elena more than held her ground on those things that she felt are very important to her. Aside from that, however, they have to deal with the effects of Raphael's mother possibly rising from her Sleep, and the effects are felt worldwide--weather disturbances, earthquakes, tsunami, vampires running rampant, and Raphael in the grip of a rage that Elena had never seen before and that left her terrified and fighting for her Archangel.Reading the first three books of this series back-to-back, some of the words and phrases used are starting to get repetitive, especially with regard to Elena and Raphael's relationship. Elena is always referred to by Raphael as his immortal/consort/Elena with the mortal heart, and it's starting to get sickening. I come to dread their sexy scenes as well, and there are many here, because well, what's new? The sex seems to be how Elena soothes Raphael back from when he goes into his cold Archangel persona, or how Raphael soothes Elena when she has a nightmare or confronted with hard truths she cannot/don't want to deal with yet. There are also two different instances where Raphael had two different things for Elena, and each time, Elena said that if she hadn't given her heart to her archangel, she'd have given it to him right then and there. (The first instance happened in Archangel's Kiss and the second happened in this book.)The only treat for me in this book is I get to see Elena spar with Raphael. And of course, we get hints that Elena is not as she seems, that there's some mystery to her bloodline. Elena is also a bit insecure, which makes her human (well, she was a mortal in book #1) and relatable.While I'd love to know more about Elena's identity (background) and certainly more of Raphael and Elena in the future, I think I'm ready for a break from them. Good thing too, because it's Dmitri's story next!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF9OGGBLHHEAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FPYZNO#wasThisHelpful","RF9OGGBLHHEAM","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by BookAddictfor TheRomanceReviews.comWhen a family member dies, sometimes secrets come out that may surprise family members. Vanessa is brokenhearted over the death of her brother, Tony. The two of them have been together for a while. They are not just brother and sister, but best friends. They share everything together. So it comes as a surprise to find out her brother had a secret life with a full set of other friends. When it comes to light the common thread is a kinky lifestyle, Vanessa is intrigued. With Tony gone, Vanessa feels all alone until his other friends adopt her.This is what makes the series so good. This sense of family and bonding through mutual respect and enjoyment of kinky sex is a hard to come by commodity. This insta-family to help Vanessa grieve is a pleasure to read about. It's also nice to see how the ""kinky"" family doesn't take over the vanilla side of Vanessa's remaining family. Tilly and the clan are able to keep it on the down low yet still make sure those who knew Tony in the lifestyle can also provide their condolences.Vanessa also experiences a birth through this death. She learns that she is even more similar to her brother than she thought. In addition, she meets the two men who were thinking of taking the next step with him. Reed and Lyle were going to invite Tony into their relationship as a third. As they support Vanessa through her loss, she grows closer to them. I have to say, this is an odd but plausible situation Ms. Dalton creates. In some sense it is disturbing that Reed and Lyle could have been introduced to Vanessa as her brother's boyfriends. Now, they are her boyfriends.The BDSM in this story is a pleasurable experience as expected with Ms. Dalton. It's nice to see the introduction of a newbie into the lifestyle. Ms. Dalton excels at showing how all types of people can join the lifestyle from different ways. The destination is the same no matter the road they take--they find their way home to where they feel accepted. This story of loss balanced by new beginnings is recommended to menage lovers who enjoy kink.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWRJE62ZG8A99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125JNWYO#wasThisHelpful","RWRJE62ZG8A99","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by KindleRomancefor TheRomanceReviews.comCan an aging porn star and a young college student find enough common ground for a relationship?Tommy Newsome is living at college and finally accepting that he's gay. Growing up in a very conservative and religious home made this an extremely difficult decision. Fortunately, Tommy has an amazing roommate, Ben, who is helping him learn to enjoy his freedom. Mike Scott is reaching the end of his career as a porn star, and with all of the changes in the industry, he's starting to think it might not be a bad thing. He also works as a bartender which is how he and Tommy first meet.At first, Mike is convinced that Tommy is way too young for him. However, Tommy doesn't see the 20-plus year difference as anything to even consider. I think this is the biggest reason why I believed in their relationship from the beginning. Although Tommy was naive in some ways, he was also very smart. He knew what he wanted, and he wasn't afraid, in his own patient way, to go after Mike. I really enjoyed watching Tommy and Mike spend time together. They were both interesting people and the relationship was developed nicely. It was hard, though, watching Mike having sex with other people while making porn movies since he hadn't told Tommy about his other job. I liked how the author resolved this major issue.I enjoyed seeing Tommy grow and mature by making serious decisions for himself, while Mike became less selfish. Watching Tommy come out to his family and face rejection was heart-breaking. Fortunately, Tommy had Mike, Ben, and Ben's family.

It's not until they both end up at Rawhide, a BDSM club, that they realize they have very specialized interests in common.From that point, the chemistry becomes incredibly intense as the two explore the more advanced practices of the lifestyle. Rather than the typical activities featured in similar books, the author shed light on the use of the violet wand and rope play.

It wasn't until later on that George found out that Alex wasn't just another guy, but a Prince of Netherlands.This makes their second meeting a little more interesting. The spark is definitely still there and it's more than for just another one night together. They decide to try out the whole dating thing on for size.Turns out, they were awesome together. A little too awesome. So awesome, that they were a bit boring, really. This story is very low angst, which I like, but nothing much really happened.There was the typical Big Misunderstanding, but that didn't really make things any more exciting for me. George had a lot to deal with in regards to the paparazzi, which he was not used to, but he really handled it all in stride. He was a very likable character, as was Alex. Both guys were normal, nice characters; even if Alex was a prince. They were a pleasure to read about and easy to relate to.I'd say MY PRINCE is another enjoyable read from Anna Martin.

But then there's this thing with her alarm and an elevator and a tampon and a handsome stranger and suddenly her dream job is more of a pipe dream as the clock keeps right on ticking. Of COURSE, the damn handsome stranger would be hockey star Beckett Riley, captain of the Chicago Buffaloes. And WOAH, is he one sexy man!! One deliciously sexy man who comes to her rescue.When Aubrey meets Beckett again after her new company lands his social media account, shy and sweet Beckett immediately requests her and only her. The two are soon inseparable, spending every moment side by side, getting to know one another and developing something deeper than either thought possible. Can their new relationship survive old insecurities?THE AUBREY RULES is the first book in the Chicago on Ice Series and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was! I've learned that sports books can go either wayâ€¦either the puns and storyline are ridiculously cheesy, or it's so delicious that it makes me desperate to go find my own own big sweaty playa. Fortunately, THE AUBREY RULES was well written and terrifically funny, with chemistry that scorched my kindle (even if the sex was only alluded to instead of detailed). This sweet story was told from Aubrey's POV, and she details how she breaks every single one of her dating rules when it comes to the sexy hockey player. He's only a player on the ice though. Off the ice, Beckett is insecure about his nerdiness and fears that Aubrey will figure out that she only wants his reputation and not the man underneath. Audrey's concerned that Beckett will figure out that he's superhot and that he could have anyone he wants. I thought this was a lovely little sweetly sensual read that fans of non-graphic, funny chick-lit stories will adore.Bottom Line: If nothing else, you must read THE AUBREY RULES for their fabulous take on the classic Breakfast at Tiffany's movie!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22IURZ6UN474L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0143J3AXW#wasThisHelpful","R22IURZ6UN474L","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He always had a bit of a thing for the mouthy sprite, but she was that one person who couldn't care less what he looked like or how popular he was. Holly uses sarcasm and vitriol as her crutch when s*** gets real, and what's realer than searching for a bipolar sister who's been missing for several days. Her search leads her to Josh, and in addition to the verbal spars they throw at each other, they're also throwing enough sparks to start a house fire. But when the entire whacked out Partridge family descends on Willow Park, Josh and Holly's flames may be doused.NOBODY'S FOOL is book 2 in the Willow Park Series and it's a doozy!! I haven't yet read the first, but you can bet I will after this gem. It's a little sweet, a little sad, a little sexy, and all wrapped up in a cloak of dysfunctional family matters that captivated me. I loved the humor in Josh and Holly's back and forth banter. Neither of them needed to still be bitter at 30 years old, but they both held onto it like a security blanket. When Josh realizes his feelings for Holly could be MORE, I loved how he pursued her (even though she insisted he not do so). My heart broke for the situation they found themselves in with Holly's sister Portia. Her bipolar disorder was such a sad thing to watch unfold, and it's not something that crosses your mind if you don't know somebody with that illness. As effed up as this might sound, I love when authors bring an element or illness into a story that I am not familiar with, as it turns into a research exposition to learn as much as I can about the issues.Bottom Line: Though not the sexiest book out there, NOBODY'S FOOL was gritty and raw and powerful nonetheless.

Full disclosure, I read it as a standalone and I'm sure my experience is not as good as it would have been if I had read the first two books.Ms. McBride does a good job of recapping some of the events from the previous books so there isn't too much confusion. This world is torn apart as it appears the angels have been corrupted. Whilst trying to battle this corruption, Anahita suffered. The tragic loss she experiences is more than she can bear. Fortunately for her, in this one it seems she will finally be reunited with her lovers.The lovers in this story are a tangled knot. One would think it could all go wrong as Anahita loves Rion who loves Reux who needs Anahita. Talk about a love triangle. Fortunately, this menage is a sexy triad and it works well. Each of the characters in this story are admirable and easy to fall in love with. What is confusing at times is how each character goes by more than one name. It could be two or three when nicknames are included. Fortunately, they are different enough that it is easy to distinguish between them.The sex in this story is heavenly. The m/m and the m/f are all delicious. Ms. McBride does a lovely job of bringing all three together into a relationship that works for them. The ending of this story leaves it open for another story.

This paranormal romance is recommended for menage lovers who have a thing for fae and angels.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT9AO74KSOHIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WG77RU#wasThisHelpful","RT9AO74KSOHIV","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by BookAddictfor TheRomanceReviews.comDerrick and Marcia love their little community of friends. If only they had a place to call their own. In OPEN DOORS, Ms. Dalton shows what it takes to open a BDSM club. Many books have high end clubs for the rich and privileged. I'm not saying that these don't exist. They just happen to be far fewer than it appears in BDSM glitterkink books. Personally, I have been at the start of when a community of kinksters tried to open their own club in a building. Due to several variables and one of them a zoning issue, the club was closed down. So when I read about how Derrick and Marcia open up a club and how it starts out, I'm impressed.Ms. Dalton does a great job of showing how a club grows organically through contributions from the entire community. As the community grows, more people help out through service or donations of furniture. Seeing a place grow from ground up is a special experience. The frustrations and heads are worth it.I loved the accuracy of the book. I loved how there are men with great plans and forget about the details. Showing how a dominant husband's relationship works with a business savvy submissive wife is a great representation of how D/s dynamics can work in real life. Learning about how the Suncoast Society started is a treat. What is even nicer is seeing how well Ms. Dalton captures reality and transforms it into an erotic education. This story is highly recommended to BDSM readers who want to learn what it takes to create a safe haven for kinksters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TC90SXFM3IFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141GSZ6Y#wasThisHelpful","R1TC90SXFM3IFE","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reviewed by Breannfor TheRomanceReviews.comFirst off, I am a huge Marie Sexton fan. I especially love her Coda books. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this book didn't quite hit the mark.Lamar was visiting his family in Coda as a teenager when he met Dominic. They share some steamy kisses and one night together until Lamar had to return home.Years later, Lamar moved to Coda to get away from his horrible ex-boyfriend. The last person he expected to run into was Dominic. When they saw each other, all those feelings came rushing back to them both.I really enjoyed the beginning of their relationship. They hung out together, shared hobbies and just had a good time being friends. Of course, they had a current of sexual tension running between them, but that only made things yummier.Once things started to get more serious between the two, that's when the story lost me. Dominic refused to be with Lamar because he was terrified of his daughter and family finding out. I understood his reasons and I think they're valid, but did he have to treat Lamar so harshly for it? His wishy-washy-ness got on my nerves and I was done with him by the end. I did love how Lamar handled him. He was understanding, but didn't let Dominic walk all over him. He stood his ground and had some serious self-discovery amongst all of Dominic's angst fests.Lamar suffered from depression and I really felt for him in the beginning of the story. I think the author did a great job of depicting his disorder. But then it kind of went away and was never mentioned again. There was no real resolution to this and it left me with some unanswered questions.All in all, this is probably my least favorite in the series. But I adore the entire cast of characters so much that if there are more Coda books to come, you can bet I'll be picking one up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17RSAX86RTP9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XZ8HS4K#wasThisHelpful","R17RSAX86RTP9F","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Ashiafor TheRomanceReviews.comA COMPANION TO WOLVES is definitely for-adults-only fantasy, as it contains lots of violence and gore and sex.In this fantasy world, trolls make trouble for the men who lived in the North. Hence, they have wolves and men bonded to them (called wolfcarls) who fight the trolls and keep peace in their respective territories. In exchange to keeping them safe, the keep has a duty to the wolfheall (where the wolfcarls live) in terms of a tithe, which include food, etc, and most especially boys, during a time when a female wolf is about to give birth. They need the boys in order for the pups to bond with.When the story begins, Vigdis (the female wolf) and her brother Hrolleif (the wolfcarl) visited the keep to ask for tithe-boys, as Vigdis was about to give birth. The jarl's heir, Njall, couldn't contain his curiosity (even after his father told him to hide) and he was compelled by something in Vigdis's eyes to come forward. When given the choice, he chose to go to wolfheall, for his honor, as the keep has a duty to the wolfheall, which his father is trying shirk, as he couldn't bear for his son to be a wolfcarl. Not only because he's the heir, but because of the stories and rumors of ""unnaturalness"" about the goings-on at the wolfheall that is circulating among the wolfless men. Njall (later named Isolfr) would go on to bond with the konigenwolf Viradechtis (alpha female wolf). And when Viradechtis's nature would demand something that's different from Isolfr's, would he regret his choice? Would he decide to leave and go back to his father?But then, the trolls are leaving their homes and going south in great numbers, a circumstance unheard of, wreaking great havoc along the way and leaving villages and wolfhealls in ruins. Even if all the wolfhealls band together, they might not be enough to stop the trolls...Being a romance junkie, I require romance in all my fiction reading. However, after finishing A COMPANION TO WOLVES, I was surprised to realize there's no romance, and yet the story captivated me. If there's a romance, I'd have to say it's between Isolfr and his wolf, Viradechtis. I find Isolfr to demonstrate growth in character over the course of the story, if in nothing else, then in the use of the words ""She's [meaning Viradechtis] worth it."" He first spoke the words when he was a lad, when he had merely an idea of what he would have to go through as her bond-brother. When he experienced the reality of the open mating, the words are harder to speak; or, it could be said that those words held a more profound meaning, weighted down as it were with his experiences and the knowledge that he would willingly go through them again, for Viradechtis.This book is also heavy on testosterone. There's hardly a main female character, not counting the wolves. And because Isolfr is heterosexual and wolfcarls don't marry, hence, he has lovers among the thrall-women and in the village, though none feature prominently as to be a permanent fixture in his life.Another controversial scene I want to highlight, also as a warning to those who should not read it if it's a trigger for you, is the open mating scene. There are two, but I'll tackle the one where Isolfr is the one undergoing it. In an open mating, the female wolf in heat could be mated with several wolves, and this is mirrored by their brothers. Because the men and their wolves are so closely bonded, when the female wolf is in heat, the male wolves are affected as well (knowing they're the potential mates), and the men will also feel what their wolves are feeling. Hence, for Isolfr, who's heterosexual, having several men top him, especially when some of the men weren't kind, is unbearable. Reading about a character who has multiple sexual partners is not new to me, but in such cases, the character is willing. In this book, it was hard to read that scene, especially when you read that Isolfr wanted it to be over soon. While it was natural for Viradechtis to mate with several wolves, for Isolfr, it was like and it read like gang rape.And while I was uncomfortable reading it, it did open my eyes to see how victims of rape must have felt during and after the violation.The open mating concept is not new to me; I first read of it in Anne McCaffrey's Pern Series. In her books, the concept is that the strongest male dragon gets to capture and mate with the queen dragon, thus ensuring a strong bloodline. So, while there's the open mating concept, there's only a one-to-one mating pair.Anyway, there's lots of violence in this book as well, in the fight against the trolls and wyverns. The authors didn't spare their characters; anyone could die. Well, maybe not Isolfr though. There's some humor too, to serve as counterpoint to all those violence, and I like how the authors make the wolves sometimes seem almost human, with certain human foibles.Overall, the authors presented an original and different story from those in the genre. Certainly well worth a read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HD8TVMWX1RWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005H0O88S#wasThisHelpful","R2HD8TVMWX1RWV","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Ashiafor TheRomanceReviews.comYou know it's a good book if you can't stop reading. Seriously, I keep telling myself just one more chapter because I need to work and before I know it, I'm in Chapter Eight, 1/3 of the way through the book! It's that addictive and compelling.Charlie has prepared for all her life to work in Anthony Global Systems (AGS), and just when her chance arrives, she has to prove she's the perfect candidate for the job by demonstrating that her Love Program worked--on herself. Love Program is a program that searches for perfect matches of couples, in whatever stage they happen to be in at that moment, based on their internet footprints and social media. And the challenge is that she has to make Daniel, her one-time best buddy turned enemy, into her boyfriend...Charlie is a true-blue bona-fide geek; you can see it in the words she used and in the activities she and her friends get up to in their free time. I love stories with geeky heroes/heroines, and maybe one of the reasons is because there are so few of them in the market. And what there are in the market are not quite believable geeks. Well, Charlie is a geek through and through, and she and her friends uses geek terms with ease as only geeks do. Very genuine, a believable geek heroine!Daniel is not quite as geeky, and he's stuck in a job he didn't want because after a career suicide, it was the only thing he could get. Yet, he didn't let it get him down; instead, he continued to investigate passive online matchmaking, because he still has ideals and he wants to do his bit to protect the men who have or about to be victimized.The story is well-written and a bit predictable, but what threw me for a loop was the revelation about AGS. That was unexpected. The scenes, especially from Charlie's point of view, are compelling and page-turning.I was a bit unsatisfied with the romance though. Okay, the thing is, they were best friends before so they already know quite a bit about each other. I like that the past was brought into the present, that Daniel thought he knew all there is to know about Charlie and vice-versa...but people change after so many years, and not just the physical aspect, especially when they were kids when they last were friends. Perhaps I missed it in my rush to get to the finish line, but I wish we could've seen how they explored the new things about each other (not just physical), and how they got to know each other all over again. Maybe the Star Trek trivia game could be shortened to give more page time to this much-needed discovery.That aside, LOST IN GEEKLANDIA is a wonderful romance that would delight all geeks and romance lovers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13UAW6OGJLBHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PD14XO#wasThisHelpful","R13UAW6OGJLBHQ","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Nadene Rfor TheRomanceReviews.comI am a huge fan of romantic suspense. As such I am always looking out for books in this genre and this one was definitely a good choice. I enjoyed this story immensely. It was addictive, suspenseful, intense, original and difficult to put down. Once you begin reading, you will find it difficult to stop until you have completed the story.LETTING EVIL IN follows the life of Kristi, a married woman who is doing everything in her power to save her marriage. However, her husband, Michael, has other ideas. He was more interested in living a life that was separate and apart from his family. His interest was so great that he decided on a whim to travel to Rio De Janeiro to meet a Brazilian girl he had met in a chat room. While in Brazil he got caught up in some nefarious activities and had ceased communicating with his wife. Kristi, believing that her husband was missing, decided to travel to Rio to search for him. While there, she found herself embroiled in the world of the drug cartel.This story featured strong female characters. Kristi was a fascinating and refreshing heroine. She showed strength, bravery and selflessness under the most harrowing of situations. Her actions revealed the lengths that a mother would go through to protect her child. Nara, the young woman that Michael went to meet, dreamt of a better life. It was her desire to become rich no matter the price. Like Kristi she was a fighter and a survivor. It could be said that Nara was selfish and greedy, but if we look deeper, one could see that she was more of a victim of her circumstances.LETTING EVIL IN is a story that will keep you on your toes and have you guessing at every page turn. It causes you to question just about every event. As the title suggested this story had some dark elements, but it will not creep you out. You may be tempted to skim the pages just to have a clue as to what's coming next, but this is the kind of story that is best if you uncover all the mysteries as you go along.I loved the author's style of writing. She created an air of mystery and suspense that was perfect for the story. The main focus of the story was on the thrilling events and situations that the characters found themselves in. The romantic elements, though minimal were hot, intense and steamy.LETTING EVIL IN is mysterious, suspenseful and riveting. If you love stories that are suspenseful, action-packed and enthralling, then give this one a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YXSELJ6PTBNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRFVP2G#wasThisHelpful","R1YXSELJ6PTBNG","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by BookAddictfor TheRomanceReviews.comFinding a job in post Tommy Twister world is not easy. When Liane finds her dream job working for powerful Emmett Radcliffe, she is over the moon. She starts her job thinking she must be designing only to find out it's her coding skills which Emmett wants most. Or is it? Emmett quickly also expresses his sexual desires for Liane. Will Liane be able to mix business with pleasure? Why not? Life could end tomorrow.Ms. Tate kicks the sex up a notch in the second book in the Weathermen Series. The sexual tension between Liane and Emmett is spiced up with their mutual enjoyment of kink. For those who enjoy a little bit of kinky bedroom play, this story will work for you. The sex scenes are a nice break between the race to figure out the people behind The Madeline Project. Honestly, I read this series not for the sex but for the storyline.The plot in this story is moved forward just a tiny bit. With four good friends working together, a reader would expect the plot to move a bit faster. Because, isn't this about halfway through? There are only two books left to determine who is causing these terrible problems Earthside and why.What I like about this story is how the underground world is built out. Ms. Tate does a decent job of creating a speculative world if humans are to live beneath the surface. The little descriptions of how air flows and simulated light all add to this world and make it come alive. This world is not perfect as crime can still be an issue. This makes life in the story familiar and easy to visualize.This second book in the series keeps my interest and makes me want to read the next book immediately.

"Reviewed by Gabrielle Sallyfor TheRomanceReviews.comI had so much fun reading THE DOM DELIVERS by Nese Lane. The female lead, Jenna Jaynes, is absolutely marvelous in all trips, plops and absolute refreshing honesty. And Jenna's assistant, Cedric, hmmm, I can't really decide if he's Bette Midler to Jenna's Lily Tomlin or more of a Rory to her Lorelai (Gilmore Girls). Either way, it works and works well. Their interactions were the highlight of the story for me. Well, one of them, at least. Enter one seriously hunky (yes, I used that word) Ayden Kelley and sparks begin to fly.What works with the story: the characters' dynamics. Their interactions are great fun, the internal dialogue works well (really well), as does the actual dialogue. The sex scenes are downright scintillating, as are the fantasies. The BDSM and the introduction of Jenna to CeeCee's and Ayden's world works well (avoiding spoilers). Of note: There's a fairly heavy BDSM scene at the end of the story, but only one and it's well-crafted. And for me, what I found particularly brilliant was the laden BDSM elements throughout the story that unless you're familiar with the genre/lifestyle, you might miss entirely, but it served as a great way to build up the anticipation. Superb.As a romance, this was a fun romp and made for a great way to spend an evening. The added BDSM elements and the erotica upped the enjoyment considerably. A definite recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R51SM5ZCOFZJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0101AS55K#wasThisHelpful","R51SM5ZCOFZJ1","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reviewed by Ashiafor TheRomanceReviews.comFINDING PERFECT is a satisfying friends-to-lovers story, and that's saying a lot, since this is my favorite trope to read.On Paige's ""D""oomsday, that is, the day she got a D in AP Calculus, thereby possibly derailing her plans to get into her dad's alma mater, she almost had a breakdown. She's been the perfect student all this while and a perfect daughter besides, fulfilling her parents' expectations of her thus far. She hires Ben to tutor her, who wanted Paige to introduce him and get a date with her best friend Zoe. A bargain was struck, and in the process, Paige found herself having feelings for Ben...but what chance did she have against her more beautiful, more popular friend?Ben is an admirable hero; working two jobs while going to school in order to help his single mother make ends meet. His confusion over which girl has a greater claim on his heart--Paige or Zoe-- is understandable and believable. It was great reading about his struggles, and how he was willing to give some things up in order to help his mom. Truly an admirable hero.Paige is one of the popular kids, but I get the assumption that she's only popular by association, due to her best friend Zoe. She's also of the opinion that being a popular kid isn't all that it's purported to be, but I wish we could've seen more evidence of this instead of just hearing her say about it. Zoe is her best friend, and while I understand why Paige can't seem to be able to talk to her about some things, there's no scene wherein they have any girl talk, thus making me wonder just how much of a ""best friends"" they are (this not counting the scene when Zoe wanted to clear up some misunderstandings). What I like about Paige, however, is that she's not a snob. I don't know how realistic that is, considering that she's one of the popular kids and her dad is a doctor, so she's rich, but yeah, that's one endearing trait about her.The story is told in alternating points of view, with each chapter stating clearly ""Paige"" or ""Ben"" right after the chapter heading. Which I think is superfluous and unnecessary. Because there is no doubt whose point of view we are in, as the first paragraph usually starts off with Ben did this or Paige said that. I mean, that's clear enough, right?Zoe is a great secondary character, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that she's not one-dimensional. Probably because the next book is about her. :)Aside from the romance, certain parent-child issues were also tackled here, and for the most part, I think it was done pretty well. Most young adults can relate to that as well, especially when their dreams and that of their parents' dreams for them do not align.Overall, a great, uplifting read. Perfect for both adults and young adults.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QYL6ZX5ZH6DK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CQ0UUM#wasThisHelpful","R3QYL6ZX5ZH6DK","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by BookAddictfor TheRomanceReviews.comConsensual non-consent is becoming more and more popular in BDSM dark tales. In SUBMISSION, Army Ranger Captain Everett is a lost soul who seeks redemption through physical punishment. Unfortunately for him, the combination of his masochistic tendencies and rock hard body attract the wrong kind of attention. Searching for a way to satiate his need for self-flagellation, Everett ends up in a seedy BDSM leather club. Unbeknownst to Everett, Phineas Bainbridge already scoped out Everett and wants to turn him into his pet gimp. Perhaps even sell the naïve heterosexual Everett as a sex slave.For those seeking for a sweet m/m kinky BDSM romance, this is not the book for you. For those who enjoy consensual rape and enjoy it one step further to non-con straight up, this is the book for you. This book is filled with conspiracies, rich men with god-complexes and sexual deviance. It's a dark gritty book which at times pulls in multiple directions. Is it a book about a man looking for redemption? Or is it a spoiled powerful playboy getting his rocks off sexually torturing heterosexual men? Or is it a crime thriller?From a plot and story building perspective, this book is murky and hard to read. It's jarring at times with sudden change in scenes. It's disjointed when transitioning between Phineas's developing relationship with Everett, and Phineas's business. The characters are a bit shallow. There isn't anyone in here who is admirable or likeable. Even Everett is a bit troublesome when it comes to liking him. He isn't the golden all-American hero. He comes across more like a whipped puppy desperately looking for a loving master to hold his leash. His childhood experiences with his father and brother only make him come across more pathetic. He isn't a survivor; he's a victim just trying to get through life.The BDSM in this book is dark, nasty and guiltily arousing. Forcing a heterosexual man into accepting m/m sex is a theme which is thoroughly enjoyable for me. The turmoil a man goes through when taking a dick up the ass or begging to suck a cock when he prefers women just flat out arouses me. The rope bondage and the beatings are heavily in the SM fantasy side. The interrogation scenes and the defilement of a young boy are all non-con and not to be repeated in real life, even if it does happen in the real human trafficking world.From a spank bank view, this book definitely does it. The sex scenes are well described and filled with debauchery. Even the sadistic tortures are done just right for a non-con masturbation session. None of this is kinky romance. Most of it is sick twisted fantasies of a sexual sociopath, which makes it that much more wrongfully erotic. What may be disturbing for some is that this story does try to be a romance between Phineas and Everett. It may be a train wreck to witness but it will be a thrilling ride as Everett's ass is ridden hard.This book is recommended for dark erotic readers who enjoy non-con, torture and taboo situations.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R3ENNRWQSWO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WGW5JB0#wasThisHelpful","R2R3ENNRWQSWO2","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Deltafor TheRomanceReviews.comOh dear Xenu, Ms. Lorelei James has a knack for taking regular 1 man, 1 woman vanilla-ish sex and making it feel like the dirtiest, raunchiest orgy ever. Add in a cowboy hat and I'm a goner for anything she puts out!!Super Man-slut Wynton Grant is more than happy to help Amazing Slut-Girl Melissa Lockhart with her dilemma. See, weddings make her horny, and what kind of slutty gentleman superhero would he be if he didn't help a woman out in her time of need? Both are happily unattached and looking for one night of fun, no strings attached, but once the deed is done, they're both pretty surprised to want more. When tragedy strikes and Wyn needs help on his family ranch, Melissa steps up and sticks around for a few weeks, playing house, runnin' cattle and rockin' the rafters with Wyn. This could be the real deal for Wyn and Melâ€¦as long as all their cards are on the table.STRIPPED DOWN is a novella in the Blacktop Cowboy Series by Ms. James, and also a stand-alone book in the innovative and fun 1001 Dark Nights Series featuring magical and mystical erotic stories by a variety of popular authors inspired by the classic The Arabian Nights tale.I'll admit, I'm a bit of a fangirl when it comes to Ms. James' books. I don't know of too many other authors who can consistently deliver fun and insanely erotic stories time after time, series after series, encounter after encounter. You always know when you pick up a Lorelei James book that it'll pack a sexy punch, and she does it again with this Blacktop Cowboys offering for the 1001 Dark Nights Series!Wynton and Melissa are so playful and raunchy, especially when they're discussing past conquests. Their chemistry is fabulous, so thick and raw and real that I literally felt the vibes shooting off the page. Melissa, while I didn't approve of her hiding her health issues from her friends and Wyn, especially when she was working HARD with him on a daily basis, was otherwise freakin' awesome! A rodeo princess and self-proclaimed slut, she owned every move she made without apology. You've gotta love a woman who controls her sexuality and doesn't subscribe to the double standards between men and women. Wynton, despite the terrible name, is a likable character. He also doesn't apologize for his manwhore ways, instead using them to enhance his legendary status and further pick up women. I loved these two together, their relationship was fun to watch develop and their playful personalities just added to my enjoyment.Bottom Line: Pick up anything you can get your hands on by this dirrrrty author! You won't be disappointed!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KBAS0ZUGD4TN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJ72U8I#wasThisHelpful","R1KBAS0ZUGD4TN","A5JZNVV4TEAWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JZNVV4TEAWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Strange though it seems, it's been 12 years since the reissue of the great Gondwana/Desintegrations disc on the Montaigne label, which made it widely available (see my review).  It had originally been released in 1989.  So this Aeon release of three orchestral works by Tristain Murail is the first in a very long time!  It's been 8 years since the first Aeon disc was released -- recordings of the Argento Chamber Ensemble (see my review).  He is a truly significant contemporary composer who has been very poorly documented.Pierre-Andre Valade led these premiere recordings of Murail compositions from 1985, 1995, and 2007 -- a rather neat glimpse of three decades or orchestral writing.  Valade is an expert in conducting spectralist music -- he has conducted numerous Murail works (we learn from the liner notes), is in the process of recording the orchestral works of Hugues Dufourt with the Philharmonic Orchestra of Luxembourg (see my reviews of Volume One and  Volume Two), and he was the conductor of the first recording of Gerard Grisey's Les Espaces Acoustiques.Spectralist music is a departure from the post-war trajectory of serialism, focusing on a microscopic analysis of the frequency and timbre of sounds.  Vibrations!  (The Hindu faith believes that the original vibration OM is the origin of the Universe...)  It is inspired by nature, following Debussy, and utilizes computers and mathematics including chaos theory and fractals to produce distinctively smooth, organic sounds.Here's the program:""Le Partage des eaux"" for large orchestra (22'29 -- 1995/6)BBC Symphony Orchestra -- recorded 2002""Contes cruels"" for two electric guitars and orchestra (20'48 -- 2007)Wiek Hijmans, Seth JoselNetherlands Radio Philharmonic -- recorded 2010""Sillages"" for large orchestra (18'19 -- 1985)Netherlands Radio Philharmonic -- recorded 2010These works are presented in an order similar to the Montaigne disc, which sandwiched ""Desintegrations"" for ensemble and electronic tape in between two orchestral works.  Here, ""Contes cruels"" (Cruel Tales), featuring electric guitars, forms the centerpiece.  It's the most recent composition, and sounds the most distinctively different of the three.  The guitars only sometimes sound recognizably like electric guitars as they are transformed by ring modulators, envelope filters, echoes, phase shifters, and other effects.  The second guitar is tuned a quartertone higher than the first.  The foregrounding of the electronic voices makes this work sound less organic, less like an awe-inspiring natural process, than Murail's other orchestral works, and this logically follows from its source, an 1883 French book of short stories of the same name.  Valade points out that ""[t]he orchestra is conceived here with a strong identity as a resonator for the two guitars ... they lie at the origin of the orchestral textures, which they initiate...""The concluding piece, ""Sillages,"" dates from the same Eighties period as the pieces on the Montaigne disc.  I find it to be the most thoroughly satisfying of the three, with a tone of natural/religious wonder that reminds me of Messiaen.  It was commissioned by the Kyoto Community Bank, and was based on observations of Kyoto, Japan -- specifically of its prominent rock gardens.The opening piece, ""Les Partage des eaux"" (The Parting of the Waters) is for orchestra with computer (originally a synthesizer).  Murail explains that ""[t]he role of the synthetic sounds is to complement the orchestra (by simulating a harp or a vibraphone playing in quartertones, for example), or else to clarify, enrich, or smooth the sonic textures.""  Central to the work is the sound of a wave and its backwash, not actually illustrated, but used as the sonic underpinning, based on the dynamic spectral analysis of that sound.  Sometimes quite forceful, and vibrant throughout, ""Les Partage"" clearly carries forward some of the optimistic vision of Messiaen.The 36-page booklet in French and English includes commentary on all three works by both the composer and the conductor.*** *** ***Tristan Murail (b. 1947) is one of the founders of spectralism, along with Gerard Grisey (1946-1998). Murail, a computer music wizard, worked at IRCAM in the Nineties, and then taught at Columbia University from 1997 to 2011. In 2012 he took a position as professor of composition at the Mozarteum University of Salzburg.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NI9MNYATF4D8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V6CLKTQ#wasThisHelpful","R1NI9MNYATF4D8","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Donaueschinger Musiktage is the world's leading contemporary music (neuemusik) festival, held annually, though not continuously, since 1921.  (It was interrupted in the Thirties and Forties by the Nazi regime.)  Works performed at the festival are commissioned specifically for it, with few exceptions.  The SWR Sinfonie-Orchester Baden-Baden und Freiburg, founded in 1946, has been the festival's ""house band.""  It is the world's leading orchestra in contemporary repertoire, and that role has been built over time to a great degree because of all the premieres of cutting-edge compositions it has mastered and performed for the annual DM.Selected live recordings from the festival used to be released every year by the Col Legno label, and since 2006, by the Neos label.  Here are the contents from the four discs released from DM 2013:Disc OneEnno Poppe (b. 1969)Speicher for large ensemble (71'47 -- 2008-2013)Klangforum WienEnno Poppe, conductorDisc TwoBerhard Lang (b. 1957)Monadologie XIII ""The Saucy Maid"" for two orchestras one quartertone apart (69'49 -- 2013)SWR Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden und FreiburgWolfgang Lischke/Christopher Sprenger, conductorsDisc ThreeGeorges Aperghis (b. 1945)Situations for 23 soloists (53'58 -- 2013)Klangforum WienEmilio Pomarico, conductorAlberto Posadas (b. 1967)Kerguelen triple concerto for amplified woodwind trio and orchestra (23'48 -- 2013)Blasertrio RechercheSWR Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden und FreiburgFrancois-Xavier Roth, conductorDisc FourWalter Zimmerman (b. 1949)Suave Mari Magno -- Clinamen I-VI for six orchestral groups (34'02 -- 1996-1998/2010-2013)SWR Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden und FreiburgPascal Rophe, conductorPhilippe Manoury (b. 1952)In situ for orchestra and ensemble (29'49 -- 2013)Ensemble ModernSWR Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden und FreiburgFrancois-Xavier Roth, conductorIf you have looked for and found this review, then I assume that you share my interest in challenging, innovative neuemusik.  That I am not tremendously impressed with four of the six works here should not be taken to mean that I think they are too challenging or innovative.  Quite the contrary.  But I do find this DM 2013 set to be disappointing, with only two of the six works rising from being interesting to being powerfully compelling.  All the ensembles, including the SWR orchestra, perform impeccably.Poppe and Lang's pieces are the longest, each filling an entire disc.  Enno Poppe, of Germany, explains that ""speicher"" means storage system, and the piece is in six parts, each sub-divided again into six parts ""whose length and proportions are in the same relation to one another as the six large parts.""  This large-scale chamber work is episodically fascinating, but I don't find it gripping over its long duration.Bernhard Lang's piece, likewise, is rigorously constructed, but fails to excite over its lengthy span.  Lang, an Austrian like Bruckner, takes materials from Bruckner's Symphony No. 1 as the basis for the piece -- hence the subtitle, referring to Bruckner's unfulfilled object of desire.  He explains that ""The Monadologie series, which currently encompasses 28 pieces, is a large-scale project of score revision, score overwriting -- and even destruction...  ...I use machines as structural generators.  The starting point is a first piece of writing, a first text, whose detonation, explosion and destruction leads to a second...  ...I made a peculiar discovery:  by applying these machines to musical structures, I in turn arrived inexplicably at comprehensible musical structures.""  Indeed, all the talk of detonations and destruction notwithstanding, the piece does not sound completely alien or fragmentary.  Neither does it sound like Bruckner, I hasten to add!  The constant juxtaposition of two orchestral groups one quartertone apart produces a strange dislocated sensation.The French Georges Aperghis proudly emphasizes the fragmentary basis of his piece, and explains his use of a matrix as a motor to bring them into dynamic interaction.  The result is, again, less than fully satisfactory to my ears.  Walter Zimmerman, of Germany, stands at the opposite extreme from Aperghis in terms of organization.  His six-section work for six orchestral groups is elaborately constructed, based on text fragments from Epicurus and others, with orchestral groups ""corresponding to three readings of the same text in analogy to the ancient vocal part and three in analogy to the ancient instrumental part.  The three readings deviate microscopically from one another, as they are the chromatic, enharmonic, and diatonic readings of the text.""  And so on.  The piece begins sounding rather like Ligeti's microtonal clouds.All four long pieces include interesting passages and interesting techniques, and are certainly thoughtful and thought-provoking.  But I am left underwhelmed by them.  Classic three-star music -- not bad, but not music that demands repeated listening either.Now on to the two outstanding five-star pieces here.  Alberto Posadas, of Spain, is one of my favorite younger composers.  A student of Francisco Guerrero, Posadas creates consistently powerful music shaped by two streams of influence:  Xenakis and the French spectralist school.  ""Kerguelen,"" named after a volcanic plateau in the southern Indian Ocean that is nearly entirely submerged, is a unique concerto.  Says the composer:  ""The choice of this title was due to the fact that this geological formation is particularly suited to describing the relationship between a solo trio and the orchestra ... the trio protrudes beyond the orchestra, such that the latter is like a plateau above which the musical trio elevates itself.""  The three woodwind players of the ensemble recherche (Martin Fahlenbock, flutes; Jaime Gonzalez, oboes; Shizuyo Oka, clarinets) are treated as a single instrument.  As with many compositions by Posadas, it is hard to believe that the resulting sounds are entirely acoustic with no electronics.  He makes use of what he calls ""micro-instrumentation,"" or ""generative instrumentation,"" to look at pitches and timbres unique to each instrument, based on its mouthpiece, physical properties, breathing and fingering techniques, and so on.  ""Kerguelen"" is phenomenally exciting.  I want to play it again immediately every time I listen to it!Philippe Manoury, of France, surprised me with ""In situ.""  Based on what little I had heard by him before, I had him pegged as a composer of rather wispy electro-acoustic works.  But this is a veritable powerhouse of energy, using both the SWR orchestra and the Ensemble Modern.  It is a spatial work, which is of course lost on disc.  The ensemble is on stage, while the orchestra is spread throughout the audience, with the percussion around the outside perimeter.  Manoury takes full advantage of the virtuosity of the musicians, and with the various permutations of instruments his orchestra-plus-ensemble provides, he builds a dynamic roller coaster of sound that provides a fitting conclusion to this four-disc journey through the neuemusik frontier.Due to government budget cuts, the two SWR orchestras, of Baden-Baden und Freiburg and of Stuttgart, are scheduled to be merged into one in 2016.  This means we are living through the final years of the greatest neuemusik orchestra in the world.  The loss of its house orchestra will have a devastating effect on the Donaueschinger Musiktage.  We have the DM 2014 yet to hear later this year, and presumably the DM 2015 to be released in 2016.  I'm sure the festival will continue, but it won't be the same.  Enjoy this cutting edge music and appreciate it while we still have it!*** *** ***The package, as for the last several years, is a four-panel cardboard foldout with plastic jewel-case inserts for the discs, all in a box with a booklet.

"Moses -- Franz GrundheberAron -- Andreas ConradEuropaChorAkademieSWR Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden und FreiburgSylvain Cambreling, conductorRecorded September 2012, live in Berlin, Luzern, Freiburg, and StrasbourgI haven't heard all the recordings of ""Moses und Aron,"" but this new one clearly surpasses those I have heard:  the 1974 Philips recording of the Austrian Radio Chorus and Symphony Orchestra (ORF), led by Michael Gielen, and the 1974 Sony recording of Pierre Boulez and the BBC Symphony Orchestra (see my reviews of both).Franz Grundheber is well known in the role of Wozzeck (for instance, the Abbado/Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra recording), and he gives Moses a rough grandeur in the sprechstimme role.  Andreas Conrad is a potent, noble Heldentenor.  Aron's is the only true lead singing role in this unusual opera, so he has to have a powerful, compelling voice.  The chorus, the EuropaChorAkademie, is clear and distinct, a stunning third singing part along with the two principals.The SWR Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden und Freiburg is, in my opinion, the world's leading orchestra in contemporary repertoire.  Sylvain Cambreling led the orchestra from 1999 to 2011 as Principal Conductor, following the tenure of Michael Gielen.  He maintained and deepened the SWR's excellence, leading many premieres at the annual Donaueschinger Musiktage.  The tour documented here in September 2012, combining live recordings from four cities, took place after he had moved on to new positions including at the Staatsoper Stuttgart.  The orchestral sound combines the best of the earlier recordings by Gielen and Boulez -- it is earthy and vivid, like the studio recording of Gielen and the ORF, but also smooth and clear like the live-in-a-church recording of Boulez and the BBCSO.  It has depths, clear lines, and powerful forward momentum.It is a tragedy that the SWR Baden-Baden und Freiburg, founded in 1946, will be dissolved in 2016, merged with the SWR Stuttgart as the result of a budget cut.  We can only hope that some of its rich legacy and excellence survives in the new combined orchestra.An added bonus to this fine 2-disc Hanssler release is the 48-page booklet, with liner notes and the entire libretto, including Act III, in both German and English.THE OPERASchoenberg left ""Moses und Aron"" unfinished when he fled Germany in 1932.  He started sketching the work in 1926, which was originally to be an oratorio, and wrote Acts I and II of what became an opera between 1930 and 1932.  There is a complete libretto for Act III, but the music was never finished.  It is sometimes read following the end of the music, but the tradition has become to perform Acts I and II as a complete opera -- the ending of Act II makes a powerful conclusion.  In this, Schoenberg's great 12-tone opera joins Bruckner's 9th Symphony, which ends quite movingly after the third movement without the triumphant fourth movement Bruckner planned.""Moses und Aron"" is a very unusual opera, with no lead female singers.  The only lead singing role is Aron, a high tenor.  The part of Moses, for bass voice, is written in ""Sprechstimme,"" a speaking-singing.  The only other main vocal role is that of the chorus, with several very minor characters.  Schoenberg's vocal writing and orchestral writing is superb, and while the opera is not exactly part of the standard repertoire, it is staged regularly and there are a growing number of recordings.The central theme is ""the struggle between the abstract thought of Moses, the true prophet of God, which cannot, owing to the purity of its abstraction, be communicated to the people, and the representational symbolism used by Aron, whose eloquence is capable of winning the people over by giving them an imagery they can comprehend.""  The final line from Moses at the end of Act II is ""Oh word, you word, that I lack.""  In Act III, Moses has Aron arrested.  He is tried and convicted, but rather than executing him, Moses frees him.  However, Aron drops dead.  The final words of Moses are ""But in the wasteland you shall be invincible and shall achieve the goal: unity with God.""  It seems to me that there was a good reason that Schoenberg was not able to finish the music for Act III -- ""Moses und Aron"" is better left with the tragic and more ambiguous ending of Act II.(verified purchase from Dussmann in Berlin)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15ZRQWM44YZPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFGH55I#wasThisHelpful","R15ZRQWM44YZPZ","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 1974 Philips recording of the Austrian Radio Chorus and Symphony Orchestra (ORF), led by Michael Gielen, is earthy, stark, and powerful, and it is excellent that Brilliant Classics reissued it on CD in 2009.  The recording was made as the soundtrack to a film version by French director Jean Marie Straub (available on DVD: Moses and Aaron), and according to Ian Bailey of MusicWeb, the studio recording was far from the live-on-stage sound of many opera recordings.  Though you would never know this reading most available reviews, the use of studio manipulation is clearly a critical element in the vivid, earthy sound.  Everything is close-mic'ed, and couldn't be more different, for instance, from the recording of Boulez and the BBC Symphony Orchestra, also from 1974, which sounds distant and ethereal by comparison.  That recording was made in the live ambience of the West Ham Central Mission in London.Gunter Reich is Moses in both 1974 recordings, and he is equally convincing in both.  I find Louis Devos, the tenor who sings the Aron part for Gielen, to be much better in the role than Richard Cassilly in the Boulez recording.  Cassilly's Aron is too one-dimensionally disagreeable, a slick salesman for God.  Devos lends Aron more dignity, and puts him on a closer footing to the noble Moses.The chorus and orchestra are both more detailed and powerful in this recording of Gielen and the ORF.  The Boulez/BBCSO recording of ""Moses und Aron"" was the first one I heard, and I was quite impressed.  Under Boulez's leadership, the orchestra sounds quite beautiful --- smoothly, homogenously blended.  It's not bad at all, but it is clearly eclipsed by this recording.One thing you need to fully appreciate the opera that is not included in this Brilliant box is the libretto.

"Two recordings of Schoenberg's 12-tone opera ""Moses und Aron"" were made at about the same time in 1974, both featuring Gunter Reich as Moses.

"I missed this great two-disc set at the time of its release in 2006 on the obscure French label Rogue Art.  The 24 pieces by the Roscoe Mitchell Trio were recorded from December 2005 to February 2006 in Madison, Wisconsin, where Mitchell has lived for many years.Roscoe Mitchell (founder of the Art Ensemble of Chicago, early member of Chicago's AACM, performer, and composer) plays soprano, alto, tenor, and bass saxophones, flute, piccolo and percussion.  Harrison Bankhead plays bass and cello.  Vincent Davis plays drums and percussion.  Bankhead is a long-time Chicago musician who is perhaps best known for playing with the late Fred Anderson, and Davis has been playing in Mitchell's Note Factory since the 2002 Song for My Sister, so these musicians have a telepathic bond making possible instant communication, shifts, and movement.The pieces move through diverse settings, from energy music a la late Coltrane or Ayler, featuring Mitchell's astonishing circular breathing technique, to the slow, quiet, and meditative.  They range from 2'25 in length to 13'38.  I consider Mitchell to be one of the great late 20th century composers.  Each of these pieces, though, takes the unique structure as the basis for improvisation, and unlike some of Mitchell's other releases, like Far Side, few listeners are likely to think this is anything but jazz -- free jazz, avant jazz, jazz with ingenious composed structures, yes, but definitely jazz, the African-American tradition emphasizing improvisation.NO SIDE EFFECTS is strongly recommended to all Roscoe Mitchell fans!*** *** ***Rogue Art saves money on graphics and uses the same spartan white color with black-and-red lettering on all its releases.

"This latest album from Henry Threadgill's Zooid is a 2-disc set from Pi Recordings, recorded in December 2014.  The lineup is:Henry Threadgill -- alto sax, flute, bass fluteJose Davila -- trombone, tubaLiberty Ellman -- guitarChristopher Hoffman -- celloElliot Humberto Kavee -- drums, percussionZooid is a quintet once again as bassist Stomu Takeishi, who played on the the last three albums, is no longer present.  Zooid continues to explore Threadgill's novel compositional/improvisational method, as explained on the Pi website:""Named after a biological term for a cell that is capable of spontaneous movement independent of its parent organism, Threadgill's compositions for Zooid assign a set of intervals to each player that serves as the starting point for improvisation. The result is a contrapuntal crazy quilt that materializes with a mysterious logic.""The drummer Kavee describes Threadgill's system: ""The spaces between the notes - the intervals in time and pitch - are the elements that we work with in our improvisations. His system generates a constantly shifting negative space - a mutating kaleidoscope of sound, movement and emotion that moves around its own axis.""The basic approach remains the same.  What is different for IN FOR A PENNY, IN FOR A POUND is that the compositions are longer, and each is in the form of a suite, with sections punctuated by complete stops.  The players continue to mesh and interact beautifully, and each is featured on one of the long pieces:Disc 101 In for a penny, in for a pound (opening)  4'3602 Ceroepic (for drums and percussion)  19'3803 Dosepic (for cello)  16'00Disc 201 Off the prompt box (exordium)  3'3602 Tresepic (for trombone and tuba)  17'2603 Unoepic (for guitar)  17'57In the brief liner notes Threadgill explains that in addition to the four quintets featuring an instrument, there is a fifth quintet featuring sax and flute that is woven into the others.  Throughout each piece all five musicians take turns leading, and some drop out to leave subgroups -- the ""featured instrument"" does not solo continuously.  Each disc leads with a brief opening piece.  Every one of the musicians plays amazing solos and submerges as part of the contrupuntal ensemble with equal mastery.  There are lugubrious passages with no driving pulse, and other passages that swing like mad!  According to Threadgill, ""[a]ll six sections together is one piece, the epic ""In for a Penny, In for a Pound.""Henry Threadgill, now 71, has been one of my favorite musicians and composers ever since I saw him and what was at that time his new band, the Sextet, at the Underground Fest in Chicago, the ""afterfest"" of the Chicago Jazz Festival, in 1981.His albums are of consistently high quality, and this latest is no exception.  He vanished from sight from 2001 to 2009, with no recordings, and thank goodness since then he has released four albums with this Zooid band.

"This is an excellent live recording of a 62-minute performance that I finally added to my Cecil collection. This was a short-lived Unit that fell in between the Andrew Cyrille years and the well-documented Unit with Ronald Shannon Jackson on drums and Ramsey Ameen on violin. Marc Edwards is the drummer here, the only recording he made with Cecil, and he does a fine job. I consider Cyrille to have been Cecil's best drummer, and Edwards doesn't cut loose the way Cyrille did -- he is more a backing drummer than a co-equal. This Unit is a quintet, with Jimmy Lyons on alto (of course), and two young players, Raphe Malik on trumpet and David S. Ware on tenor. Malik sounds great, soloing at length right out of the gate, very bright and extroverted. (He would continue with Cecil, playing in the Unit with Shannon Jackson documented on New World and Hat Hut.) Ware sounds fine as well, adding low register playing to the sound palette and trading rhythmic patterns with Cecil. Lyons is right at home - he had played with Cecil for 15 years when this recording was made, and would play with him for 10 more years before his premature death in 1986 at the age of 53.This was a summer festival gig, the Yugoslovian Jazz Festival in Lubljana. I heard a Cecil Taylor solo performance at the Chicago Jazz Festival in the late 1980s, and his playing is like nothing else. He comments in the liner notes here by Steve Lake that his music is ""...about magic and capturing spirits.""

"This Brilliant-style box (14 discs in cardboard slipcases with their original cover art -- no jewel cases) restores to print several great recordings of modern and contemporary music.  With the exception of the Messiaen recordings from 1966, everything else was recorded from 1980 to 1991.  There is no indication of remastering -- they are marked ADD/DDD.  There are five discs of Stravinsky and Schoenberg, arguably the two most important 20th Century Modern composers.  The other nine discs are less well-known contemporary music, including three discs of Boulez conducting Boulez.In the 1990s, Boulez signed with Deutsche Grammophon.  His vast output on that label is more expansive and more Romantic than his earlier recordings for Sony, for example ""Boulez conducts Schoenberg"", and Erato.  He also stuck mainly to the Modern canon for DG, and rarely recorded the sort of cutting edge avant-garde works of the late 20th century found here.Both Schoenberg discs here, including recordings of the violin and piano concertos and two orchestral works (the early ""Pelleas und Melisande"" and the late, serialist ""Variations for Orchestra"") are well worth hearing and have been available as a two-disc set from Erato and Apex:  see my lengthy review.  As for Stravinsky, the major find for me is the complete 46-minute opera ""Le Rossignol"" featuring Phyllis Bryn-Julson and John Tomlinson with the BBC Symphony Orchestra -- beautiful music, beautifully performed.  Also found on the same disc is the rare ""Les Soucoupes"" original version from 1914-1917, along with the better known version from 1954.  I am less impressed by the neoclassical ""Pulcinella,"" the symphonic poem ""Le Chant du Rossignol,"" and ""L'Histoire du Soldat,"" an amusing miniature work of musical theater for three singers, a dancer, and a septet.  Patrice Chereau, best known for designing the modern set for the Boulez Ring at Bayreuth, is the soldier!Turning to the three Boulez discs, this 1981 recording of ""Pli Selon Pli"" with Phyllis Bryn-Julson is quite fine -- I haven't yet done a careful comparison with my favorite recording on Sony from 1969 with Halina Lukomska, also recorded with the BBC Symphony Orchestra.  It is clearly preferable to the more recent recording with Christine Schaefer and the Ensemble Intercontemporain, the recording Boulez considers definitive.  The disc of chamber works is interesting but rather light.  It includes the early version of ""...explosante-fixe..."" for flute and eight instruments.  The best find is the disc of vocal and orchestral works.  ""Le Visage nuptial"" and ""Le Soleil des Eaux"" for soprano, chorus and orchestra, both based on poems by Rene Char, are quite compelling and surprisingly accessible.  I find ""Figures, Doubles, Prismes"" for orchestra, from 1968, to be one of Boulez's more powerful works, sounding positively Xenakis-like in its fiercest passages.  No doubt this why Boulez never revisited or revised it -- it is somewhat out of character for him, as he has generally favored delicacy over ferocity.The Messiaen recordings, including ""Et Exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum,"" are fine, but the recording here with the Orchestre du Domaine Musical is clearly surpassed by Boulez's later recording with the Cleveland Orchestra.  The recording of Berio's ""Sinfonia"" included here is the best-known version, and it has been widely available.  I have never been all that impressed with the composition myself.  It sounds quite dated to me, an attempt to be ""hip"" in a very Sixties style featuring the New Swingles Singers and a narrator.  For what it's worth, Boulez recently included it in a list of the ten most important works of the 20th Century.The disc of Eliott Carter performed by the Ensemble Intercontemporain is superb, a highlight of this entire set.  It features the incredibly vivacious ""Concerto for Oboe,"" written for and performed by the great virtuoso Heinz Holliger.  ""Penthode"" (1984-5) was commissioned by the EI, and it is dedicated to the EI and Boulez. It is more austere than the concerto, but fascinating.  Twenty players are divided into groups of four, and as Carter explains, ""...each group...has its own repertory of expressive characters embodied in its own special field of speeds and musical intervals. While the five groups oppose or combine with each other, one long continuous line is passed from one instrument to another, binding the first and third sections of the score together.""  See my review:  Carter -- Ensemble Intercontemporain/Pierre Boulez.And that brings us to the reason I was quite excited to see this box -- three discs of contemporary music that have been out of print and unavailable for years:  1) Donatoni and Ligeti, 2) Kurtag, Birtwistle, and Grisey, and 3) Dufourt, Ferneyhough, Harvey, and Holler.  Along with the Carter disc and the Xenakis piece on the disc with Berio, this is a treasure trove of great contemporary music performed by the Ensemble Intercontemporain, led by Boulez:Harrison Birtwistle -- ""...AGM..."" for 16 voices and 3 instrumental groups (27'10)Elliott Carter -- ""Concerto for Oboe"" with Heinz Holliger (19'57), ""Penthode"" (19'25), and ""A Mirror on which to Dwell"" (18'40)Franco Donatoni -- ""Tema"" for 12 instruments (16'09) and ""Cadeau"" for 11 instruments (11'12)Hugues Dufourt -- ""Antiphysis"" for leading flute and chamber orchestra (18'14)Brian Ferneyhough -- ""Funerailles,"" Versions I (11'11) and II (13'37)Gerard Grisey -- ""Modulations"" for 33 musicians (18'38)York Holler -- ""Arcus"" for 17 instruments and magnetic tape (19'35)Gyorgy Kurtag -- ""Messages de feu Demoiselle R.V. Troussova"" for soprano and chamber ensemble (25'52)Gyorgy Ligeti -- ""Trio"" for violin, horn, and piano (21'41)Iannis Xenakis -- ""Jalons"" for 15 instrumentalists (14'35)The Birtwistle piece, with a text constructed of fragments of poetry from Sappho, is quite unique and compelling, combining his distinctive drama-oriented style with a smoother sound that reminds me of Ligeti's microtonal writing.  This 1983 version of the great Kurtag piece, settings of 21 poems by Rimma Dalos, features the Hungarian soprano Adrienne Csengery.  It was recorded very soon after its original recording in Hungary, and Boulez's performances of it with Csengery and the Ensemble Intercontemporain played a major role in establishing Kurtag's reputation in the West.  I have not yet had the chance to do a careful comparison of the two recordings, but this one is excellent.  Pierre-Laurent Aimard plays Book One of Ligeti's ""Etudes for Piano,"" and the ""Trio"" for violin, horn, and piano is also included.  For definitive recordings, I suggest the Ligeti Edition from Sony.Two of the best works here are those by Dufourt (of France) and Holler (of Germany).  They are both dense and powerful, and deserve to be heard by anyone interested in contemporary avant-garde music.  Dufourt, one of the original spectralists, explores shifting intensities with the flute moving through mysterious passages interrupted by ferocious ensemble blasts.  Holler's piece is a subtle and fascinating tapestry of interweaving acoustic and electronic motives, very different from his award-winning recent electro-acoustic Spharen (Spheres), which blends the electronics with and enhances the orchestra.  I have not always been impressed by the electronic elements of Jonathan Harvey's music, but ""Mortuos Plango, Vivos Voco"" for concrete sounds, featuring bells and soprano, is quite striking and impressive, created with computer processing.Ferneyhough's twin ""Funerailles"" for string sextet plus bass and harp are slower, more spacious, and more mournful, as the title suggests, than his typically frantic chamber music, though dotted with trademark quicksilver scurries.  The Donatoni pieces are both bright, light, and lively.  ""Tema"" features oboe, woodwinds and strings with unbroken forward rhythmic motion, like Mozart-in-a-funhouse-mirror.  ""Cadeau"" is more episodic, and features tuba, harp, and xylophone along with oboe.  ""Jalons"" by Xenakis is from his late period (1986), and while not as complex and fascinating as his Sixties and Seventies works, it is a nice addition here.  The Grisey piece is the fourth of six parts of his spectralist cycle, ""Les espaces acoustiques,"" which can now be heard to greater advantage as part of the completed cycle.Five of the discs here were released as a set several years ago, and that collection is now rendered obsolete as it is all included here along with much else that had been left out.One thing that is not included, and it is mentioned in the liner notes in error, is an Erato disc of Daniel Barenboim leading the Orchestre de Paris in three works by Boulez, including ""Notations 1-4.""  The Complete Erato Recordings means everything with Boulez as conductor.  Another minor error in the 40-page booklet in English, French, and German is that the list of dates and locations of the recordings is not complete.  The 11-page essay by Maxime Joos comments on Boulez and his relation to the composers and works, but does not give very much information on the compositions in their own right -- the focus is on Boulez.This is a great reissue -- thanks to Warner Classics, which appears to be reviving the Erato imprint.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CU4D2VCB1JP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFVL1PG#wasThisHelpful","R2CU4D2VCB1JP2","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vijay Iyer (piano), Marcus Gilmore (drums), and Stephan Crump (bass) here follow up the great 2009 album Historicity with an even better album in the same vein.  ACCELERANDO deserved every award it won for 2012 jazz -- it is another exciting rhythmic blend of modern jazz classics (Henry Threadgill, Herbie Nichols), the lovely Duke Elllington ballad ""The Village of the Virgins,"" catchy melodic pop songs (Rod Temperton/Heatwave, Steve Ellison/Flying Lotus, Porcaro-Bettis/Michael Jackson), and Iyer originals.  (Iyer quotes ""Cool"" from West Side Story by Bernstein/Sondheim in his solo in ""Optimism."")Iyer makes reference in the liner notes to how the world is accelerating:  ""...rising inequality, populist revolution, economic crisis, climate change...""  This is music of the moment, and music that will last.  This is music that is rooted in the rhythms and history of jazz, and connects with the wider world of pop and progressive social change.For now it stands as the Trio's best recording, but their more recent Break Stuff (2015) on ECM is also excellent, a cooler, sleeker set with fewer recognizable pop melodies.If you haven't yet heard the Vijay Iyer Trio, what are you waiting for?","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RVQ9FRSF46LY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006G0XDSO#wasThisHelpful","R2RVQ9FRSF46LY","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pianist Vijay Iyer, with Marcus Gilmore on drums and Stephan Crump on bass, is updating the piano trio with exciting rhythms and a fresh mixture of modern jazz classics (by Andrew Hill, Julius Hemphill and Ronnie Foster), pop songs (by Bernstein & Sondheim, Stevie Wonder, and M.I.A), and original compositions by Iyer.This is vibrant, contemporary jazz, great for listening while dancing or sitting, but if sitting, some part of you is likely to be in motion!Iyer includes a quote from Gramsci's Prison Notebooks in the liner notes, and refers to the ""Brown and Black Atlantic"" of colonialism and the slave trade, so we know the music is informed by a radical political and social sensibility.My jazz listening has grown further and further from what's current, still rooted in the Sixties/Seventies free jazz/improv of the AACM (Roscoe Mitchell, Henry Threadgill) and Europe (Peter Brotzmann, Evan Parker), so I am quite happy to have discovered some great jazz being made by younger musicians!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8WKXWRUH7MI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EC3932#wasThisHelpful","R8WKXWRUH7MI5","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE SEER made all the best-of lists for 2012.  Now Michael Gira and Swans have astonished us all again by making another 2-disc album that is just as good!On first listening I found it hard to judge whether TO BE KIND was as good, or better than, THE SEER.  It took repeated listening to come the conclusion that THE SEER is less consistent -- Disc One is not as good as TO BE KIND, but Disc Two is better.  TO BE KIND is more consistent throughout.Swans, the band, is by now forged into a powerful unit.  I am quite sorry that I missed their recent Atlanta performance, which came during the madness of the end of the spring semester.Fortunately they will be recording another album before long, and hopefully they'll come back through.Gira and Swans cut through the shallow, superficial, plastic facade to the flesh and bone and electric soul of Life!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3STV0U8TKIGQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JNHR162#wasThisHelpful","R3STV0U8TKIGQV","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was initially underwhelmed by this album, which made all the critics' best-of lists for 2012, but eventually I realized what everyone was raving about.  The thing is, though, THE SEER is not equally superb throughout.  The second disc is just amazing, so don't be too hasty to form your opinion after only hearing Disc One.  The opening track (Lunacy) is fairly light, and there is a clear minimalist influence.  Then Disc Two shoots us screaming into space on a dark, psychedelic voyage!Michael Gira's reformed Swans are more powerful than ever.  The more recent TO BE KIND (2014) is more consistent than THE SEER -- it's stronger throughout -- but it does not reach the same heights.The music of Michael Gira and Swans is raw, visionary and uncompromising.  His vocals remind of both Lou Reed and Iggy Pop, but the music is sui generis.  Listening is like plugging your mind directly into the black hole at the heart of the galaxy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M6W7NV7D6151/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008K7WCJM#wasThisHelpful","R2M6W7NV7D6151","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never heard Swans in their original run.  I only finally caught up with them with THE SEER (2012), and then worked back to this 2010 album.  It took repeated listening, but the incantations worked, and I am now under Michael Gira's spell.Swans music stands where carnality and brutality collide with spirituality and cerebral metaphysicality.  It locks into repetitive riffs influenced by minimalism and rises to ecstatic heights like gospel.  Gira's lyrics are vivid and intense.This album has been surpassed by THE SEER and TO BE KIND (2014), but it's a great album in its own right.

"Snakeoil, Tim Berne's chamber jazz project, did not sound very appealing to me when it began a few years ago.  I never got past the soundclips until now.  I thought the addition of a guitar might boost the energy level, but I find this set to lack inspiration.  The one exception is ""Embraceable Me,"" which builds very effectively to an energetic finale, with some lovely lyrical playing from the woodwinds along the way.Berne has always been a large-form composer, and to fully appreciate his music the listener has to be patient as the structure unfolds.  Solos tend to be secondary to the compositions, and that is certainly true with Snakeoil.I only recently caught up with the outstanding  Science Friction Live: The Sublime And...  album from 2003 (see my review), and it has all the energy and excitement lacking from this new release.  Ryan Ferreira, the newly added guitarist here, is not allowed to play the lead role Marc Ducret plays with Science Friction and several other Berne bands, but is restrained and subdued.Tim Berne, who studied with Julius Hemphill, has never been a traditional jazz player.  I wouldn't say Snakeoil's music is very jazz-like at all, though that is how it is categorized.  That's not a bad thing, I'm no jazz traditionalist.  Rather, it seems to me that Berne has tended to bring the energy of rock to his music, and I find that lacking in Snakeoil.So it doesn't swing, and neither does it rock -- to my ears it lacks a spark.*** *** ***I saw Tim Berne live in Tucson in 1997, a great concert at the Mat Bevel Institute organized by Zeitgeist Productions.  It was a duet with Michael Formanek on bass, and I only recently learned that it was recorded and is available as a CD:  Ornery People.  That performance made clear that Tim Berne can solo quite impressively on alto sax -- he's not only an innovative composer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NW77OLUIN0FN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQESBZC#wasThisHelpful","R1NW77OLUIN0FN","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"IN TIMES did not impress me nearly as much as the other Enslaved albums I've heard on the first few listens.  (Those are Below the Lights, Isa, Vertebrae, and Axioma Ethica Odini).  But based on those great previous albums, and the rave reviews on many metal websites, I didn't give up easily.  I persevered, kept listening, and then it started to sound better and better until it hit me that IN TIMES is indeed another great album from the Norwegian extreme/progressive metalists -- it helps to crank up the volume!One of the most immediately compelling songs is ""Building With Fire,"" which features a galloping NWOBHM-style beat.  Herbrand Larsen's clean vocals struck me at first as not-in-sync with the band's sound, but that's one of the things that changed with repeated listening -- it sounds more and more right.There are sections in both ""In Times"" and ""Daylight"" that sound very Amon Duul II-esque to me -- Seventies psychedelia.  The passage in ""Daylight"" is quite striking, with everything dropping out except two guitars, evocative of a blissful utopia.  Eventually the band joins back in with power chords.  The black metal vocals of Grutle Kjellson, founder and bassist, are featured periodically throughout, but as with all their recent albums, black metal is only an element of the progressive sound, a point that seems to be lost on some reviewers who expect pure black metal.Another influence I noticed, and I may be wrong about this, but I think I hear the great Norwegian composer Grieg here and there in the mix, particularly the well-known theme ""In the Hall of the Mountain King.""  That would be fitting, as the vision of Enslaved has expanded well beyond the black metal of their very young early days!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRXF5JKCUAP7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVDJ3TW#wasThisHelpful","RRXF5JKCUAP7H","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is a fairly traditional opera, with strong singing roles for men and women, intrigue, seduction, virtue, and its absence.  Of course Birtwistle's music is not traditional, but the music of ""Gawain"" has strong links to Wagner, and is informed specifically by both ""Gotterdammerung"" and ""Parsifal.""The poet David Harsent drew on the 14th century narrative poem.  He transforms the Green Knight, who takes on the dual nature of both Green Man, representing the wild, untamed outdoors, and the moral values of the society -- its paternal and civic authority.  Harsent transforms Morgan le Fay from a marginal and evil character in the original to one both central and virtuous.  Core to the story arc is Gawain's realization that he is not the Hero of the story, a strong parallel to Siegfried in Wagner's Ring.I don't find ""Gawain"" to be as compelling as Birtwistle's more recent The Minotaur (see my review), but that is partly because ""The Minotaur"" was released as a DVD, and the visuals are stunning, including John Tomlinson as the ingeniously costumed Minotaur and the voluptuous Christine Rice as Ariadne.

For those just discovering his music, it's a perfectly fine introduction, but no substitute for his best albums.

"Though it might come as a surprise to some, given the clear roots of YOB in Black Sabbath, this is intensely spiritual music -- a doom metal doorway to enlightenment.  The five long songs all have serious metaphysical lyrics printed in the single-sheet foldout, and the graphics feature a mystical diagram of overlapping triangles in a circle that reveals the path inward to infinity.  Scott Kelly of Neurosis, another intensely spiritual doom metal band, contributes vocals and lyrics to ""Before We Dreamed of Two.""  It is entirely appropriate that YOB has released their latest, Clearing the Path to Ascend (2014), on Neurot Recordings, the Neurosis label.Here is a lyric to give you an idea of the content:UPON THE SIGHT OF THE OTHER SHOREFire Burns Through DarknessUnseen UnveiledCome Bear To WitnessBelief Shaken To The CoreUpon The Sight Of The Other ShoreHeaven Speaks In RiddlesProphets Speak In TonguesThe Dead Speak In SilenceLove Smiles In SurrenderRed Eyes In DesperationA World We Cannot EscapeClutching Hate Like A WeaponBlood In Our HandsExpound The GospelBelief Shaken To The CoreUpon the Sight Of The Other ShoreMy interpretation is that ""the other shore"" is what buddhists call ""nirvana"" -- Enlightenment, Peace.

"I'm a big James McMurtry fan, but I can't get as enthused about this album as many others seem to be. The standout track is ""How'm I Gonna Find You Now,"" which not surprisingly was released with an amusing video in advance of the album. It's an uptempo number with a rapid-fire vocal reminiscent of ""Choctaw Bingo,"" and prominently features the banjo in addition to electric guitars.The lyrics throughout are outstanding, of course, more of the hardscrabble character-sketch vignettes we've come to expect.  But too many of the songs are in a slow, mournful mode (Copper Canteen, You Got to Me, Carlisle's Haul, South Dakota), and the streak of anger of great recent albums is missing.COMPLICATED GAME grows on me with repeated listening, but I don't think it's as good as his excellent run of electric albums from Saint Mary of the Woods (2002) through Live in Aught Three (2004) to Childish Things (2005) and Just Us Kids (2008).","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HPTMBNXUMU6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P7PKGOI#wasThisHelpful","R3HPTMBNXUMU6Y","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always thought Mark Lanegan's voice is one of the best in rock, but I haven't kept up with his prolific post-Screaming Trees career.This is a great album I just finally discovered.  For the longest time there was a hole in my music collection for 2001 -- not for jazz or for contemporary classical, but for folk/rock -- zip, nada, nothing.  It was over a decade later that I finally discovered a few albums from that year that I had missed.  Now Lanegan's can join Chris Whitley's Rocket House as one of the best of that early-millennium interregnum.FIELD SONGS is a very strong set of songs, with fantastic, varied arrangements, all of course featuring Lanegan's great voice.  The two key musicians throughout are Mike Johnson, a frequent Lanegan collaborator, on guitars and keyboards, and Ben Shepherd, the Soundgarden bass player, on guitars.  While not entirely acoustic, this is folk and blues rock that doesn't get heavy or loud or rock out.I've been digging into Mark's back catalog based on his recent string of superb albums:  Blues Funeral (2012), Black Pudding (2013), and Phantom Radio (2014).  Don't miss them!Mark Lanegan is still making great music 14 years after this record came out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GJPU8SMOQ7G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005CCBF#wasThisHelpful","R1GJPU8SMOQ7G9","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am belatedly catching up with this album as I track down more and more of Mark Lanegan's music.  His recent work (Blues Funeral, Black Pudding, Phantom Radio) is as good or better than anything he's ever done, and I began to wonder, what have I missed along the way?Some say he plays a secondary role here to Greg Dulli (Afghan Whigs), but it's Mark's contribution that keeps me interested throughout.  Lanegan authors two songs, Dulli authors three, and the other seven are co-authored.  This is the first music of Dulli's that I've heard, and while he combines with Lanegan to produce a compelling sound, I am not sufficiently impressed to seek out his other recordings.Mathias Schneeberger is great on guitar, and either or he or Mario Lalli sounds exactly like Richard Thompson in the solo on Lanegan's ""Bete Noir.""  I was sure it *was* Thompson until I checked the liner notes.  Schneeberger also produces, along with the Gutter Twins.The 12-page Sub Pop booklet includes several garish color photos, but no lyrics.Strongly recommended to all Mark Lanegan fans!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10I93GE413ZVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012GJG38#wasThisHelpful","R10I93GE413ZVN","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thou is a sludge/doom metal band from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  The band distinguishes itself from most of its peers by providing lyrics for the songs in the 8-page booklet, which would otherwise be impossible to decipher since they are sung in a hoarse, rasping scream.The band's vision is summarized in the credits/dedication:""This record is dedicated to the feral outlaws, avatars of Nature's undomesticated virtue, in eternal war with the wretched prison called Civilization.""In the lyric to ""In Defiance of the Sages"" they say:""Destroy the past completely along with its abortive children: unauthentic present and rust-encrusted future.  Now, we will create ruins.  And after -- something new and unimagined.""Primitivist anarchists, apparently, it's probably best not to think of what their daily life looks like -- I don't imagine they live off the land in the swamps of southern Louisiana, and they clearly use electric power from the grid for their concerts and recordings.  I respect their vision, while respectfully disagreeing about the wisdom of destroying civilization.The music would not be nearly as harsh as it is without the screamed vocals.  The huge wall of guitar, bass and drums slowly advances in simple chord structures, and much of it is quite warm and beautiful.  There are quiet passages toward the end, and female vocals that make me think of Wolves in the Throne Room, the Earth First!-inspired black metal band from Washington State.I picked this up on the recommendation of Brandon Stosuy, who runs the Show No Mercy metal reviews section of Pitchfork.  Stosuy picked HEATHEN as the best metal album of 2014.  While not quite that enthusiastic, I can appreciate Thou's powerful social and musical vision.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KBZDS13AIDWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDZ5C20#wasThisHelpful","R1KBZDS13AIDWE","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great album from Dylan Carlson and company.Mark Lanegan sings on ""There Is a Serpent Coming"" and ""Rooks Across the Gate,"" and Rabia Shabeen Qazi sings on ""From the Zodiacal Light.""  I'm a big Lanegan fan, so this makes ""Primitive & Deadly"" even better than it would be otherwise.  I'm not familiar with Qazi, but her vocals are excellent as well.  Both singers contribute their own lyrics.Earth is one of those bands that is hard to classify -- I suppose most would call this album doom metal, but it sounds more bluesy and less metallic than much in that category.  One of the music's most important characteristics is that it is VERY SLOW.  To me it sounds like a Western landscape.The cover art by Samantha Muljat looks very familiar to me -- could it be based on a photo of Hutch's Pool, up the trail from the end of Sabino Canyon outside Tucson?  It may be that the psychedelic scene is what triggers the Western association in my mind and ear.One of the best metal albums of 2014.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZRS45W5D5MJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LID0PLM#wasThisHelpful","R2ZRS45W5D5MJC","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"YOB's latest is on Neurot Recordings, the record label of Neurosis, the seminal doom metal band from Oakland.  This is perfect -- the two bands pursue a similar heavy and serious sound.YOB is:Mike Scheidt -- guitar and vocalsAaron Rieseberg -- bassTravis Foster -- drumsAcross four long tracks, YOB clears the path, focusing intention on ascending to enlightenment.  Assisting in this journey is the excellent artwork of Orion Landau.Scheidt's lyrics are weighty and thought-provoking, similar to the Neurosis lyrics of Steve Von Till and Scott Kelly.  His vocals alternative between a hoarse bellow and a clear clean tone, as well as a high tenor that sounds like a woman's voice.  He sometimes harmonizes with himself.  Scheidt's guitar lays down huge dark riffs, with a second guitar track over it in places, adding texture and complexity.This is the first YOB album I've heard -- I look forward to going back to their previous releases.Clearly this is one of the best metal albums of 2014.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OXV34XU3ES6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZGTKVI#wasThisHelpful","R1OXV34XU3ES6I","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vindsval, the visionary mastermind of Blut Aus Nord, returns to his black metal roots with Memoria Vetusta III: Saturnian Poetry, planting the sound back on the Earth after forays into space on recent albums such as 777: Cosmosophy and the previous entry in this series, Memoria Vetusta II: Dialogue With the Stars (see my review).This is not raw, rough black metal though.  It is finely crafted with a huge, warm sound and majestic melodies conveyed by massed guitars.  The relentless drums drive the songs forward with powerful momentum, and the screaming black metal vocals are placed over the top, rather than submerged as on MVII: Dialogue.The cover art by Kristian Necrolord Wahlin is superb, a dark Tolkien-esque landscape.  The impeccable 12-page booklet includes lyrics, some in French, and some in English.  Included are poems by Baudelaire and Verlaine.Here is an English lyric:""By Her...By Me,I understand a being absolutely infinite,a substance consisting of an infinity of attributes,of which each one expresses an eternal and infinite essence.And from the One,substance of all things,emanates the Divine.""One of the best metal albums of 2014, without a doubt!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WQQX5UH8VOKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NB2BY1I#wasThisHelpful","R1WQQX5UH8VOKO","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just discovered this Ohio band.  I've been listening to post-rock/post-metal for several years now, and based on this album it seems that the Trees are quite proficient and quite consistent -- they do what they do quite well.Their sound is earnest and majestic and tragic.  I don't find RED FOREST to be as powerful as the best albums by other similar bands -- Pelican's The Fire in Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw or Russian Circles' Geneva (see my reviews of both) -- but it is certainly solid and worth hearing for anyone who enjoys instrumental post-rock/post-metal.One thing about the Trees and Pelican I find frustrating is that their cover art and song titles *and the name of this band!* very strongly hint at the theme of ecological destruction, catastrophic climate change in particular, without ever making clear that this is their intent.Wolves In the Throne Room and Agalloch, with vocals and lyrics, make clear their ecological message.  I hear one in this music as well, and I hope I am not just imagining it.

"Several years back I was looking for a ""Best of the Doors.""  At that time the only set available was missing ""Waiting for the Sun,"" one of the absolute best Doors songs, so I took a pass.I only now discovered this 2-disc set released in 2003 -- this is what I was looking for!I'm a Doors fan from way back, and for my purposes this LEGACY set comes very close to being the essential Doors collection.Disc One is an excellent selection from the first three albums -- THE DOORS (1967), STRANGE DAYS (1967), and WAITING FOR THE SUN (1968).Disc Two includes five cuts from L.A. WOMAN (1971) which are all great and the one track I want to hear from MORRISON HOTEL (1970), which is ""Waiting for the Sun."" (I've never understood why the song isn't on the album of the same name!)Unfortunately it does not include the one track I would want to hear from THE SOFT PARADE (1969), which is the title track.  But  it includes a vicious live recording of ""Gloria.""The long spoken word ""Celebration of the Lizard"" is for collectors only.I'm only docking LEGACY one star since it's only missing one essential track from across all six studio albums.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P8LR03PK3SUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AINOJ#wasThisHelpful","R2P8LR03PK3SUU","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whatever you think of Schnittke's symphonies, you cannot say that he just did the same thing over and over (as many have said, for instance, about Bruckner).  His First (1974) is a comedic, polystylistic, anarchic happening that openly mocks the solemnity of the classical tradition.  His Second  (1980) is ostensibly a religious choral symphony, though I doubt its appeal to the devout (see my review).  And the Third (1981), which he began years before, is his German Symphony, incorporating elements from across the entire span of German composers beginning with Bach.The Third is in four movements, but not the standard symphonic structure.  The opening (11'54) is a large, slowly building introduction that evokes the Rhine-music from the opening of Wagner's Ring (Das Rheingold).  Complete with waves, it builds to a great Wagnerian brass fanfare at the 3 1/2 minute mark.  After subsiding back to waves, there is another fanfare crescendo at the 7-minute mark, followed by an odd little tuba waltz, and then a passage of woozy folk melody with bells, leading to a final great fanfare at 10 1/2 minutes, and then a fade.  The entire span can be thought of as the emergence of the German Geist, a concept from the great German idealist philosopher Hegel.The Allegro (12'30) is the movement most commented on, ""developed from the monograms of more than thirty German composers,"" according to the composer, from Bach to Stockhausen.  It is a lively, vivacious piece, quite out of character for Schnittke, though it ends on a tragic note.  It is Bach whose stamp is felt most strongly here, quoted at the beginning and again at the end.  Some might amuse themselves with trying to identify composers, but the music is strong without engaging in the exercise.The Allegretto (7'15) is a powerful piece of writing, beginning with a passage that sounds like the music of Giants from Wagner's Ring, and continuing through stormy Wagnerian and Beethovenian passages.  Also uncharacteristic of Schnittke in its forthright muscular energy, this is a  powerful commentary on the dark side of the German experience.  I wish it was longer.Finally, the closing Adagio (16'55) is clearly out of place in the standard symphonic form.  But Schnittke's vision of and commentary on all things German is a tragic one, and so the vast Mahlerian adagio has to come last, like Mahler's 9th Symphony and Bruckner's unfinished 9th.I do believe the proportions are not quite right, and that is the main reason I give Schnittke's Third Symphony four stars instead of five.  The outer movements are too long, especially the Adagio, in comparison to the very strong, compact inner movements.I waited for several years for Chandos to release a Valery Polyansky recording of this symphony with his Russian State Symphony Orchestra, as there seemed to be a complete cycle in progress.  But none have been forthcoming since the excellent Sixth Symphony in 2004 (see my review), so I finally picked up this recording by Erik Klas and the Stockholm Philharmonic from the Swedish BIS label.  The musicianship cannot be faulted in the slightest -- only the cover art!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ME63UHTA8W8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000027EDR#wasThisHelpful","R2ME63UHTA8W8O","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've picked up the occasional Sun Ra disc over many years, and I have not found them all to be of the highest quality.  Ra was prolific, and he documented himself when no one else would on his El Saturn Records!This 2-disc set, though, is outstanding, compiled by alto saxophonist Marshall Allen, who played with Sun Ra for decades, and has led the band since the passing of Ra -- 20 tracks selected with care from the vast discography, originally recorded from 1957-1978.The 16-page booklet includes meticulous information on each track -- who plays on it, when it was recorded, where it originally appeared.  The interview with Marshall Allen gives some good insight into Ra and the band.  There are five great black-and-white photos by Val Wilmer, including one of the band with singer/dancer June Tyson in whirling motion.When I saw Sun Ra and the band live at the Chicago Jazz Festival in the Eighties they had a fairly conventional big band jazz sound, just strange around the edges, with Ra at the keyboards, June Tyson dancing, and the ""Space Is the Place"" chant.  Ra had gone back to his roots as arranger for the big band leader Fletcher Henderson.  I recall that they played very precisely, like a hive mind -- insect big band jazz!Most of the music here ""In the Orbit of Ra"" is more unconventional, with lots of grooving rhythms and Pan-African exotica.  There is one track (""Reflects Motion Part 2"") that features a smoking solo by tenor saxophonist John Gilmore, but for the most part it's more atmospheric than virtuosic.This is certainly a good way to hear Sun Ra, selected by the man who keeps the Arkestra going in the 21st century!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28Z0A7I4UFCZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M04USQU#wasThisHelpful","R28Z0A7I4UFCZK","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Listening to PHANTOM RADIO back to back with Blues Funeral, which I consider to be the best pop/rock album of 2012, it doesn't sound quite as good.  But in its own right it's one of the best albums of 2014, and after multiple listens it grows on me and I find its melodies in my head for hours.The first four songs are really strong:  Harvest Home, Judgement Time, Floor of the Ocean, and The Killing Season.  The rest of the album moves in a lighter pop direction by comparison until the powerful closing track: Death Trip to Tulsa.  At first I was not fully convinced by Seventh Day, I Am the Wolf, Torn Red Heart, or The Wild People.  Seventh Day features a ""la, la, la"" chorus which was initially jarring.  The Wild People struck me as lightweight (Lanegan is a dark bohemian -- isn't he ""wild""? -- why does he need to go hang out with wild people somewhere else?)  Torn Red Heart, with a Jesus & Mary Chain sound, is a love song (""You don't love me..."") that seemed out of character.But on repeated listening, PHANTOM RADIO sounds better and better.  Torn Red Heart and The Wild People have strong melodies that burn into the subconscious and bubble back up later.  The lyric to I Am the Wolf can sound cliched and over-the-top, but with Alain Johannes's guitar and Lanegan's voice carrying you along, it overcomes that reaction.As with BLUES FUNERAL, Lanegan's secret weapon is Alain Johannes on guitars, bass, keyboards, and production.  Jack Irons is the drummer.  As on that previous MLB album there are lots of Eighties retro sounds, mainly produced by synthesizer keyboards, but these are just the raw materials for something new.Lanegan is on a roll, continuing to make some of the best pop/rock music of recent years.(Don't overlook Black Pudding (2013) with Duke Garwood either!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3671SU8RKZXKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXILUBU#wasThisHelpful","R3671SU8RKZXKT","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Barry Guy, bassist, bandleader, and composer extraordinaire, has been extensively documented by the Intakt Records label based in Switzerland.  This superb compilation is a Guy sampler across recordings on the Intakt label as well as Maya Recordings, the label of Guy and his wife, Maya Homburger, which is distributed by Intakt.  The oldest recording goes back to 1972, and the most recent is from 2006.As Guy explains in the liner notes:  ""I have tried through the documented albums to create a scenario that suggests a compositional approach to the structuring of the musical fragments.  Through this selection of pieces I hope that the listener is tempted to search out these and other albums on Intakt Records and Maya Recordings where the full picture can be heard.""He succeeds wonderfully in creating a compelling album from diverse sources.  By the time I discovered Barry Guy's music, his London Jazz Composers Orchestra had ceased to exist.  Intakt reissued the early LJCO albums, originally recorded for other labels, and issued several new ones through 1998.  But I could never figure which of the nine albums to hear first, and so I still hadn't heard any of them until now.Included here are the following LJCO extracts:Ode, Part 1 (9'04) from the album Ode (1972)Harmos (7'16) from the album Harmos (1989)Sleeping Furiously, Part 3 (5'15) from the album Three Pieces for Orchestra (1995)Double Trouble (6'27) from the album Double Trouble (1989)Featured are superb improvisers playing Guy's compositions, including Evan Parker, Paul Rutherford, Marilyn Crispell, Paul Dunmall, Barre Phillips, and many others.  Guy's compositions include powerful, melodic themes, which might surprise those who have heard only his playing with the free improv Parker/Guy/Lytton trio.  These excerpts make a strong case for the music of the LJCO, and there is plenty more -- nine discs worth.Guy includes three solo bass pieces from two albums:  Fizzles (1993), and Symmetries (2002).  The Parker/Guy/Lytton trio is represented with ""Agreement"" from the Maya album Imaginary Values (1993).  A Guy/Parker duet is taken from the Birds and Blades album (2001).Two other trios are included:  the Spanish piano trio of Agusti Fernandez, Ramon Lopez, and Guy from the album Aurora (2006), and the trio of Guy, his wife Maya Homburger on baroque violin, and Pierre Favre on percussion from the album Dakryon (2004).Finally, there is an excerpt from the first Barry Guy New Orchestra album Inscape-Tableaux (2000), a 10-member ensemble that replaced the LJCO, which became increasingly difficult to convene due to its size.  Since then the BGNO has released two more albums, and they are all excellent.I only own three of the many albums represented here in PORTRAIT, and so for me this is a great way to hear more of Barry Guy's music in a form compiled by Guy himself.  The great Guy/Crispell/Lytton trio is sadly not included, but I have all three of their albums, so it is others who will miss out, not me!  (I consider their best to be Ithaca (2004).)*** *** ***The package for this collection goes beyond what we come to expect.  The CD insert contains all the details on the recording and musicians for each track.  In addition there is an 88-page color booklet in English and German with essays and photos, including the album covers of all Guy's recordings for both the Intakt and Maya labels.BARRY GUY: PORTRAIT is essential for any fan of Barry Guy that doesn't already have all the recordings!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3164IFH4RI0MV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NO2EV6#wasThisHelpful","R3164IFH4RI0MV","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 80-minute disc presents eight duo and trio improvisations from Free Zone Appleby 2004, presented as part of the annual Appleby Jazz Festival.  The recordings are from Ancient Space in St. Michael's Church in Appleby, England on July 25, 2004.The musicians are:Barry Guy -- bassEvan Parker -- soprano saxophonePaul Lytton -- percussionPhilipp Wachsmann -- violin, electronicsJoel Ryan -- live processingThe shifting line-up of players is organized with mathematical precision to result in a fascinating diversity of textures.  Four duos of acoustic players, each paired with Ryan's computer processing (Wachsmann, then Guy, then Lytton, then Parker) alternate with trios of the other three acoustic players without Ryan.The overall pattern of continuities and contrasts is amazing!Parker plays soprano exclusively, and his bright, darting sound is at far remove from the jazz tradition.  Lytton likewise is a marvel of diverse scrapings and knockings, none of which resemble a standard jazz drumkit.  The two string players provide a wealth of sounds, high and low, that are more or less recognizable as emanating from their standard instruments.The Parker/Guy/Lytton trio sounds great here, as do the trios with Wachsmann replacing Guy and Wachsmann replacing Parker.  The Parker/Guy/Wachsmann trio I find to be a special treat, as it can be contrasted with the Iskra 1903 trio of Paul Rutherford/Guy/Wachsmann.I am very happy to have caught up with this Psi disc nine years later!I have it filed under Evan Parker -- EP's duo with Ryan is 18 minutes long, the longest piece, and the electroacoustic dimension created by Joel Ryan can be seen as an extension of the Evan Parker Electroacoustic Ensemble -- but it is truly egalitarian, cooperative music that represents an ideal of human interaction.(verified purchase from Squidco)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFJOOPBA36EJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A7IHD0#wasThisHelpful","RFJOOPBA36EJK","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TRANSIENT is the latest album from Neill Jameson and Krieg, and it is a powerful statement from a veteran practioner of U.S. black metal -- Jameson (aka Imperial) has been at it since the mid-Nineties, long before most listening to it today knew it existed.The current line-up is Jameson on vocals and acoustic guitar, A. Poole and D. Zdanavage on guitar, D. Sykes on bass, and J. Dost on drums.  The sound is immediately recognizable as black metal, but without the tremolo guitar one often hears.  This is a more bass-heavy assault, and it is warmer than the icy blasts you may have heard elsewhere.  There are significant doom elements, as well as electronic segments and psychedelic aspects.Thurston Moore and Dwid Hellion trade off with spoken word vocals on ""Home,"" (the only lyric included with the disc), and while this provides welcome contrast, I don't consider it to be the best moment of the album overall.  Jameson's rasping, roaring vocals can't be understood, but that's fine -- they serve as another instrument, and it's the feeling that matters.  There are strong melodic passages, especially in ""Ruin Our Lives,"" and this adds to the power of the 11-track album.Every review I've read speaks of its sense of bleakness, but that's not the impression I get at all.  For me it's much like Neurosis -- an implacable sense of stoic resolve and perseverence in the face of world that is very far from being a cheerful utopia.  (Krieg means war in German.)In short, TRANSIENT is an excellent metal album for 2014.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX1PEWK6MH71B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LUSUWR2#wasThisHelpful","RX1PEWK6MH71B","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Yep Roc set was compiled by John Doe himself (given name: John Nommensen Duchac), 21 tracks from his 8 solo albums since 1990.  It sounds fantastic, and certainly serves as great introduction to a superb body of music.  It is not necessary for a hard-core fan who already has all of those albums, but for the rest of us?  Awesome.Here are the tracks and the albums they're from, numbered by their sequence here:Meet John Doe (1990)5) Take #52 (unreleased version), 19) Dying to Get HomeKissingsohard (1995)7) Safety, 8) Love Knows, 20) Tragedy By DefinitionFor the Rest of Us (1998) reissued as For the Best of Us (2006)2) A Step Outside,Freedom Is...

(2000).  There are 8 songs here from the three albums I don't have (Dim Stars, Forever Hasn't Happened Yet, and Keeper), and they sound excellent in this context -- there isn't a bad track!Doe has a great voice, he's a great songwriter, he always assembles a great band, and he is often joined by great female singers -- in X it was Exene Cervenka, and here it might be Kathleen Edwards, Neko Case, Jill Sobule, or Aimee Mann.Doe's sensibility combines romantic yearning and punk anger.  He has long been one of my favorites -- seeing him live in Salt Lake City in 2000 was awesome! -- and I hope this album serves to make his music known to a wider audience that doesn't realize what it's missing!*** *** ***The package is excellent, a vinyl LP-style cardboard fold-out with no jewel case.

"When did Elliott Sharp, the avant-garde guitarist, start playing the saxophone?While not a virtuoso, at least as far as this album reveals, Sharp holds his own quite well in the context of a quintet playing 11 of his compositions.  He plays tenor and soprano sax and bass clarinet, with Nate Wooley of the U.K. on trumpet, the young Terry L. Green on trombone, Brad Jones on bass, and Ches Smith on drums.It has been noted that this is the most jazz-oriented music of E#'s long career.  It is not mainstream jazz, that's for sure, but some of it falls on the free jazz side of the free jazz/free improv divide in avant-garde improvised music.  Nate Wooley has years of experience playing with Eddie Prevost (AMM) and other leading British free improv musicians, and there are free improv passages that approach the speed and density of Parker/Guy/Lytton.But one of the chief characteristics of this set is the use of smeared horns, both trumpet and trombone, bringing to mind Louie Armstrong and Dixieland jazz as refracted through the post-free jazz sounds of Lester Bowie (Art Ensemble of Chicago) and Roswell Rudd.  The rhythm section is powerfully propulsive in places.  These elements represent the African-American free jazz influence.Overall, this is insouciant music with a quick, humorous sensibility.  ""Blues for Butch,"" written I assume for the late Butch Morris, the NYC trumpeter and inventor of ""conduction,"" is indeed a blues number, the closest Sharp comes here to the sound of his Terraplane project.  The last piece, ""Cherenkov Light,"" is process music that unfolds slowly and eerily, sounding much like AMM.This is an excellent hour-long album that incorporates its free jazz and free improv influences into a compelling synthesis!(verified purchase from Squidco)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROCYCKMGJLEWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G1V15OC#wasThisHelpful","ROCYCKMGJLEWT","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marty Ehrlich is an alto saxophonist, a composer, a bandleader, and a professor of music at Hampshire College.  He worked closely with Julius Hemphill for many years, and carries on in Hemphill's tradition while developing his own body of music.  (See Julius Hemphill: The Complete Remastered Recordings for a great collection of Hemphill's music, in addition to his many recordings with the World Saxophone Quartet.)This is the second recording of Erlich's Rites Quartet, both on the Clean Feed Label.  (Unfortunately the first, Things Have Got to Change, released in 2009, is currently unavailable on CD and so I haven't heard it.)  Recorded in 2011, this is a great album with seven Ehrlich compositions and superb playing by:Marty Ehrlich -- alto and soprano sax, fluteJames Zollar -- trumpetHank Roberts -- celloMichael Sarin -- drumsThis is a variation on one of my favorite jazz ensembles -- a sax/trumpet/bass/drums quartet.  The twist here is the substitution of cello for bass, which follows Hemphill going back to the great Dogon A.D. (1972) album with Abdul Wadud on cello.  While informed by free jazz, this is not avant-garde music.  There is a mixture of up-tempo and slow songs, with strong rhythm and melody, rooted in the blues -- just solid, mainstream jazz.The title track, ""Frog Leg Logic,"" gets things off to a hopping start with its catchy rhythm.  ""Ballade"" is tricky, because it shifts part way from a beautiful, sad ballad to a funky blues.  ""You Can Beat the Slanted Cards"" is another up-tempo toe-tapper with a tricky rhythm.  The lovely ""Solace"" features Ehrlich on flute.  The closing number, ""The Gravedigger's Respite,"" is another up-tempo piece.Despite the fact that Roberts and Sarin are new to the group (replacing Erik Friedlander and Pheeroan Aklaff from the first album), the quartet sounds like it has been playing together for years.  Ehrlich and Zollar are magnificent throughout.The Clean Feed disc comes in a cardboard foldout like a miniature vinyl LP, with a plastic insert for the disc.  I realize this is relevant to fewer and fewer people as MP3s and streaming replaces the CD, but I remain old school for now.(verified purchase from Squidco)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CXON2NB4M989/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006DLIDRW#wasThisHelpful","R1CXON2NB4M989","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Trio 3 first formed in the early Nineties (their Live in Willisau album, recorded in 1992, was my pick for best jazz album of the year for 1998), bringing together as equals and co-leaders Oliver Lake on alto sax, best known for his long tenure with the World Saxophone Quartet, Reggie Workman on bass, best known for playing with Coltrane on the 1961 Live At The Village Vanguard sessions, and Andrew Cyrille on drums, best known for being (at least in my opinion) Cecil Taylor's best drummer.This is the fourth and latest Trio 3 album on the Swiss Intakt label to feature a guest pianist (following recordings with IrÃ¨ne Schweizer, Geri Allen and Jason Moran).  This time it's the incredible Vijay Iyer, who is known for his speed, drive, and rhythmic complexity, but this is not a Vijay Iyer album, and here he blends magnificently with his elders.  (Workman was born in 1937, Cyrille in 1939, and Lake in 1942.  Iyer was born in 1971!)The pianist brings two compositions -- the opening ""The Prowl,"" which opens with a funky bass line, and the moving ""Suite for Trayvon (and Thousands More)"" in three parts, a highlight of the album.  Workman contributes ""Synapse II"" and ""Willow Song,"" a lovely ballad that followers of the bassist may have heard before.  Two compositions are by Lake -- ""Shave,"" and the title cut, ""Wiring.""  The album closes with the latest recording of Cyrille's ""Tribute to Bu,"" which he wrote for Art Blakey, the great drummer and bandleader.The great Amiri Baraka wrote the liner notes.  He died between the August 2013 recording and the album's release in 2014, and he will be missed.  The 12-page Intakt booklet also includes color photos of the musicians.  The cover art is by Oliver Lake.These master musicians have at their disposal the entire history of jazz.  This is post-bop, broadly speaking, and there are avant elements that some traditional jazz listeners might find challenging.  But this is not really avant-garde music -- it is solidly in the African-American tradition, with strong melody and swinging rhythm, up-tempo numbers and slower ones, including ballads.  It moves outside, but it comes back in!I haven't heard the other ""Trio 3 + guest pianist"" albums, so I can't compare, but in its own right this is an excellent album, sure to be one of the best of 2014!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT4PHNJALMMZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEZP5HI#wasThisHelpful","RT4PHNJALMMZ9","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This solo electro-acoustic concert was recorded at Cafe Teufelhart in Dachau, Germany on May 16, 2007.  Elliott Sharp (E#), avant-garde guitarist, composer, and electronics wizard, was 56 at the time.  For over 70 minutes, Sharp plays with incredible technical virtuosity.The music is frenetic, with great forward drive.  Classical and blues styles are most prominent in Sharp's playing.  ""Dachau 1"" (18'28) has Bach-like passages and is on amplified acoustic guitar alone.  My one criticism is that there are times when a figure is obsessively repeated before finally moving on.For ""Dachau 2"" (22'35) and ""Dachau 3"" (25'11) Sharp makes use of his laptop to electronically modify his own guitar, adding loops and other effects.  Exactly how he does this I'm not sure -- I'd love to see a performance!  ""Dachau Encore"" (7'28) is all blues, played with slide guitar, which E# has been pursuing for many years with his Terraplane project.He explains that ""[o]ne might call the music a live remix of my various solo programs for electro-acoustic guitar.  Some of the themes are well-documented on the solo CDs 'Velocity of Hue' and 'Quadrature' -- others, unnamed, appear suddenly and then disappear after revealing their nature.""As anyone would expect who is even slightly familiar with Sharp, this is cerebral, challenging music -- a far cry from Leo Kottke: 6 & 12 String Guitar!  Sharp takes us on a journey -- strap yourself in, because he takes us to places we've never been before, in wonder the whole way at the unexpected twists and turns.*** *** ***It is not entirely clear what the listener is to make of the album's title, or the choice of this particular concert to release as opposed to the others on the tour.  On the one hand it is a Concert IN Dachau, not a Concert ABOUT Dachau.  There are no vocals, no lyrics, and no obviously tragic aspects to the music.  On the other hand, the cover is forbidding, though totally abstract, and Sharp does address the location in the liner notes:""I was quite surprised when I found out from Steffen about the booking in Dachau as this is one of those place-names that have become synonymous with human atrocity...  As the Jewish son of a Holocaust survivor, performing in Dachau was especially resonant.""So it seems that the terrible history was on Sharp's mind, and perhaps it should be on ours as well as we listen and ponder.He adds, and I feel compelled to add as well so as not to alter his meaning through omission:  ""Despite the weight of the Holocaust, I'm angered in the way that contemporary Jewry acts as if they own all to themselves all of the suffering of WW2, all of the extermination, all of the death, and that it gives them license to do any brutality to the Palestinians who just happened to be living [some for thousands of years] in ""their"" Promised Land.""He goes on to point out that there were other groups targeted by Hitler, and many other genocides in places including the U.S.S.R., China, Cambodia, Rwanda, and Iraq (the victims of the U.S. invasion and war).So perhaps this should *all* be on our minds as we listen.But if what you're looking for is music that expresses the unfathomable tragedy of war and genocide, I would recommend Shostakovich's  Symphony No. 8 instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PAMXXQ5TDS6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001673V8Y#wasThisHelpful","R2PAMXXQ5TDS6H","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The indefatigable Fred Anderson (1929-2010) was a fixture of the free jazz scene in Chicago for decades.  While not technically a founder, he was there very early in the activities of the AACM (Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians), founded in 1965 by Muhal Richard Abrams and others.  I lived in Chicago for the decade of the 1980s, and I used to hear Fred, usually with a trio, at least once a year at the annual Underground Fest, the afterfest of the Chicago Jazz Festival in August.  Fred's performance was invariably a highlight -- he was our very own Coltrane!His unique stance was leaning over with the top of his head pointed straight at the audience as he expounded seemingly endlessly and always totally compellingly on the tenor.  A couple of the best recordings of Fred are from 1979 The Missing Link and 1980 The Milwaukee Tapes, and while not perhaps in his prime at 50, he had more energy and his musical vision was stronger then than this and his other late recordings.  Fred's sound was his own, with a dark tragic tone, and his style was solidly rooted in the bebop of Charlie Parker, with elements of Gene Ammons and Sonny Rollins, but extended into the post-Ornette land of the free.What we have here is a 2-disc live recording at Johnston State College in Vermont on December 12, 2004.  Fred is joined by the top-notch rhythm section of Hamid Drake on drums, whose percussion career started playing with Fred from a young age, and William Parker, NYC bassist extraordinaire.  Compared to those Eighties performances I saw/heard in Chicago, this music is more varied, and less austere and serious.  Parker and Drake engage in all sorts of moves, incorporating funk and R&B grooves, which sometimes draws Fred into a more light-hearted style.The first disc is one uninterrupted 44-minute performance.  Disc Two is in three parts -- a 37-minute performance, followed by two shorter pieces of 13 and 14 minutes respectively.  On track 2, Parker plays the south Indian wind instrument called the nagaswaram rather than bass.  I am completely unimpressed by this, and so I prefer to skip this track.  However, what remains is easy to recommend with five stars!Fred Anderson was better documented in the last decade of his life than he had ever been, and this 2005 Eremite release was one of many albums issued in that period.  Hence I missed it at the time and am only now hearing it nine years later.Better late than never -- Fred Anderson is one of my favorite saxophonists, and this is a great late performance!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWEUHWPZ0LHSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A0GP5E#wasThisHelpful","RWEUHWPZ0LHSP","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It looks like this will stand as Ornette Coleman's last music, barring posthumous releases.  He was 75 when it was recorded, live in Germany, in 2005.Most of the compositions are either taken from previous albums or are slightly modified versions of pieces from previous albums.  The new pieces, including the opening ""Jordan,"" sound terrific.  Ornette's quartet is his son Denardo on drums and two basses -- Greg Cohen, well-known for his work with John Zorn, and Tony Falanga, whose bowed playing sounds like a different instrument from Cohen's, adding textural variety as well as another lead voice at times, bringing to mind the original quartet with Don Cherry on trumpet.Other than the unique two-bass instrumentation, there is really nothing new here for Ornette.  His playing will sound very familiar to anyone who has been following him for years as I have.  He still has that great, piercing cry on the alto sax, and a unique style of trumpet-playing as well.  What makes SOUND GRAMMAR better than any of his recordings since SONG X of 1985 (see my review) is the high energy level.  He and the quartet clearly rose to the occasion that night in Ludwigshafen!*** *** ***Ornette was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music for this album, and we have the Pulitzer committee to thank for bending the rules.  As it turns out, the prize is awarded for new compositions.  The compositions on SOUND GRAMMAR were 1) not new, and 2) not even submitted to the committee!  Clearly the committee wanted to give Ornette the award -- they went out, bought the album, and gave him the award rather than any of the dozens of submissions.  As I see it, this is overdue just recognition for an award Ornette deserved for his pioneering music of 1959-1962, his Atlantic recordings.And while SOUND GRAMMAR is not on the same level as those great recordings, it is excellent and well worth hearing.I will miss Ornette -- he was a gentle, beautiful soul who was tenacious and uncompromising in his unique artistic vision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZJ4PF5Z7RKHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GFRE76#wasThisHelpful","RZJ4PF5Z7RKHZ","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marc Ribot is known for two things -- his superb role as a hired guitarist on all sorts of recordings (such as Tom Waits: Rain Dogs and T Bone Burnett: The Criminal Under My Own Hat), and his role as an avant-garde guitarist and composer, a key player in the Downtown NYC scene for decades.Here we hear Ribot in an entirely different context -- solo guitar music, mainly acoustic, composed for films.  As Ribot explains in the liner notes:""This is an album of film music: some were pieces originally composed for movie scores, others for films I turned down but found myself writing for anyway, still others for projects that never existed outside of my head.  All have been transcribed/re-imagined as solo guitar pieces... ...The title and some of the compositions were also inspired by my experience preparing for a live accompaniment of the Charlie Chaplin film ""The Kid"" at Merkin Hall in January 2010 as part of the NY Guitar Festival.""""Natalia"" and ""Requiem for a Revolution"" were composed for ""The General,"" a documentary film directed by Natalia Almada.  ""Delancey Waltz,"" ""Fat Man Blues,"" and ""Bateau"" were originally composed for the motion picture ""Drunk Boat,"" produced by JD Foster.  ""Variation 1,"" ""Flicker,"" ""Requiem for a Revolution,"" ""Postcard from N.Y.,"" and ""Sous le ciel de Paris"" feature textured electronic soundscapes by Keefus Ciancia.While there is variety from track to track -- ""Natalia"" for instance is electric and ""Fat Man Blues"" is humorous -- overall, the mood is melancholy.  It is more folk than jazz, with evocative melodies that seem to transport the listener back in time to remembered scenes, some urban, some bucolic.This is warm, human music that communicates through feeling rather than through dazzling technique.SILENT MOVIES presents a little-known side of Marc Ribot's sensibility, and we are the better for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNOF0PSRLY8SN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003X2O6IO#wasThisHelpful","RNOF0PSRLY8SN","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a recording from June 2002 in Chicago, a ballads session from Peter Brotzmann (alto & tenor sax), Joe McPhee (tenor sax, pocket cornet, & trumpet), Kent Kessler (double bass), and Michael Zerang (drums & percussion).  Ballads?  Yes, that was the concept informing this excellent meeting.  According to the liner notes, Brotzmann and McPhee first met in 1977, didn't play together until 20 years later in the Peter Brotzmann Chicago Tentet, which also included Kessler and Zerang.This is an excellent album, certainly for anyone who enjoys the music of either Brotz or McPhee.  It is rooted in the blues, in ballads expressing a deep mournfulness, but it is by no means traditional sounding.  It does lean more toward American free jazz than most European free improvisation.  It is more melodic and conventionally structured than many Brotzmann recordings, based on themes rather than being totally free.Six of the eleven pieces are by McPhee (Stone Poems No. 1 and 2, Something There Is That Doesn't Love, Alto Lightning in A Violin Sky, In Anticipation of the Next, and Pieces of Red, Green and Blue), three are by Brotzmann (Master of a Small House, From Now Till Doomsday, and Do You Still Love Me/Did I Ever?), one is by Zerang (Cymbalism) and one is traditional, brought to the session by Brotzmann (Blessed Assurance).The Swiss Hat Hut label was founded in the Seventies to document Joe McPhee's music, so in that sense this can be considered more a McPhee album than a Brotzmann album -- it's Brotz's only recording for the label as far as I know.In short, an excellent and unique session, one of the best of 2004, well worth checking out for any devotees of avant jazz/improv!(verified purchase from Cadence Magazine)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R91AYOFZQKMNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00020P77E#wasThisHelpful","R91AYOFZQKMNU","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a recording of Peter Brotzmann's Chicago Tentet from early on, May 1999, at the Festival de Musique de Actuelle in Victoriaville, Quebec.  It was mastered and released the following year, 2000.  The group formed initially in 1997, and its first release was in 1998.  That 3-disc set won the Cadence Magazine readers' poll for Best Album of 1998.This is an incredible 37 minute performance with the line-up of:Peter Brotzmann, Mats Gustafsson, Ken Vandermark -- saxophones & reedsJeb Bishop -- tromboneToshinori Kondo -- trumpet, electronicsFred Lomborg-Holm -- cello, violinWilliam Parker, Kent Kessler -- bassHamid Drake, Michael Zerang -- drumsThere is great variety and contrast as the piece progresses, with plenty of room for the musicians to solo as well as play as part of the great roar of the full ensemble.Back on those early days, the Tentet improvised based on compositions like ""Stone/Water,"" compositions that were basic structures, not fully notated scores.  Starting in 2006 or so the use of compositions was dropped entirely, and since then performances have been 100% improvised.If you have found this review, I'm pretty sure you already know you enjoy this type of music.

"This was the first recording by the trio of Peter Brotzmann, reeds; Peeter Uuskyla, drums; and Peter Friis Nielsen, electric bass.  Drummer Uuskyla produced the original 1999 Slask release, and this 2010 Jazzwerkstatt reissue is very welcome.  The three Peters -- Brotz of Germany, Uuskyla of Sweden, and Friis Nielsen of Denmark -- were recorded live at Bohus Sound Recording in Sweden.The music is entirely improvised.  As Uuskyla says in the liner notes:  ""...[T]his music is very abstract.  No notes, no pre-arrangements or even pre-prepared structures, no nothing.  Just three music instruments...""  (The quote I've used as my review title is taken from Uuskyla's liner notes.)  This 2010 reissue adds a bonus track recorded live in Sweden in 2001 following 9/11/01, called ""Nine-Eleven-Blues.""This is a great set!  The first album I heard by this trio was Medicina (2004).  It features greater variety as the pieces are all compositions by the three musicians, and I think it is even better than NOISE OF WINGS.  But if you enjoy Brotz's energy music, this is fantastic.  No delicacy, little melody, just strong, intense expression.  Brotzmann plays tenor on five tracks, and clarinet and tarogato on two.The metaphorical theme for this album and this group is birds in flight, the ""noise of wings.""  These are no doves, or songbirds, but rather huge, enraged, prehistoric birds that feel the onset of climate change, and are not going quietly into the night of extinction!Brotz has many projects, many of them documented on Long Story Short (2013), and as far as I know this trio has not been recorded again since 2004, but it deserves to be!(verified purchase from Dussmann in Berlin)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34RON7O26D8CE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002FAXFJ6#wasThisHelpful","R34RON7O26D8CE","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Free Jazz Quartet is a rather obscure British band that only recorded one album, Premonitions, in 1989.  The FJQ is Paul Rutherford on trombone, Harrison Smith on tenor sax, soprano sax, and bass clarinet, Tony Moore on cello, and Eddie Prevost on drums.  This 1992 live recording from Bristol, only retrieved from the vault and released in 2010, doubles their discography!  Both albums, both live concert recordings, are on the Matchless label run by Eddie Prevost, best-known from the seminal free improv ensemble AMM.""Memories for the Future"" is gentler than ""Premonitions,"" which had a sense of urgency running through it captured by titles like ""Red Flags,"" ""Gathering Clouds,"" and ""Tocsin.""  Rutherford was an intransigent old-school communist, and the marxist element was apparent as well in the photo of the four band members assembled like a propaganda-style picture of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Mao.  Here the militancy is gone, and what remains is the vision and embodiment of egalitarianism.There is no indication that the eight pieces are compositions.  All seem to be totally free improvisations, one (""Octavian Law"") a solo by Prevost.  There is no ""front line"" and ""rhythm section"" -- all four players are lead players, taking turns initiating new turns and segments.  Rutherford and Smith lead off on ""A Fertile Valley"" with slow intertwining lines and are eventually joined by Moore and Prevost.  Moore leads on ""Pulsate,"" establishing a funky rhythm that the others join.  Prevost starts ""Summoning"" with some atmospheric percussion, ""summoning"" the others to join.  The final piece, ""Blurring of Boundaries,"" has a moving, elegiac feel.There are passages, including ""Vibrations,"" where Smith's saxophone actually plays melodies and sounds more like a Sixties Blue Note album than we expect from the British free improv tradition.  I suspect that, although these are not compositions, Moore's funky rhythm and Smith's melodies may have been used regularly as the band toured, certainly apropos the name -- free jazz, rather than free improv.  Prevost can certainly play swinging jazz if he wants to, I know from hearing him on other recordings, but this session doesn't feature anything approaching a driving, propulsive beat.This is a great document of a movement and a little-known ensemble.  It is essential of course for fans of the late Paul Rutherford.  Anyone who admires Eddie Prevost based on his work with AMM or many other musicians should not miss it.  Harrison Smith and Tony Moore are not as well known, but they contribute here to music that is truly fine.The title is evocative, referring, I take it, both to the musical and political liberation movements of the Sixties that lived on for many years but which seem to have either died out or exist in extremely weakened form today.  Remembering that egalitarian vision as we listen to this music can inspire us to continue to act to bring about that imagined Future!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13GWJ4L7ZOXPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003MNIEZK#wasThisHelpful","R13GWJ4L7ZOXPY","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This early 2007 recording, released in 2008, is the latest batch of compositions from NYC alto saxophonist Rob Brown.  It is a departure from his two previous quartet sessions, Jumping Off the Page (2000) and The Big Picture (2004), both superb, and both of which featured the late trumpeter Roy Campbell, Jr. -- this time instead of trumpet, Brown is joined by Craig Taborn on piano (and electronics), while William Parker plays bass and Gerald Cleaver plays drums.Between Brown's angular compositions and the alto-piano interaction, CROWN TRUNK ROOT FUNK has the classic sound of a Sixties Blue Note album like Eric Dolphy's Out to Lunch (1964), and it is more introspective and subdued than those previous quartet sessions, with a cool, crystalline sound.My favorite tracks are ""Clearly Speaking"" and ""Exuberance,"" which are the most up-tempo with the fieriest solos and the most energetic interactions.  ""Lifeboat"" also increases in velocity as it moves toward land, becoming an excellent vehicle for the band.  Parker's ability to bow high on the bass and sound like a horn is remarkable.  The closing ballad, ""Worlds Spinning,"" is tragically beautiful, a meditation on worlds spinning in violent and unenlightened ways (think of Iraq in 2007).  Brown's sound here is powerfully moving.""Rocking Horse"" is based on a repeated three-note motif played by Parker.  Like ""Ghost Dog,"" it moves deliberately, setting all four players in clear relief, and works within a clear structure as opposed to a free blowing improvisation.  I find the longest piece, ""Sonic Ecosystem"" (11'15) to be the least engaging.  It features Taborn's electronics as a tableaux against which the other instruments move slowly, almost statically.  On the one hand it serves to provide variety and texture to the album as a whole, but Taborn's electronics are not used nearly as effectively as they are on Tim Berne's Science Friction Live (2003).Rob Brown has been one of my favorite jazz musicians and one of my favorite alto saxophonists for years.  I recommend this album to anyone who also enjoys Brown's music, and to anyone interested in the best jazz of our time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PYJV6J9WY78O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013RDZY2#wasThisHelpful","R2PYJV6J9WY78O","A30RI0AJ4CQBU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30RI0AJ4CQBU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I dropped my ASUS Transformer so I needed a tablet to replace it. Since I only used it to read research papers in PDF I decided to give this cheap tablet a try. The first issue I had was that this tablet did not come with a PDF reader/viewer installed. So I needed to config WIFI in order to connect to the app store. The tablet shows a strong signal is being received. It connects but when you try to browse or go to the app store it disconnects but still show the signal is 100% or just wont reconnect. I thought maybe it was the security on my router so I turned everything off and still the same thing.After 4 days of trying I was able to get it to connect to download the PDF reader but the WIFI connection is pretty unstable. The second issue I have is the back of the tablet is very flimsy. When I am holding it the impression from my fingers on the back shows on the screen. The light of the screen and the quality of the screen is not the best, it gives of a funny glare/ mirror tint look from certain angles. The camera quality is not the best either, images look washed out.If you are looking for a disposable tablet then you can give this a try. if you are looking for something to connect to WIFI to check emails and browse while you are on the go , you might want to get something else the WIFI on this is too erratic.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZNVP63ULP68T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFID3AC#wasThisHelpful","RZNVP63ULP68T","A1AKW788238PWQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AKW788238PWQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This past year I've sort of gotten into small digital cameras. First I bought a dash-cam for my car, and then later purchased one of the Polaroid Cube's and a Mobius action camera. Since then I've been thinking of getting one of the quad-copters to either use with one of those cameras or one with it's own camera. Problem is I don't really know anyone who actually has some to ask for advice. So I was happy when I was offered an advance copy of this Dummies book on the subject.I have to say it's very informative - I've been able to find answers to my questions and to ones that I hadn't even thought to ask. This book isn't the end-all be-all source of information on drones/quad-copters, but I would have to say that it's a good place to start. I'd recommend it to someone like me - starting from scratch with little or no prior knowledge.Still haven't decided if I'm going to buy one - besides learning about them, I want to first try some out and see how easy they are to operate.

"This game is played a bit different than the regular Monopoly games. There are some similarities though. You get four tokens (and passports), so that seems to limit the number of people who can play. The object of the game is to collect passport stamps - the person to fill their passport first wins. The game starts off with all the major stamps placed on the board - a specific sized one for each property. There are some generic gray stamps that stay in the bank. Landing on a spot you have the option to buy that stamp or it can get auctioned off. When a player lands on a spot that you have the stamp for - the owner is paid a 'Visitor Fee' (basically like rent in the regular game). Another difference are the Here & Now cards and the Chance cards. I think these are what makes the game fun to play. The things the cards can let you do makes the game challenging - just when you think you're going to get ahead, another player can use one of their cards and put a damper on your play. Makes for some lively social interactions (if you get my drift). The dice is a bit different - one die has a icon in the place of the 1 pip (sort of reminds me of the speed die). That icon is the 'Sneaky Swap', it can also still be the 1 in some rolls.Overall I have to say I've enjoyed trying out this new game (can't say the same for everybody here). I think we're still getting use to the way the game plays compared to regular Monopoly. The games tend to be a bit short - about an hour, but that might be because we still stop a bit and look at the rules to figure out what we're doing. Plus, given the different international locations on the board, we sometimes stop and an go look up where something is. (Helps to keep a globe handy). Fun game - and a bit educational.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10BL1G6ORT3ME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00THAGEL8#wasThisHelpful","R10BL1G6ORT3ME","A34VV0DDR0OFE5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34VV0DDR0OFE5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Basic electric alarm clock. I like the large numbers. Purchased this to replace my old clock radio alarm clock, one that I've been using for more than 30 years. Hated to have to replace it. This new clock is fairly small and is just an alarm clock, which is fine for my needs. The alarm is a fairly annoying piezoelectric sounder that intermediately buzzes when the alarm goes off. There is a huge snooze button on top of the clock, but to actually turn the alarm off you have to find the slider switch on the back and use that. Problem is there is an identical slider switch on the other side of the clock (which is what you use to set the time & alarm). Hopefully I'll get in the habit of using knowing with to use.Setting the clock up timewise couldn't have been easier.

My only issue is that I think I might have liked it better if I had read some of the previous books before this one. I do plan on picking up the first in the series and reading that too.Like I mentioned, the action/intrigue/thriller genre is a favorite of mine and with this novel you get a lot of that. The story is centered around a team of characters from various agencies and law enforcement who are trying to deal with what at first appears to be terrorists, but it's not as simple as that.

"I've been using Remington razors ever since I started shaving many years ago. My first razor was an clunky model PM850 (which I still have and it still works). Even now, the two razors I use pretty much every day are a Remington DA 307 foil razor and a Remington model R-6150 rotary head razor. So when I was offered one of these new model PF7300 foil razors to try out for a month, I happily accepted it.The razor is very light-weight, I'm guessing it has a smaller battery & motor in it than the more expensive models. The power transformer is smaller and has a different plug on the end than the regular line of razors - looking at the voltage, that is different too (4.0V). Which I'm guessing why there is a different plug, so as not to use the wrong one. Since I've only been using this razor for the occasional shave and touch-up, I've only had to charge it twice since getting it. The charge seems to last a decent enough time.The razor does a pretty good job with my semi-heavy beard - but it's definitely not as powerful as my regular foil razor.  Still, I can see keeping a razor like this at the office or in your travel bag for those times when you need to freshen up a bit. I also think this would be a good inexpensive razor for a teenager just starting to shave.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SJR2QXY794Z9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0X2QVI#wasThisHelpful","R3SJR2QXY794Z9","A34VV0DDR0OFE5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34VV0DDR0OFE5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Purchased this so as to be able to hook up my old Pioneer LaserDisc player to my 1080p television. The best output the laserdisc player has is s-video. My tv has an s-video input (which I was using), but that was only getting me 480i. I was hoping with this upscaling converter to get a little better picture. I have to say that it's really hard to tell if the picture is any better than before. It's now 1080p - but given the source resolution it still looks just a tad better than VHS.I'm giving the converter five stars as it's doing what it's suppose to. The unit was easy to setup. There are just two buttons, one switches the output between 1080p & 720p and the other from s-video input and the composite video. There is a wall transformer that powers the converter.

"I'm constantly needing to measure something (or so it seems). And I get tired of looking for the tape measure because nobody seems to bother putting it back where it goes. So when I ran across these Stanley Fatmax keychain tape rules I picked up a couple to keep around the house. Not really planning on using either of these for keys, but I do like that they have that loop on them. I took a bit of light chain and attached the one tape measure to one end and screwed the other end of the chain to my work bench. Sort of along the lines of those pens on chains that you use to see in banks. Hopefully that will keep it around when I need it.These tape measures seem to be well built - thoughts same as the bigger units that Stanley makes. I like that you can lock the tape in position.

"I was all excited to be able to try out one of these new LG G4 phones and had been reading everything I could on them before it was sent to me. Which I think is the source of my disappointment in this phone. Apparently Verizon felt the need to disable a number of the features that LG put into the phone. One being the FM radio. That was something I was really expecting to be there. It is something my current cell phone has and something that I use a lot while at work. While it might seem to be a small thing, it's pretty much the deal breaker for me.Add to that, that I also took the phone into the local Verizon store with the intent of transferring over my cellphone account to them. Going in Saturday morning I found the store empty except for the three employees. So I was able to sit down with one and not only discuss changing service but had him go through the features and functions of the phone. Apparently he was demoing a G4 himself and been using it for awhile. Asking him about the FM radio he said it had been disabled, but that I could use Verizon's Slacker Radio app instead â€“ but just remember that will make use of your data plan. He also mentioned that the theme feature was disabled as well as the multi-use profile function. Getting to talking about actual service plans â€“ he suggested since this was a demo, to go with their no-contact monthly pre-pay plan. And that for $45 I could get unlimited calls & text and 1GB of data. Hmm, that's less than what I'm getting with my current provided I told him â€“ for $45 I'm getting the same calls & text, but also 5 GB of data. Yes, he said â€“ but Verizon's network is so much better. How much better?, I asked. With my current 4G LTE service I can watch You-Tube videos with no problems and stream music and watch videos. That's around here he said â€“ if you travel you probably wouldn't have that same level of service. Problem I have with that, I don't really travel. So in the end I passed on switching my service over.So I've been just using the phone without cell service and connecting via wifi. I have to say the LG phone itself is great â€“ it takes fantastic pictures. And the speed of the processors make apps fly. I even like that the main buttons are on the back of the phone in the center. I especially like the Amazon suite that the phone comes preloaded on the phone. It combines all the other  Amazon apps together into one screen.I also purchased a case for the phone and a 32GB micro-SD card. I was happy to find that there are a lot of different cases available for this new phone (there doesn't seem to be any for my current phone).So in the end, I love the LG G4 phone itself, just don't like how Verizon disabled it so that you had to use their data plan instead. (Which is why I'm giving it three stars.) So if you're thinking of getting one of these â€“ get the phone somewhere else than Verizon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G63N7Z0V15P2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XMGTFZA#wasThisHelpful","R3G63N7Z0V15P2","A34VV0DDR0OFE5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34VV0DDR0OFE5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I'm a big fan of Ed McBain's other series - 87th Precinct, and I'm a fan of the Hard Case Crime series of books. So I was very happy to get an advance reader copy of this 'new' book. I put new in apostrophes because this story was actually written decades ago. The story reflects that â€“ it is set I'm guessing in the mid to late 50's. A time when it cost you a dime to use a payphone. Two dollars could get you a taxi ride to the other side of the city. And ten dollars would get you two hits of heron.The story centers around Ray Stone â€“ a piano player with a serious drug habit, who wakes up one morning to find a dead girl in bed next to him. He then tries to find his next fix and along the way decides to also find out who killed the girl â€“ all the while trying to keep ahead of the cops who are looking for him.The story was pretty good â€“ not quite the same as the 87th Precinct series. And I had a hard time imagining a strung out drug addict functioning enough to play detective. I did like the feel of the time that the story conveyed. So I'm giving the story 4 stars. Coming in at around 200 pages this is was a very quick read. Included in the book was the 21 page short story â€œDie Hardâ€.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ2V0DV13BZTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781166064#wasThisHelpful","RQ2V0DV13BZTX","A34VV0DDR0OFE5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34VV0DDR0OFE5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The seeds I got did not sprout. I split the seeds into two groups - holding 1/2 back. The first batch I followed the instructions on the package. Which were;Start indoors in any season. Soak in water for 24 hours then cold stratify for 30 days. Sow seed 1/16"" deep in lightly mulched seed bed and tamp in soil. For the seed bed I used one of the Jiffy 5710 12-Pellet Indoor Plant Start Greenhouses. Got no sprouts. I then tried just soaking the second batch of seeds in water for 12 hours and planting them in another of the Jiffy seed starters. Which is a technique that I usually used in the past with other plant seeds and have been successful. Still nothing.I don't think it's bad seeds - just that they are hard to start. I may try doing these chocolate vines again next year.Just a note - my two star review is mainly for my disappointment at my not successfully starting these seeds.

"I'm happy with the trash bags, but I'm a bit confused with them too.I readily accepted a sample of these Hefty Extra Strong - Multipurpose 30 Gallon large trash bags. But when I got them in the mail, they looked familiar to me. Upon arriving home I found out why. The trash bags I'm currently using are the Heft Extra Strong - Trash Can Liner 33 Gallon extra large trash bags. The boxes look identical. My confusion is why have both a 30 gal bag and a 33 gal one. Putting the two different bags up together to see the differences in measurements - one is about 3 inches longer (side-ways) than the other, and one is about two inches longer (from top to bottom). So the Trash Can style is wider, but the Multipurpose is longer. Other than that, the plastic is the same thickness (1.05mil). Not trying to complain - just making an observation.I'm happy with the product (both of them). I actually purchased the Mega Pack of the extra large bags with the intent of cleaning out my garage last month - but with all the rain we've been having that project hasn't progressed as far as I wanted. These heavy-duty Hefty bags have worked well for what I have been able to do. I've been setting the filled bags out for trash pickup without putting them in the bin and haven't had one break open on me yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13SFC2HTF75AV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001BU9Y9Q#wasThisHelpful","R13SFC2HTF75AV","A34VV0DDR0OFE5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34VV0DDR0OFE5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been needing something like this. Getting older, I've had a few scary moments in the bathroom when I've slipped coming out of the bath or shower. No major injuries - but I did pull a towel bar off the wall once. This grab bar is a definitely lot more substantial than that towel bar.Placement of the grab bar was something I thought awhile on. I wanted it to be useful for both the tub and the shower stall that are in my master bathroom. The location needed to be also suitable for attaching the mounting brackets, as they need to be screwed into some framing studs. In the end I installed the grab bar vertically on the end of the wall separating the shower and the bath. Doing that also ensured that there would be plenty of solid wood for the screws.Mounting the grab bar took probably thirty minutes - and that including the time needed to get my shop vac out and clean up the dust. You have to first mount a pair of brackets, which come already attached to the bar. Basically you hold the bar to the wall where you are planning on putting it, and mark where the holes need to be drilled for the mounting screws. I went ahead and put three screws into each bracket. The screws are about three inches long and you really need to follow the instructions and use the correct sized drill bit for the holes. Too small and you're not going to be able to put in the screws, too big and the screws may not be secure. Once you got the holes made, it's as simple as screwing in six screws to mount the bar. Then when you have done that, you have to remove the bar itself so that you can put on the end caps that cover the brackets. There are three tiny set screws that hold the bar to the brackets - removing them took some dexterity (least for me). Putting them back in even more. These things are tiny and the allen-head wrench that comes with them is small too. I lost one of the set screws trying to put it back in it's hole. You actually get two spares (so I imagine I'm not the only one who lost one).The bar looks great. It's shiny chrome - which actually matches the rest of the fixtures in my bathroom (which are also Moen products). Pulling on the bar to test it - you can tell it is a heavy-duty fixture. I'm very happy with the look of it. Hopefully I'll never be in the position of needing it - but I'm glad to know it's there if I do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A3MHJNOVCDWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UGAD21I#wasThisHelpful","R3A3MHJNOVCDWP","A34VV0DDR0OFE5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34VV0DDR0OFE5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been waiting years for this, years!! Well, a lot of us have been waiting years for this. Luckily Universal Studios didnâ€™t let Raimi use the original cut for Army of Darkness (originally titled Medieval Dead and with a different ending where Ash uses the Necronomicon to return home but ends up in a post-apocalyptic future). For years there were rumors of another Evil Dead film, or a reboot, but since television has gotten so good, Iâ€™m really glad that this was the medium they chose to tell more adventures of Ashley J. Williams.I watched the pilot Halloween night on Starz as was intended, and it was everything I wanted it to be. Bruce Campbell was perfection as always, it was so amazing to see Bruce back in the role of Ash after all these years, itâ€™s almost like no time has passed. After picking up a girl and taking her back to his trailer, they â€œpartyâ€ and to impress her Ash reads a bit from the Necronomicon, not a good idea. Never read from the book! There are tons of awesome deadites in the pilot, lots of creepy and gross moments that harken back to Evil Dead 1 and 2. I love all the call backs to ED 1 and 2, music cues and flashbacks (though there is no mention of Army of Darkness at all, maybe in future episodes but that adventure was not mentioned in this first episode). I want to say more but I wonâ€™t spoil anything either. I loved that there was more Three Stooges style slap stick humor, this just felt right at home with the rest of the films.Ash is a lone hero, but often times his stubbornness and arrogance gets in him in trouble. Luckily for Ash, he has some help. Ray Santiago plays Pablo, Ashâ€™s coworker who looks up to Ash and sees the potential in him to be a true hero. Dana DeLorenzo plays Pabloâ€™s friend and also works with Pablo and Ash, she doesnâ€™t really see Ash in the same light that Pablo does. We are also introduced to Jill Marie jones as Amanda Fisher, a cop who runs into some deadites and has a very brief encounter with Lucy Lawless who plays Ruby. Sam Raimi gives us a lot to chew on in the pilot, but is also keeping a lot secret, I get the feeling there will be some great mysteries to be revealed throughout the season. The humor, the action, the horror, itâ€™s all on point. This is everything I wanted it to be and more. I think any fan of Evil Dead 1 and 2 or Army of Darkness is really going to enjoy watching more adventures of Ash vs. Evil Dead.

"I can easily say that the best things about The Phantom Menace was pod racing, and the lightsaber duel against Darth Maul. Most of the marketing for Phantom Menace really pushed Darth Maul too, his face was everywhere, and he looked great. S.H. Figuarts did a stellar job of capturing the likeness of Ray Park who played Darth Maul on screen. This figure is just so nice. Of all the characters from the prequel trilogy that could be turned into an action figure, Darth Maul would be at the top of my list.Now I understand why people dislike the prequel trilogy, I get it. But I still think Darth Maul was great, he was very Boba Fett, a lot of style, great design, very few lines of dialogue, dead super quick. This figure really captures the essence of the character, the accessories and articulation really help bring this figure to life. Darth Maul comes with fisted hands attached out of the box, a set of dual bladed holding hands, a set of single bladed holding hands, and a set of force push or action hands. We also get his lightsaber hilt which the blades plug into holes on both ends, and then there is the cut lightsaber hilt (after Obi-Wan cut Maulâ€™s lightsaber hilt in half in Phantom Menace) as well as an alternate head with a very intense grimace.S.H. Figuarts continues to impress. This weekend they are putting on a show and showcasing their future figures for their Star Wars line. Weâ€™ll be getting Kylo Ren, Captain Phasma and First Order Troopers from The Force Awakens. Weâ€™ll also be getting Mace Windu and Jango Fett from Attack of the Clones, as well as Han, Luke and Chewie from A New Hope. Itâ€™s a great time to be a collector of 1/6th scale Star Wars action figures. I really loved Figuarts Luke from Return of the Jedi, I think Darth Maul might actually be a better figure. I think the likeness to the actor is spot on, I think this figure is extremely accurate to the source, the articulation and accessories are great. S.H. Figuarts is using a new process to apply faces where they essentially print on the face so itâ€™s accurate and no bleeding or missed sections. This is a fairly small figure and the fact that his eyes and teeth and small earring and face paint are applied so immaculately is a testament to Figuarts new technology. The dual horizontal and vertical butterfly joints in the shoulders allow for a great range of realistic motion. I applaud S.H. Figuarts for their attention to accurate detail, their ability to push the boundaries and use new technology, and their clear love for the license they have. This is a must own figure, very much worth the $50 price point.

"Iâ€™ve had this figure on pre-order for quite some time, and now that itâ€™s finally here in hand, I am not disappointed at all. This figure was worth the wait. I was young when Batman the Animated Series aired, but I watched the first episode when it played, and Iâ€™ve loved it ever since. For me, this is the definitive Batman. Kenner put out a line of BTAS figures back around â€™92 when the show debuted, I had the Power Belt Batman which was really the only figure in the Kenner line that looked like this, like how Batman looked on the show. I loved that figure, and I love this figure too.Gone are the days of the brittle, clear joints that DC Collectibles had been using for their BTAS line, this figure is rock solid. The joints are stiff, the small ankles hold up this broad shoulder crime fighter. The joint holes at the hips are gone, this figure is aesthetically pleasing both in design and execution. If I had to list complaints there wouldnâ€™t be many. I wish maybe there had been some shadowing or a thin line painted on the lip area to make it stand out more, and an additional cape that covered his body, like when Batman is in full on detective mode and hiding in the shadows. Other than that, and some limited range or articulation, this is an amazing figure.Aside from the grapnel gun and batarang, you get two sets of hands. The figure comes packaged with fists attached, you get two batarang holding hands and two open grip hands, presumably for the grapnel gun. And like previously released Batman and Robin figures, you also get an additional hand with the grapnel gun sculpted in, which is great. Also included is the figure stand with turn around images on it. Not tons of accessories, but all the appropriate ones. Since all of these figures are episode specific in their design and release, I understand why they donâ€™t include a bevy of accessories with each figure. There is no diaphragm or ab crunch and the arms at the elbow donâ€™t quite hit 90 degrees, but you can still get this figure in some good action poses, especially with the grapnel gun or batarang.I love BTAS, and I love this Batman figure.

"I am relatively new to collecting Hot Toys figures. Earlier this year I bought my first figure from Hot Toys, Guardians of the Galaxyâ€™s Star Lord, which is an amazing figure, a work of art really. I also ended up getting the Rocket and Groot 2-pack from Guardians of the Galaxy as well, and again Hot Toys just knocked it out of the park with the sculpts, paint and accessories. Now we get Han Solo, Captain of the Millennium Falcon, and I am yet again just blown away by the craftsmanship on this figure. Hot Toys is just killing it this year with their Marvel and Star Wars lines. I took a bunch of pictures of Han (which the pictures donâ€™t really do him justice, so much better in hand) because in different lighting and from different angles he looks more lifelike and more like Harrison Ford. From afar, this just really looks like Hot Toys took a time machine to 1977 and shrunk down Harrison Ford in his Han Solo costume and boxed him up just for me. This figure just looks real.The box is a slip box like a shoebox and has a nice piece of art lying over the clamshell where the figure is. What we get is the figure, a swappable hair piece (for wearing the headset) a headset, a comlink, two pairs of ungloved hands and 3 pairs of gloved hands, DL-44 Heavy Blaster Pistol (and if you ordered from the Hot Toys site you got the Stormtrooper Belt with the E-11 Blaster Rifle) and you also get extra wrist pegs and magnets for the holster (the snap on the holster is magnetic, nice). There is also a display stand with a crotch cradle for keep the figure upright securely and displayed in essentially whatever pose youâ€™d like.The head sculpt, the body, the tailored clothing, the accessories, the stand, the articulation, the paint, this is just a work of art. If you are a Star Wars fan and absolutely love Han Solo (like many of us do) and you have around $200 to throw down, I highly suggest you purchase this figure before itâ€™s out of production. Once this figure is gone, the price will just keep going up. And man, this is a figure to own. I know the high price tag can put a lot of people off, and I get it, I do. Throwing down $200 plus on a toy is kinda crazy, but this is more than a toy. This is cutting edge technology utilized by some of the most talented sculptors on the planet to bring to life one of the most iconic film characters ever. This is a piece of art, an action figure, a dream come true really. Each year since Iâ€™ve been alive there have been new Han Solo figures released. I have pretty much all of them. In the last 30 years Iâ€™ve acquired some 35 different Han Solo figures or more. This, this is the one to own, this figure is the closest to the real deal you could possibly get. Art can be expensive, this figure is wearing hand tailored clothes, has a hand painted face, comes from Hong Kong, so yea it can be a bit pricey. To me, itâ€™s worth the price. Hot Toys made another masterpiece with their Han Solo figure, this comes FULLY APPROVED.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NGZIWE9FWLMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4QORIC#wasThisHelpful","R2NGZIWE9FWLMQ","A3RKFHBRBAG79P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RKFHBRBAG79P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is great. This is the Enchiridion from Adventure Time and Marceline the Vampires Scrapbook. The book was bigger than I thought it would be which is a great surprise. This book is about double the size of the Adventure Time Encyclopedia (which this book is a great companion to) and I like that half the book is the Enchiridion and the other half (just flip the book over) is Marcelineâ€™s Scrap book. Both halves of the book get a good number of pages to impress and expand on the ever growing world of Ooo.I really like all the detail, you can tell this was made with love and fans of the show (Written by Martin and Olivia Olson who both play characters on Adventure Time, Olivia plays Marceline). Thereâ€™s cool little things like taped down pieces, tons of little scribbles and sketches. I really like the parchment style scrolls and spell sections in the Enchiridion and the hand drawn sketches in the scrapbook. This book is really great for the price (under $20) this is a great book for any fan of Adventure Time, and can really be appreciated by anyone of any age.

"Poe Dameron, an X-Wing pilot, is one of the new Episode VII Force Awakens figures from the Black Series line that I was a bit lukewarm about. I saw some pictures of the figure and expected to get a wonky painted face. Luckily for a figure I ordered here on Amazon and didnâ€™t get to hand pick, I got a great figure. People have complained about the sculpt not looking like the actor Oscar Isaac who plays Poe Dameron, but I donâ€™t think the sculpt is the issue, I think itâ€™s the subpar Hasbro paint job that kills this figure for most. But like I said, I was lucky enough to get a good one, so Iâ€™m pleasantly surprised.All I know of Poe Dameron is heâ€™s Black Leader for a squadron of X-Wings. I really like the updated flight suit that he wears, it keeps enough of the aesthetics of the old trilogy but with a cleaner more modern look. The helmet looks a little big and odd from the front, from the sides and back it looks ok. Maybe the proportions are off or itâ€™s just not the best helmet sculpt, I like the figure without the helmet better. Aside from the helmet we get a set of hands without flight gloves that have wrist articulation (the black gloved hands only have a cut at the wrist where you peg in the hands, so theyâ€™re not ideal for gun holding) and swapping out the hands was easy enough. You also get a pistol that holsters nicely onto Poeâ€™s belt. Articulation is on par with what weâ€™ve been getting from the Black Series, the flight suit harness can make posing the legs a bit tricky as It tends to be in the way. Also, the upper torso articulation on my figure was very stiff, took some finagling to get it loose.Iâ€™ve been really pleased with these first issue releases of Black Series figures for the Force Awakens. Weâ€™ve gotten a good balance of heroes and villains, and weâ€™ve gotten a few female characters as well. Canâ€™t wait to see what figures will be released next. If you can only find a few of these figures, this is one to get. Poe Dameron comes with some cool accessories, has a cool look and design and poses well. Hopefully you can find one at a reasonable price and with a decent painted face.

"This is one of those rare occasions where I have a figure I know nothing about, so this review is only on the figure itself. I think the design is great, I canâ€™t say how accurate this figure is to the source as Iâ€™ve seen no photos of this character. The anticipation for Episode VII The Force Awakens is real, and Iâ€™m grabbing all the cool looking figures I can at reasonable prices. The Hasbro 6â€ Black Series figures shouldnâ€™t cost more than $20 upon their release. Figures that are out of production like X-Wing Pilot Luke, Darth Maul, R2-D2 will all run closer to $100, but all of these Force Awakens figures are still in production. Right now theyâ€™re selling out quickly, but within the next few weeks you should be able to find them. I check Amazon daily so Iâ€™ve had some good luck.Guavian Enforcer, weird name. Sounds like some sort of fruit loving killer. The design though, I love the helmet, I love the very intricate line work in the suit. I got really clean paint applications on this, no bleeding or missed portions. The thigh cuts were super stiff, but with a little time and care, I got them to move. The articulation overall is like all of the other figures in the Black Series line. The wire on this figures left leg looks like it would make for issues when posing, but I didnâ€™t have any issues, I was able to pose him/her/it, (no idea if this character is a robot or a girl or a girl robot or what) without issue. The guns fit well enough into the figures hands, only the right hand has a trigger finger but the left hand still holds the guns ok. For a character I know nothing about, this is a great looking figure with an awesome sculpt, decent articulation (head articulation is the best weâ€™ve gotten from any Black Series figure yet, head can look all the way up) some cool weapons and a unique design. I canâ€™t wait to see what this Guavian Enforcer is all about.

"This shirt is great. I've had some hit or misses when buying T-shirts here on Amazon. Either they fit funky, or the design washes off and fades (and not in a cool retro way, but a crappy quality s#&$@y kind of way). This shirt fits perfect (I'm 5'7"" and 160 pounds, ordered a large) and it's soft. I washed it before wearing and the image didn't fade or crack at all. The shirt color and image are exactly as pictured. It's great to have such a cool shirt already for the Force Awakens so many months before release. And I'm really pleased it's exactly as pictured and good quality. For $15 this shirt is a no-brainer for anyone who wants a cool Episode VII shirt.

"I like Hellboy, well really I love Hellboy. You kinda have to if you're going to pay $20+ for a giant sticker to put on your wall. Now this isn't a sticker, it doesn't have an adhesive on it like a normal sticker, it's something you can take off the wall and re-stick on another wall. Though I wouldn't recommend doing that too many times because this will eventually not stick as well and the corners will start to curl off the surface of the wall. This arrived rolled in a box, so that's good (no creases). I wiped down the wall I was going to put this on to get off any dust and hair. The biggest thing to note is that what I got is different than what is pictured. Underneath the Hellboy title, is a big symbol of the B.P.R.D. which was a very pleasant surprise. There is also a lot of black shading under the title so the decal itself is bigger overall than pictured.

"I don't like writing negative reviews, especially since I know they can influence peoples decision to purchase, but I cannot recommend this shirt. I love the cream color of the shirt, and the image itself. But The shirt is very uncomfortable (feels rough and stiff) and the graphic itself dissolved after one wash. I washed this shirt before ever wearing it (as one should) and after just one wash and never getting to wear it, most of Catwoman disappeared in the middle of her body, just cracked and washed right off. The product info on this shirt states ""T-Shirt Will Not Fade, Crack or Peel After Multiple Washes"", not true, this peels/fades/cracks after the first wash. And not in a cool vintage looking way.

"Iâ€™ve gotten a few of the DC Collectibles Batman: The Animated Series figures now, and I love them. They take me back to my childhood, which wasnâ€™t all that great, but Batman made it better. I feel bad for those who have had issues with DC Collectibles BTAS line, fragile joints that break, paint chipping, overall defects. Iâ€™ve managed to get lucky and get figures Iâ€™ve ordered online and not had any sloppy paint, and no breaking limbs or joints. The Batman and Joker and Catwoman I got all had stiff ankle joints and knee joints I could tell would snap if forced, I hit them with a blow dryer for 30 seconds, and no problem. Loosened the joints right up and now theyâ€™re fine. Yea, it sucks we have to do that, but the alternative is worse. If you plan on keeping your figure blistered to the card, Amazon may not be the best place to get yours. Amazon forces these figures into boxes that are too small, so the card will be bent/curved/folded. I planned on opening mine so I didnâ€™t care, and the cards the figures were blistered to werenâ€™t too badly destroyed, not as bad as some figures Iâ€™ve ordered from Amazon.So here we get the Joker, my favorite Joker to date. A little bit Romero, a little bit Nicholson, a lot Hamill. I know for a lot of people Mark Hamill is and always will be Luke Skywalker, and Iâ€™m sort of in that camp. But to me, Mark Hamill is and always will be the best Joker ever. He is able to do things with his voice that I just donâ€™t think anyone else can match, (though Troy Baker gets close to sounding like Hamillâ€™s Joker) Hamill has a hell of a voice. And DC Collectibles has made a hell of a figure. Here is Joker from the BTAS episode â€œThe Last Laughâ€ (if you have Amazon Prime you can watch all 4 volumes of BTAS for free, I highly suggest you do) as well as episode specific accessories from this episode.Youâ€™ll get two fists which are on the figure right out of the blister, two sets of gripping hands, and two sets of trigger finger type hands. You also get a small yellow handled knife, a very small blue comb (I mean very, very small), a pearl necklace, a clear breathing helmet and a scope. Joker can hold most of the accessories with some work and patience, but the tiny accessories are small and kind of pointless. I would have preferred a clock attached to a keg of dynamite, or a pistol, something better. I really like that there are scene specific accessories to this line of figures, but maybe DC Collectibles could have found a better episode to pull from, I donâ€™t know. But random accessories is better than none, so Iâ€™ll take â€˜em without any more complaints. Iâ€™ve read of some sloppy paint on the Joker, mine is great. The teeth are all painted well, the eyes, lips. I didnâ€™t have any problems with chipped paint on the gloved hands or anything. Thatâ€™s something to watch out for I hear. The articulation is on par with the rest of this wave and wave 1, stronger joints and no pin holes in the sculpt which is nice. The rubbery jacket doesnâ€™t hinder articulation much, if at all. Standard articulation, ball joint neck, ankle pivot, hinged hips, pretty much what weâ€™ve been getting. I am loving this series so far. Iâ€™ve been waiting years for figures like this, Iâ€™m really elated with this line. DC Collectibles is really winning me over with this series and their Arrow TV Series figures, theyâ€™ve picked up their game in the last few months. For the price, the sculpt and accessories, the Joker comes FULL Y APPROVED.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15DYQU1F29MSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LBCW50E#wasThisHelpful","R15DYQU1F29MSW","A3RKFHBRBAG79P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RKFHBRBAG79P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This figure is my favorite of the DC Collectibles Batman: The Animated Series so far. I canâ€™t say Iâ€™m a huge Robin fan, but I did like his character a lot in BTAS, and this figure does him justice. Overall I think the sculpt is fantastic, though a bit on the small side. Robin was fairly ripped in the show, here the figure looks more like a boy. Maybe the figure should have been a bit taller or more broad in the shoulders, but I still think itâ€™s an amazing action figure.Now Iâ€™ve read and watched reviews of these figures and have heard the complaints about the fragile joints and sloppy paint, though that seemed much more prevalent in the first series of figures released. I donâ€™t have any issue with my Robin figure. The paint is applied even and smooth and in all the correct spots, without any chipping. Aside from the head sculpt, I think the paint is the strongest part of this figure. Itâ€™s vibrant and bright, more so than any other figure in the series so far. Iâ€™ve read complaints about sloppy paint on this figure so be on the lookout if youâ€™re buying this in the store. I also like that they sculpted Robin with a smile, it gives more life to the figure.For accessories we get a bunch of alternate hands. We get two fists, two gripping hands, to flat hands, and a hand that has the grapple gun sculpted into it.  We also get a bola whip that seems to be a tad too short, a grapple gun that you can put into one of his hands, and an alternate cape that can be put on by removing his head and switching out the capes. One cape drapes over Robins shoulder and the other cape is more pulled back. I think this is a fantastic figure, I feel like itâ€™s stronger in terms of quality than the earlier releases from this line, but still a bit too thin to pose confidently or be rough with. I still found myself being very careful, I donâ€™t want to snap one of his skinny legs or ankles. I advise hitting these figures right outta the blister with some hot air from a blow dryer before moving any of the joints, just to be safe. I know I know, you shouldnâ€™t have to, but you do. So unless you want to be disappointed really quickly, Iâ€™d play it safe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QQUPVDSCXVJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LBCW2DE#wasThisHelpful","R1QQUPVDSCXVJ8","A3RKFHBRBAG79P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RKFHBRBAG79P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like DC Collectibles figures, I think they look less cheap than most Marvel figures, which suffer from gummy/rubbery limbs and mediocre sculpts. Though DC Collectibles has been plagued with fragile joints as of late, I have not had any issues with any of my Batman the Animated Series figures.Man-Bat, one of my favorite characters from Batman the Animated Series. Granted heâ€™s basically a Jekyll and Hyde archetype, I loved the character design for Man-Bat in BTAS. I had the original figure from Kenner back in 1992, I just really like this iteration of the character and of Batman in general. BTAS is my most favorite version of Batman. This figure is solid, the design, the sculpt, all top notch. The paint application on mine is pretty great, there was a tad bit of extra white around one of the fangs, but I just scraped that off with my pocket knife and now it isnâ€™t an issue. The accessories are small but great, you get the tape recorder that has the sound of the Man-Bat attacking a security guard that Batman later uses to identify the source, and three little bottles of the serum from the BTAS episode â€œOn Leather Wingsâ€.The articulation is where Iâ€™m sure most people will complain. The legs are articulated well enough for my taste, and they are sturdy enough to hold the figure upright without the stand that the figure comes with, which is great. The head doesnâ€™t turn far enough up to get good flight poses for the figure, and the wings do not have any articulation at the elbow or wrists, which is unfortunate. Luckily the arms are easy enough to replace with the second set of arms. This figure comes with two sets of arms/wings which I think is awesome, so Iâ€™m not as bothered that neither set are articulated. The set of arms attached to the figure right out of the box are the outstretched flight wings. The second set of arms are with the wings mostly folded in, more for a walking around and fighting look. The arms just pop out at the shoulder and just plug right into the figure, fast and easy. Maybe a little too easy, since the large flight wings are a bit heavy they have trouble staying out in a flight position and want to dip down from the weight. Other than that, this is great. Itâ€™s a big figure in a bigger box than the other BTAS figures currently being produce by DC Collectibles and itâ€™s the same price, nice move DC!

"This figure is a bit on the pricey side, but itâ€™s easily the best Captain America figure from The Avengers film on the market (save for the ¼ scale NECA Captain America but thatâ€™s a bit too big for my taste, and pricey). This is also the best likeness of Chris Evans in figure form out there. Some people complained that the face on this figure is too pale, I get that but it doesnâ€™t bother me. I think itâ€™d be more weird if he was really tanned. Is this figure worth $65? It depends on how much you like Captain America, or Captain America from the Avengers film. I like action figures quite a bit, and I like Japanese import figures, though they can be ridiculously overpriced. If this figure was $40 Iâ€™d have gotten 2. This figure really should be around the $40 mark, but what you get for $65 is still pretty awesome. And Iâ€™m a pretty big Captain America fan so I think itâ€™s worth it.I like when Figma includes multiple different faces and wish they had done so this time, but they didnâ€™t. Itâ€™d have been nice to have an angry fighting face or something. You can take off Capâ€™s face and move his eyes, thatâ€™s better than nothing. You also get the standard Figma stand and sandwich bag for all the accessories which I like quite a bit, a peg board with 4 sets of hands (two flat hands for holding the shield, 2 gripping hands, 2 lose gripping hands, two hands with the fingers flayed out for throwing the shield poses, and a â€œHulk Smashâ€ pointing finger (and Cap comes out of the box with two fisted hands, so 5 sets of hands in total , plus the right handed pointing finger). Now Iâ€™ve seen a lot of reviews complaining about the shield and the straps falling off. That wonâ€™t be an issue if you plug in the two straps correctly. Both straps fit into the shield very specifically in just one way and one way only, if you donâ€™t match the cuts in the shield and straps, itâ€™s going to keep falling off his arm. My only complaint about the shield is that it doesnâ€™t somehow attach to Capâ€™s back. The paint job on the shield is excellent, as well as the rest of the figure. I donâ€™t have any issues with bleeding or missed paint spots on my figure. The articulation is superb as always, Figma is really good about articulation for the most part. People have also complained about latissimus muscles on Caps back looking like wings when the figures arms are up. It doesnâ€™t bother me.Look, $40 or more for one action figure is a tough pill to swallow, I get it. So you have to decide how much you like action figures and how much you like Captain America. I love both of those things and I knew this figure would meet my expectations, and it did. It even exceeded them, this figure looks much better in person, pictures donâ€™t really do it justice. If you can find this figure cheaper Iâ€™d say pull the trigger without hesitation and get it. If youâ€™re on the fence because of the price, just weigh how much you love Cap and maybe save up for it, itâ€™s a fantastic action figure.

"People complain about the Revoltech joints and the ratchety sound they make when you move them, but that doesnâ€™t bother me. People seem to have too high a standard in how they grade an action figure, they are looking for perfection. When it comes to cheap, mass produced molded plastic, youâ€™re not going to get perfection, period. You canâ€™t even get perfection when you shell out $400 on a Sideshow Collectible figure. My expectations are simple, It shouldnâ€™t break out of the box, the paint should be at least 85% on the mark, and the accessories should fit in the figures hands and holsters. Rarely is a small 6â€ figure going to look exactly like the source (NECA got pretty close with their Arnold Schwarzenegger Predator action figures last year though), and rarely is there that perfect blend of asthetics and poseability. This figure gets awfully close though.I think this is the best Star Wars 6â€ figure currently available. I was a big fan of the first line of the Star Wars Black Series figures, but they seem to have gotten worse over the last few waves, save for a few figures here and there. I am eagerly looking forward to Bandaiâ€™s S.H. Figuarts Star Wars line slated to release around August of this year. After getting my hands on this Revoltech Stormtrooper, Iâ€™m pretty excited to see their Boba Fett figure that is scheduled to come out later this month. So whatâ€™s in the box? Here you get two fisted hands that are already on the figure out of the box, a right and left trigger hand, and a right and left gripping hand. You also get the standard E-11 blaster rifle, and the bigger DLT-18 Heavy Blaster Rifle. I think this is the most accurate looking Stormtrooper figure on the market to date in this scale. The fragility of some parts of this figure are what keep this from being perfect. Yes, this figure is just about perfect. The snap piece on the holster popped out of place just simply by holding the figure and posing it. I tried super gluing it back but the peg is so small it keeps popping out. It drives me nuts. I also snapped off the bottom piece of the DLT-18 rifle just seeing how sturdy it was (it is not sturdy, not at all). This isnâ€™t a super fragile figure, the joints are rock solid, but the rifle and the holster are weak, so watch out for that if youâ€™re taking yours out of the package.Aside from a few issues with the fragile nature of the holster and Heavy Blaster Rifle, this figure is damn near perfect. You can get this dude in any position you can think of. Revoltech did a fantastic job on the articulation with this figure and how the armor hides a lot of the joints, far more than any of their Iron Man figures. If you love Japanese import figures, Star Wars, or Stormtroopers, you have to get this. Iâ€™m serious, even with the issues, this is one of the best figures of the year so far and I doubt any other company will top this Stormtrooper any time soon.

"I love this figure. I was really pleased with the DC Collectibles Arrow 2 pack previously released with Arrow and Billy Wintergreen, I didnâ€™t think we would ever get action figures from this show. That 2 pack sold well and was received well, so now weâ€™re getting more figures and in single releases. Canary came out in January and thatâ€™s one of the best female action figures I own. It was accurate to the source and had great articulation and accessories, it was just an extremely solid figure. But this Deathstroke figure just takes the f%$#ing cake. This is my favorite figure of the year so far next to Revoltechâ€™s Stormtrooper (though that figure has some issues with fragility which bummed me out), the sculpt is source accurate, the articulation is great, the paint application is smooth and even, and  comes with plenty of good accessories.The metallic paint on the body armor looks great, there doesnâ€™t seem to be any recycled parts from the Billy Wintergreen figure from the Arrow 2 pack, the sculpted armor doesnâ€™t hinder the articulation. This is just another solid figure from DC Collectibles (who in the last year or so has been plagued with some serious quality control issues, Iâ€™ve had no problems with this figure at all) and I just flat out love the character of Deathstroke, I loved him even more after watching season 2 of Arrow. I think Manu Bennett brought something really magical to the character of Slade Wilson and his portrayal of Deathstroke. Deathstroke just looked really awesome in the show and itâ€™s represented really well in this figure. This figure comes with a pistol that can be holstered on his right leg, which is always a plus. I hate figures that come with pistols and holsters but the pistol cannot be holstered, itâ€™s just a waste. You also get a small knife that can be sheathed on the back of Deathstrokeâ€™s belt in a horizontal position and a large knife that can be sheathed on his left leg. You also get his katana that fits nicely into its sheath on his back.Iâ€™m really excited to see the rest of the figures slated to come out this year. Iâ€™ve seen in-hand pics of Floyd Lawton (Deadshot) floating around and for sale on ebay and he looks great. Later this year weâ€™ll get Felicity Smoak, Arsenal, John Diggle, and a Dark Archer. If youâ€™re a fan of the show and action figures, or a fan of Deathstroke, get this figure. I really liked the DC Arkham Origins Deathstroke figure but this version is even better, itâ€™s phenomenal.

"I am listening to this right now, and it's bad ass. A quick wikipedia search tells me rappers Vast Aire and Vordula Mega joined talents under the name Cannibal Ox. I know nothing about hip hop, my music tastes are broad and diverse, but I love old school rap and this album reminds me of that. I grew up listening to west coast rap from the mid 1990's, like Keak Da Sneak and Mr. Doctor and E-40, Brotha Lynch Hung, and then others like Tribe Called Quest and the Beastie Boys. I don't listen to Kanye West or most new hip hop or rap, so I'm not sure how most people who listen to newer rap will feel about this, it is old school in the best way. There are just beat tracks with no lyrics, Bill Cosmiq killed it producing this. Great samples and synth and string work, awesome beats and great sound. Listening to this on headphones is the way to go, there are lots of back and forth from ear to ear sounds, Blade of the Ronin is just really well put together and mastered.

"Golden is the first book in a young adult magical realism series, with each of the books also being loose retellings of fairy tales. Author Melinda Michaels describes the story that way, but what is really happening is that the world she has created takes place after the fairy tale stories have all played out. This world deals with the descendants of the fairy tale characters. And that is really all I am going to tell you about the plot of the book, because I think so much of the magic in Golden lies in the suspense and intrigue that Melinda Michaels is so great at weaving into her story. There are wonderfully complex characters that while they themselves divide each other into good and bad guys, they are each so much more complicated and faceted than that. The characters were a joy to read about. Some you will be able to predict and others throw everything on their head.The book starts out with the main character Hanna reeling from a blackout she just had in school. This was scary for her because after her last blackout when she was eight, she lost all of her previous memories. Heck, I would be terrified of blackouts too! I really enjoyed Hanna. I liked that even though she knew her family was holding back on information, she didn't stop questioning them. I hate when characters in books know there are secrets being kept from them, and they ask a couple of times and then just let it go. Umm, no way would I let something important like that go. And Hanna didn't. My only hold up with Hannah was her tendency towards really reckless behavior. Like standing in front of a train (at all!) but then waiting there until the last possible second. That is something that I just cannot get on board with. But other than that, I thought Hanna was a great character. I loved watching her interact with everyone else in the story because all of the characters in Golden were so different! From Owen to that Vann guy, to Hanna's own grandparents. Everyone had their own personality and role and secrets. But some of them might not be what you think!Melinda Michaels does an excellent job weaving in surprises, and some not so surprises. She gives you enough foreshadowing so that you can figure out some things on your own, so you are not completely lost in the woods, but I promise that is not all she has in story for the readers. Not to mention the great romance as well. Mmm, I would love a side of William. I really enjoyed Golden and I cannot wait to see what is next from this author. I will certainly be reading it.*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest review.

"Alive is one of those young adult books that has such a cool concept, that you can't not read it. Alive is about a teenage girl that gets a heart transplant, and then some strange and dare-I-say-it... creepy, things begin to happen. You cannot tell me that story doesn't sounds, original and flat out awesome, can you? Nope, I didn't think so. Alive is a great read. One that will leave you more than a little spooked.Stella is a character that I think could be very polarizing in the young adult book world. I can certainly see people getting frustrated with her, but it was really easy for me to put myself in her shoes and imagine how hard her recovery and every day life must be. I haven't gone through anything as traumatic as having a bad heart or needing a transplant, but Stella is a very easily relate-able character.Sure, she gets a bit of first boyfriend tunnel- vision, and sure she takes a couple craps on her friends, but put in context of everything that was going on, I got it. Now, don't get me wrong. I didn't give her a free pass for being a crappy friend more than once during Alive. In fact, I wanted to shake her every single time I imagined Henry's hurt feelings. Stella kind of went on a path of teenage destruction in parts of Alive. She is lucky that her friends are so awesome, because I know a lot of people that wouldn't not put up with half of her decisions. I know it seems like I am hating on Stella. but I'm not. Because even through everything I just mentioned, I was still on Team Stella. Why? Because of Chandler's writing. Chandler Baker made me care for Stella, because I understood Stella's motivations.I love Henry. I shipped hard for him in this book. Levi totally creeped me out. He was not a bad boy that made me swoon at all. But then again, how could anyone steal my attention from Henry. I just wanted to hug him from the very first text that Stella sent him. (and I hadn't even met him yet!)Chandler's writing was the highlight of Alive for me. It was thought provoking writing. I loved the idea that an organ might not just be an organ. That it might carry some impressions, and history from its' previous owner. That concept alone has a ton of ramifications, and interesting ideas to explore. Alive is the product of that thought, and I loved seeing where Chandler Baker took it. So whether you end up loving Stella or hating Stella, I think there is something for everyone to enjoy, and to think about, in Alive.*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest thoughts.

"3.5/5Where to start with this one? Letters to Zell is a hilarious and zany ride that takes what we knew of fairy tale princesses and turns it on its' head. Told in letter format, Letters to Zell starts off with a letter to Zell (Rapunzel) from Ceci (Cinderella- but don't call her that! She hates it!). Apparently, Zell up and left her princess friends to run off and tend to Unicorns. Zell, Ceci, Bianca (Snow White) and Rory (Sleeping Beauty) are all a part of a book club, and the other princesses are not too happy that Zell left them without any notice.The letters drop you right in the middle of their world, and it takes a good bit of time to get your bearings. Since the book is told in letter format, and alternates between the princesses, the author- Camille Greip, has to weave details into each letter. Although this method took longer than a couple setting the stage paragraphs or even chapters would have, it felt more authentic to the story telling method. If these princesses were really writing letters to their friend, they wouldn't explain the world they all grew up in, in one go around. (If my friend wrote me a letter and described Florida, it would be one bizarre letter.) So even though this often left me a bit confused until I could gather enough details to paint a picture of the world, I kind of liked it. It made me feel like I was on a scavenger hunt of sorts.Let's talk a little bit about the letters. They completely cracked me up! I loved Binaca's. She is so crass. All of her letters started with ""Important F-ing Correspondence from Snow B. White"" Bianca is also still living out the pages of her story, so her letters were of particular interest to me. The book on a whole was a lot of fun to read. I loved the concept of these princesses bonding together and doing something so ordinary as drinking (a lot!) and having a book club. Parts of the story did seem to drag on a bit, and I had to put the book down a few times and pick it up again later, but overall, I enjoyed this story.Letters To Zell reminded me of the song ""Fairytale"" by Sara Bareilles. Where all of the Fairy tales have taken a decidedly less happy(and maybe more realistic?) turn than their happily ever after. Each of these princesses are trying to figure out what they really want to do with their lives. I think this is a great book for people in their 20s to read, because I feel like we all are trying to figure out our passions and what we really want to do. And I think everyone has at some point wondered, or known someone who has wondered, if the path they were on was the right one. This takes that idea, throws in some adventure, princesses and a whole lot of wine, and takes us on a journey to answer that questions. And there are a lot of laughs, and some behavior unbecoming of fairytale  princesses, along the way.*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest thoughts.

"Outside the Ropes is the first book in a new adult sports/crime contemporary romance series by the same name. It is dark, gritty and more violent than I am used to. This book pushed me outside of my normal comfort zone while reading, but I have to say I enjoyed it. I know almost nothing about boxing, but I thought Ashley Claudy made the sport accessible to the reader. Plus there is a lot of action, violence and romance to keep the story moving and to grab your attention.Regan has had a tough life in the foster system, and Outside the Ropes starts out with her getting jumped on her way home and beat up pretty bad. That should set the tone for the whole story actually. But she survives and as a result she is brought into the world of competitive boxing. She loves it almost immediately, and through this world she meets a whole slew of new people. I really liked the whole cast of characters in Outside the Ropes. Dexter and Gage were obviously my favorites, but I have a soft spot for Anthony too. I know that might seem crazy if you have read the book, but I do. Even though Dexter and Gage are brothers, they could not be more different, which is always fun for me to read. I like a variety of character types in my reads.I wanted a little more hinting at Gage's interest in Regan early on. At one point in the story, after talking to her only a handful of times, he said something like ""well I think you know how much I like you."" And I was thinking, really? I don't know that. I mean, I could have guessed because I knew he was going to be the love interest, but I didn't see much interest manifesting on the pages of the story. Now after they had that conversation, I totally saw his interest. (and no it wasn't insta love, nor did they get together at that point, but it was at least obvious that he liked her.)Outside the Ropes is not the typical story that I read, but I am glad that I read it. I found myself getting caught up in Regan's world. I think fans of gritty stories with fighting and violence will absolutely love this series. And if you are like me, and you like your romance on the fluffy and light side, give this series a try anyway! I think you will enjoy it. I am already itching for the next book.*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest review.

"3.5/5 starsDead Upon A Time is set in a fairy tale world that is a little darker and a little more twisted than the fairy tales we all remember as kids. And in this world, children are being taken and tortured in creepy ways. I liked (and maybe liked is the wrong word because that makes me sound kind of sadistic) that the children were each tortured in a unique way to their particular story. One was forced to eat a poison apple over and over again, others were cooked alive, etc. Dead Upon a Time is the story of Jack and Kate, two outcasts in the village that embark on a quest to save the children, and Kate's grandmother.Dead Upon a Time is a very quick read that I think would appeal to a younger crowd of young adult readers as well as older readers who are fans of grimm brothers, once upon a time series, and twisted fairy tale re-tellings. I loved the interplay in Elizabeth Paulson's world between uncommon people v. the concept of evil, v. witches. We got to see some of the differences, but I wish that this was explored a bit more. Maybe in another book. HintHintWinkWinkElizabeth.I was the most interested in why these children were being tortured and more of the history surrounding their chosen methods. Did the kidnapper know about their fairy tales, or was this the way their tales might have played out instead? A lot is left up to the reader to ponder, which made Dead Upon a Time a unique read. Much of the book was focused on the rescue journey. I loved learned about the world through the journey, and how evil and magic manifested itself. It was a very quick and fun read.Kate sees glimpses of the children through visions or flashes throughout their journey, but that is almost all we saw of them until the very end. I wanted to see a bit more on the actual rescue and what was going on, at the kidnappers end. I think there is a great book told from the kidnappers or the kidnapped children eyes, as a companion piece. Fans of darker and more twisted fairy tales will like this spin on the classics. I thought it was a great read. One you can finish in only a few short hours, and there was little to no romance, which makes it suitable for readers of all ages. Check out Dead Upon a Time if you dare. Happy ending not guaranteed. ;)*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest thoughts.

"3.5/5Coercion is a serial series that makes up books 1-3 in the Montana Dragons series by Chloe Cole, who is the alter ego to NY Times best selling author, Christine Bell. The Montana Drags series is a paranormal romance series that follows two different dragons. (Where do they live, I wonder? Could it be Montana??) Books 1-3 are Drake's story and books 4-6 are Etienne's story. I liked that this serial romance was split into two sub parts like that. I grabbed Coercion book 1 because it was free on amazon. (Still is! Grab it HERE) And when I finished reading that I immediately bought the complete Coercion set. (it was only 99 cents!! Such a deal!)Willa is a wolf shifter that was jilted by the Alpha in her pack. That whole story has an entire spin off series, in case you are interested. But You don't need to read it to enjoy and understand this series. Willa's parents leave the pack and are looking for allies to get revenge on behalf of their daughter. In the process of their plan they sign a marriage contract with a dragon shifter. Only problem is Willa had no idea. Willa's parents totally handled this situation badly. They don't tell Willa what is going on, they pull up to an abandoned road and basically strand her there. Talk about messed up and scary.But that is only the start of the story, because then we meet Drake. Willa and Drake clash and butt heads the whole time. That was what I loved about them. They are both so strong willed and stubborn that it is an interesting match. Their story was great for a quick read that felt new and fresh. I have been really interested in Dragon shifters lately and to see one paired with a wolf shifter was not something I expected. Coercion is a great 3-part serial for fans of shifter romances. i would recommend you check it out! I want to read more Willa and Drake.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ED4S3D333HCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QT0V05E#wasThisHelpful","R1ED4S3D333HCN","A1VN2TU8YZS5P6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VN2TU8YZS5P6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A New Adult Fae series? Umm, HECK YES! Fates Divided is the first book in the Halven Rising Series. What in the H-E- double hockey sticks is a Halven you ask? --> [spoiler]A Halven is a half-fae, half-human[/spoiler] This is the first paranormal that I have read by Jules Barnard and I have to say, I think I like it even more than her contemporaries. I love paranormals and magical based new adult books, and this one is so good! I loved how the world was a college campus combined with part of the fae universe. It was so cool. Jules did an excellent job of blending modern science with the magical. While reading, I kept thinking, ""yep, I could totally see this happening.""Elena turns 18 and everything starts to change for her. I didn't put together that it was her 18th birthday that was the catalyst for everything, until a lot of the crazy events had already started happening, but still it was pretty cool to see everything that she could do. And what I loved was that through the bloodlines, different traits and abilities were passed down. Because Derek and Elena were completely different.Fates Divided is told mostly from Elena's point of view with a sprinkling of chapters from Derek's view. Of course I wanted to see more of Derek, because he is oh so dreamy and protective of Elena.I kind of wish that the timeline of the story was a bit more stretched out. I know the urgency of the situation was heightened by the one week deadline, but it was freaking me out how fast Elena had to work to not only develop her abilities and find this big mysterious cure. I should note that the writing and the pacing didn't feel rushed, just the timeline of events was crammed together by design. It was ampping up my heart rate while reading.I need more of this series right now. I know that the summary says each of these books can be read alone because they feature a different couple, but because of the world building and background information that you get in Fates Divided, I think it would be best to read this series in order. I wouldn't want to pick it up at a later book. if you are like me, and have been dying for a new adult paranormal or fae series, this is the one for you!

"3.5/5 starsThe Secret Fire is the first book in the young adult fantasy series, The Alchemist Chronicles. The Alchemist Chronicles is the collaborative efforts of french author Carina Rozenfeld and young adult author C.J. Daugherty. This was my first book by either of these authors and I have to say it was so well done. I loved the idea that these two teens, in two different countries could be brought together through the strange, magical and completely different things happening to each of them. The Magic Fire is a whirlwind adventure, that spreads generations and countries. I love the mixture of history, the beautiful settings and the fatastical and magical secrets that surround the characters in the Secret Fire.The Secret fire is told in dual narrative between Sacha and Taylor, two teens that each have something crazy happening in their own lives. Taylor is only just learning that something strange is happening to her throughout the story. We get to experience all she is going through for the first time with her, while Sacha has known for as long as he can remember what is up with him. He can't die until he is 18. It is a strange concept to have short term invincibility, but I loved the twist on the family curse idea.There are so many questions still lingering by the end of this book. I can't wait to get the next book in the The Alchemist Chronicles, because it feels like there is still so much more to come. We did get a lot of answers to the mystery surrounding the two teens, but holy cow there is so much more! Not to mention, I think the romance is building for the next installment, and I cannot wait!

"3.5/5 starsThis will be a mini review (although I feel like even when I say mini, I end up talking and talking and talking....) because one, I think by now Huntley Fitzpatrick books are well known and beloved for being beautiful stories and two, this review can get spoilery real quick, and I don't want that to happen. Which is why I wanted to read the Boy Most Likely To so badly. I have not experienced any of Huntley's books yet, and I thought that since this was a companion book and not a sequel to the Boy Next Door that this would be the perfect opportunity. And I am really glad that I did read it first because I have a feeling that it positively influenced my reading experience.I thought this book was going to be a fluffy contemporary romance, and it really wasn't. It was a contemporary romance but it dealt with meatier issues, which gave the book more denseness, if that makes sense. It was a full bodied contemporary, and I was really digging that about the book. Tim and Alice were so not your typical characters. Tim felt a lot older than he was to me. Probably because he was dealing with some very grown up things, all on his own. And Alice...took some time to grow on me. I'm not sure if that is because I didn't read the first book and didn't get to see her as a background character before or what. I never disliked her, I just didn't immediately see her as the leading lady. I really warmed up to her though as the book unfolded.What I loved about The Boy Most Likely to was that it not only featured great characters and was very much about their journey as individuals, but it also had a nice slow burn romance. (think crock pot on the lowest setting...this was reallyyy slow burn.) But Huntley's writing also put a spotlight on so many different relationship dynamics- families, siblings, friends, girlfriend/boyfriends. And that was what made this book so wonderful. If you are looking for a contemporary with a bit of grit and some depth try the Boy Most Likely To. I think you are very likely to love it.P.S. this turned out to be a full length review, and not mini at all. Such is the curse of being verbose.*Disclaimer _ got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest thoughts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LPZWVFH6PQM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI028PO#wasThisHelpful","R1LPZWVFH6PQM6","A1VN2TU8YZS5P6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VN2TU8YZS5P6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before we were Strangers is an adult contemporary romance set up over a course of almost two decades. I thought this book was going to be a new adult book when I bought it, and arguably the beginning of it is, because the characters start off in college, but this book was overall an adult book with the characters aging through a lot of their life. That was surprising to me, but overall this was still a really good read. I absolutely LOVE love love the premise of the book. Max and Grace had something going on in college and then for reasons unknown they went separate ways. They meet up again through a craigslist missed connection ad. I just love that idea. I think that was flat out brilliant on Renee Carlino's part. It was the perfect blending of romance and technology in the online world we live in now.The book is told both in dual narrative, as well as shifting between present day and various points in Grace and Matt's past. I know that might sound a bit confusing but for the most part it worked really well. The past and present and the person were each identified really well, so you always knew who and where you were reading. For the most part, the book starts off in the middle of the story in Matt's point of view and then it flashes back all the way to 15 years before when Matt was in college. From there it shifts between grace and Matt in large blocks of chapters each (not every other chapter switching) and tells the story in chronological order, taking it past the ""initial"" starting point when the book started. Have I confused you yet? Don't worry, it actually works out well and is pretty easy to follow.Before We Were Strangers took me on a total rollercoaster of emotions. It was happy, it was romantic, it was sad, it was poignant, it was bittersweet and a million other things that I have not hit on. This book was the very real journey with all the ups and downs of life thrown in to keep these two on their toes. I genuinely had no idea how their story was going to turn out until the very last page, and a happily ever after was never guaranteed. That made reading Before We Were Strangers a different kind of romance reading experience to me. All at once I loved and was very nervous and on edge that I didn't know was going to happen. Not to mention that I really didn't know if I was going to like Matt. I have never read a book before where I went from really liking a characters, to hating a character in the middle of the book and then liking him again. Normally, once I form an opinion about someone, it is really hard to sway me from my view of them. Not the case at all here. Renee Carlino really understands people. She has this way of crawling inside their heads and making them feel so utterly realistic that they could be anyone in your life. The good and the bad. This was the perfect, realistic modern day love story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HHCX74H9CZ70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O65X7MI#wasThisHelpful","R1HHCX74H9CZ70","A1VN2TU8YZS5P6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VN2TU8YZS5P6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5/5 starsSigns Point to Yes is an adorable, or adorkable as the summary calls it, young adult contemporary romance. If it is starting to get cooler where you are, Signs Point to Yes is the perfect book to have you feeling like you are back in summer. Or, if you are like me, it is a great book for any time of the year.Jane is a high school girl just trying to figure out what she wants to do next with her life. Instead of going to work at a college, like her mom wants, Jane signs up to be a nanny for a neighbor and their little girls. I loved that Jane didnâ€™t know what would come after high school for her. I think a lot of times in books we see characters that knew exactly what they wanted out of life and were laser focused on it. Which is great! I was like that. My mom said I knew I wanted to be a lawyer in middle school, but the vast majority of 16 years olds do not know that. Jane is a great role model for them.Teo happens to be the older brother of the girls that Jane is babysitting. Jane and Teo used to be good friends, but Teoâ€™s best friend Ravi hates Jane. In fact, he calls her his mortal enemy. I thought this strange triangle dynamic was hilarious. (and no Ravi didnâ€™t have a crush on Jane.)Signs Point to Yes was such a fun read. Teo and Jane were great characters and super cute together. Sandy Hall did an excellent job writing realistic teenagers, with realistic teenage problems. And it was a fresh and fun romance to boot. I highly recommend it fans of young adult contemporary.*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest review.

"An Inheritance of Ashes is a standalone young adult fantasy. The book takes place after a war has ended. A war between humans, the Wicked God and Twisted Things. That right there should tell you one thing about this book. It is going to be creepy. And honestly the chilling atmosphere that Leah Bobet created was my favorite aspect of An Inheritance of Ashes. Fans of atmospheric reads, will love that about this book. I am not going to lie, the first time that I read the summary, and started the book for that matter, for An Inheritance of Ashes, I thought it was a sequel. It is describing a war that just took place, and I thought I missed the first book that had the war in it. So if you are like me, that is not the case. An Inheritance of Ashes is the first book.Hallie and Marthe are sister's, and they are the main characters of this book. They are taking place of the family farm in the aftermath of this war. I don't want to spoil too much about the book, so I am only going to say that the ""drama"" or the strife that they face comes from threat of the Twisted Things. An Inheritance of Ashes is an intense read! It is a war time setting and everyone is still reeling from their loss. There is a slight romance, but on the whole the book is more somber in tone. It does leave way for some really cool fantasy elements. I loved learning about the the wicked god and the twisted things. They creeped me out man!As far as characters go, I really liked Tyler and I liked Hallie. I would have liked to have seem more on the romantic front between the two of them, but what romance was there was really sweet. I love a good friends turned more plot. Hallie and Marthe get along like only sisters can...meaning that they sometimes didn't get along at all. An Inheritance of Ashes was a different kind of young adult fantasy altogether, and I really enjoyed that Leah Bobet took the plot to such a unique place. I love reading books that make me stop and think, and give me something different than I was used to. If you like creepy, atmospheric reads that develop and build slowly, with really interesting fantasy elements, An Inheritance of Ashes is the book for you!*disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest thoughts.

"Calling Me Back is the first in a three part novella series. Part three, and the complete series set, just released yesterday, so if you are like me and like to have the option of reading all parts of a series or serial back to back (to back) this is the time to grab the complete set. I love Louise Bay's serial romances. She somehow manages to fit what feels like a whole story in just over 100 pages. These stories and series, are great romantic pick me ups. I read, and totally LOVED her New York series, which was set up in the same format- a three part serial. The Calling me Series is a spin off of Louise's What the Lightning See's series, which focuses on Jake and Haven. I haven't read What the Lightning Sees yet, but it is on my To Be Read List. And now that I know they are secondary characters in the Calling Me series, I am even more excited to read their story. Haven is Ashleigh's friend and Luke's sister (the main couple)Ashleigh and Luke have been friends for forever, and you know what that means... a friends lovers book. How I love this trope. Calling Me Back jumps right into the action. There is a little bit of background laid for the friendship dynamics of the group, but Ashleigh and Luke are already starting a budding relationship by the end of this installment. I tell you that for two reasons. First, so you know that there is romance in this installment, which is a key in an instant gratification ""happy"" read, and also two because I am really interested to see what bumps Louise has in store for us in parts 2 and 3. I know it will not be all sunshine and roses for our couple.I liked that Ashleigh and Luke both started the series out dating other people. I am not going to lie, I could really relate to the start of the book. Luke and his girlfriend are at a wedding, and he is griping because it seems like all of his friends are getting engaged, and his girlfriend is starting to get ideas. I have seen this time and time again in my friends. It is like a domino effect. One ""falls"" (aka gets engaged) and then all of her close friends start falling around her. So I get where Luke was coming from, but I also got where his girlfriend was coming from. The other thing I could relate to was the sunday night dinner group that Haven Ashleigh and Luke had. I love this idea, and I used to have the same thing in college. A group of friends meets up for dinner and games and the person who cooks dinner rotates. So I instantly had a connection to this group.Bottom line: If you like quick, completely engaging stories with a sizzling romance, Louise Bay's serials are perfect for you. Whether you start with the Calling Me series or the What Lightning Sees series, it doesn't matter. Each one can stand on their own, and I am sure both of them are equally well done. Now please excuse me, while I dive right back into part two of Calling Me.*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this product for free in exchange for my honest review.

"Garcinia Cambogia promises that you will have more energy and that this will aid in appetite suppressant and weight loss. They also promise that there will be ""No jitters, no upset stomach, no side effects."", which is super important to me when I am choosing a weight loss (or really any kind of pill) I have tried a few other kinds of weight loss pills over the years and they would have my heart racing. But I am happy to say that there really was none of that with this Garcinia Cambogia.I can't say that I really noticed an increase in energy, but I am a pretty regular coffee drinker anyway and I didn't change anything about my food or drink consumption during the month I took this. I do think this helped to suppress my appetite and if used as directed, 30-45 minutes before a meal with a glass of water, you will see results. I think you will see more results if you increase your water intake and eat healthy/workout more. But with no changes to diet or exercise, with taking Garcinia Cambogia you most likely will still notice a decrease in your appetite.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36UQBBMV1USEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011JDE24G#wasThisHelpful","R36UQBBMV1USEI","A1VN2TU8YZS5P6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VN2TU8YZS5P6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got the extensions in the color dark brown and I have to say the color match was perfect. It was very true to the color in the picture. Tip: pull up the picture of just the hair, not the picture of the hair in the box as i found all of those brown shades to look very similar.The extensions were soft and felt like real hair, and were very easy to put in. I would get these again just for ease of care and of application. The only thing is that I did wish each strip had been a little fuller. These will add some volume because you are adding more hair, obviously, but I have rather fine hair myself and it didn't add a whole lot of volume. I would probably need to purchase another set or two if I wanted to have the illusion of very thick hair.They are a great length and if you are just looking for a color match (or even some highlights, these are great for blending in with your own hair.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30F09OTSAQPTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5KIKF6#wasThisHelpful","R30F09OTSAQPTN","A1VN2TU8YZS5P6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VN2TU8YZS5P6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5/5Tyed is the first book in the new adult California Love Series by author L. J. Shen. I don't have the opportunity to read very many fighting books. It isn't that I dislike them, but normally I don't feel the appeal in the summary. But when I read the description of Tyed, I felt drawn to the book and the characters, which is always an excellent start. The idea that Blaire was the less successful and somehow not as pretty twin of a supermodel seemed like such an intriguing idea to me. Where was that going to go? And could it really be true? I wanted to find out. Plus reviews were saying great things about Ty, and I love a strong alpha male character.Ty and Blaire were a treat to read. I could not put Tyed down. Sure there was alpha dominance and strength with huge fights, as well as insecurity issues with Blaire. Those were the things that I expected- they were the obvious aspects of the story, and don't get me wrong- they were very well done and worked out well in the overall plot line, but the real star for me in Tyed was the unexpected softness to Ty. I just loved him so, so much. I thought I would like Blaire more at the start of the story because she is a really great girl and she has no problem sticking to her ideals, but Ty stole the show for me. He won my heart and then some. I actually sided with Ty time and time again!I am not really sure if the next story is going to be able Ty and Blaire again. I would love it to, but I think it might be about Blaire's sister, or perhaps someone else at the gym. Tyed is a story that fans of new adult fighting romances will love. It will be a great addition to their collection of favorites. And I think people that don't read too many fighting themed new adult romances, should start with Tyed and the California Love series. It is a great entry into the genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZNPQJGFF4NBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQDQ470#wasThisHelpful","R2ZNPQJGFF4NBE","A1VN2TU8YZS5P6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VN2TU8YZS5P6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5/5Here They Lie by Dâ€™Ann Burrow is a new adult southern gothic romance. I love these kinds of reads during this time of year. I have a confession to make. Normally I am not a seasonal reader. I will read a â€œbeach readâ€ romance every single day of the year, and same goes for sci fi, fantasy and paranormal. But for some reason, the exception to this is during fall, and more particularly during the month of October. October brings out a desire in me to read creepy, horror books. But my favorite of all are southern Gothic paranormal/magic romances. I want to light a candle and curl up in a warm sweater (with cool weather, please!) and read books just like Here They Lie. The cover practically screams fall/Halloween to me. And the story was great too.The description of Here They Lie initially reminded me of the Heirs of Watson Island series, with the mention of the three families and a secret that bound them together, plus the whole southern Gothic things, but it is really nothing like that series at all. I loved getting to know Aunt Kate through Reeseâ€™s eyes, and I was really into the budding romance between Reese and Colton. I canâ€™t speak too much about the whole secrets aspect because, while we did find out a little bit about it, it was not nearly enough for my liking and it was kind of all crammed into the end of the book. I will have to wait until the next book to dive into that part of the story.Here They Lie was a really good book to set the stage and meet the characters. It read more like a romance to me, which I really enjoyed. I would have also liked a little more time spent on the family secrets, and why some people in the families seemed to know about them and why others did not. That didnâ€™t make a whole lot of sense to me, but I am thinking there will be more clarity on that question and dozens of other questions I have surrounding the families. I will definitely be continuing this series because it has been ages since I have found a good pure magic story, without a paranormal element. So even though I do wish we got some more answers throughout the story, the basis of the plot is more than enough to keep me interested. I really like Reese and the plot is  intriguing.*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest thoughts.

"The Shadow Behind the Stars by Rebecca Hahn is a young adult mythology book unlike any other mythology story I have read in the young adult world. It read more like a traditional Greek tale. A fictionalized play of a Greek tragedy, and there was just something about that the academic and history nerd inside of me ate right up. I loved that this story was set in ancient Greece and that it had all the sorrowful tragic elements of traditional Greek myths. Of course, that meant for a more violent and slower pace of story telling, which to me equates to a more mature target audience. I think adults will love this story perhaps more than young adults.The Shadow Behind the Stars is told from the point of view of the Fates. I have not read too many books from the three fate sisters point of view, so that was really interesting to me. It was a kinder and gentler fate than I was used to from tales. They knew they had to carry out their job, but they could just not help but get swept up in poor Aglaiaâ€˜s story and destiny. I really liked the dichotomy of voices in the this story. The book is told from the point of view of one of the Fates, but on the other hand, it is also very much Aglaiaâ€˜s tale. The interplay between narrator voice and main character played out really nicely. I am very impressed with Rebecca Hahnâ€™s writing.The Shadow Behind the Stars is not one of those books that you can gobble up in a quick afternoon. It has a slower pace and is meant to be savored. I donâ€™t often get to read books like this because of my limited reading time, I am drawn more towards instant gratification stories, but there is something really satisfying about digging into a book that forces you to slow down and really digest each page. If you are a fan of traditional greek mythology, you should really check out The Shadow Behind the Stars. It is a beautiful (and yes a little sad) tale. I will tell you one thing, I canâ€™t wait to read another book by Rebecca Hahn.*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest thoughts.

"Alice Takes Back Wonderland by David Hammons is a young adult fairy tale mash up, that will remind fans of a younger version of Once Upon a Time. I have a love for all things Wonderlandian, so it is no wonder that I was immediately drawn to Alice Takes Back Wonderland. The book starts out when Alice is about 7 and is somehow in Wonderland. But she is not the Alice from the story, she is an American Alice from the Midwest. Her first trip in Wonderland is short, but it left a lasting impression on her. Fast forward 10 years, and she Alice has almost convinced herself that it was just a dream. But then the Rabbit shows up at her door and takes her back to a very different wonderland.Although I found the start of the story a bit slow, I really did love the set up. I loved that this was not the Alice from the story, and I loved the idea that the Villain in this story- the Ace of Spades, didnâ€™t want to just take over Wonderland. He wanted to change Wonderland into something more ordinary. Something more like Aliceâ€™s world. What a fresh take! I have never read a story like this one. Author David Hammons did a great job with nonsense. I donâ€™t mean that in a negative way, nonsense is essential in a story about Wonderland. And Alice is a very nonsensical girl. I felt like she truly belonged in Wonderland.Alice Takes Back Wonderland brings us characters from many different story worlds, and they overlap in delightful ways. I had never guessed some of the pairings that David Hammons treated us readers to. The literary geek in me was super excited to see some of the crossovers. This is why I love Wonderland as the backdrop for fairy tale mashups and re-imaginings, because there is so so much that can be done with this fantastical setting. Alice Takes Back Wonderland is a really interesting read. Fans of fairy tale re-tellings and of Once Upon a Time should check it out. And keep reading, if you found the beginning a bit slow like I did, keep going because it really picks up speed after Aliceâ€™s return.3.5/5 stars*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest review.

"3.5/5 starsLike it Never Happened is a young adult contemporary book set featuring a high school drama troupe. A group of five friends and the story of their high school years. I really enjoyed reading Like it Never Happened. It reminded me of 90s shows like Salute your Shorts and Clarissa Explains it all, though I am not really sure why. It is set in contemporary 2014/2015, but it really felt like a 90s throw back to me, and I totally loved that. Like it Never Happened is author Emily Adrianâ€™s debut novel, which completely astounded me. She is an excellent writer, and she seemed so well practiced. I canâ€™t wait to see what she has in store for us readers next.Like it never happened follows a group of 5 best friends, and their trials and tribulations in the theater at their school. Right at the start of the book they make a pack to never date one another. But I knew that was going to change at some point. I was a little excited and a little disappointing all at once with the way things played out with Charlie. It was kind of bittersweet and all at once perfect (in a weird way.) My emotions ying yanged all over the place with this book. Emily Adrian did a fantastic job of capturing the essence of high school. I think that is why I had conflicting emotions. Even if something didnâ€™t turn out the way I pictured it in my head, it felt so utterly real.I loved Rebecca so  much. She was me in this book. I am nothing like her, but while I was reading Like it Never Happened I became her. It was pretty freakinâ€™ cool. Charlie left me with mixed feelings. As did Tess a bit and Rebeccaâ€™s sister Mary. Like it Never Happened kind of reminded me of Never Always Sometimes by Adi Alsaid, but only a little bit. There are classically high school characters that are rich and each have very distinct personalities. And letâ€™s not forget that they are all drama fanatics so there is a flair for the dramatic in Like it Never Happened, but this was such a great addition to the young adult genre. I really enjoyed Like it Never Happened.*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest thoughts.

"Oh how I wanted to love Secrets Donâ€™t Keep. It has all the makings of a book that I would love! A scavenger hunt style quest to join a super secret boarding school society, and did a mention a secret society? Not to mention the boarding school society of the super rich reminded me of Gossip Girl. The characters definitely had the entitled bratty thing down pat. I know you can sense a but coming. I wanted to love Secrets Donâ€™t Keep, but I just didnâ€™t. This book fell apart for me pretty quickly and I was really bummed about it. I kept reading because I genuinely love stories surrounding secrets and secret societies. I want to get to that OMG moment. And that aspect of the book was ok. There were lots of twists and turns and the author had unpredictability down pat. It was all the other stuff, the character stuff, that had me grinding my jaw.Kera and Dex just didnâ€™t do anything for me. They had a bad case of insta love and I just couldnâ€™t back it up. Not to mention I didnâ€™t think Kera was a very good friend. Not that her friends were perfect friends to her either. From the summary and the setting, this book reminded me a bit of Secret of the Sevens by Lynn Lindquist, which I really loved. This one was no where near as good. It felt choppy and the characters majorly got on my nerves.But if you are a huge fan of secret societies, secrets donâ€™t keep might be worth checking out. I really enjoyed the scene setting. The school sounds like a place I would love to spend a couple of days getting lost in, and the actual secrets in this book were pretty major. And my favorite part of all was the app that Keraâ€™s friend designed for the students of the school to talk to each other. I thought that was really cool. But all of those things that I enjoyed were not enough to save me from the annoyance I felt from the characters.If you are looking for a great story about a secret society set at a boarding school, try Secret of the Sevens by Lynn Lindquist. Secrets Donâ€™t Keep was not a hit for me, but I do hope that if you read it, you end up loving it! Let me know what you think if you get a chance to check out this book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27M6AFNAZBJ89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0103OEBWK#wasThisHelpful","R27M6AFNAZBJ89","A1VN2TU8YZS5P6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VN2TU8YZS5P6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh Elisabeth Grace how I love you and your books! Let me count the ways. Actually that is kind of what I am going to do. This is going to be a mini review because I have read and COMPLETELY LOVED so many of Elisabethâ€™s new adult and adult romances that I am afraid I will get too gushy here. So I am just going to quickly run down the reasons why you need Jamie McTavish and this book in your life. ASAP.First, Iâ€™m going to let this graphic speak for itself: uniform4Done! Jamie McTavish is hot and swoon worthy and I would like a moment or two alone with him. Seriously, that alone is enough of a reason to make me want to read Indecision. (Not to be confused by the similarly titled and similarly covered series, Indiscretion series.)Second, Elisabeth writes not only great romance but she writes great characters, and great plots. Great everything. Period. Her books are so engaging, and well written, you will not be able to put them down. I devoured this book in one sitting. And when I was done I seriously contemplated [picking this book right up and starting it all over again.Third, Indecision might be my favorite book of all of hers. But please donâ€™t make me pick, because I go back and forth with a lot of them. But all of them are worthy of re-reads in my opinion and there are so few authors that I can say that about.The takeaway here should be that is you love new adult or adult contemporary romances, love solid story building, love swoon worthy men (in uniforms!) then why the heck are you still waiting?? Indecision is the perfect book for you! Go read it now.*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest review.

"3.5/5Coercion is a serial series that makes up books 1-3 in the Montana Dragons series by Chloe Cole, who is the alter ego to NY Times best selling author, Christine Bell. The Montana Drags series is a paranormal romance series that follows two different dragons. (Where do they live, I wonder? Could it be Montana??) Books 1-3 are Drakeâ€™s story and books 4-6 are Etienneâ€™s story. I liked that this serial romance was split into two sub parts like that. I grabbed Coercion book 1 because it was free on amazon. (Still is! Grab it HERE) And when I finished reading that I immediately bought the complete Coercion set. (it was only 99 cents!! Such a deal!)Willa is a wolf shifter that was jilted by the Alpha in her pack. That whole story has an entire spin off series, in case you are interested. But You donâ€™t need to read it to enjoy and understand this series. Willaâ€™s parents leave the pack and are looking for allies to get revenge on behalf of their daughter. In the process of their plan they sign a marriage contract with a dragon shifter. Only problem is Willa had no idea. Willaâ€™s parents totally handled this situation badly. They donâ€™t tell Willa what is going on, they pull up to an abandoned road and basically strand her there. Talk about messed up and scary.But that is only the start of the story, because then we meet Drake. Willa and Drake clash and butt heads the whole time. That was what I loved about them. They are both so strong willed and stubborn that it is an interesting match. Their story was great for a quick read that felt new and fresh. I have been really interested in Dragon shifters lately and to see one paired with a wolf shifter was not something I expected. Coercion is a great 3-part serial for fans of shifter romances. i would recommend you check it out!

"Frost is a young adult norse mythology book, which kicks off a new series by E. Latimer. (I believe the series will be the same name as the title but I havenâ€™t found confirmation of that yet.) You all know how much I love mythology books, and frost is a great take on the Norse tales. I absolutely loved that author E. Latimer took a unique spin on the frost giants, and made them the rulers of the realm. Frost offers wonderfully imaginative writing, solid friendships, great characters, and a refreshing take with a main heroine that has her head and her intuition completely on point.This may sound a bit strange but one of the things that I appreciated most about Frost was that both the frost and fire sides seemed to realize that they were asking a lot for a normal 17 year old girl to believe- not only that she was part frost giant, but also that their side was the side to be trusted. Loki and Erik (and no there is not a love triangle, for the record.) each realized that Megan had no reason to trust one side over the other because everything was completely new to her. I appreciated the time and space that people gave her to make her own decisions. It made the whole supernatural element of the story fit into what Megan thought was a contemporary world (kind of, other than that whole kissing and freezing a boy incident).I could not put Frost down. really, this book was over 450 pages and I DEVOURED it in one night. It was that good. I loved watching Megan piece together court life, and figure out just what the heck was going on. What everyoneâ€™s hidden agendas were.

"Jillian Cade: (Fake) Paranormal Investigator by Jen Klein is a young adult book that made me so happy because it totally surprised me. It is the first book in an unnamed series, and I am so crazy happy that there are going to be more of these books especially because of the direction that Jen Klein took Jillian Cade in. Jillian is the daughter of a paranormal expert, whom she lovingly (not really) refers to as a con artist. That should tell you all you need to know on Jillian's stance on the paranormal.I felt so bad for Jillian. I mean, her mom passed away, her dad is always off traveling so you can guess that there is a bit of a strain on their relationship because of that. Not to mention Jillian is kind of bitter about the whole paranormal thing because her father has basically abandoned her to tour the world, leaving her alone and without money to even pay the power bill at her house. Talk about child neglect. To keep things going Jillian heads up her dad's paranormal investigation private eye business. I loved that she made her clients jump through password hoops to protect her identity from them. She is a savvy one, which is one of the things that I immediately liked about her. She is a fighter. A sassy fighter.Jillian and her cousin help people rid ghosts from their house, or help out with curses, and the like, even though Jillian doesn't believe in any of it. (think Psych or monk or the mentalist.) But when a new guy shows up in town, and is a big groupie of her dad he basically forces her to come along on her next assignment. Saving the popular girl at school's boyfriend from a curse. And that is about all I am going to tell you about the plotline from the book because this book is just so darn good, I don't want to spoil a thing. Whether you are going into Jillian Cade expecting a contemporary or more of a paranormal, it doesn't matter, because I guarantee you will be surprised and pleasantly so while reading. (and nope, I am not going to tell you which one of those I expected. I've even included both contemporary and paranormal in my genres as a kind of pathetic attempt to throw you off. It's not actually both. winkwink)If you love spunky characters, a riveting plotline, some romance to boot, and not to mention the set up for what looks like it is going to be a great series, then you have the right book. Jillian Cade exceeded all of my expectations. And then some.*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest review.

"A Sweet Possibility is the second book in the new adult/adult contemporary romance Archer Cove by Natalie Charles. I had no idea that this was the second book in the series at all, and it read a like a complete standalone. This line from the summary totally sold me on the book, ""All baker Jessica Mallory wants is a modest thigh gap. And her own chocolate shop."" I have no idea why but I love the modest thigh gap and chocolate addict conundrum. It is totally adorable and cute, just like Jessica. I also loved Nate. Pretty hard. So I think it is safe to say that A Sweet Possibility was a really sweet book. Definitely.Jessica is quirky and funny. Kind of like a smidgen of Bridget Jones mixed in with spunk and something that is uniquely her own. And Nate is just pure adorable-ness. I could not get enough of him. I loved how infatuated he was with Jessica. Those kind of sweet crushes get me every time. Jessica gets dumped and decides to make some changes in her life to get herself together and to open her own chocolate shop. (She does it for all the wrong reasons, but nonetheless the reader knows what is going to happen.)Nate steps in to help Jessica and watching the two of them together just made me smile. A Sweet Possibility is a bit of a predictable read, but it is predictable in all the ways you want it to be. I can't wait to read the first book in the Archer Cove series, because I am sure that it is just as fell good as this one. My only holdback with this book was something that I only noticed after I had finished reading. I know that might seem a little strange, but I was just loving every page of this story that this point didn't even cross my mind until I was done. Click to see what it was. (view spoiler)Bottom Line: A sweet Possibility is a really sweet friends to more contemporary romance. I would totally check it out, when you are looking to satisfy your romance sweet tooth.*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest thoughts.

"These makeup brushes are great for a grab and go travel set. They come in a very nice bag, and come with a great variety of brushes. I love how soft yet, well packed the brushes are.

I had to air mine out from the bag and wash them with baby shampoo (like I would to clean them) because they did have a slight smell from the packaging.There is a good mix of face and eye brushes.

"T.A. Foster writes great feel good romances, and Because of Sydney is no exception. Because of Sydney is a standalone new adult contemporary romance with no cliffhanger. But even though it really does stand completely on itsâ€™ own, it takes place in the same universe as her Kissing Eden series , which I absolutely loved. Because of Sydneyâ€™s main character (other than Sydney, who is new to the books) is Mason, Greyâ€™s Uncle- who-is-really-his-age. When we last saw Mason he was dating Edenâ€™s friend Taylor.Because of Sydney starts out with Mason completely single and very much back in his business state of mind, looking for a new land development deal. I loved that we got to see Masonâ€™s story because you can just tell from the get go that this is a complex guy. There is a lot brewing in that head of his. And I was super excited to slip on in there and make myself comfy to watch his story.Sydney is a fresh faced college grad trying to make her way in the hard hitting world of journalism. I love that she works for a digital magazine, because letâ€™s face it- that is where journalism is today. It would have felt stuffy and forced to me if she was sitting in a newsroom cranking out a newspaper. #IsThatOnlyMe? Sydney wants to get the inside scoop on the land development deal, which lands her square in Masonâ€™s path. Oh boy, can you feel the sparks from here??Because of Sydney was such a fun and flirty read. My only hiccup was when Sydney went against who she was and told Mason that she was a â€œjust for funâ€ girl. There is nothing wrong with just for fun, if that is what you want. But Sydney so clearly didnâ€™t want that, and that kind of set up always has me groaning a little. It reminded me of the movie Heâ€™s Just Not that Into You, when the girls are talking about being the rule and being the exception. Girls always think they can change the guy, but that isnâ€™t the rule, that is the exception. Anyways it was just a small hiccup because like I said this is a feel good book. HintHint WinkWink. If you are new to the Kissing Eden universe, you can read this story first and it does stand completely on itsâ€™ own, but I would personally recommend starting with Kissing Eden, so you can get to know Eden and Grey and the island of South Padre a little better. But either way, you canâ€™t go wrong with any of these books. T.A. Foster is a great writer!*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest thoughts.

"I have to admit, I was skeptical when I first saw these little headphones. I didn't know how good the quality would be, but once I charged them up and put them in, before I even turned them on I was blown away by how comfortable they are. They come with multiple ear insert sizes, so you can pick which one works best for your ears, and they are really soft. A lot of time headphones end up hurting my ears, but these did not.And the sound quality is excellent! I couldn't believe how clear these babies are.

"3.5/5I really like the length of this wig, and the color is very very vibrant. It looks just like it does in the picture. I have tried other wigs in the past and they were much too long for me. I had to cut them, but this one was the perfect length. (in my opinion)It is good for a costume wig, and the price cannot be beaten. However it is not the most realistic looking wig. The hair looks a little fake, but for the price it is great for any kind of costume or cosplay. I would recommend airing the wig out a bit before using it for the first time, because it does have a bit of a smell.Overall, for the price it is a really great deal.*Disclaimer- I got a sample of this product for free in exchange for my honest thoughts.

"4.5/5Dark Embrace is actually the 4th book in the Dark Paradise series by Angie Sandro. I actually had no idea because the cover looks totally different than the previous three covers (which I like a lot better than this one) and the first three books features a character named Mala. All of them featured Mala to my knowledge and Dark Embrace features her cousin Dena. I have not read the first three books in this series, and I was fine reading this one. There were a few moments where I wish I had a little more back story, but Dark Embrace can stand on itsâ€™ own. It felt more like a companion series rather than a continuation to the Dark Paradise series. But either way, I absolutely loved Dark Embrace!Dena is a great character. She is stubborn as a mule, but she is caring, compassionate and determined. And I appreciated how skeptical and distrustful she was of people. because holy cow, everyone in this book should not be trusted. Not even her. It is really hard for me to describe Dark Embrace, other than to say it is one fantastic paranormal mystery of a ride. You have this mysterious dark shadow that Dena seems to be the only one to see. And he seems to be kind of obsessed with her. And then you have all the people that seem to die around her. And then you have all the people trying to kill her. And it just keeps building. You learn one thing and three more mysteries and questions pop up.Angie Sandro did a really fabulous job telling Denaâ€™s story. I loved how everything was presented and how all the events unfolded. I so badly wanted something specific to happen in this book and it did. And when it did, I was whooping for joy. I want to see more Dena stories. I hope this is not the end for her. Now that she knows what is going on, I want her to get her romance on. Even though there was plenty of romantic action in this book, which I absolutely loved, I hope that Dena takes a little more time in the next book to enjoy her relationship.Bottom line? If you are a fan of mysteries and paranormal romances, Dark Embrace is a book that you cannot miss out on.*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest review.

"4.5/5Lust is the second novel in the Allure Chronicles, a new adult paranormal romance series. Lust picks up right after Lure left off, with Daisy and Owen having just found each other and the bomb of what Daisy having allure essence in her really means. It was one doozy of an ending, but then again the end of Lust was also pretty gut wrenching. Alyssa why do you do this to me?? Ugh I just love her books so much. And the Allure Chronicles has to be one of my favorite series of hers.I love all of the characters, not only just Daisy and Owen, but Violet and Roland have special places in my heart as well. I was kind of hoping that we would see more of Roland in this book. Not because I dislike Owen. I really love him, I am just also intrigued by Owen and his connection with Daisy. Luckily, I have a feeling that I will be seeing a lot more of him in the next book. Wink wink.Lust takes all of the characters on a world-wind high speed journey to try and fix what is happening to Daisy. I wonâ€™t go into too much more detail about what exactly is happening because I love all the Allure history and characteristics Alyssa Rose Ivy explains in Lust. Things that I so want them to fix or find a workaround from because I love Daisy and Owens connection. I think there is something so pure and innocent about their feelings and the way they treat one another. I know that seems strange given everything you know about the series- the titles, the covers and the series name, but it is true! haha, they are just too cute together.Another exciting moment in Lust for me, was when mention of Energo was made! Alyssa, you master you. (for those of you new to Alyssaâ€™s books, Energo is a land in another two of her series- the Forged Chronicles and the Afterglow Trilogy.) All of her series and worlds are coming together and linking up! I absolutely love it. I want to see some kind of chart or map made of all of Alyssaâ€™s series lands and the creatures that live there. Someone please make that!Fans of New Adult paranormal romance need to read the Allure Chronicles. And it is great series to start with if you are new to Alyssaâ€™s works because it touches so many of her other series. Start with this one and then move off to any of the numerous other series that overlap.

"3.5/5Undercover Empath: Kindred Demon is the first book in the New Adult paranormal series, Undercover Empath. I really like how well the covers of the series go together. They are almost identical but in different colors. And they are each really pretty. It follows detective Rose Hansen who can determine anyone's intentions with the slightest brush of her hand. It is a gift that Rose shies away from, but it is really useful in her chosen profession. I really enjoyed Kindred Demon. It is a super quick read, but I thought Rashelle Workman did a really good job with the paranormal elements in the story. They were very upfront and in your face. I also really liked the mystery surrounding Rose's parents and the bio facility that I am sure is going to play a much larger role in future books.Romance was not really in the forefront of this book. It was focused more on introducing the world and characters, and surprisingly, I was ok with that. because I could see some of the inklings of where the romance is going to go in the future and it made me very happy. I also think he is going to play a bigger role. There is more to meets the eye with him. I have a couple of ideas, but they each pretty different so who knows.Undercover Empath: Kindred Demon is a super quick read. Almost too quick. My main drawback with the story was that I wished it was a little more fleshed out. Don't get me wrong, there will be plenty of time for more character and plot development in future books, but I felt like this installment just flew by and there could have been a little more. Each book so far has been about 100 pages, so maybe they are more like longer novellas or serials. I was expecting full length novels, which is probably why it felt short to me. The second book is already out so I can get my instant gratification and find out what happens next, which is a big plus in my book, but the summary is the same as the first book. I think that should be redone, it was pretty confusing to me. I am really interested in following this story. I love Rose, I hope the romance turns out the way that I want and I can't wait to see what surprises Rashelle has in store for us next.*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest thoughts.

"4.5/5 gavelsThe Dreamer is the first book in a new, New Adult fantasy series, called the Dreamland Series. I loved this book. I found it to be well written, fresh, engaging and really creative. I loved the world within a world that Author E.J. Mellow created. The book starts out by Molly getting struck by lightening and ending up in the hospital. I thought it was funny that the doctor made an offhand comment that she might experience some weird dreams, which then sets off the whole rest of the story.Because Molly does experience some weird dreams. Dreams that have her questioning what is real and what isn't. Molly gets transported to the same, very strange looking world in each of her dreams. A world where she is a special person called a dreamer, and that she might just play a pivotal role in their society and survival. I don't want to tell you much more than that because I loved the way E.J. Mellow painted the picture. She did a fantastic job with her world building, and I want you to experience terra sominum (can't remember the spelling, and can't find it in my kindle) for yourself.And for my romance fans out there- you need to read the Dreamer. I love Dev and Molly so much. That is also the only reason that I knocked 1/2 star off. Because of Molly's ""real-life"" boyfriend. Who is also very nice (kind of like Dean in Gilmore Girls. He was nice, but kind of boring, when put next to Rory's other choices.) And it is really, really hard to compare to Dev. I want the other guy out of the picture completely, and until that happens I will be a little sad. I hope to see lots more Molly and Dev in the next book.And speaking of the next book, I already know it is going to be epic and action packed. So what does that mean for you? You need to read the Dreamer ASAP. This is a great find as a favorite series for me. I can't wait for the next book.

"4.5/5Dare is the first book in a new, new adult paranormal romance series, called The Nox. I have read, and loved, a bunch of T.A. Foster's new adult contemporary romances, but I have never read any paranormal book from her. So I was really excited to see about the Nox. Dare is the leader of the Nox, a group of panther shifters that protect the town of Sullen Grove. I really enjoyed the concept of Dare. The nox are formed of all female panther shifters that don't want to fulfill the destiny laid out for them by the council (the ruling body for shifters). Basically in shifter land, each female shifter is destined to a male shifter of some kind, and when they marry, or bond, the male shifter takes over their land and moves on to get his next wife. And then when the female shifter becomes pregnant with his cub, she loses all of her power to that cub. Totally not cool.Dare doesn't want to give up her territory, or lose her powers and ability to shift. She she gathers a group of other girls and tries to rebel, which is the set up for Dare. I love this idea and I also loved the more intricate details of the council and the bonding, which you will have to read to find out for yourself. I was fascinated by the way the magic worked with the shifters in this regard. T.A. Foster did an excellent job making Dare flow right along, and with making the nox her own. Not to mention is has an addictive romance. I love T.A. Foster's romances, and I was happy to see that this was was just as wonderfully satisfying as her contemporary romances. Dare and Zac totally melted my heart. I love the way they were so drawn to each other.And I have to say, T.A. Foster really surprised me with several of the plot twists. Normally, I am pretty good about pinning down what is going to happen in books that are not thrillers or mysteries. And I had my idea of how this one was going to end in my head for about the whole second half of the book. But holy cow, I was totally off base! And I kind of loved that. T.A. Foster, you continue to surprise me in all the best ways! The Nox is already one of my favorite new adult/adult shifter series.*disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest thoughts.

"3.5/5Tangled Webs is one of those books where it was love at first glance. As soon as I saw the cover I fell in love. (side note: this is a beautifully designed book. Each of the chapters even has black and white lace designs on the pages. A wonderfully intricate touch, I thought.) I knew I wanted to read it. And then as soon as I saw the summary, and found out that Tangled Webs was about a blackmailer in historical London, called Lady A who collected secrets, I was even more excited! How amazingly cool does that sound? And then the plot thickens. When I finished Tangled Webs, I liked it and I thought it ended in a good place for a standalone. But then I went on goodreads and saw that it is the first in the Tangled Webs series. Whaaa? Now I am very intrigued to see where Lee Bross is going to take the next installment.

I really liked Arista. She is a survivor, but her years of fending for herself didnâ€™t make her overly hard and jaded. Sure, she was distrustful, but then again she is a blackmailer- so I guess it goes hand in hand with her business. But she wasnâ€™t corrupted to her core. She is still a good person, and I think Lee Bross does a great job of showing Aristaâ€™s softer side through her interactions with her friend Becky. I loved how protective Becky and Arista were of each other. I also really enjoyed Aristaâ€™s blooming friendship with Sophia. It was such a surprising treat that Sophia took Arista to the salons to see Voltaire. That was a great enlightenment element woven into the story. I hope we get to see more bits of history in the next book.There were a couple of little things that I wish I had seen more of in Tangled Webs. Not really things I wanted done differently, because I rather enjoyed Leeâ€™s writing and storytelling, but some elements I wanted to see more of. Like the secrets Lady A traded in, for example. I wanted to know what the actual secrets were. We got to know one about the first exchange she had and then we got to find out one at the end of the book, but other than those two there werenâ€™t any other big (or even little) secret reveals about her â€œcustomersâ€. I also wanted to see more romantic development between Arista and Grae. I love Grae to pieces, but it was basically instant infatuation between him and Arista. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I love the idea of them together, and I really liked their shared passion of travel and the sea, but I thought there was a really great opportunity for some building blocks to be laid between the two of them when Arista found herself staying with Graeâ€™s father and family by happenstance. We didnâ€™t really get that. I just saw Grae totally besotted with Arista from start to finish.Overall, Tangled Webs was a very good read. I loved the setting and the characters and the plotline was different than so many of the books I have been reading lately. Very refreshing. And while I do wish we got to see more in the way of slow build romantic development between Grae and Arista, as well as more secrets that Lady A collected, I think that these things will resolve themselves in the next book. I canâ€™t wait to see what Lee Bross has for us next.*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest review.

"Jesse's Girl is the 6th standalone book in the hundred oaks series. The hundred Oaks series are each young adult contemporary feel good romances. In Jesse's Girl we meet Maya, who is the younger brother of Sam (from Catching Jordan.) Sam and Jordan show up throughout the book, which I am sure will be a fan favorite, but I haven't read catching Jordan yet. Please don't stone me. I have read Breathe, Annie, Breathe and I plan to read all of the rest of the books in the series. Someday. I liked Jesse's Girl even more than I liked Breathe Annie Breathe. Miranda Kenneally does such a wonderful job with contemporary romances. Her books just make me feel good.Maya is a tough cookie, but also one of the sweetest people ever. She wants to be a musician, but she has a little issue with stage fright when she sings solo. I liked that she wasn't this super talented, super amazing- no faults kind of girl. I really liked that she had some talent issues to work through. It made her seem more real. And I loved her with Jesse.Maya and Jesse each have their own trust issues, for their own reasons. But watching them bicker until they couldn't help but get along was just way too cute for me. Yes, even though they had a hard time initially trusting one another, once they moved past it, they were both so supportive of the other. And that was heartwarming for me to read about. Each one of them had multiple times where they could have reverted, but Miranda handled every road block wonderfully, in my opinion.Jesse's Girl is a great feel good read. This is the kind of read that I want to come home to after a long day of work, or a read that I want to pull out poolside. I really do need to read the rest of the series because I know that I will love them all. If you are looking for a well done young adult contemporary romance, try one of Miranda's books.*Discalimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest review.

"Enrique de Melchor (1950-2012) was one of today's top flamenco guitar virtuosi, and the son of the famous accompanist Melchor de Marchena (1913-80).This is a book of transcriptions of his pieces (accompanied by a CD), as follows:Farruca Â«LimoneraÂ»Taranto Â«Candil mineroÂ»Fandangos de Huelva Â«MarismasÂ»Guajira Â«CafetalÂ»Colombiana Â«ZaralmondiÂ»BulerÃ­a Â«Danza de los GitanosÂ»Two of the selections here are from La guitarra flamenca, three from Bajo la luna, and one from Arco de las rosas.  However, if you haven't got these albums, you don't need to care, as all pieces are included on the accompanying CD.  The performances include other instruments, such as bass and synthesizer, which are not transcribed; if M. Faucher (the trancriber) separated the guitar parts unaided from all the accompanying clutter, my respect goes up a notch.  There are intelligent and perceptive analytical notes in Spanish, English and French.Enrique's toque moved a long way from his father's; the difficulty level here is frequently virtuosic.  It's certainly beyond my technique to play these pieces with authority at the speed of the recordings, and I would guess beyond most other prospective buyers', too.  But that doesn't, of course, mean that you shouldn't want to try.As to my rating: five stars for the quality of the transcriptions, two for the quality of the music, which to me seems rather sterile.DISCLOSUREI received a free copy of this item for review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFZ466AU2NMJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058UIPDQ#wasThisHelpful","RFZ466AU2NMJN","A5Y1PJIOU21WD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5Y1PJIOU21WD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Johnstons are seldom mentioned these days except as the starting-points for Paul Brady and Mick (then known as Mike) Moloney, but for my money they were one of the best groups ever for Irish traditional music; and all the material from the outer albums falls into that category*.  They understand their material perfectly, they're first rate instrumentally, and their harmonies are stunning â€” listen to ""Fuigfidh Mise 'n Baile Seo"", for example.Unlike the previous almost-twofer The Johnstons/The Barley Corn, this album contains all the tracks from it's constituent LPs.Those two are among my favourite folk albums of all time.""Give a Damn"" contains modern songs, and in my opinion is not nearly as strong.But at (as I write) the price of a single album, I have to give this five stars; just program out the tracks you don't like.*OK, ""Ye Jacobites"" and ""Fhir a' Bhata"" are Scottish.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10A0KLATUL7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AYD0XLE#wasThisHelpful","R10A0KLATUL7R","A5Y1PJIOU21WD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5Y1PJIOU21WD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a reissue of Festival Gitana, aka Flamenco Fiesta, recorded around 1960 on the Elektra label.Sabicas was one of the greatest flamenco guitarists of the 20th century.  His artistic name was a pun on his childhood nickname ""Las habicas"" â€” Little Green Beans, because he was always eating them.Los Trianeros are rather more mysterious: Enrique Montoya and Domingo Alvarado are quite well known, and Diego CastellÃ³n was Sabicas's brother.  But El NiÃ±o de Alicante was actually Mario Escudero, recording under this pseudonym because he was under contract to another company.As to the music, the guitarists are brilliant.  Unfortunately, the album is let down by the singers, both of whom were more at home in the greener pastures of ""aflamencada"" Spanish pop, and who here appear competent but undistinguished.

"I must make it clear at the outset that I don't possess this album, which contains 31 of the 91 tracks Paco has recorded in his seven basic (i.e. not anthologised) recordings for Nimbus.  I do, however, possess those seven albums (in fact, all of Paco's albums since his first in 1968), and since as I write no other review has appeared, I venture to add some information.I should also say that I contributed both booklet notes and a cover photograph to the Nimbus albums, so I refrain from comment on the quality of the music or the recordings.As far as I can make out, this selection comprises the following:4 tracks from Music of RamÃ³n Montoya & NiÃ±o Ricardo, 19874 tracks from Azahara, 19886 tracks from Encuentro (with Eduardo FalÃº), 19895 tracks from Misa Flamenca, 19916 tracks from Arte y PasiÃ³n, 19993 tracks from Flamenco Guitar recital, 20063 tracks I haven't been able to place exactlymaking well over 2 hours of music.At it's budget price (assuming it still is, when you read this), it's terrific value; unless your taste is specialised.If Flamenco Guitar is your thing, go for the double album of that name, which comprises Montoya/Ricardo and Azahara.If you prefer flamenco singing and the ambience of a live performance, you may prefer Arte y PasiÃ³n*.If you like the flamenco mass, then you can see it as well as listen to it.If you want music of Latin America â€” in which Eduardo FalÃº is certainly one of the greatest names â€” then most of this album will be of little interest.If, however, you have no overriding passion but like a lot of variety, then this compilation could well be ideal.  My only caveat would be the programming, which (for me) has far too many transitions of style; personally I would reprogram the tracks with the remote.*To this we may now add A CompÃ¡s, which I personally think is the better of the two albums.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNAC5VF69D6ON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PO5B5B4#wasThisHelpful","RNAC5VF69D6ON","A5Y1PJIOU21WD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5Y1PJIOU21WD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Masters of the Spanish Guitar, eh?  And so they were indeed; but the music is all Latin American.This album is in fact a reissue of Romantic Guitars, albeit with the order of the tracks pointlessly shuffled.  The LP is a moderate rarity, especially in stereo.A re-release is thus welcome.  As well as the title, the cover has been changed, the revised one being a doctored version of that on Fantastic Guitars; but frankly, the original wasn't much of a loss.So: an album of Latin American favourites by two of the World's greatest flamenco guitarists, recorded around 1960.  It's not what purists would consider ""authentic"", but it is a lot of fun.The LP was released in both mono (Decca DL 8897) and stereo (DL 78897). Whether the MP3 samples are stereo I find it hard to decide: the channel-separation certainly isn't great, but then neither was it on the LP â€” although it was definitely there (which is more than I'd guarantee for Fantastic Guitars).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1201JAHEF3WGJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149EB3YY#wasThisHelpful","R1201JAHEF3WGJ","A5Y1PJIOU21WD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5Y1PJIOU21WD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw Llan de Cubel for the first time at the Sebastopol Festival (in California), and they blew my mind out through my eyeballs. I bought every album they had on the spot, and I don't regret it.They're a six-man folk group from Asturias in Northern Spain, featuring pipes, whistle, fiddle, flute, guitar & bouzouki.  This is their fourth CD, and it's stunning. The first track is a hymn to a girl from Cabrales, with the most wonderful vocal harmonies, followed by a driving instrumental on the pipes.

"George Shipway (1908-82) was an excellent British historical novelist, whose strengths include a strong realism, and whose cavalry background made him well qualified to write about military matters.Most his his novels are more serious than this one, which he himself describes as ""a diversion"".The Club of the title (short for ""Chilianwala"") is for retired old buffers from the British cavalry â€” people very much, in fact, like the author himself.Written in 1971, when repeated strikes were earning Britain the name of ""sick man of Europe"", it's set in a (then) near future where a major clash between communism and fascism is becoming ever more imminent.Tongue clearly firmly in cheek in places, it details the Club's rather drastic solutions to some of the social problems.How much you like it may depend rather upon your own politics â€” or perhaps, simply whether you dislike extremism in all its forms.I very much enjoyed it, although I certainly didn't take it seriously.4Â½ stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5HLS01LN8D7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0583120628#wasThisHelpful","R5HLS01LN8D7R","A5Y1PJIOU21WD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5Y1PJIOU21WD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ida Presti and her husband Alexandre Lagoya formed what has been called the greatest duo in the history of the classical guitar. They were to the duo what Segovia was to the solo instrument: they innovated technically and musically and made something like fifteen world tours, inspiring nearly all the best modern composers to write for the medium, while at the same time generating an entire new body of transcriptions from instruments such as the harpsichord. They also inspired and taught several other duos who are now among the best in the World, including Ako Ito & Henri Dorigny and the Athenian Duo (Evangelos & Liza).  Their fame and impact were still accelerating when, on a tour of the United States in 1967, Ida Presti was taken suddenly ill and died. She was forty-two.Presti/Lagoya's early recordings were on French RCA, and most of these were issued as a 2-CD boxed set (7 43212 58662), now deleted. They then moved to Philips, for whom they re-recorded much of their repertoire.The complete Philips recordings in turn were issued on a 3-CD boxed set. That set, too, is now deleted; but, it is (happily) completely subsumed by the present L'Art de Alexandre Lagoya.This album appears to be drawn from the Philips recordings, most which are available on CD in the set mentioned above; but the Scarlatti Sonata, K. 87, L. 33 is a rarity: I'm unaware of any CD containing their recording.CONTENTSa1) Bach: English Suite Nº 3, BWV 808: Courantea2) Bach: English Suite NÂº 3, BWV 808: Allemandea3) Bach: English Suite NÂº 3, BWV 808: Preludea4) Scarlatti: Sonata, K. 87, L. 33a5) Scarlatti: Sonata, K. 380, L. 23b1) Granados: Spanish Dance NÂº 2, Oriental, Op. 37, NÂº 2b2-5) Marella: Suite NÂº 1 in D Majorb6) Debussy: Clair de Lune","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGEXVF5S3LP05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001R8ZL6M#wasThisHelpful","RGEXVF5S3LP05","A5Y1PJIOU21WD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5Y1PJIOU21WD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The remainder are by the duo.The pieces asterisked were re-recorded when they moved to Philips, and thus appear also on their Complete Philips Recordings, later subsumed into the 6-CD tribute to Lagoya, which also contains the Handel Sarabande.The total time is 138'05"".THE MUSICMany of the pieces are (now!) standards of the guitar duo repertory, and really require no comment from me.  In each case, Presti/Lagoya's version seems to me the best, with one exception: Falla's Spanish Dance, in which Bream & Williams outdo even the superb performance here.â€¢ Pujol's piece is, unsurprisingly, a Guajira, in that style's characteristic hemiola (alternating bars of 3/4 & 6/8) rhythm.  Ida gives it an electrifying performance, demonstrating what a magnificent soloist she was before she subordinated that career to the duo's.â€¢ The two pieces by Lagoya consist of a beautiful romantic prelude, followed by a sort of scherzo.  ""RÃªverie"", in particular, is one of my favourite guitar miniatures.â€¢ Falla's ""Fisherman's Tale"" is a lovely quiet, meditative piece; and I'm unaware of any other guitar duo recording (although I have an ancient solo recording by Laurindo Almeida).â€¢ I love all of Granados's Spanish Dances, and again I'm unaware of any other duo version of this one (although Manuel Barrueco does an excellent solo job; in fact he plays the lot, a magnificent recording).â€¢ Presti's's ""Hongroise"" is a tribute to BÃ©la BartÃ³k.â€¢ The Dowland pieces are uninformatively labelled ""Trois danses"" on the track listing.  The duo's versions don't sound much like lute music, but they're good fun.â€¢ ""Danse rythmique"" is a cheerful, lively piece that makes extensive use of Ã©toufÃ©e.â€¢ Francisco Calleja was a Spanish composer from the start of the 20th century, best known for his lovely CanciÃ³n triste, recorded by Vicente GÃ³mez and others.  The three preludes are pleasant and tuneful, although of no great depth.â€¢ Jolivet's Serenade is more modern in vocabulary, although it doesn't indulge in the pings, bonks and graunches that were later to grace some of the repertory.  Dedicated to the duo, it ""evokes, in his personal language, facets of countries in which the guitar is popular: Italy, Spain, France and the United States, home of Jazz"".  It's the longest piece here, at over 12 minutes.â€¢ Yves Daniel-Lesur was (it says here) a member of Les Six, although you could certainly have fooled me.  His elegy (which he himself transcribed for the duo from the harp original) takes the form a melody over an arpeggiated accompaniment, somewhat after the manner of ""Clair de Lune"", although again with a somewhat more modern vocabulary.  I find it very attractive.â€¢ And finally, the Suite of Royal Dances was adapted by the composer from his music for the film Marie Antoinette.  There is no information on the individual movements.BOOKLET NOTESare in French alone.  They're fairly intelligent, but, somewhat disconcertingly, comment on the tracks in a different order from that in which these appear on the album.SHEET MUSICThe music of ""RÃªverie"", ""Caprice"", ""Danse rythmique"" (and, presumably, ""La Hongroise"") was published several decades ago by Ricordi; but I don't know if they're still available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GEJTXKHVR4XG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004UR1N#wasThisHelpful","R2GEJTXKHVR4XG","A5Y1PJIOU21WD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5Y1PJIOU21WD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And for those who have (perhaps) wondered what happened to some of the other characters in that opus: a close reading reveals that the ""moribund aunt"" that Pat has to meet in the last story can only be Aunt Agatha.I find myself re-reading the middle story less often than the others (although I'm not quite sure why), but the other two are well up to the usual Charteris standard of this period.P.S.

These are followed by a table of crans and rolls, and another of the triplets and quadruplets used by Willie; then several photographs.THE TUNESThere are 152 tunes, ""all, excluding airs, that I managed to gather together up to Christmas 1975.  My original intention was to transcribe the airs as well but this proved to be such a formidable task that I was forced to abandon it.  They will be published separately, it is hoped, at a later date"".The tunes are taken directly from Willie's playing, and are printed clearly, along with his ornamentation, and expressions such as staccato marks.APPENDICESAt the end are diagrams of the range and fingering of the chanter, the tuning of the regulators, the tuning of the drones, and ornamentation for various instrument; a Discography; a Bibliography; Acknowledgments; and an Index.SUMMARYThis is a very thorough job indeed, and clearly has been a labour of love.  I recommend it unhesitatingly to all players of Irish music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EO0E7XOX6PEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0946005729#wasThisHelpful","R2EO0E7XOX6PEL","A5Y1PJIOU21WD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5Y1PJIOU21WD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As Segovia's recordings inspired the classical guitarists of the future, so the seminal recordings that Julian Bream made for RCA between 1960 and 1980 produced a whole new generation of lutenists.In my view, although lute performance has moved on in terms of historical accuracy, these albums have never been surpassed for musicality â€” and, particularly relevant to the present context, rhythm.The ""Dances of Dowland"" LP was recorded in 1968, with the following contents:01) Earl of Essex Galliard,  4202) Lachrimæ AntiquÃ¦03) My Lady Hunsdon's Puffe, P. 5404) Lord d'Lisle's Galliard, P. 3805) The Frog Galliard, P. 2306) LachrimÃ¦ VerÃ¦07) The Shoemaker's Wife, P. 5808) Lady Rich's Galliard, P. 4309) A piece without title, P. 5110) Sir John Smith's Almaine, P. 4711) Melancholie Galliard, P. 2512) Sir Henry Gifford's Almaine13) Dowland's First Galliard, P. 2214) Mrs. Vaux's Gigge, P. 5715) The Earl of Derby's Galliard, P. 4416) Semper Dowland, Semper Dolens, P. 9and a total time of 42'14"".Its CD history is rather strange, since it was re-released twice, with different bonus tracks, all taken from the now-defunct Lute Music of Dowland LP:- Under the original title, plusâ€¢ Galliard To LachrimÃ¦ , P. 46 (after LachrimÃ¦ AntiquÃ¦, as appropriate)â€¢ Captain Digorie Piper's Galliard, P. 19â€¢ My Lord Chamberlain, His Galliard, P. 37â€¢ Resolution, P. 13â€¢ Mr. Langton's Galliard, P. 33â€¢ Sir John Souche's Galliard, P. 26â€¢ Piper's Pavan, P. 8- And (in the UK) under the title of ""Julian Bream Plays Dowland: Lute Music and Dances"" (ASIN: B00004SNK9), plusâ€¢ Piper's Pavan, P. 8â€¢ My Lord Willoughby's Welcome Home, P. 66â€¢ Forlorn Hope Fancy, P. 6â€¢ A Fancy, P. 5â€¢ Farewell, P. 3You pays your money and takes your choice â€” or took it, since all of these are now apparently deleted.P.S.

"Five complete Saint novels, unabridged?  Not if the list of contents on the cover is accurate.The Saint Closes the Case (original title The Last Hero) and The Avenging Saint (Knight Templar) are certainly complete novels, and what's more, two of the best.  But ""The Man Who Was Clever"" and ""The Lawless Lady"" are merely two of the three stories in Enter the Saint, the other being ""The Policeman with Wings"".  The Saint vs. Scotland Yard (original title The Holy Terror) is not a novel at all, but three more ""novellas"" of the same kind.So this looks to me not like 5 complete Saint books, but 3.66.I do like the picture on the cover, though.If pushed to it, I would say that the best single-volume anthology of Saint stories is The First Saint Omnibus.P.S.

"""Meet The Tiger"" (later retitled ""The Saint meets the Tiger"") published in 1928, was Leslie Charteris's first book in the Saint Saga (even though Hodder & Stoughton later pretended that Enter the Saint was, presumably because they weren't the publishers of the former).It's a useful (though not infallible) rule of thumb that if a book doesn't hook you by the end of the first page, it's not going to.  Here are the first two paragraphs of ""Meet the Tiger"":'Baycombe is a village on the North of Devon coast that is so isolated from civilisation that even at the height of the summer holiday season it is neglected by the rush of lean and plump, tall and short, papas, mammas, and infants.  Consequently, there was some sort of excuse for a man who had taken up his dwelling there falling into the monotony of regular habits â€” even for a man who had only lived there for three days â€” even (let the worst be known) for a man so unconventional as Simon Templar.It was not so very long after Simon Templar had settled down in Baycombe that the peacefully sedate village became most unsettled, and things began to happen there that shocked and flabbergasted its peacefully sedate inhabitants, as will be related; but at first Simon Templar found Baycombe as dull as it had been for the last six hundred years.'Not the greatest opening Leslie Charteris ever wrote â€” he was to become pretty skillful later â€” but quite respectable for a young man of 21 in only his third book.  The character so introduced, of course, was to become the longest-running fictional hero of the 20th century.Even at this early stage, the Saint (plausibly from his initials â€” but you knew that) is a more well-developed, more travelled and certainly more eccentric character than his near-contemporary, Bulldog Drummond.  There are few of the wilder parts of the world which he has not visited, and few of those in which he has not had adventures.  He has won a gold rush in South Africa, and lost his holding in a poker game twenty-four hours later.  He has run guns into China, whisky into the United States and perfume into England.  He deserted after a year in the Spanish Foreign Legion (Drummond would have been horrified at the idea of joining, let alone deserting).Likewise Patricia Holm, the Saint's companion in so many later adventures, is a much more interesting heroine than boring little Phyllis Drummond, who exists only to be kidnapped and rescued â€” someone whom the swine have got, or might get, and nothing more.The elements of the plot are pretty much the standard stuff of the day: a debonair hero for the reader to identify with; a million dollars in gold stolen from a Chicago bank by a mysterious mastermind known as The Tiger; a gang of ruthless criminals; and of course a damsel in distress.  What separates this from the majority of such efforts is the way Charteris plays with these elements â€” tongue clearly in cheek, in places â€” and weaves a story that carries you along from first to last.  Some of the characters (Algy, for instance, or Aunt Agatha) are so skillfully drawn that you feel you'd recognise them if they walked into your local pub.Other characters that recur later include Simon's faithful manservant Orace, and â€” briefly, in Knight Templar â€” Detective Inspector Carn.From what I can make out, ""Meet The Tiger"" is very difficult to get hold of; but if you want to read the Saint books it's worth making the effort.  They're definitely best if read in the right order.P.S. For a list of â€” and discussion of â€” all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To...

"Meet the Tiger (later retitled ""The Saint meets the Tiger"") published in 1928, was Leslie Charteris's first book in the Saint Saga (even though Hodder & Stoughton later pretended that ""Enter the Saint"" was, presumably because they weren't the publishers of the former).Nevertheless, ""Enter the Saint"" is the book that introduces Simon Templar as he is in most of the books that follow, and as neither the cinema nor television has yet had the nerve to portray him:  he beats people up, robs them, blackmails them, even murders them, and gets away with it.  And the fact that his victims are particularly vicious thugs (Snake Ganning), dope dealers (Edgar Hayn), white slavers (Henri Chastel), war profiteers (Leo Farwill) and so forth â€” and that he gives a large chunk of his profits to charity â€” would not excuse him to a strict moralist.  The success of the Saint books for seventy years must mean that strict moralists are perhaps not as common as one ought to hope.There are three longish stories; a reference that may be presumed to be to Sir John Bittle (from ""Meet The Tiger"") dates the first at nine months after the end of that opus.To enumerate plot details would probably be superfluous.  Suffice it to say that Charteris was just starting to hit his stride, and that ""Enter"" introduces two of his best characters: the Saint's friend Roger Conway, and his perpetual adversary, Inspector Claud Eustace Teal.  Patricia Holm now lives with the Saint although (daringly for 1930) they aren't married, and Orace is still the stalwart retainer.A fine warm up to its sequel, what is possibly the best of all the Saint stories: The Last Hero (aka ""The Saint Closes the Case"").P.S.

"1948's ""Call for the Saint"" marks a partial, but nonetheless welcome, return to the old (1930s) Saint from the sanitised and lobotomised G-man of the War years.In the first story, set in Chicago, the Saint works to find the brain behind a protection racket; in the second, he unravels the mystery behind the rise of an apparently talentless New York boxer.Both stories, unusually at this late date, also feature Patricia Holm and Hoppy Uniatz â€” the latter in particularly fine form.P.S.

"Craobh Rua (""Red Branch"" in Gaelic) deserve to be a lot better known than they are, being comparable in terms of musicianship with the best of other Irish folk groups.  After seeing them in concert, I made a point of getting hold of all their albums so far, which consist of:1990 Not a Word About It1992 The More That's Said the Less the Better1995 No Matter How Cold and Wet You Are As Long As You're Warm and Dry1997 Soh It Is2000 If Ida Been Here, Ida Been ThereTheir line-up on the present album is...Michael Cassidy (fiddle)Brian Connolly (tenor banjo & mandolin)Patrick Davey (pipes, flute & whistles)Aaron Jones (cittern, guitar & vocals)...the first two named being the nucleus of the group from its inception.All of the albums are good, but this one is my favourite owing to the inclusion of Aaron Jones, who is one of my favourite singers, on top of being a wonderful cittern-playerFor my money, too few Irish groups feature the tenor banjo: DÃ© Dannan definitely lost something when Charlie Piggott left, and now Barney McKenna's gone, too.  The sound of the banjo alongside the fiddle and/or pipes is wonderful, and Craobh Rua really drive.So full marks from me.The occurrence of so many locomotive-related titles in the instrumentals is due to their being composed by Patrick, who is a train-spotter (or rather, railway enthusiast).UPDATEThere's now also a 6th album:2014 I'd Understand You If I Knew What You Meant","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R352XS6QA1XNRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004TJ6K#wasThisHelpful","R352XS6QA1XNRM","A5Y1PJIOU21WD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5Y1PJIOU21WD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of the greatest recordings of Flamenco ever made!Although Carmen (1913-1963) was of course primarily a dancer â€” THE female dancer of the century â€” she was also an excellent singer with a marvellous Gypsy voice.  Although they performed together for decades, she made only two albums with the amazing Sabicas on guitar (the other being ""Queen of the Gypsies""); but they show what he was capable of as an accompanist: the rhythm the two of them generate (e.g. on the BulerÃ­as or the Jaleo Canastero) is nothing short of phenomenal.Tracks 3, 5, 6*, 8 & 9 are solos by Sabicas, foreshadowing the career which would for many years make him the World's greatest flamenco virtuoso.Carmen is the singer on most of the other tracks â€” fortunately, as she's considerably better than the rather mediocre Domingo Alvarado, who never the less performs adequately on the final one.I know of no album that's conveys the tripartite essence of Flamenco better than this.

"Invisible: How You Feel Is Not Who You Are by Jennifer Rothschild is a book for women who struggle with feelings of worthlessness or lack of purpose. This book on significance is a case study on the relationship between Gomer and Hosea. It's well researched and the Biblical story is a background for modern application. Rothschild has a fun teaching style that is appealing to many audiences of every age group. Her method of turning ancient Scripture into modern teaching is impressive and commendable. It's a book about purpose and appealing to many women.If you've never studied the book of Hosea then you'll enjoy this teaching from Jennifer Rothschild. She speaks from the heart of a woman, wife, mother and friend. Many will identify with these roles in life and apply the message of significance and purpose right where they are.I'm giving the book four stars instead of five because this book is similar to Anonymous by Cindi Wood, or ""The Invisible Woman"" by Nicole Johnson. While the case study on Gomer and Hosea is different from these other two books, the theme of significance is similar and the message repetitive.If you like Jennifer Rothschild Bible studies then you'll enjoy her book ""Invisible.""I received this book free from the publisher.

"The Power That Changes the World by Bill Johnson is a reflection of his preaching and teaching style. This book is easy to read yet salted with powerful thoughts between the pages. Each chapter applies a concept of POWER with an application for your community and world. Learn how to influence and lead through Biblical methods. Learn how to identify problems and apply power resulting in change.An important message in the book is how to be a light in a world of darkness. Another important message (and a favorite book quote of mine too!) is when Johnson says, ""We are to reign with the heart of a servant, and serve with the heart of a king.""I'm giving the book 4 of 5 stars because there is one chapter that I didn't like and I almost stopped reading the book. To write a fair review I continued reading past the chapter and discovered content worthy of praise. If you stumble on this chapter ...keep reading all the way to the back cover and be blessed. Another chapter elaborates on the blessings of God with the message ""It is absolutely foolish and selfish not to pray for a life of blessing."" Johnson then explains why blessings magnify favor and this may open the ""prosperity gospel"" theology debate.I received this book free from the publisher.

"At-A-Glance is one of my favorite planner systems so when I see their products I always stop and look inside the cover. Its more difficult to do this online- to estimate the weight, print size, cover texture. When the Meeting Notebook arrived my first observation is the texture of the cover. Its not smooth like most planners and have an appearance that resembles grey flannel. Concerned this strange cover might stain with a water spot, I did what any good reviewer would do and splashed some water from my CamelBack water bottle right onto this planner. Surprisingly, it did not stain or leave a spot! Very impressive!The cover is not study like most planners, so when writing on the Meeting Guide I found it helpful to put the pad on a desktop or flat surface.  The coil edge is white and my planner arrived with bent coils which I easily adjusted into their rightful place. I donâ€™t like the color or size of the coil edge. The paper resembles college-ruled binder paper, double-sided. An added bonus is a clear plastic pocket in the back of the planner. For professional use my personal preference would be a black cover or simulated leather cover, with a black coil. Others may prefer this more casual look of the gray flannel and white coil edge.

"For more than a year I've been using the older version of this product (De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker) and so my review is a comparison of the two versions. This new version has a deep cup tray, allowing for taller coffee mugs or latte cups. ON the older machine I would have to use a cappuccino cup to get espresso of the old one and then take it over to another coffee pot to get hot water.  With the new version (shown here) I can get espresso and hot water from them same machine. The new version (shown here) has a really easy to read ""on"" button which the older version does not have.Added features on this new version also include a cup warmer, a nice feature so I'm not adding hot espresso into a cold cup. Water heats faster in this new version. One downside is that the older version has a better steam-control knob and the new version (shown here) has only the on/off button for steam.Enjoy your espresso machine- make it a coffee day!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PM397TUMJ5CH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCP71VK#wasThisHelpful","R2PM397TUMJ5CH","AC5LUZU3QNXAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC5LUZU3QNXAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bathsheba by Angela Hunt is a retelling of the Bible story in a fictional perspective. Historical characters are brought into modern storytelling and the author's imagination. In this fictionalized story, King David's wife is introduced in her family setting and then brought into the Biblical setting.If you know the Biblical story, lust and self-indulgence are key components of the message. Author Angela Hunt brings her readers just to the point of physical intimacy, using graphic imagery, and stops. She does not cross the line and keeps her bedroom scene imaginative.As a theology student I did find the fictional book stretching the imagination beyond the pages of Scripture. It's entertainment not theological.Fans of Angela Hunt writing will enjoy the book.I received this book free from the publisher.

"While the book ""Survive or Thrive"" is written primarily for pastors, I found it to be an excellent and informative resource for ministry leaders too! The book is divided into two sections based on the book title. ""Survive"" covers topics such as hiding your real identity, avoiding isolation, thorn in the side and community. ""Thrive"" includes coaching, mentoring, counseling, friendship and more. Many concepts are derived from the PastorServe website and community. Transparency is woven throughout the book and Jimmy shares deep conversations.The book is written with the message of Christian love, while at the same time confronting and convicting pastors and leaders of their weak points. It's not a shaming or condemning book to read, and addresses hidden struggles. The target audience is primarily men and mens issues, where women are identified in their roles as ""pastors wives"" and how the men can minister at home.My favorite feature in the book is the chapter endings. Each one includes a set of very powerful questions:Reality questionsRewind and review questionsReflection questionsRemember questionsRespond questionsWhile many of the questions are personal for private journaling and mentoring, a few might be useful for team building your ministry staff. Many included related Bible verses for discussion.Also included in the book are infographics for emphasis and effectiveness. Use the book for individual study, mentoring, coaching or as the foundation to helping pastors in your community.I received this book free from the publisher.

"If you're a follower of Hillsong Church and Hillsong United Music then you'll like the ""Live, Love, Lead"" book from pastor Brian Houston. This book is an encouragement for anyone in ministry or leadership. Houston sets the stage: ""Living fully, loving completely, leading boldly- these are hallmark's of Jesus' time on earth. Whether you're taking baby steps or giant strides, walking on water or running on empty, wherever you are in your journey of faith, Jesus is the ultimate guide and companion.""Using his own story as a backstage to the book, there are 20 chapters in this book including:** Life in the Faith Lane** Confident in the Call** Pioneering** Shame No More** The Narrow GateEach chapter begins with a verse from Hillsong Music, followed by a memory from Houston's life, and then his commentary. While the book structure resembles a devotional writing style (quote-personal story-commentary-action call) it's much longer and more informational than daily devotions. With 20 chapters I found the book required more time and it took me almost a month to read the entire book using my reading method of ""one chapter per day.""I've highlighted about one-fourth of the words from Brian Houston- he's a convicting author with a powerful and transparent message to share. While I do not know his church history this side of the ocean, I did find it fascinating to discover the challenges he met with Jesus on his journey of obedience and faith. Many of my Christian friends are also reading this book and enjoying it too!I gave the book four stars instead of five because it took me a LONG time to finish reading it!

"Perhaps you know Laura Story from her beautiful songs? When you read her book ""When God Doesn't Fix It: Lessons You Never Wanted to Learn, Truths You Can't Live Without"" you'll have a deeper appreciation for the passion behind her words.  The book addresses the challenges of living and loving someone with chronic illness. Sharing her intimate and painful story, this book is a raw look into the challenges  and causes of mental illness. I saw many similarities in her story with my stepdad who struggles with multiple sclerosis and similar brain misfirings. The emotional rollercoaster family members ride in a journey of healing and acceptance is well documented in Laura's book and her music too!The book is encouraging and yet unfiltered truth. Woven into her story is the love of God that surpassess all human understanding.

Also included in the front ate two pages for births and one page for recording marriages and another for deaths. An attached ribbon is the same color as the Bible cover and can be used to mark your most recent reading location. The index tabs are color coded to divide the Old Testament and New Testament.

"Cosmetically this is one great looking computer with awesome video quality and color. The exterior is a slick bronze color similar to the color of my gold iPhone. It's a bit heavy and too large for one-handed use. Manufacturer info says the computer is pre-installed with backlit keyboard and I did not notice this feature when using the computer in dim evening light. Backlighting was not visible. Powercord is lightweight and not chunky like previous Toshiba cords. The powercord connection on the computer does cover the input jacks, so I had to turn the cord a few times to test the input jack. The sound is AWESOME with SkullCandy built-in speakers. The dual keypad is awkward to use and there is a learning curve to make sure I clicked the left side or right side of the keypad. Too often I was clicking intuitively and then getting undesired results.The 360 degree design is functional and fun. The computer converts to a tabletop presentation for audience view. This would be handy for many professionals. The tablet function is interesting, except I did not like the keyboard resting on my lap when using the computer as a tablet. It's also bulky in size and heavy in weight for tablet use.The computer processing speed is VERY SLOW and it took forever for Google searches, downloading, and online social media use. Very  SLOW. Computer warned me the initial estimate for downloading Chrome would be 12 hours. Yes, 12 hours. The estimate kept vacillating between 12 hours and 37 minutes to download the Chrome browser. I have a super high seed wifi and download large files DAILY so this was a distraction and annoyance to experience slow speeds. My family uses streaming video and speed is critical to our enjoyment.Windows 10 is preinstalled and has its own challenges. It's tricky to change the default search engine and browser.In sum, the Toshiba Satellite Fusion 15 L55W-C5257 15.6-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Laptop would be useful for someone with patience and slower processing time. It's not functional for school use because the size will not fit in a backpack like the smaller notebook computers my kids use at their school. Likewise for travel this is a tad too wide and heavy. For in-office presentations the device is attractive and functional as a presentation, tablet or computer. I would not recommend this for streaming video or downloading.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q3JUFGKV2LY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010SBAYIS#wasThisHelpful","R2Q3JUFGKV2LY3","AC5LUZU3QNXAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC5LUZU3QNXAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Brilliant Design and Easy to InstallMy husband and I both work at home and find the solicitors who ring the doorbell to sell products are disruptive to our work and privacy. So we installed the Myfox Wi-Fi Security Camera and within the first hour of installation we watched the gardeners maintain our yard, the painter patch the holes on the house, and two Jehovah Witnesses leave a flyer on the porch. This camera is getting a workout! It's like caller ID for my front porch!Installation was super easy. Install the MyFox app to your cell phone and follow the instructions on screen. It takes a few minutes for the ""barcode"" to identify the camera, so try moving the phone and camera different distances until you hear the confirmation ""beep"" which indicates the camera is activated with your phone. Add additional family members or guests to the account. Options include Owner, Kids, and Guests. If you are out of town and need a house sitter this is a good method for the sitter to watch the exterior of the home. You could install an interior camera as a baby monitor too! 2-way radio on the device allows communication options.The video quality is excellent color and clarity. There is an HD option that can be turned on or off. When the sun shines on the window it causes a glass reflection on the video image. Manufacturer website does not recommend placing device near heat or direct sun. The powercord is long enough to reach from my wall outlet to the window. Optional video cloud service is available from MyFox for one-day or seven-day backup. This would be handy if you travel or if you are having Amazon packages delivered to your house via postal deliver or drone! Watch those packages arrive and know when to call a neighbor and ask her to pick the package off your porch if you're away from the house or out of town.I've already recommended this camera to my family and friends and I'll be buying a second camera soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WUACR3BMCQNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZWBURWI#wasThisHelpful","R1WUACR3BMCQNC","AC5LUZU3QNXAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC5LUZU3QNXAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Air Purifier is a perfect solution to keep our family healthy! I started waking up sneezing almost 25 times each morning and knew something was in the air. So I called a professional company to clean my air ducts and heating units (see image) and then installed this quiet air purifier in my bedroom. I am pleased with the performance and my symptoms have improved when I keep the purifier running. The filters are easy to remove and clean.One drawback is the smell from the purifier unit. I'd describe it as a smell associated with electronic devices. Hopefully this issue will go away over time.An added bonus of the purifier is that it also works as a cooling fan with a slight rotation. At night I turn the fan to low and it's barely a whisper. During the day the fan is at full setting and does make a noticeable noise.

Since the stitching is overlaid on the top of the apron (rather than hidden inside seams) it's noticeable but only up close. The fabric quality is superb...thick and sturdy. Pockets are generous and allow me to carry my cell phone rather than sitting it on the kitchen counter where it's likely to get splashed with cookie batter.Since I am petite, the neckline is much lower than I'd prefer but this can be remedied with a few stitches around the neck strap. Overall length is perfect and apron protects clothing well. I am amazed at the low price for such a fine quality product. I'll be buying more aprons as gifts for my friends and family.I saw a few OLD Amazon reviews from 2012 about thin fabric (not at all like the one I received) or color inaccuracy. This was not my experienced with the apron and the one I received is thick fabric and a beautiful wine color. Perhaps the manufacturer has made improvements in the last three years based on customer feedback.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DZ5WFPBRWOTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5IVJ68#wasThisHelpful","R2DZ5WFPBRWOTK","AC5LUZU3QNXAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC5LUZU3QNXAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I researched Bible journaling ideas, these pens were recommended so I purchased a set. They arrived well-packaged inside an easy-to-open plastic sleeve. Included are six pens in these sizes:.20mm.25mm.30mm.35mm.45mm.50mmMy first observation is that the pens are not erasable like the FriXion pens I normally use. My second observation is the sharp edge of the pens and a few times I did notice indentations in the Bible pages beneath my journaling. One method to keep the pens from tearing or indenting multiple pages might be to use a thin cardboard beneath the page you are journaling.Because I keep my Bible on my lap when reading, I'll occasionally notice my underlines are uneven.

"Iâ€™ve always been a fan of Joanna Weaver books and Iâ€™ve been waiting to review Lazarus Awakening DVD Study Pack, a video Bible study filmed in the Holy Land. If youâ€™re like me and unable to visit the historical sites where Jesus walked, then youâ€™ll enjoy the DVD! Set aside a time and a location for this journey into the tomb of Lazarusâ€¦and discover your own resurrection of faith. Find your place in the heart of God.The Lazarus Awakening DVD Study Pack includes eight video sessions, each lasting from 17 minutes to 20 minutes in length. There are a total of three DVDâ€™s and the entire series requires almost three hours of viewing time. This is an excellent opportunity for local small group study, individual Bible study, or a mini-retreat. After watching the sessions Iâ€™d recommend a mini retreat! Take breaks between the video sessions and read Bible passages referenced in the video. Write in your journal what the Holy Spirit has placed upon your heart. Set a day for your mini-retreat at homeâ€¦ just you and Jesus, or set a location with a few friends.Filmed in the most beautiful locations, this video Bible study is eloquent, unscripted and heart-driven!I found myself captivated by Joannaâ€™s voice, her deep passion, and her personalization of the stories she teaches. She has a gift for organizing key concepts into eight sessions, and then presents a verbal outline of the key points. Write down these key points in your related study guide included in the DVD set.Disclosure: I received this free from the publisher.

"The appealing advertising and product merchandising on this router makes it really attractive. When the box arrived I think I saw my husband hug the thing! His relationship faded with a short time as the router performance was less than desirable. The first issue is the four external antennas shown in the upright position. When attaching the four external antennas I heard a rattling noise in two of them. After attaching these external antennas they would not position vertically as shown and they kept falling down. Clearly two of the four external antennas arrived defective.I continued the installation and it did improve the speed of my family network (running 16 devices). We gave it a good workout! The media prioritization is a great benefit and allows us to give higher priority to work computers and normal priority to the Apple TV or the Wii connection.I'm giving the device three stars: speed and media prioritization are a benefit, the defective external antennas were a disappointment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MMA4ZAC3D1EA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN21DK#wasThisHelpful","R3MMA4ZAC3D1EA","AC5LUZU3QNXAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC5LUZU3QNXAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Empty Hands by Sister Abegail Ntleko is truly inspiring. From the time I picked up and read an advanced copy for review, I was immediately sharing her amazing story with my husband, daughters and friends. Each chapter left me in amazement at the remarkable strength of this intelligent and compassionate lady. She has much wisdom that can be applied in the mission field, in local churches, in our communities and in our homes. Her philosophy is to ""Meet people where they are in their lives and accept them."" She does this in the face of unimaginable adversity.There are many cultural and religious experiences in her story. As you read the book you'll be exposed to South Africa during poverty, apartheid, male dominance and AIDS. Sister Abegail Ntleko walks her readers through her own journey of faith, from numerous Christian churches, Buddhist friends, and Zulu traditions. If you try to put the author inside the parameters of conformity then you'll be disappointed in your effort. She is a remarkable and unique woman with a passion and love that is unstoppable. She lives intentionally, purposefully and passionately to make the world a better place.This book is so inspiring I intend to read it many times. It's rich with a passion unseen in many people. The cultural aspects expose the reader to life beyond the American armchair. Half-way through the book I found myself searching for and sponsoring a young girl in South Africa through Compassion International. If I can help one young girl aspire and achieve her dreams just as Abegail has done, then my money is following my heart. This story has left a lasting imprint on my heart.Christine AbrahamFounder and Ministry Director  |  WomensBibleCafe","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TTXEV1185L9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1583949321#wasThisHelpful","R1TTXEV1185L9T","AC5LUZU3QNXAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC5LUZU3QNXAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I bought this at my local grocery store I saw the enticing price and bought three containers. Upon opening the first container I quickly noticed a problem: the packaging! In order to open the package lid, I had to cut away the label and save the measurements on serving size. So I cut around the container label near the bottom of the lid. It's a nuisance.The second packaging problem I had was the ""measuring cup"" which is actually the lid itself. It's marked with different lines and I filled to the 2-quart line, twice, to make 1 gallon for my kids. The second time I went to make another batch of lemonade, I removed the lid and leftover powder spilled all over my kitchen floor. I wasn't thrilled to mop the floor and get the sticky stuff up before someone tracked it onto our carpeting.Yes, the lemonade has the same great taste as past Country Time products.

"One of my favorite books to read the summer of 2015 is this book by Amy Lively, How to Love Your Neighbor Without Being Weird. Being the founder of a #BibleCafe I loved the book so much I added it to my Top 10 Favorite Books of 2015 and also pleaded with the author to join her book launch team on Facebook. This book speaks my language about ministering to women in small groups using the gift of hospitality in your communityWhat I like most about this book is the experience and willingness to share Bible study methods that worked and failed in a local community. Amy tackles the most common fears and excuses for leading local studies in your home. She tells the truth about what it required to invest in the lives of your neighbors and to move into your calling.If you want to discover how to obey the Lord's command to love your neighbor then get this book NOW! Amy has literally mapped out the steps you'll want for inviting neighbors, planning your groups and identifying your purpose.I'm in a local leadership group with twelve ministry leaders and I hope they will select this as one of the monthly books for discussion. It's really encouraging and once you finish reading the book you'll get off the sofa and meet those neighbors who walk by your home each day. Pray for your neighbors, love your neighbors and read Amy's book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ7L155BGCZ4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764217003#wasThisHelpful","RQ7L155BGCZ4P","AC5LUZU3QNXAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC5LUZU3QNXAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dutch Sheets is a well known and well-respected prayer warrior. In his Authority in Prayer book, he differentiates between the  power or strength to rule and the authority or right to rule. Many times the author references Scripture verses to validate his point. The King James Version, Amplified, Message, and New King James Version are frequently quoted in the book. The author uses numerous examples of praying for our nation, for ministries and for friends.Claiming authority over Satan and winning against spiritual warfare is often not preached in local churches, so I found this a handy reference book. I enjoyed the Authority in Prayer book and Iâ€™ve read it three times. Each time I read the book Iâ€™m convicted of something new. For this reason I have both a printed copy of the book and also a Kindle version for easy reference. The author reminds us that â€œChristâ€™s church would have keys (authority) to lock the gates (government) of hell and release the gate (government) of heavenâ€ (see Matthew 16:19).Sheets is quick to point out that he doesnâ€™t have audible conversations with God. But like many Christians walking in relationship with God, he does â€œtalk to Himâ€ through intentional prayer. Thereâ€™s an interesting lesson on being called as priests, which some religions may disagree or dispute based on their theology. The author shares experiences of modern prophets such as Bill Johnson, Lou Engle, Chuck Pierce and Sandy Grady. If you have a prophetic gifting then this may interest you. Sheet gives examples of intercessory prayer and reminds his readers, â€œMy first thought when seeking direction is to always look in Scriptureâ€¦â€At the end of one chapter there is a lesson on numbers in Scripture, sometimes called â€œBiblical numbers.â€ Skeptics may find the information outside their comfort zone in spite of the associated references from the Bible. The numbers three, five, seven, eight, eleven and twelve and given meaning by Sheets. Some of those meanings are not in alignment with what Iâ€™ve learned through Bible scholars at Liberty University, so Iâ€™d recommend you investigate this further for a better understanding. If youâ€™re not gifted with prophecy, this will probably make you uncomfortable!If you want to know what it would be like for Christians to invade this side of eternity with authority in prayer, then read the book. â€œIf a society remains the same after Christâ€™s church shows up, then the church is not being the church,â€ explains Sheets. After reading the book youâ€™ll most likely grow in boldness with your prayers. Or, if you find the theology makes you too uncomfortable you might toss the book away. Filter the book through prayer and the wisdom of your pastor. Donâ€™t just sit on the sidelines of spiritual warfare.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J0R168VU6FGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KO2F7U#wasThisHelpful","R1J0R168VU6FGN","AC5LUZU3QNXAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC5LUZU3QNXAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I started reading The Accidental Feminist: Restoring Our Delight in God's Design by Courtney Reissig I found the book captivating. It's not easy to write about feminism from a Christian perspective as the topic often clashes in understanding and table talk discussions. For this reason, it's a book worth reading! The author recounts her journey out of â€œaccidental feminism,â€ offering wise counsel for Christian women related to relationships, body image, and moreâ€”drawing from the Bible rather than culture. Like many women she was under the influence of a culture pressuring her to conform to the world view rather than the Biblical view of womanhood. How does a recovering feminist fit into the pages of Scripture?Courtney studies the development of the feminist movement and its historical impact on women and society. She explains, ""As the culture has evolved, so has the concept of feminism."" This alone makes the book worth reading, as she defines feminism as ""equality equals sameness."" Is this Biblical and how do we apply feminism to our Christian identities? You'll learn the benefits of the first feminist movement in the 1950's and how this changed through the generations to a label challenging modern girls today. ""Feminism began as an ideology that promised equality and freedom from the control of men. It has become an ideology that tells women they can use their power, sexuality, and freedom to influence men,"" writes Courtney.There are some interesting themes in the book and worthy of a small group or book club discussion. Topics include what it means to be a God-designed (and not a man), a talk on submission (makes most women uncomfortable), body image, church and home. You'll see these topics from a feminist view and a Biblical view, and that's worth exploring. What you learn can be shared with the younger generation and remembered by the older women who lived through the first generation of the feminist movement.Educate yourself with these book concepts and then form your own opinion. Get the conversation going in church and at home...this is a topic often ignored in modern Christian culture. Worth reading....more than once!Disclaimer: I received an advanced copy of this book free from the publisher.

"The Sterling Silver Sky Blue Topaz December Birthstone and White Topaz Halo Heart Earrings, Ring, and Pendant Necklace Jewelry Set is not what I expected, yet still pretty. I am a custom jewelry designer so when I saw the words ""sterling  silver"" I had the expectation that this would be a nice quality product. Nothing about it resembles the .925 sterling silver that I've worked with as a designer. It's very lightweight and most sterling silver is heavier. In this set, the birthstone is heavier than the metal. There is no authenticity certificate to validate the silver.The heart-shaped ring has a pointed end (bottom of heart) and open edge. It's comfortable to wear. The earrings are pretty and match the set. The necklace has a thin chain with a spring-style clasp. A lobster clasp would be preferred, as spring clasps are more difficult to attach and tend to fall off over time. The pendant is attached with a pretty bail, however it's soldered at the bottom and over time may wear out. The packaging box is low quality, missing a manufacture name as well.You'll want to be careful cleaning the set, although cleaning and care instructions were not included. I use a silver polishing cloth on my jewelry. This product did not arrive tarnished like most silver.The price seems high for the quality, packaging and overall product. I've seen similar items at wholesale bead and jewelry shows for significantly less.

"I was excited to receive the Cosco The Avery Line 3-Drawer Classic Baby Changing Table, Dark Cherry Finish. When the UPS delivery man dropped off the package, we both observed the weight and size of the box. Since the intended location of my dresser was upstairs, I opened the box downstairs and assembled upstairs because of the weight. The color and finish on the dresser is beautiful, and the height and size sufficient for a changing table. As a dresser, the drawers are smaller than I would prefer for storage. It will hold diapers, creams, blankets and small items.Observations:1) the Styrofoam packaging fell apart as I opened the box and made an enormous mess. Using a stopwatch, I recorded 8 minutes to unpack the box and materials.2) one of the parts (particle board) arrived damaged. It was a decorative piece on the underside of the dresser.3) one of the dresser knobs was missing.4) Assembly time took 4 hours and 22 minutes. I've assembled similar products and this has many assembly parts5) unlike other products, an Allen-wrench is not included. Use your own Philips head screwdriver.6) three of the four legs fell off my unit.7) While the 32-page assembly book has good graphics, it's difficult to discern which screws to use- black or silver, because they are similar in size and shape,I gave the dresser 2 stars because the color and finish are very nice. I deducted three stars because the assembly is too long, the dresser was falling apart before I even used it, and parts were missing. The price is in alignment with the product...if you hire someone to assemble it then four hours of labor would equate to a more expensive ""finished"" unit.

"I bought the original Gorilla Glue because the packaging says ""bonds virtually everything: wood, stone, metal, ceramic, foam, glass and more."" My intended purpose was to attach a wooden leg to a wooden dresser. I applied the glue and my first observation is that it ran and dripped onto the carpet.

"Whether you're a blue collar worker, white collar worker, ministry leader, or blogger, Jon Acuff's ""Do Over"" book is an essential handbook for any career! From the time I first started reading the book it was stuck in my hand and I did not want to put it down. Immediately I started telling family members and friends to read the book. The concepts are simple to implement- yet full of life-long skills.In my print copy of the #DoOver book I've highlighted 90% of the book with marks such as ""try this,"" or ""do now"" and ""quote that."" Seriously great book!Acuff's writing style is entertaining and fun to read. This is not a boring career book with dry concepts. His fresh approach includes ideas such as:>> Master the Invisible Skills>> Never Become a Dinosaur>> Grab the Right Hammer for Your Career CeilingHidden behind years of humor and sarcasm is a brilliant mind with equally brilliant concepts. He's authentic, bold, humble and confident as Acuff shares his testimony on intentional career building. I could read this book over and over again (and probably will) and never get bored with it.

"Before the Amazon shipping box was even opened, I could smell the strong citrus scent of these scrubbing pads. The scent is strong and noticeable! There are several thin pads inside the box and they resemble flattened sponges. In fact, I secretly hoped they would inflate and grow like those little kid toys ""fill with water and watch me grow."" My scrub (it's not a sponge) remained flat even after running water to wet the surface. This is a very thin kitchen scrub. The cleaning power is powerful, especially on white tile grout. I did all the scrubbing and when finished I was disappointed to find the ends of my fingernails were broken and raw. Again, the scrub is thin. I'm accustomed to using a kitchen sponge with a scrub surface. Once my grout was white and clean, I ran the Clorox Scrub Singles, Kitchen across my tile counters. It's not a sponge, so it left a layer of cleaning product and I needed to use paper towels to wipe away the mess.If you order the Clorox Scrub Singles, Kitchen, Citrus from Amazon I HIGHLY recommend you do NOT order any other items in the shipping box. Food, books, clothing...all of these things packaged with the strong fragrant citrus will most likely absorb the smell. Each time I open my cleaning supply cabinet I can smell these scrubs.I'm undecided to give this two or three stars. It cleans the grout with a bleach-like effect, removing stains. It makes a mess on the smooth surface and I had to use additional towels to wipe away the product. The smell is noticeably strong.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KGK52YXZC2PH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMSX1FC#wasThisHelpful","R3KGK52YXZC2PH","AC5LUZU3QNXAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC5LUZU3QNXAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Awesome upgrade to an already great appliance! This George Foreman grill is loaded with features. I especially like the digital temperature and controls. Cleaning is easier than most of my appliances. I followed the instructions and did not use cooking spray on the grills, and it was super easy to clean. Everything I cooked on the grill tastes great. The searing feature sealed the juice and flavor and makes a big improvement to the flavor. I cooked one batch of chicken-apple sausage without the searing feature, and was disappointed. The next time I used the appliance I seared the sausage at 500 degrees, then the temperature automatically drops to 350 degrees. The burgers I cooked were also fantastic, and the drip pan did it's job well. I'm giving it four stars instead of five because:1) There is a plastic smell when first using the appliance, as the temperature heats to 500 degrees there's a noticeable smell or burning plastic. The more I use the appliance the less I notice it, so it seems to be disappearing with use. Since the appliance generates a great deal of steam, I used the center cooking island in my kitchen to protect my cabinets from steam.2) I did manage to burn my fingers the third time I used the appliance. The instructions recommend using oven mitts and after a painful burn, I'm now using them.3) This is a challenging appliance to store in my cabinets. It's wide and bulky, with a plastic exterior. There are two sets of grills (four plates total) plus the drip tray. Make sure you plan ample space to store this when you're not cooking.Great tasting food...you will not be disappointed. Happy Grilling!UPDATE: We are now using this grill several times a week in our home! The food and flavor is much better than on the outside BBQ or the stove. Our favorites are grilled sausages, hamburgers and chicken. The meat is not dry, it cooks faster than the outdoor grill and the flavor is retained.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VP140YA63RLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYK18O#wasThisHelpful","R2VP140YA63RLJ","AC5LUZU3QNXAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC5LUZU3QNXAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fasting For Financial Breakthrough by Dr. Elmer Towns is an excellent teaching on Biblical fasting, rooted in theology not prosperity. This is not a ""get-rich"" teaching and instead focuses on partnering with God to manage your finances. Upon completing the book I felt a renewed and refreshed attitude towards money. I was so impressed with this teaching that I felt called to lead 500+ women through a 40 Days Financial Fast. After reading this book I learned to:1) Fast and pray according to God's will2) Fast and pray according to Biblical principles3) Fast and pray in faith believing4) Fast and pray in fellowship5) Fast and pray continuously6) Fast and pray to be cleansed of sin barriers7) Fast and pray with a great number of peopleI learned truths about money, financial obligations, self-control and my relationship with God. While I'm a graduate of the Financial Peace University from Dave Ramsey, there are many theological concepts presented by Dr. Towns that are not included in FPU study. Both teachings are worthy of your time and investment!My first exposure to Dr. Elmer Towns was a class on The Gospel of John at Liberty University. There I learned he is co-founder of the University, Dean of the School of Religion and a translator for the New King James Bible. After watching numerous teaching videos and reading his book on the Gospel of John, I was so impressed with his work that I started looking for more books by this Bible scholar. 10 Quotes from Fasting For Financial Breakthrough #TweetThisFasting is a time when we do more than ask for money. It is a time to reexamine our relationship with God. Elmer TownsWhen fasting, we must find God's presence, abide in it and fellowship with Him. Elmer TownsWhen you need faith to trust God for big things, fasting is a great way to develop it. Elmer TownsFaith is putting God's Word into action. We haven't exercised our faith until we've applied God's Word to our problem. Elmer TownsStewardship is the proper management of time, talents and money for the glory of God. Elmer TownsBiblical money management is putting God first, necessities second and pleasures last. Elmer TownsWe don't need to pray long prayers for God to answer. He can hear and respond to the shortest cry for help. Elmer TownsGod often gets our attention through money problems. Elmer TownsJob's greatest wealth was not his money; it was his walk with God.

"Anonymous: Discovering the Somebody You Are to God begins with a personal invitation R.S.V.P. from Cindi Wood, popular Bible teacher and author of the Frazzled Female series. During the six weeks of study, there are lessons for five days of the week. It took me about 20 minutes to complete each daily lesson and it was easy to understand.  Topics include:Week 1: Shades of Anonymous- When You Feel InvisibleWeek 2: The Woman Who Anointed Jesus- When You Are JudgedWeek 3: The Woman with the Issue of Blood- When You Are Tired of HurtingWeek 4: The Woman at the Well- When You Feel OrdinaryWeek 5: The Woman Who Committed Adultery- When You Are Burdened with ShameWeek 6: Rhythm of Grace New Name, New IdentityThe first week begins with an introduction to feeling invisible. The next four weeks you'll meet ""Judged"" in the house of the Pharisee; ""Hurting"" near the shores of the Sea of Galilee; ""Ordinary"" by the well in Samaria; and finally, in Jerusalem's temple courtyard, you'll meet ""Shame."" Perhaps you've met Judged, Hurting, Ordinary and Shame...or maybe these are identities you've experienced sometime in your life. Upon completion of this study you'll see them through the eyes of Jesus.The writing style is conversational and easy to follow as Cindi Wood shares stories from her experiences teaching middle school children and overcoming clinical depression. You'll like the pleasant personality of the author as she falls in love with her readers!****************************************************10 Quotes from Anonymous: Discovering the Somebody You Are to God #TweetThisHaving a relationship with Jesus Christ dispels every other identity that holds you hostage. Cindi WoodGod does not define you by your current or past struggle. He defines you by who you are in Him. Cindi WoodSometimes the best words are those spoken within the heart. Cindi WoodThose who follow Jesus cannot be snatched out of His saving hand. To suggest so casts doubt on the safe grasp of our Savior. Cindi WoodGod does not want any of His children to live an unfulfilled life. Cindi WoodJesus never forces anyone to seek and receive what He has to offer. He simply provides the opportunity to do so. Cindi WoodGod allows in each of our lives earthly experiences to teach us spiritual truths. Cindi WoodMercy is best described as God's attitude toward those who are in distress. Cindi WoodWhen you come to Jesus, He's always full of compassion to embrace you. His love is unconditional and steady. Cindi WoodIf you'll let Him, Christ will turn your trembling into triumphing. He longs to encourage you in your faith and communication with Him.

"This seemed like a good solution to replace my Comcast device, since Comcast has raised the monthly rental fee to $15 per month. It took 45 minutes on the phone with Comcast to get the modem operational from their end. As I was installing this I saw the power cord connector was loose on the modem and I appeared to have a defective unit. From the day I installed it, I started losing internet service daily, about the same time each day. When my neighborhood had a 30-second power surge today and lost power for less than a minute, the device went down completely and it took about 10 minutes to reboot itself. Frustrating to have a modem without battery back-up even for 30 seconds!

It satisfies both the sweet tooth and the salty tooth...just as the product is described. At the grocery store the flavors all look the same..so it helps when my kids identify the EXACT flavor they prefer. I've discovered they do NOT like the Sweet & Salty Peanut flavor, or the Sweet & Salty Peanut Dark Chocolate Peanut & Almond flavor. The exact flavor they like is this one: Chocolate Pretzel Nut. I have several unopened packages of the other flavors and the kids beg me to buy more of their preferred one. Although the bar is small, it fills them up at snack time until they come home from school.Nutrition Facts per package label: 150 calories, 5g fat, 2g saturated fat, 0g trans fat, omg cholesterol, 160mg sodium, 24g carbs, 2g fiber, 12g sugar, 2g protein.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VU8TDBWRASSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JELVRVC#wasThisHelpful","R2VU8TDBWRASSJ","AC5LUZU3QNXAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC5LUZU3QNXAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I decided to return to the health club after an absence, I asked my fitness friends which earbuds they liked best. Many of them suggested the Yurbuds Inspire Sport Earphones for women. They arrived quickly with Amazon Prime shipping and I discovered great sound, lightweight comfort and an excellent fit. They stayed secure as I worked on several weight machines, the elliptical and the stationary bike. The overall length of the cord is great for exercise machinesâ€¦not too long and not too short either. I especially like the secure fit in my iPhone earphone jack, because the Apple earbuds always fall out! I did find the cord twisted frequently and I have not yet resolved this frustration.

" 0:43 Mins The Black & Decker EHC3002B Glass Bowl Chopper (black) that I tested was disappointing. Following the instruction guide, I assembled the product easily: I put the chopper blade in the bowl, attached the plastic safety lid, attached the motor. Following these instructions I made the Spinach Artichoke Dip on page 7 in the instruction guide. The appliance did not chop or blend the ingredients well and I transferred to a mini food chopper to complete the job. On another test, I used almond butter, honey, coconut and coconut oil....once again the appliance did not chop well so I transferred them to another device to complete the job. These ingredients in the second test were soft and should have chopped well. The ingredients in the first test were thawed spinach and thawed artichoke hearts, following page 7 in the instruction guide.My Observations:1) This is like a power drill on a salad bowl. Sounds like a power drill or a dentist's drill (please see attached video)!2) The chopper blade sits unattached inside the glass bowl, and is attached to the ""power drill"" motor at the top.3) The appliance did not chop the food4) The glass bowl does not have handles, so removing the hot glass from the oven is a challenge even wearing two oven mitts.I would not personally buy this for myself or give as a gift to a friend. Rather, I would select a mini-chopper with blade attached to the base unit.

"Mere Christianity by C. S. Lewis is one of his most famous books. The book is a based upon a series of radio talks during the World War, with additional elaborations and wisdom from Mr. Lewis. His understanding of theology is deep yet practical, and not swayed by any particular denomination. Clearly he dislikes argumentative Christians and his book focus is to teach the basics without conflict. He writes, ""This book, then, does not consist of academic philosophical musings. Rather, it is a work of oral literature, addressed to people at war."" His original audience consisted of men and women who might not live another day, and he purposed to encourage them and bring them into faith. A former atheist, Mr. Lewis simplifies the core concepts of Christianity and argues for the benefits of having a faith rooted in Christ,I found this book a pure delight to read, and will most likely read it again a few years from now. The use of imagery to explain theology is a powerful teaching tool. It's a refreshing and unique approach, with words flowing from the heart of the author. He simplifies what others tend to complicate. One of my favorite chapters is when he explains why some Christians can be un-Christian in their actions towards others. The words are powerful, convicting and written in love.************************10 Quotes From Mere Christianity #TweetThisIf the universe is not governed by an absolute goodness, then all our efforts are in the long run hopeless.

"I was disappointed when my Mavea water pitcher started leaking with this filter. The Aqua Optima Evolve is taller than the Mavea filter slot, and this caused leakage in my pitcher. Since the water is BELOW the top of the filter, it sits inside the reservoir and will not drain. When I pour from my Mavea pitcher into my tea kettle, water spills down the side of the pitcher and makes a mess on the counter. In terms of function, this does not fit the Mavea as advertised. In terms of taste, the water tastes pure and without the bitterness or chemical flavor of some water filter products. I have included photos for comparison. You will notice the distinct height difference between the Mavea filter and the Aqua Optima Evolve Filter.Also, another reviewer said her Aqua filter is made in China.

"I have a one-eyed dog who struggles with night blindness, so I keep night lights in the house to prevent him from walking into furniture. My previous night light would automatically turn on at night and go off in the morning, so I decided to buy something similar. When the Maxxima MLN-09 LED Night Lights arrived, I noticed the cheap quality and design. Opening the lens cover and looking inside the light fixture I observed a very tiny light, equal to something you'd find in a battery-operated tea light set. The lightbulb is smaller than an eraser head on a pencil. Yet in spite of it's tiny size, the bulb has a powerful effect. It produces a blue glow with a geometric pattern. In my small laundry room, it's too bright and the pattern is distracting. In my family room, the room is larger so the brightness is less intense.

In her book Sheila addresses these ten feelings that can become overwhelming burdens:>> Heartache>> Disappointment>> Fear>> Bitterness>> Unforgiveness>> Anger>> Regret>> Abandonment>> Shame>> InsecuritySheila calls them the ""ten chaotic feelings that tend to paralyze us"" and walks you through a solution to these frustrating burdens. By the time you finish the book you will feel lightened from your burdens.I enjoyed reading The Storm Inside: Trade the Chaos of How You Feel for the Truth of Who You Are by Sheila Walsh. I especially enjoyed the ministry stories about women who reached out to Sheila for encouragement during their own times of pain and darkness. The book is filled with wisdom and based on truth of Scripture. Highly recommend reading one chapter a night before bed!******************************************************10 Quotes From The Storm Inside #TweetThisBefore we can embrace the good news of the love of God, we have to deal with the truth of who we are without Him.

"We've been using the  Brita pitcher  for many years and with the California drought our water started tasting really disgusting! I was excited to find this new pitcher and it has everything I wanted. Most important is taste, and this pitcher improves the taste of drought water significantly! Second, the pitcher has a really unique way of filling with water. IN the previous  Brita pitcher  I used, it was necessary to remove the lid each time I filled with water. On this device, there is a ""water flap"" at the top of the pitcher. Simply place the pitcher under your faucet and when the water runs the flap opens automatically. When the reservoir is full,, the water flap automatically closes.The one drawback to this pitcher is the weight. The 9-cup is top heavy...and little children hands or people with weaker hands would have a hard time lifting the pitcher. When the pitcher is full, I need to carry it with two hands.I am pleased with this pitcher, it tastes better than my previous brand, it's easy to use and I save money on bottled water. each member of my family uses the  Camelbak Eddy Bottle (1-Liter/32-Ounce) and we refill it using our filtered water. Less expensive that buying bottled water!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DY5JYJ7X87G3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002U50QQQ#wasThisHelpful","R1DY5JYJ7X87G3","AC5LUZU3QNXAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC5LUZU3QNXAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Learning from the Giants: Life and Leadership Lessons from the Bible by John C Maxwell is an examination of the leadership style from Scripture. Maxwell explores key traits and leadership styles from  Elijah, Elisha, Job, Jacob, Deborah, Isaiah, Jonah, Joshua and Daniel. Imagine that you are sitting in your home office and you receive a visit from one of these giants of faith. What would they say to you? What will they teach you? Will you apply the lesson, or simply say â€œThatâ€™s great for you but for me I needâ€¦â€I took my time reading the book Learning from the Giants: Life and Leadership Lessons from the Bible, because itâ€™s power-packed with ideas. I decided to read the book twice before reviewing it, though this probably frustrated the author and publisher as they waited for my review and I sincerely apologize! I enjoyed being mentored by these giants and will continue to apply the lessons learned throughout my ministry and personal life.Learning from the Giants: Life and Leadership Lessons from the Bible is well-written with no stone unturned. Itâ€™s informational, motivational, and applicable to the life of todayâ€™s leaders. Donâ€™t miss the change to learn and grow!I received this book free from the publisher. I was not required to write a positive review and the opinions I have expressed are my own.

"I reviewed the WHITE Humidifier. The device is compact and does not take up excessive space like the other products I have used. Our air is extremely dry with the California drought and we are having unusually warm weather, yet when we finally turned on the house heaters I wanted to add moisture to our home. After reading the user manual, I made sure to place the appliance away from electronics (big concern) and away from my shuttered windows. I filled the humidifier with regular tap water, though the user manual recommends distilled water to prevent ""white dust"" on the furniture. For product testing, I put the humidifier to the maximum setting- turned the knob all the way to the right. I checked the appliance every few hours and highly recommend this because one reviewer said her unit leaked! I ran the humidifier for TEN HOURS to see how long the water tank would last, and finally turned it off when my carpets were wet from moisture. The air was significantly improved: less coughing, less sneezing, and dry mouths were improved. I will continue using the device, however now that my product testing is complete I will use a MEDIUM setting and most likely switch to distilled water.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CX8ZCT9VUMZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNBKJFW#wasThisHelpful","R2CX8ZCT9VUMZO","AC5LUZU3QNXAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC5LUZU3QNXAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""JumpStart Your Leadership"" by John C. Maxwell is a easy book to read and digest. You can read the entire book in just over one hour, or you can read the daily tips for three consecutive months.The book content was originally published in Maxwell's ""The 5 Levels of Leadership book.""As you read the book, it's obvious this is a summary of another book with larger ideas. This jumpstart concept is divided into 90 ideas. Each idea begins with a short paragraph and is followed by a leadership question for reflection. Here are some of the leadership questions from the book:>>> Write down one positive thing you can honestly say about each person on your team. Then take the time during this next week to compliment each person with it.>>> Consider a candid conversation you have had that did not lead to a positive result. If you could redo the conversation, what might you say differently to emphasize the personâ€™s potential and how you could help them reach it?>>> Are you avoiding a difficult conversation you know a team member needs? Why? What step will you take today to discuss it with them?These would be good journal prompts for leaders, or agenda items for a team meeting.The book is similar to a devotional in format and structure, however it's leadership-based and not faith-based.. Each day begins with a leadership quote, followed by a short paragraph based on Maxwell's book The 5 Levels of Leadership, and concludes with a journal prompt. It's very simplistic and easy to use.While seasoned leaders might find the book too basic, the audience is geared towards newer leaders starting their careers. It's basic material rather than deep wisdom. There were a few times I wondered if John Maxwell was the author or if the book was written by someone else, perhaps by an editor. For a deeper study, read Maxwell's entire book ""The 5 Levels of Leadership"" and use this as a supplemental action plan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EEEIVQKF3PCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFYJ1P6#wasThisHelpful","R3EEEIVQKF3PCF","AC5LUZU3QNXAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC5LUZU3QNXAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two medium-size dogs and both dogs love the Cesar Home Delights Wet Food. They enjoy all flavors and after using this product for about two months, I've observed a noticeable change in their fur! Their fur is much softer and less coarse, with a shiny coat we have not seen before. They are thriving on this pet food!There are differences in the ""flavors"" so test them out and see which flavor your dog prefers. I am able to split a container of the more dense flavors between two dogs. They each get one-half a container morning and evening, mixed with a small amount of dry food and sometimes warm water. You can feed them the Cesar Home Delights Wet Food without adding dry food or water; this is a personal eating habit for my dogs. Feed one full container if you are not adding dry food. The beef stew flavor is watery... less dense, so I need to give each dog a full carton of the food, morning and evening. There is a noticeable odor from the potato in the stew, so if your dog's ""gas"" is overwhelming, try a different flavor.I will continue buying this product...my dogs look beautiful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R173T4ZJCKMCUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLSBJOS#wasThisHelpful","R173T4ZJCKMCUY","AC5LUZU3QNXAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC5LUZU3QNXAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Women's Ministry in the 21st Century: The Encyclopedia of Practical Ideas is a handbook for new and seasoned ministry leaders.

The book sections include:Friendship and FunServing OthersSpiritual GrowthTen-Minute DevotionsBible StudiesMovie Club/Book ClubCelebrations and EventsOutreachRetreatsLeader Helps (forms)While the book is primarily geared for local ministries, with a little modification and creativity some of the ideas could be implemented for online Bible study and women's groups.

"The budget-friendly KitchenAid KCAS10OB Aluminum Nonstick 10-Piece Set Cookware - Onyx Black is designed for use on gas, electric, and induction cooktop surfaces.  I tested my cookware using a gas stove. Potholders are recommended, though I found the handles were not hot and I only needed potholders when I removed the lids.  The 10-piece set is a beautiful and slick Black Onyx color. Included items are:8-inch skillet10-inch skillet1.5 quart saucepan and lid3.0 quart saucepan and lid3.5 quart saute pan with lid8.0 quart stockpot with lidI found the pots were generously sized, yet they were not too large to fit in the cabinets.  They seemed to be slower to heat foods and appeared to use more energy, however I've been using Magnalite Professional for 20 years and it would be unfair to compare this well-priced product to a higher priced product. Please read the other Vine reviews besides mine to see if there is a consistency in the heating time. The pots were very easy to clean, and I liked the clear lids for viewing the foods as they cooked. I'm giving my review 4 stars because the design, comfort and price are awesome.The pots include a limited lifetime warranty, see instruction book for terms and conditions. Make sure you save your purchase receipt for any warranty claim. Shipping note: the box is INCREDIBLY HEAVY. My husband is a weight-lifter and he struggled to get the box from the front door into our kitchen.

"I was unable to find blank 3 x 5 index tabs in the local stores, so I took a chance and bought this online. My concern was the thickness of the paper, since the 3 x 5 lined index cards I purchased at Walmart were much too thin. It turns out the Smead Card Guide was very impressive...more than I expected. Thick quality so the index stands upright in my file boxes. The card does not bleed through and using a black Sharpie marker, I was able to write on BOTH SIDES of the index card.

"Cinnamon tea is a personal favorite, and after drinking Harney and Sons Tea Bags, Hot Cinnamon Spice in a local restaurant I was glad to find it here at Amazon. My restaurant tea was served in teabag form (not the satchel bag that other reviewers have mentioned) and the flavor was pleasing. My friend and I both enjoyed the taste and we each reused our teabags for a second cup.I enjoyed it so much, I kept the outer cover of the teabag packaging to remember the name and brand, then ordered it here on Amazon! I've been drinking Good Earth Original tea for years, and it's no longer for sale where I live. Between the two, the Harney and Sons Tea Bags, Hot Cinnamon Spice is a more blended flavor, where the Good Earth Original Tea has a very distinct cinnamon flavor. I've also tried the Tazo Sweet Cinnamon Spice Herbal Tea and found it tastes like ""bark"" and was not pleasing.

"The Republic of Tea, Get Wellness Tea is an absolute necessity in my home! My family drinks this during the winter months, at the start of a sore throat or a cold.

"My family really likes the Bath and Body Works Lavender Vanilla Bath Soak. The scent is relaxing and not overpowering, it's soft and gentle. Added to a bathtub of hot water, the steam from the bath combined with the soft lavender smell is a perfect blend for relaxation. It doesn't require a large ""portion"" to create the desired effect, which is good when you're raising two teenage daughters and products like this are a necessity in the home! When the kids have a bad day at school they know that a calming lavender bath will make it easier to sleep at night. It does take a few minutes for the crystals to dissolve, so swirl the bath crystals in the hot water before you enter the tub.

Mine have NEVER smeared and I've never had problems with them, even living in hot weather of California. What I like most is the visibility...they work great on the thin pages of my Bible and do not smear. I also like the erase ability feature... the thin Bible pages do not tear when I erase a mark. I lean towards the darker colors for underlining my Bible and text books: greens, blues, pink, red, orange, brown.My daughter is an artist and I bought her a set of these Japanese gel pens for Christmas. She thinks they're fabulous and uses them often, especially the fine edge. They work great on the thicker artist paper and the colors are vibrant.The pens are very easy to hold and the cap snaps to the bottom of the pen so you will not lose it.

"What Your Heart Needs For The Hard Days  by Holley Gerth is a comforting devotional book for women. The book includes 52 devotionals, one for each week of the year.  Each of the 52 devotions begin with a NIV Bible verse, then a personal story from Holley, and words of encouragement. She takes a hard look at her most difficult days, and rewrites them through a heart filter based on Jesus. Her beautiful writing style is conversational, as she shares her story and then encourages the reader to write down her own story. Journal prompts begins with ""What My Heart Is Saying to You...."" and end with ""What My Heart Is Hearing From You."" After 52 weeks or 52 days of journaling your heart, you will discover a heart makeover!Some of the Devotions Include:**  God Wants to Lift You Up When Life Lets You Down**  God Is Thinking About You Today**  God Will Give You Courage Not Condemnation**  God Won't Let You Fall**  God Doesn't Want You To Try So HardThe book assumes the reader is having a hard day (as the title suggests) and is written with the purpose to lift burdens and give hope.

"Good Leaders Ask Great Questions by John C. Maxwell is a basic leadership book. The focus of the book is in alignment with the title. Maxwell uses examples from his own leadership experience, sharing successes and failures. The common theme of asking questions is divided into to parts: Questions John Maxwell Asks and Questions Leaders Ask Him. Most emphasis is placed on answering questions from leaders, such as:**  What must I do to lead successfully?**  How does leadership work?**  How do I get started in leadership?**  How do I resolve conflict?**  How can I succeed?**  How can I successfully navigate leadership?The book is informative, yet some of his other books are much better. This book reminded me of a summary of coaching calls or perhaps a solution to managing coaching clients. The structure is repetitive and the book loses it uniqueness after the ""Ask question"" concept is grasped. I'm a huge fan of John Maxwell books, yet I found this one a bit too simplistic and geared primarily to new leaders.Maxwell's The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership is excellent and one of the required books for my pastoral leadership class at Liberty University.

I found the motor noise very loud, my husband could hear it downstairs and thought I was drilling holes into the wall. The vibrations are very rough and the drawback to the noise and hard vibrations is that I wanted to QUIT brushing as fast as I could, to eliminate the loud sound and the harsh pressure on my teeth. The final frustration is the size of the bristles.,..they remind me of the toothbrushes I bought my kids when they were toddlers. The brush head is so small, that I found I had to move across my teeth several times...like brushing my teeth with a toddler brush.

When I saw the Jillian Dempsey Natural KhÃ´l Eyeliner, Rich Brown I was intrigued by the product description and decided to give it a try. Let me just say, I LOVE THIS. The product is easy to apply, even with my contact lenses on. It smudges into a beautiful eyeliner very easily, and has a smoky brown color that looks natural. The smudge tip of the brush is really effective. The product stays on all day long and does not smear or flake into my eyes (and contact lenses).

"I'm reading this fasting journal for the THIRD time and highly recommend it! The format is simple to use and begins with a summary of Biblical fasts: Esther three-day fast (Esther 4), Daniel 21-day fast (Daniel 10), Atonement fast (Leviticus 23), Battle fast (Judges 3), Lifting judgement fast (1 Kings 21), Healing fast (Isaiah 58), Dominion fast (Matthew 4).You'll want to read the ""Fasting"" book by the same author, to help understand these types of fasting.The journal begins with a daily devotion, a reminder of fasting tips from the related book, and thoughtful questions for reflection. The printed journal has adequate room for writing your responses, however if you are using the digital version then you'll want to write your answers in a composition book or notebook. The daily journal ends with a pray and then an action item.This is an excellent tool to follow when fasting. If you're choosing a 40-day fasting period, then follow this with ""The Fasting Edge Journal"" another 21-day journal by the same author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R8RV1UP3Y7DT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006FIJ4PI#wasThisHelpful","R3R8RV1UP3Y7DT","AC5LUZU3QNXAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC5LUZU3QNXAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know this TV had some serious light-bleeding issues when it was first released. In fact, I'm assuming that the revamp is the main reason these were released to Vine - so that the fix could be noticed and the reviews could note that. We have had ours up for roughly a month with absolutely no signs of light bleed at all. However, without knowing when they other reviewers began to experience it, I will say that if that changes, I will update my review ASAP. For this price, there shouldn't be such serious flaws.Now, on to other parts of the review. The TV came extremely well-packaged (as it should). No signs of any issues there. Installation was a breeze, though my husband might argue that point simply because he's the one that had to hang the thing. Maths, you know. The instructions were easy to follow, and the videos on Sony's website were very helpful. I like that it has the option to hang or to sit on a cabinet, and we honestly didn't know which we were going to go with at first.Set-up was also a breeze, though longer than I would have liked. There were updates right out of the box, which is typical these days for electronics that hook up to an internet connection. No worries there - but the update felt like it took forever. So just be aware that if you're in a hurry, you might want to wait until you're not. But getting everything set up was extremely simple - once the updates were done, I had us hooked up to Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google, and several other places within a matter of minutes. All those are pre-loaded as apps on the TV - which is great, because we haven't had cable for years. Hate paying the prices. We used to have a Fire TV box, but that is now upstairs in the play room since it is no longer necessary down in the living room.The tv comes with two remotes - a standard one and a smaller, more compact one. I primarily use the smaller one, but it does take some practice to use well. The Teenager spend a full 10 minutes one day trying to figure out how to do something, and in typical Teenager style, just kept pushing the main button part. *sigh*The picture is, frankly, incredible. The first thing we actually watched once it was hooked up was 'Planet Earth', and simply - WOW. I have no hesitations about saying this is the best looking tv we've ever had. It truly is incredible. We haven't tried the 3D yet, but frankly, I'm not sure I'm even worried about it. With the size of the screen (also the *largest* tv we've ever had) and the Ultra HD, we're pretty content.The sound - is fantastic. My husband's biggest concern was that the sound would not be very high quality because of the flat-panel, wall-mount, whatever. However, it really does sound significantly better than we had expected. Which is good, because we haven't hooked it up to the overhead speakers yet. But the things we have watched so far have all had great sound, bass included.The only minor nitpick that I have found is that of Google Photos. I use Google Photos to back up all my pictures. I am logged into Google on the tv. However, you cannot just access your pics on the tv (for slideshow). No, you have to create a slideshow online, then access it on your computer or phone, then GoogleCast it to the tv. Pretty clunky, really. I'm *assuming* this is because Sony wants people to use its online picture service, but...it doesn't play very nicely with Google either. I would happily have copied pics over to Sony, but it was a pain.Overall, I could not be more pleased with this tv. If it weren't for the weird Google Photos functionality, I would happily give the tv 5 stars with absolutely no question. If anyone knows a better workaround (I'm fairly technologically savvy, but I'm no expert), I'd love to hear it. Even better would be if they would just fix it. But in the meantime, we are loving watching movies in glorious Ultra HD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38405FITIMP65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R45XL64#wasThisHelpful","R38405FITIMP65","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our backyard has been having...issues. Come spring, we will be tearing out the troubled spots and replanting them with grass. Unfortunately, it's difficult to test this product during the fall in the PNW, as the deluge season has arrived. I'm anxious to try this and update later with specifics, but so far I have learned a couple of interesting things:1. This stuff is seriously *expensive*2. The coating takes up literally half the product - which means you're actually paying for only 20 pounds of seed.3. I didn't realize this when this was offered to me, but while this particular version is recommended for a wide swath of the US, it does NOT show up as premium for - you guessed it - the PNW. Oregon and Washington have their own blend. Had I known that, I would not have ordered this.As I said, I will be anxious to try this, but in the meantime, unless this stuff works amazingly well, I wouldn't buy it again simply because of the price and the fact that the coating takes up so much of what the buyer thinks they are getting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PEMI2ZJESVK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8KLA38#wasThisHelpful","R3PEMI2ZJESVK7","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What happens when you're 12 and the person you have always considered your best friend dies suddenly. You don't find out for two days, and - even worse - you never have the chance to say goodbye. Nor do you have the opportunity to apologize for your last act - meant with the best of intentions, but not received as such. When maybe you're a little different than the average 12-year-old girl, and you suddenly learn that a rare jellyfish is migrating north and the sting could be unnoticed. If you're Suzy, you begin to research that jellyfish in order to convince everyone - but mostly yourself - that things *don't just happen*.While the book is a middle-grade level book, the story contained within is appropriate for all ages. It is unique and absolutely beautifully written. Suzy has a voice that is all her own, but her struggles to accept the death of her friend and what that means for her own life, are universal. The book is divided into parts that have sections within them. Each part begins with instruction from Suzy's science teacher about how to do a scientific research paper. Then the sections alternate between Suzy's research and her remembrances of her friendship with Franny throughout their 12 years. In a sense, the book is a scientific research paper regarding love, loss, and acceptance.The characters in the story are so beautifully...human. As a parent, I know that ""sometimes things just happen"" has crossed my lips - and never have I appreciated that internal struggle that it could cause in someone who strongly appreciates order and reason. And yet...sometimes they do. Coming to terms with that can take years for some, and some never do. This is the beautiful tale of a girl who begins to learn that sometimes, things aren't what we want them to be, and change is just a part of life. An excellent book for a discussion of love and loss, and for any classroom, library, or home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HAVKZ5UN14DN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316380865#wasThisHelpful","R2HAVKZ5UN14DN","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a huge fantasy fan, and with a teenage son who also enjoys fantasy, I was intrigued by this game. After playing with members of the family, the overall rating is a 4. Two adults, the teen, and the almost-nine-year-old played together, and though everyone agreed the instructions were a bit complicated to start with, overall a great time was had by all.The bartering was one of the parts of game play that has the most potential to go either very well, or be the most competitive. Once a dragon is killed, the players involved in that have only 60 seconds to divide the loot amongst themselves. If there are four pieces of loot and 3 players helped defeat the dragon, who gets that last piece? Does one player promise to give extra to another next time? The kicker is - if the 60 seconds passes, then *no one* gets the loot. Players can choose to help other players, or they can choose not to.The card system was deemed a little confusing, but nothing overwhelming. It just took some time for everyone to understand how (and why) the cards worked as they did and what could be done with them. A few games in, and everyone was much more comfortable with the entire game.Yes, we had an eight-year-old playing with us, and while it was confusing in some ways, she really enjoyed it. As long as the competition isn't too cut-throat, I don't see any reason that other kids that age wouldn't be able to play as well. Ideally, I would say 10+, even though the game says 12+. And for 3-6 players, it would be a great game for a fun evening in with friends.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R243W0XYQRM49M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631402897#wasThisHelpful","R243W0XYQRM49M","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Concussion' is the story of Dr. Bennet Omalu, the neuropathologist who discovered CTE - the disease that is damaging/killing football players at a rate that would never be allowed in anything else. Dr. Omalu, whose role in the discovery has been largely ignored/forgotten/whitewashed, came from Nigeria having little to now idea how big a role football plays in our nation. When he discovered CTE, and published his findings, he was certain that the news would be welcomed as a way to save future players. Instead, he got a fast and furious lesson in how big business (Yes, the NFL qualifies) can spin stories and take over the narrative.This book takes a look at not only his discovery, but at Dr. Omalu as a person. His upbringing, who he is as a person, his motivations, and his convictions. Interspersed between the what the author has written are bits in italics - the words of Dr. Omalu himself. It's an eye-opening look at what shaped the man who, on nothing more than a whim, autopsied the brain of Mike Webster to discover the cause of Webster's crazy. It's also a heart-breaking account of what happens when the NFL and its fans put their money and desire for entertainment ahead of the health and well-being of those responsible for that money and entertainment.The writing in places feels a bit...off. It's sort of like how a person inexperienced in English would write, with the very short sentences and awkward dialogue. However, it's not often and in the overall scheme of the story, it does not do any damage. It is an interested tale, as evidenced by the fact that the movie (with Will Smith as Dr. Omalu) is coming out this December. It's also a tale that needs to be told, for the sake of those who are putting their lives on the line for a billion-dollar entertainment industry, as well as for the forgotten man who has continued doing his best to help them.Look, I am a football fan (not fanatic). I have a team I follow, and I root for them to do well. But I also believe that these players, not all of whom have multi-billion dollar contacts, are going to put their future health and well-being on the line, then the NFL has a responsibility towards them that has been lacking. This book makes very clear the science, the attempts to negate the science, and the outcome if something isn't done. Now the question is - are people truly listening?","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPBR8KQ0H43DD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812987578#wasThisHelpful","RPBR8KQ0H43DD","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have three cats, an older one and two younger-but-not-quite-kittens. Our prior cat stand, that we have had for ages, was one tier and was purchased when we only had one cat. So I was excited to get this and give it a shot.The biggest thing is - this thing is TALL. I'm 5'6"" and it's taller than I am. What this means is that putting the last couple of pieces on (if you're my height or shorter) WILL require a stool of some sort. It's also got a fairly good-sized base, so make sure you have the floor (and wall!) space. On a similar note regarding the size - the top tier has not been explored by any of the cats, I think because their just not sure exactly how to get up there. Everything else has at least been checked out, but...not that one.Putting it together was fairly easy. A tip - separate the bolts beforehand, and make sure you're grabbing the right post number, as they're very similar. Also, double-check the size of the rectangle when it calls for one, as there are three that have slight variations. Overall however, it wasn't difficult at all.The box this arrived in is HEAVY. Seriously. I'm pretty sure the carpet covers lead...ok, maybe just a lot of plywood. But if you have lifting restrictions, you'd better have someone available to help you. On the plus side, it seems pretty stable and I think it will last for a while. The carpet is quite plush (the kids love how soft it is), and the sisal seems like it's on there pretty well.The only other issue I noticed is a quality-control issue. There are a few places where glue was used that it sticks up fairly significantly. Not something that most cats are going to want to lay on. And on one piece, where a bolt screws up into the top of it, the bolt actually extends beyond the wood when it's tightened in all the way. There is fabric over it, but...it shouldn't do that.Overall, I think this will be a great addition for the four-legged goofballs. The youngest has already been quite active on it, and the others are slowly getting accustomed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K30I9DL2ZIP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY251AK#wasThisHelpful","R3K30I9DL2ZIP7","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dog Breath. Not to be confused with Puppy Breath, which is associated with all things cute and fuzzy. Dog Breath, on the other hand, could be associated with unwashed feet, rotten milk, and teenage body odor. In other words - EW. This is the problem that the Fresh Breath Drops are attempting to remedy, and the jury is still out whether it actually does much.I have a dog and 3 cats, and they all drink from the same bowl. I put the amount of drops required into the correct amount of water and...wait. I don't sniff the cat breath often, so I don't worry about that. The dog breath, well...it's hard to ignore when they stick their muzzle in your face for attention. It may be that after a couple of weeks there was a slight improvement, but I'm not sure that the cost effectiveness is really there. It's definitely easy to use, and none of my pets had any issue drinking the water with the drops in it, but 9 pumps per bowl means that I'm going to be going through this stuff like crazy.So, overall you probably should ask yourself - are you ok with unwashed feet in your face? Is there something else more cost effective that would be a more long-term solution? It wouldn't hurt for anyone to give it a shot, but with 4 animals drinking from the same bowl here, it just doesn't make sense.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SX4MP1LR216I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHU4644#wasThisHelpful","R3SX4MP1LR216I","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mikey is a regular kid, even though his mother is a political wannabe, his older sister is in his class, his town appears to be the epicenter for paranormal happenings, and his best friend is partially a God. Oh, and he has a disabling case of OCD. But what happens when you are the ordinary kid surrounded by extraordinary happenings? How do you figure out how to be ""normal"" amidst the chaos?Patrick Ness has written a book with a unique perspective, but one that seems so normal for every teenager living. Finding the extraordinary that is within us all, when everyone else seems to be ""the special one"" can truly be a challenge - and that challenge doesn't end when high school does. The voice of Mikey rings so true, even though I'm so far out of high school that I now have a high schooler of my own. The writing is honest, and the occasional Immortal floating around just makes the struggle to find what is special all the more poignant.The story is also done as a sort of story-within-a-story. Each chapter begins with a synopsis of the current goings-on in the battle of the ""indie"" kids against the Immortals. For example, the book begins:""Chapter The First, in which the Messenger of the Immortals in a surprising shape, looking for a permanent Vessel; and after being chased by her through the woods, indie kid Finn meets his final fate.""The rest of the chapter then goes on with Mikey telling his story outside of the supernatural one. Each chapter begins the same, with an update on the supernatural battle at the beginning, before Mikey carrying on. It was an interesting way to both set the tone of the chapter, compare the differences in the ""ordinary vs. extraordinary"" in Mikey's view, and (honestly) giggle a little bit at the cliche stories of the regular kid who becomes the hero.Overall, it was a fun and mellow read with a great message. It's not a beat-you-over-the-head-until-you-realize-my-point kind of message either, which most teens and pre-teens would respond to. It's just...a good story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OSF0JAURWOJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062403168#wasThisHelpful","R1OSF0JAURWOJ9","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"i was looking for a nice watch for my husband, as he will not buy one for himself and his old workhorse is about ready to be put out to pasture. When I saw this one, I thought it would be great. He likes bigger watch faces and it's not flashy. However, it has its pros and cons.First - it's a nice watch overall. It keeps excellent time and works well. The metal band is quite nice, though maybe not for everyone.However - the band is HUGE. Seriously. We took it to a local watch place to have some links removed, and after the guy took out 6, he said that he couldn't take out any more...and it's still too big for my husband's wrist. Granted, he's not exactly a tower, but...you may need to be to wear this watch. In addition, he likes to be able to see his watch at any time, day or night. This is not going to work for that. Any light absorbed eventually wears off, leaving the wearer in the dark.Overall, it appears to be a pretty decent watch. But do pay close attention to your wrist size, otherwise you'll have a watch that you just can't wear.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R197P1BYEAR7EB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487Y2BI#wasThisHelpful","R197P1BYEAR7EB","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 8-year-old daughter is a competitive gymnast. She spends, at this point, around 10 hours in the gym at practice a week. One of her heroes is Gabby Douglas - who happens to be in this book.The book is perfect for a comfortable reader. My daughter is in third grade and has no problem reading the stories. The colorful drawings are nice, though sometimes a bit distracting from the story itself. The book is broken into three parts: It's Not Easy Being a Kid, Family Matters, and Practice Makes Perfect. The first two parts each have five stories, the last one has six. At the end of the book, there is a Bibliography for anyone who would like to do further reading on any of the athletes mentioned in the book.This book would be excellent in libraries, classrooms, and for any parent whose child has an interest in sports. Many of the athletes dealt with difficulties as a child that would also be helpful for some adults to use to encourage kids who may be facing their own struggles.

"Frankly, I hate carrying a purse. I'd prefer to just grab my phone and keys and go. So when I was offered the opportunity to try this wallet case out, I said yes. And so far, I'm fairly pleased.There are several things I like about this case - the ease with which I can take my phone in and out, the slots, and the magnetic closure. The material is nice looking - while it lasts. The way it fits my phone, including the cutout on the back. The fact that I can just have a small amount of cash and a couple of cards and be ready to go.Things I'm not so fond of - The material tends to start splitting in spots. It's not very sturdy. The ""buttons"" on the side that are supposed to be for the power and volume are not very easy to find, even when you're looking right at them. I can't count the number of times I have turned the volume up instead of down - the finger feel is simply not there. The sort of cheapish feel overall.In general, if you're one of those people who loves to switch out cases regularly and like this style, then you'll be all set. I tend to prefer to find a case and keep it as long as possible, so while I like many of the options of this case, it won't last as long as I would like it to. Also, something to remember - you're very limited (by design) with how much you can carry in a case like this. If you're prone to have lots of cash (or change) or like to have every member card under the sun with you, then this type of wallet will not work for you.NOTE: This case was offered to me in exchange for a fair and honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R08ZQHW6SDS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010C8IC1S#wasThisHelpful","R2R08ZQHW6SDS2","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We go through a lot of water bottles in our house. I have a teenager, a gymnast, an adult who travels a lot and me. Frankly, I'm not sure I could count in my head how many we have floating around right now. So I was a bit hesitant when offered the opportunity to review this one. And yet, it has turned into my absolute favorite.The biggest thing about this water bottle, for me, is the ease of cleaning. The bottom screws off, the top screws off, and the glass insert just pulls right out and can go in the dishwasher. The outer plastic probably can as well, but since the glass part does, I just hand wash it and call it good. It goes back together just as easily, and the silicone seal at the top keeps liquid from leaking in between the two pieces.The flip lid is easy to open and close, and I really like the little slide lock. I often slip my water bottle into my bag when I'm taking my daughter to gymnastics in order to carry everything, and it drives me crazy when a water bottle spout leaks or pops open. Haven't had a problem with this yet.The opening is also big enough for ice! Huge. Seriously. Our weather this past summer has been ridiculously hot and any drink un-iced didn't stay cold for long at all.I've dropped this a couple of times, and no breaking glass. My teenage son does the dishes and hasn't managed to damage it yet. So I must declare that it's a good, sturdy water bottle. Really, I like this one so much I'm thinking about getting one for everyone in the house and getting rid of a few others that are not nearly as good.

"I do not have fine hair - more towards the normal side. But I'm always looking to add a bit more body, particularly since I don't do a lot to style. Wash, add a conditioner, maybe a curl creme, and let it go. I *might* blow dry on occasion, but that's rare. So I was curious about this shampoo in my longish, wavy hair.It definitely has given me a bit of a boost, though nothing significant. The smell is nice, though it borders on somewhat strong. It does tend to fade, though. Cleans without feeling stripped, works well for my lack-of-styling needs.Overall, I like it. It's not AMAZING, nor is it TERRIBLE.

"I have longish hair with a medium texture that tends to dry wavy and then slowly straighten over the next couple of days. Since I prefer the wavy, I was curious to try this. I have to say, I really like it.A huge bonus - it doesn't smell massively strong. That might seem strange to start with, but the last texture stuff I tried was STRONG. This smells pleasant, and it tends to just fade away. However, the waves have been lasting longer than usual. I'm on day 2 now, and I could easily have another hair-down day (if it wasn't going to be in the high 80's). And while the instructions say to use this after regular shampoo and conditioner, I didn't bother with conditioner and my hair still feels soft with no sign of damage. While I probably wouldn't use this without my conditioner regularly, I wanted to see how it did.Overall, I like this better than most I have tried and think this will probably be a staple in my limited supply of *stuff*. I'm pretty low-maintenance, so if something sticks, that's a pretty darn good sign.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DM1G6H3JF9WY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PATJODU#wasThisHelpful","R2DM1G6H3JF9WY","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm always curious about the sprays that are supposed to resemble in effect what the ocean does to one's hair. So when this popped up, I thought I would give it a go. I have medium texture hair, fairly long, wavy when I let it dry naturally. I'm badly in need of a haircut, so I tend to get less wave than I would like. In this, the spray did make a difference. My hair was soft, and lightly wavy in just the way I like for roughly a day-and-a-half. It was simple to use - spray, tousle, then I went to bed and let it dry.So why only three stars? I cannot tolerate the smell. Some stronger smelling products sort of...disappear...after a while. Not this one. The smell was long and strong - pretty much as long as the spray was working. I can't quite pinpoint what it is, and some may like it, but it was just too strong for me. It was sort of like wearing one of those cheesy ""ocean-scented"" candles around my neck for a couple of days.Sadly, as much as I like the effect of this spray, I will not use it again lest my nasal passages spontaneously combust. Kind of a bummer, really.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B1KP4J3QP3NA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0UJV4O#wasThisHelpful","R2B1KP4J3QP3NA","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not often these days that a book, particularly the first in an apparent series, comes in at a whopping 580 pages. Even less often does the doorstop turn out to be quite such an excellent read. Both cases hold true in 'Twelve Kings in Sharakhai', the first book in The Song of the Shattered Sands series. Be warned, however - there is a lot going on in this first book. Try to read it too fast (even though it's compelling), and you'll feel like you just came out of a book coma.Ceda is a young woman from the slums of Sharakhai, a city in the desert. She is also a ""pit dog"", one who fights in the pits for her living. She has honed her skills because she has a goal - vengeance. Finding the one responsible for the death and humiliation of her mother, and killing him. The problem? The one responsible is one of the Twelve Kings - rulers of Sharakhai for the last 400 years. Human, all. They can be killed. But they were ""blessed"" by the Gods with their long lives and their grip on the city. They are ruthless, and they want everyone to know it. When Ceda goes out on Reaping night against the law, she starts a chain of events that she, nor the Kings, could ever have predicted.First - the heroine. Ceda is a strong, clever young woman. She is human, and has her faults. But make no mistake - she is truly an excellent main character. She is well-developed, and battles with the same conflicting emotions and issues that all people grapple with. Only in her world, there is magic, Gods exist, and Kings can live 400 years. As for the other characters, they have also been extremely well fleshed out. There's not a one that I couldn't picture in my head. No one is a cardboard cutout...all have good and bad, and make decisions that reflect that.The setting - incredible. The details that went into crafting this world are amazing. From the sand ships, to the creatures that roam the desert, descriptions of the city and it's different areas and inhabitants. There was a lot of work put into this, and it shows. However, the truly pleasant thing as a reader is that it's never dull or dry. Everything is woven into the story, in context, in a time that is fitting. There are no crazy-long passages there just to tell the reader all about something. The author allows the reader to get a feel for the setting, then bit by bit brings it more into focus.As for the story, it's done just as well as the rest. It's a unique take on medieval fantasy, with elements from today thrown in (carefully) here and there. And yet it all makes sense and works with the characters and the surroundings. The characters and the setting are woven together so well that sometimes it can be hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that, in some ways, the setting itself - the city and the desert - ARE characters.Overall, I was taken aback when I realized how darn big the book was. Then I groaned. Then I put it aside for a few days in dread. Then I started reading...and once I did, it was hard to stop. And when I *did* have to stop, my mind was figuring out when I could get back to the book. Yes, I finished in a book coma. I had to give my brain time to fully absorb what I had read before I could go any further. I am still mulling over details and thinking on the story - and in my mind, that is the mark of a great book. When it's done, and you're moving on, part of that story has permanently made a place in your mind and your heart. So it is with 'Twelve Kings in Sharakhai'.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FKFB9UQAFHV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0756409721#wasThisHelpful","R1FKFB9UQAFHV4","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband has issues with dry skin, depending on the soap he uses. His favorite has always been Irish Spring, but it really dries his skin out - particularly in colder weather. So when this soap came out, I was curious to see not only if it would help with the dry skin, but if the smell would be too strong, overtly male, or just plain old ick.So far, hubby likes it. He really likes the smell, and I have to say - I do too. I have been using the soap, and it's not a ""manly"" odor, more a fresh one. It's sort of like the smallest hint of baby powder with green grass/leaves. It's not heavy or overwhelming, either.The dry skin issue has been reared its head, either. Granted, it isn't the middle of winter, but the soap hasn't been making things worse, at any rate. I tend to have horrible dry skin issues, and I haven't had problems either.Overall, it's a nice, clean-smelling soap that does what soap should do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDSZF5N32N5WB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SS81M58#wasThisHelpful","RDSZF5N32N5WB","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alexander the Great. He's a figure of power, a lesson from the past. But what was he *before* he was all that? What was his life like as a 16-year-old, before he became ""the Great"" conqueror? This is the question that the 'Blood of Gods and Royals' series hopes to answer. In 'Legacy of Kings', Eleanor Herman makes a good beginning.Speaking of the beginning - it's a bit on the slow side. Have patience and bear with it. There is a lot of history here, and five different people who need their own backgrounds, motivations, and lives. It took me roughly half the book before I really started to get into the story itself. This is to be expected, as this is just the first novel in what promises to be AT LEAST a trilogy.The characters are written as teenagers, but remember - teenagers in Alexander's time would have been far more...mature...at earlier ages than those we are familiar with now. They married young, had children early, and often died young. Frankly, even though this is a Harlequin Teen book, it felt like it could have been young adults as characters. Each character is written well, and all of them pulled the element of surprise at least once during the novel. In other words - they are not written as predictable wooden things, but as young people whose motivations still are developing and whose lives are in constant upheaval. Herman did a great job with this (speaking as someone who has a teen at home).While this is historical, it is also a work of fiction. The history is definitely interwoven throughout, but so is the fantastical - amazing creatures known as myths, Gods who may or may not still exist, and magic that is both feared and revered. Again, Herman did an excellent job weaving together the factual and the fictional.Overall, it's a very well done look (so far) at what might have been when Alexander was young and magic may still have existed. I look forward to recommending it to my friends and to reading the next book when it comes out next fall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QVQSZRQW49CB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373211724#wasThisHelpful","R1QVQSZRQW49CB","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Generally, I'm a rag/towel kind of person. I detest extra waste. However, I am married to a ""use all the paper towels as quickly as possible"" kind of guy. So, I was thinking of these as sort of a happy medium between the two. The fact that these are at least minimally recycled and in waste-free packaging is what sold me on trying them.So far, we've used them for wiping up spills, cleaning stair railings (and with two active kids and boneheads who painted the railing white...), cleaning gymnastic mats and wiping counters. They've done excellently at every task. They are sturdy enough to withstand the heavier wiping (stair railings), don't fall apart with lots of liquid, and give a nice cushion for the extra icky tasks (cleaning cat vomit). The extra bonus is that, maybe due to the heavy-duty feeling, doesn't tend to waste these as much as the paper towels, which means he's using less waste than he otherwise might. It's sort of a win-win all the way around.So, while I still tend to primarily use rags or shop towels to clean messes, these have definitely earned a place in our household for those not quite as environmentally conscious as I am :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19USWFI0DO139/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00375LQKI#wasThisHelpful","R19USWFI0DO139","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are for my teenage son, who generally lives in athletic shorts. I don't (typically) have a problem with that, but sometimes something a little bit nicer is required. This jean shorts fit the bill.He is 14, roughly 5'6"", and weighs I'm not sure how much. He tried these on and they fit extremely well. A small gap in the back, but definitely nothing really noticeable. The length is great, and they are not too tight anywhere. He can move around freely with no issues.I'm not sure we've ever bought him Wrangler pants or shorts before, but I have to say I'm very impressed with the way these fit.

"My husband tends to be like the Otterbox cases for his phones, and they have been great. However, when I saw this option, I thought it would be worth a try, since his job often has him in unpredictable weather and situations. He's had it on his phone for almost two weeks now, and I have also been using one on my phone. We recently compared notes and decided we both agreed on the high and low points of these FRE cases.First the good - we tested the waterproofing, and I can say without a doubt that I would trust my phone in this with no hesitations. Whether on a boat, or simply hiking through wet woods and streams, this case will keep your phone dry. It's also fairly sturdy and seems to do well against the standard knocks and drops. The touchscreen works fine, even through the top part of the case, though there is often a slight lag.Now the downsides - the sound is not the greatest. The volume level on the phone has had to go permanently higher in order to hear clearly. Since my husband works on trains, that's a permanent bummer...the noise level is already pretty high. In addition, if you like to use your phone for music or watching tv/videos, the sound quality is somewhat affected. It's not terrible, but it's not as high-quality as what you get with standard cases or just the phone, either.So. Those are the pros and cons as we have discovered them over several days of use. For some, the cons may not be such, and this case will be a fantastic purchase. However, at this point, whether we will continue to use the cases is up in the air. I don't like the slight lag, and the husband really struggles with the restriction in sound when he's working.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P3QH4NAMXNYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOLC6DK#wasThisHelpful","R1P3QH4NAMXNYO","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cookbooks are my weakness. I mean, books in general are my weakness, but I read cookbooks like novels. Niche cookbooks I don't often get, simply because I don't always have use for them. However, cookies - well, that's different. Who doesn't have a need for cookies at multiple points in their lives? So when this popped up, I was excited to get it.As a general rule, I insist on make a minimum of three recipes from any cookbook before I review it. I don't personally feel that any cookbook review can be truly relevant unless recipes have actually been tried. However, since this cookbook is ONLY about cookies, and there are only so many cookies I need floating around my house at any given time, I tried two recipes instead of three.The first recipe I tried was a twist on the basic Oatmeal Cookie recipe. Instead of using raisins in the recipe, I added (per instructions) cinnamon chips instead. The method was a little bit different than my general cookies, but turned out very good. They were soft and not overly sweet. Both kids gave them a two-thumbs up, though they did wish I had added chocolate chips instead :)The second recipe I tried was a twist on the Chewy Double Chocolate Cookies - the Chewy White Chocolate Chunk cookies. Again, the methodology was quite different from any cookies I've made before, but they turned out incredible. Very chocolatey and soft, a hit all the way around.One of the things I particularly liked about this cookbook is the fact that each recipe has multiple twists to it, allowing for a variety of flavors with one basic recipe. The recipes themselves are well-written, and the instructions are clear enough for even a novice baker to follow. And the pictures, well...they are mouth-watering.Overall, this is a handy cookbook to have around for anyone who appreciates good cookies. Bake sales, holidays, or just to have a batch in the cookie jar - this cookbook will cover all the bases!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RRB62GE3OVDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632170175#wasThisHelpful","R1RRB62GE3OVDU","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is designed to be given in addition to your dog's regular food - 1/2 pouch for every 25 pounds, I believe. As my dog weighs just about 50 pounds, we gave the entire pouch. He loved it - licked it all off the top of the food before deciding to finish his kibble. It does, however, somewhat resemble cat vomit in looks and texture.I can't speak to the probiotic nature of this, as I was only given one pouch to test and that is not enough to determine anything at length. But based on my dog's reaction, if your four-legged friend likes to have soft food along with their kibble, then this would probably be a good one to try.

Aircraft carrier, holding the entire country of Monrovia...you get the picture.The tray is well-made and heavy-duty. It has a really nice feel to it, and the color is gorgeous.

There isn't a huge well in the center, so very liquidy foods would probably not be your best option.Overall, it really is a lovely tray.

"People dead and missing at an old school that takes in students from the local asylum. One person in particular a ""person of interest"". One person who may - or may not be - two people residing in one body. Not two personalities, but two actual souls, living in the same body since birth. Is it possible? Or is she crazy and imagining the second one? And what happened two decades ago that left the school a shell and lives forever changed?'The Dead House' is not written as a standard novel. It's written almost as a case-folder, with interviews, diaries, transcriptions, etc. used to tell the story. There are some pictures, but unlike some of the ""mixed media"" novels, these do not hold a prominent place. It's mostly reading. The only downside to this particular format in this book is that every new thing has a date and time - and sometimes, there are multiple entries in one day. Trying to keep that straight could be a bit of a handful at times.I found the story intriguing, the idea of ""is she or isn't she"" crazy, on a topic that most would say was full-on nuts. The element of mystery was there all the way through to the end (no spoilers!), and kept me guessing. While I wish there had been more of a solid ending, I will say that it did fit the rest of the book.Overall, while this is definitely a young adult book, I did enjoy it and would recommend it to a teen that I thought might enjoy it as well. There is some violence, a little bit of it fairly graphic, so be aware of that. It also deals with something akin to witchcraft, so if that's a concern then this book may not be for you.

"Ghostman. The term conjures up something that isn't really there - doesn't exist as we would think of it. And in the second book featuring Jack - the Ghostman - Roger Hobbs proves just how elusive a Ghostman can truly be. This time, Jack has been contacted for help by his former mentor, the one who taught him just about everything he knows. The one who disappeared several years ago without a trace. She's in a tight spot, and only Jack can help her get out of it.While 'Ghostman' was a novel that I quite enjoyed, I wasn't able to fully immerse myself in 'Vanishing Games'. The writing seemed strange in spots. The biggest issue that I had was that Jack, the expert, suddenly didn't seem to know much about several of the weapons used in the book. This is a man whose life depends on having more knowledge than others and translating that knowledge into a capacity for problem-solving and disappearing. So it was jarring to keep reading how he wasn't familiar with something. There also seemed to be more violence in this book. Not that I have a problem with violence in a novel if it fits the story line, but it seemed to me that Jack used more brains in the first novel, and significantly less in this one. Definitely made for a less interesting story.Obviously, I liked the first Ghostman novel enough to seek out the sequel. I'm not sure I can say the same for this one. If there is a third, and I'm guessing there will be, it will probably be a toss-up as to whether I bother reading it.

"I love to feed my hummingbirds. I have a few that come by, where their presence is announced by the cat. I have two feeders up outside, one closer to the house and one out a little bit. The birds tend to prefer the feeder further away, so that feeder always empties first. So when I decided to give this instant food a shot, I did a test. I put my regular sugar mix in the feeder closest to the house and the instant mix in the feeder further away. My thought process being that since the birds gravitate towards the one further away, that might give the instant nectar a better chance. Unfortunately, that is not what happened.At the end of the second day, the feeder closest to the house was completely empty. The feeder further away from the house was still 3/4 full. I observed, several times, the hummingbirds fly up to the feeder, hang around a minute, then move to the other one to eat. I don't know why, but this food just is not their preferred food of choice. Having said that - hummingbirds are definitely birds of habit, so it's possible that over time they might decide that the instant nectar is ok. However, I'm really not sure. And since it doesn't take long to throw some sugar and water in the microwave to make their food, and it's far cheaper than the instant nectar, I think I will just stick with my regular method.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXKQWCMP2O6G3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RM70DDI#wasThisHelpful","RXKQWCMP2O6G3","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What if angels weren't exactly what we thought they were? They still answer to a higher power, but...it's not exactly a gracious and loving thing. Even worse? Those angels are in league with the demons - and they were spawned the same way.This is what Robert Brockway has brought to life in 'The Unnoticeables'. A world where it is possible to see angels and demons, and even to become a ""chosen one""...at the expense of your humanity and that of many others.The book moves between an unknown narrator, Carey (living in New York in 1977) and Kaitlyn (living in Hollywood in 2013-14), and illuminates how their lives intertwine in unexpected ways.The story itself is odd, creepy, sometime scary, and absolutely fascinating. There are definite parallels that can be made between the angels/demons in the book and some religions, though I'm not sure if that is what the author was going for here. Outside of that, however - it's just a really good story. The pace moves quickly and the stranger elements are woven into the novel in such a way that I never found myself questioning them. It is fairly graphic in spots - death and sex are not strangers in this book. I hate spoilers, so I won't give any, but I will say if reading that statement gives you pause, then this *might* not be the book for you.I believe it was Chuck Wendig that said this book is ""Deliriously unhinged in the best way possible..."", and I would have to agree with that statement. I didn't find the book ""hilarious"" as noted by someone one, so I wouldn't necessarily be looking for laugh-out-loud funny. But it had amusing spots, always tempered by a bizarre sober (and sometimes less-than) reality.Overall, I wouldn't say it was an absolute favorite, but I'm glad I read it. It's certainly spawned from a mind and an imagination that has to have been called ""overactive"" many, many times.

"I have been wanting a *good* smoker for quite a while, but can't afford the usual suspects. So when the opportunity to try this one came up, I jumped at the chance. And I cannot emphasize enough how glad I am!First impressions - the thing is flipping heavy. This is not something you'll be moving around a lot, so make sure you put it in a place that really makes sense. We have ours in a nook on the covered back patio, so that it's protected from weather. If/when it starts to get cold enough to freeze outside, it will go in the garage. It also feels heavy duty. I was a little concerned that it might feel flimsy, but that is not the case at all. The door/latch feels very solid, the shelves are a good weight, and the smoker box is heavy-duty. There is virtually no set-up (other than unpacking and putting batteries in the remote), though a new user does need to do a burn-off of the inside of the smoker. Very simple to do, needs no water or chips. Plug it in, set it up and go!Our first attempt at smoking was a whole chicken. We used one of the recipes that came with it, and used the temperature probe method. Having tried those flimsy box smokers before with horrible results, I was a little bit leery of what would happen here. However, I can honestly say that the chicken turned into one of the best meals ever. We used apple chips, and it turned out smoky, juicy, and golden.Next - a small pork roast. Used our own rub this time, and again used the temperature probe. Delicious and not dry at all. It's easy to set for the temp. and the probe, and it alternates between the two on the display so you can get an idea of where things stand. You should preheat it (has a cycle for that) and it works well. I did, however, learn the hard way not to lean to close to the smoker when it first gets opened up...eyes full of smoke.

"Everyone has magic, some but...well, their magic is ""wonky"". It doesn't do what it's supposed to do when it's supposed to do it. So instead of getting into a premier magic academy, Nory (whose father is Headmaster at one such academy) is shuffled off to her Aunt's to attend a school with a new Upside-Down Magic class. Question being - is doing it ""right"" really what is important?This book was originally intended for my 8 1/2-year-old daughter. She got into the first chapter, then...set it aside and didn't return to it. I read it (as one must to do a proper review), and could see why she might not be all that enthused for a girl who is working on reading Nancy Drew. The writing is just ok - nothing that truly drew me into the story (and I love to read excellent writing, no matter the age range). The story had a few things that annoyed me..for example, the authors took great pains to describe the students as ""light-skinned"", ""brown, probably Latino"", and ""Asian-American"", among others. Don't get me wrong - I think diversity in anything is excellent. However, particularly for kids, it should be natural instead of being so emphasized and spelled out. Show the reader, don't tell them. Another thing is that, honestly, the story probably could have been cut a bit and still retained its overall message. Reading how one student turned into a rock over and over again was...repetitive. Kids will feel the same way, as a general rule. Make the point, then move on. They are a smarter audience than many authors give them credit for.As for the message - it's a good one, but again, the book is not subtle about it. And the ending (no spoilers) seemed a little unrealistic to me. Or maybe just naive?Overall, for a beginning reader, it might just do the trick. But it would definitely be a book that I would recommend checking out from the library instead of purchasing unless it becomes a great favorite.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U5I88ZNOM9UU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545800455#wasThisHelpful","R2U5I88ZNOM9UU","ARSQ2F9U315WG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARSQ2F9U315WG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fast-paced with a wonderful cast of characters, The Marriage Pact by M.J. Pullen is an engaging novel about friendship and love.Marci Thompson has made a career of temp work, but her latest job has lasted much longer than her previous gigs. The other big difference on this job is her six month relationship with her married boss, Doug Stanton. Their romance is exciting and passionate but being â€œthe other womanâ€ is beginning to wear thin. However, Marci continues to remain hopeful Doug will finally leave his wife and fully commit to her. When her thirtieth birthday rolls around, her college friend Jake Stillwell reminds her of the pact they signed ten years earlier that if neither was married by their thirtieth birthday, they would marry each other. Marci has always loved Jake, but she is also heavily invested in her illicit romance with Doug which makes it very difficult for her to know which man she should choose.Despite being a bit self-absorbed, Marci is a likable and mostly sympathetic character. She is ashamed of her affair and despite knowing she should end their relationship, she lacks the willpower to make a clean break from him. She has a long history of avoiding conflict and her knee-jerk reaction when things go wrong is to run away. A snap decision brings positive changes for her life, but it is not until she is on the verge of losing what she holds most dear that Marci reflects on what she truly wants.The supporting cast of characters is well-developed and for the most part, likable. Suzanne is Marciâ€™s best friend and she provides her with unconditional support. Jake is very sweet and just like Suzanne, he is willing to drop everything to help Marci when she needs assistance. Rebecca is the least appealing of the friends since she is more concerned with pursuing her own agenda than supporting Marci when everything begins to fall apart.The Marriage Pact by M.J. Pullen is a charming novel with a realistic storyline. The characters are multi-faceted with true to life flaws and imperfections. An entertaining read that will leave readers eagerly anticipating the next installment in The Marriage Pact series.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B70O8JUHNHMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W1E166U#wasThisHelpful","R1B70O8JUHNHMG","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All Dressed in White is the latest addition to Mary Higgins Clark & Alafair Burkeâ€™s Under Suspicion mystery series. In this outing, the cast and crew of the cold case TV show are profiling the unsolved disappearance of a bride who vanished five years earlier.Television producer Laurie Moran is about to pitch her latest ideas for the next episode in her popular television show when Sandra Pierce drops by her office in hopes of convincing Laurie to feature her missing daughterâ€™s case. Dubbed the Runaway Bride, Amanda Pierce vanished without a trace the day before her destination wedding and no one has seen or heard from her again. Despite a thorough investigation, the police could not say with any certainty that foul play was involved in her disappearance, but Sandra remains convinced Amandaâ€™s fiancÃ© Jeff Hunter murdered her for financial gain. Once all of the members of the wedding party and Amandaâ€™s family agree to participate in the show, Laurie, along with her cast and crew, head to Palm Beach to reenact the events leading up to Amandaâ€™s disappearance in hopes of solving the case.Laurie is no stranger to losing a loved one to murder and she understands better than anyone Sandraâ€™s need for answers about her daughterâ€™s disappearance. Laurieâ€™s preliminary research supports the theory that Amanda did not leave under her own volition but with a plethora of suspects, which includes not only Jeff, but his current wife (and Amandaâ€™s best friend) Meghan White, and Amandaâ€™s sister Charlotte, Laurie still has a lot of work ahead of her. New clues emerge after reviewing the security footage from the hotel, but there is still very little evidence as to the perpetratorâ€™s identity. During the course of the investigation, it also becomes apparent there are several members of the wedding party who are harboring secrets they are reluctant to have revealed.The pool of suspects is vast and the information that Laurie uncovers does not help narrow down her list or their possible reason for murdering Amanda. Jeff is a natural suspect since he stood to gain a vast fortune in the event of Amandaâ€™s death. His rather quick marriage to Meghan also paints him in an unflattering light but does that also make him a killer? Meghan also falls under suspicion considering her marriage to Jeff but Laurie also discovers the two women were quarreling in the days leading up to Amandaâ€™s disappearance. Close friend Kate Fulton is afraid a secret she is keeping will be exposed but does this have any bearing on what happened to Amanda?  Jeffâ€™s groomsmen are obnoxious and seemingly harmless but their actions are also closely scrutinized throughout the investigation. A surprise suspect emerges after the wedding photographer remembers his assistant was not initially questioned after Amandaâ€™s disappearance. News about the murder of a student from the same campus where several of the key players attended college piques Laurieâ€™s interest but is there any connection between that long ago homicide and Amandaâ€™s case?Intricately plotted with a fantastic cast of characters, All Dressed in White is a cleverly written whodunit. This engaging and fast-paced mystery will stymie readers as Laurie and her team investigate their latest cold case in hopes of discovering the truth about what happened to missing bride Amanda Pierce. Another excellent collaboration from Mary Higgins Clark & Alafair Burke that old and new fans of the Under Suspicion series are sure to love.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CE3CW7436QTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI30E#wasThisHelpful","R1CE3CW7436QTS","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Consent by Nancy Ohlin is an incredibly thought-provoking young adult novel about an affair between a high school student and her teacher. Well-written and impossible to put down, readers will be thinking about this story long after the last page has been turned.Beatrice â€œBeaâ€ Kimâ€™s life is full of secrets but she has trouble keeping her crush (and subsequent relationship) with her music teacher, Dane Rossi, under wraps. Bea cannot help but notice how sexy and good looking her substitute teacher is but their interactions are at first innocent and focus on her extraordinary talent for playing the piano. His praise and interest are just the inspiration she needs to consider pursuing a future as a concert pianist and their shared passion for music easily bridges the age gap between them. The attraction between Bea and Dane simmers in the background until the two take a trip to New York so Bea can audition for a professor at Julliard. Careful to keep their distance from one another upon their return, a careless moment of passion sparks an investigation into their affair.In spite of her less than happy home life, Bea manages to excel at both her school work and playing the piano. Beaâ€™s relationships with her father and brother are distant and the reasons for the rift between the family members remain unclear for a good part of the story. Although she is essentially a piano prodigy, she has ever received any type of formal training nor much encouragement to nurture her natural abilities.  The one bright spot in her life is her friendship with Plum but despite their close relationship, Bea is less than forthcoming about many details of her life.The various story arcs are interesting and the characters are relatively well-developed. The music aspect of the storyline is possibly a little too detailed for a layperson but music enthusiasts will certainly enjoy the close attention to detail. Bea and Plum are vibrantly developed characters that are three-dimensional and quite likable. Beaâ€™s brother and father are not as fully fleshed out and for the most part, they remain on the periphery of the overall story.  Dane remains enigmatic despite his rather prominent role in the storyline and some of the questions raised about him are never clearly answered. Nonetheless, he is a larger than life character whose obvious charisma and charm make it very easy to understand why Bea is so attracted to him.The questions swirling around Bea and Daneâ€™s relationship and the age of consent are extremely insightful and thought-provoking. Viewing the romance through Beaâ€™s eyes, it is easy to understand what she is thinking and feeling from their very first meeting until the novelâ€™s end. Her perspective during the investigation is intriguing and it is not until she learns unexpected information about Dane that Bea sees their relationship more clearly and with this newfound knowledge, she makes a rather surprising decision about their future. While most of the storyline is resolved, a few lingering questions remain about certain individuals and their actions.Consent by Nancy Ohlin is an adeptly written novel about uncomfortable subject matter that is guaranteed to generate interesting discussions between parents and their teens. An outstanding portrayal of a sensitive topic that I highly recommend to readers of all ages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHMEEHA91CVMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442464909#wasThisHelpful","RHMEEHA91CVMB","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Stages by Thom Satterlee is an intriguing mystery starring a very unusual but likable protagonist.For the past eighteen years, American Daniel Peters has been living and working in Copenhagen as translator of philosopher Søren Kierkegaardâ€™s works. Socially awkward with a penchant for routine, Daniel was unaware that these traits are, in fact, symptoms of Aspergerâ€™s syndrome until rather late in life. His close friend and boss Mette Rasmussen was instrumental in helping him understand his condition and while he still has difficulty reading social cues, he is making an effort to interact more regularly with his co-workers. Mette was very protective of him and in the aftermath of her death, Daniel is trying to put his well-ordered life back on track when he learns he is the lead suspect in her murder. In an effort to clear his name and recover a recently discovered but now missing Kierkegaard manuscript, Daniel steps out of his comfort zone and investigates the clues that he hopes will lead him to her killer.Daniel is highly intelligent but he is definitely at a disadvantage in social or work environments. He is never quite sure whether people are making fun of him and he is often at a loss when trying to read facial expressions or grasp subtle nuances during conversations. He also struggles to understand what emotions he is experiencing and although he misses Mette, he does not feel grief at her death. He is very reflective of their shared history and there is no mistaking his long held affection for his former girlfriend, but grief is just not in his emotional vocabulary. Instead, Daniel tries to make sense of his new life without her but without Metteâ€™s protection, his trusting nature makes him a target of unscrupulous people who try to take advantage of him both at home and work.Danielâ€™s innocence is refreshing yet also heartbreaking. The police have questions about his last encounter with Mette and he is genuinely perplexed when his explanations do not clear him as a suspect. Once he realizes this, he fully co-operates with their requests while at the same time investigating her death on his own. He makes a few puzzling discoveries that he tracks down but his Aspergerâ€™s makes it difficult for him to put what he uncovers into any type of understandable context until a shocking revelation helps Daniel put all of the pieces of the puzzle together.Although a bit of a slow starter, The Stages is a captivating read with an engaging cast of characters. Daniel is an interesting protagonist and viewing the world through his perspective is quite fascinating. The mystery aspect of the storyline is well-written and Thom Satterlee does a superb job of concealing the perpetratorâ€™s identity and the motive for the crime right until the novelâ€™s stunning conclusion. Overall, a clever yet baffling mystery with a unique premise, unexpected plot twists and an atypical lead character that I highly recommend to fans of the genre.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33N1IIVFPD9WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQA6JJ0#wasThisHelpful","R33N1IIVFPD9WF","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Having just made partner in the local fertility clinic, she works with a slick doctor who keeps her busy cleaning up his messes but his latest misstep might be well beyond any type of damage control. At the same, she is stunned and dismayed to discover that Mitchellâ€™s new teacher is none other than her sonâ€™s unnamed father Kevin Holts and his teaching style is unconventional at best and downright destructive at worst.

At the same time, she is also scrambling to stop the good doctor from ruining their business with his after hours shenanigans.The Burned Bridges of Ward, Nebraska by Eileen Curtright is a laugh out loud funny novel with a cast of well developed, eclectic characters. Although occasionally a little over the top, the storyline touches on a number of topical issues such as the alarming trend of overmedicating students and standardized testing in schools.  Zany and irreverent with a satirical edge, Eileen Curtright is nonetheless spot on with her depiction of some of the problems in todayâ€™s world and the downsides to small town living.

Set in the small town of Lily Dale, Bella Jordan becomes a reluctant innkeeper while waiting on car repairs. Surrounded by physics and mediums, Bella becomes embroiled in the mystery surrounding Leona Gattoâ€™s recent death.  Was the guesthouse ownerâ€™s death an unfortunate accident? Or was it something far more sinister?Still grieving her beloved husbandâ€™s loss, Bella and her five old son Max are in the midst of moving halfway across the country when she takes a unexpected detour to Lily Dale to return Chance the cat to her rightful owner. Dismayed to learn of Leonaâ€™s death from her neighbor and good friend, Odelia Lauder, Bella accepts Odeliaâ€™s offer to stay at the guesthouse until her car repairs are completed. Despite entreaties from the other residents, she is planning to leave as soon as possible, but she is troubled an ominous dream about Leona. With a little help from Odelia and ex-cop turned private investigator, Luther Ragland, Bella decides it would not hurt for her do a little unobtrusive sleuthing but will she uncover the truth before it is too late?Bella is a likable and sympathetic protagonist. Her husbandâ€™s death turned her life upside down and the loss of her job means she and Max must leave behind the only home they have ever known to move in with her less than welcoming mother-in-law. Although somewhat charmed by Lily Dale, Bella is hesitant to remain in town and she is very wary (and slightly skeptical) of its residentsâ€™ psychic abilities. Her inability to commit to staying in town beyond a few days becomes a bit tiresome as the book moves forward, but given the upheaval in her life, her doubts are understandable. While not a typical amateur detective, her natural curiosity leads her to look around the guest house for clues into Leonaâ€™s death. Reluctant to share what she discovers because of her fear of becoming a suspect, Bella zeroes in a couple of possible suspects and inadvertently puts herself in harmâ€™s way when she rushes headlong into a dangerous situation.Lily Dale is a wonderful setting and the townspeople are quirky yet interesting. The supernatural element is unobtrusive yet intriguing but it is left up to the reader to decide whether or not some of the things that occur are just coincidence or the result of otherworldly intervention. It is worth mentioning that Bella solves the mystery surrounding Leonaâ€™s death through good old fashioned detective work and some pretty accurate speculation, not psychic or ghostly involvement.Nine Lives by Wendy Corsi Staub is a fantastic beginning to this new series set the charming town of Lily Dale. The characters are a bit eclectic but this adds to their overall appeal. The storyline is well-developed and several red herrings and clever misdirects make it impossible to guess the perpetratorâ€™s identity or motive for the murder for much of the story.

She is instantly attracted to hot band member and songwriter Syon Braden, but she has a strict no rock star rule. However, when presented with the opportunity to go on tour with the group, she cannot deny the publicity would do wonders for her business. Trying to keep her distance from Syon is virtually impossible, but will their relationship last once the tour ends?Insta-lust flares between Kate and Syon right from their very first meeting which pretty much sets the tone for their passion fueled relationship. Syon is possessive, demanding and persistent while Kate wavers back and forth between sticking to her rules and giving in to her desire for him. Syon is intense and dedicated to his career but he can be overbearing when it comes to getting what he wants. His business sense is something Kate respects since she is equally serious about her own career. However, her previous relationship leaves her reluctant to become involved with another rock star but her attraction to Syon proves too powerful to resist. Not all the members of Toxsin are happy with their burgeoning romance and it soon becomes obvious someone is willing to go any lengths to sabotage Kateâ€™s business association with the group.While Rock Me Two Times has an interesting storyline, it unfortunately gets lost amongst the numerous sex scenes between Kate and Syon. The sex scenes are incendiary but the encounters eventually become repetitive. Regrettably, character development also suffers a bit as well and it is difficult to feel much of a connection to the main protagonists or the secondary characters.Rock Me Two Times by Dawn Ryder is fast paced with plenty of smoking hot sex scenes.

"How to Be Brave by E. Katherine Kottaras is an engaging and realistic young adult novel about friendship, grief and moving on after a terrible loss.High school senior Georgia Askeridis begins her senior year of high school still deeply mourning the loss of her mother from complications of diabetes and obesity. Her father has left her to deal with her grief on her own as he works long hours in the familyâ€™s restaurant. The school year is off to a rocky beginning as the schoolâ€™s â€œmean girlsâ€ target her but her close friend Liss comes to her rescue with some well aimed barbs at the popular teens. Taking her motherâ€™s last words and letter to heart, the two young ladies devise a list of things to accomplish that will hopefully help Georgia live life to the fullest. Aiding them on their journey is new student, Evelyn, and the three quickly begin checking items off the list. However, after a terrible mistake ruins her friendship with Liss, Georgia cannot help but wonder whether the list is truly helping her cope with her loss.Georgia is a bit directionless without her mom but she has no choice to deal with the cards life has handed her. Her efforts to be positive in the face of her loss are quite heartening although this is a goal she struggles to meet. Her list is a mix of fun and easy to accomplish items but most of what she hopes to accomplish is well out of her comfort zone. Despite how uneasy some of her tasks make her feel, Georgia (with some not so gentle nudging from Liss) gamely sets about fulfilling her goals. After things go too far one night, her friendship with Liss is threatened and she begins avoiding Evelyn. Giving up on her list, she concentrates on what is probably the most important item she originally set out to accomplish and Georgia throws herself into a huge art assignment which yields very surprising results.Written in first person from Georgiaâ€™s perspective, How to Be Brave touches on relevant issues facing teens today such as bullying, experimenting with drugs and struggling with self image. E. Katherine Kottarasâ€™s depictions of Georgiaâ€™s actions and thought processes ring true as do her overprotective fatherâ€™s reaction when he discovers what she has been doing with her friends. The growth of the characters is absolutely phenomenal and watching Georgia find the courage to stand up for herself is immensely gratifying.

"The Sister Pact by Stacie Ramey is an emotional young adult novel that tackles some very difficult subjects such as teen suicide, grief, depression and drug use. It is a realistic and very compelling story that is thought-provoking and ultimately, healing. Due to some of its content, I recommend the novel to older teen (and adult) readers.In the aftermath of her sister Leahâ€™s suicide, Allie Blackmore is grief stricken and haunted by her sisterâ€™s death. They were incredibly close and as teenagers, they devised a suicide pact. Struggling to understand why her sister ignored their pact and killed herself, Allie begins a downward spiral of using cold medicine and eventually illicitly obtained prescription drugs in an effort to numb her pain. Although she is seeing a psychiatrist, she refuses to open up to her doctor and against medical advice, she stops taking her prescription for anti-depressants. Desperately trying to pick up the pieces of her life, Allieâ€™s efforts are hampered by her inability to paint, a toxic relationship with her longtime crush and ghostly appearances by Leah.Allie is a likable yet incredibly exasperating character. Instead of being honest about how much she is struggling, she keeps insisting everything is â€œfineâ€. Her relationship with her parents is fraught with tension even before Leahâ€™s death and now they are wrapped up in their own grief, Allie is essentially left to deal with her problems on her own. With all of her fatherâ€™s high expectations weighing on her, Allie resents his autocratic orders and dismissive attitude toward her and her mother. Her mom is of absolutely no help since she relies heavily on Xanax to get her through the day and continues to allow her soon to be ex-husband to steamroll over her. It is little wonder Allie chooses unhealthy ways to help cope with her crushing grief and her pain positively radiates off the pages of the novel.As she tries to understand Leahâ€™s decision, Allie keeps going over the events of their last day together. Her memories of their final evening together at a party are hazy but bits and pieces begin to come back to her. Did something out of the ordinary happen to Leah at the party? Do the answers lie in the sistersâ€™ dysfunctional home life? The further Allie digs into Leahâ€™s life, she is stunned to learn that her sister was keeping many secrets and despite the information she uncovers, she may never discover the reason for Leahâ€™s inexplicable decision.The Sister Pact by Stacie Ramey is a riveting young adult novel that is gritty and unflinchingly honest.  What initially drives the story is learning the truth about Allieâ€™s family, the reasons for the suicide pact and why Leah committed suicide. However, by the novelâ€™s conclusion, it is Allieâ€™s journey of self-discovery that holds the readerâ€™s attention. All in all, it is a very moving novel that I recommend to adults and older teens.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP3OU98FVJ99L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108GOL00#wasThisHelpful","RP3OU98FVJ99L","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in the 1950â€™s, White Collar Girl by Renee Rosen is a riveting novel about a female journalistâ€™s attempt to break into the historically male dominated field. Fighting to be taken seriously during a time when female reporters were relegated to writing â€œfluffâ€ pieces, Jordan Walsh never loses sight of her goal although she sometimes questions her motivation for trying so hard to make a success of her chosen career.Jordan comes from a long line of reporters and after her brother Eliotâ€™s death two years earlier, she is determined to make him and their parents proud. Excited by the job offer at the Chicago Tribune, she is brought back to earth in a hurry when she discovers she will be writing society pieces and articles about womenâ€™s issues. With one eye on achieving her goal of writing hard hitting news stories, Jordan never hesitates to take risks and investigate the leads that come her way but convincing her editor to take her seriously takes grit, patience and perseverance.Jordan is definitely a woman ahead of her time and her drive to succeed eclipses nearly everything in her life. She is frustrated by her colleagueâ€™s attitudes toward her and the other women she works with but she never lets them deter her from her goals. She is smart, savvy and inquisitive and although she sometimes rushes into situations without thinking things through, her instinct about newsworthy material is sound. Although her career is her top priority, Jordan does have a serious relationship with a fellow news reporter but her success threatens to derail their romance.Unlike some of her friends and co-workers, marriage and family is oftentimes the last thing on Jordanâ€™s mind. Although she becomes engaged, planning her upcoming wedding is low on her list of priorities. She is also ill-prepared for her very traditional fiancÃ©â€™s and his familyâ€™s expectations about her role after the wedding. Jordan often minimizes her success at the Tribune in order to protect her fiancÃ©â€™s ego and his frustration about her higher profile assignments and news scoops leads to discontent for both of them.White Collar Girl is a mesmerizing novel that is quite fascinating and based on many historically accurate scandals and newsworthy events of the late 50s and early 60s. The characters are multi-faceted and brilliantly developed with realistic flaws and imperfections. Renee Rosenâ€™s meticulous attention to detail, the captivating plot and an interesting main protagonist bring the story and the time period vibrantly to live.

"In Until We Meet Again, Renee Collins combines time travel and an intriguing mystery with a sweet romance and the resulting story is unique and engaging.Cassandra is less than thrilled to be spending her summer vacation with her family in Massachusetts instead of Paris with her best friend. But all of that changes once she meets a mysterious stranger on the beach one moonlit night. Lawrence Foster is handsome, charming and by some strange twist of fate, he has time traveled from 1925 to the present. They are both living in the same house during the two different time periods and the only place they can be together is on the isolated stretch of the beach where they first met. Curious about the history of the house, Cassandra learns distressing information about Lawrence and in an effort to prevent the unthinkable, she and Lawrence are determined to uncover the truth about the events that took place 90 years earlier.In the beginning, Cassandra is a little self-absorbed but once she meets Lawrence, she puts all of her energy into researching those long ago events. She is creative and resourceful and although she is afraid that their actions in the present could have change history, once she knows the truth about what happened to Lawrence, nothing is going to stop her investigation. Cassandra genuinely cares for Lawrence and as her concern for him deepens, she grows and matures into a very likable character.Delightfully debonair, Lawrence is definitely hero material. Having lost his mother the previous year, he is spending the summer with his uncle before heading off to college. Although he has no interest in following in his fatherâ€™s footsteps, he is willing to do what is expected of him. However, his obedience begins to waver once he learns what his uncle has planned for him. The more information he and Cassandra uncover, the more afraid he becomes of the people his uncle is involved with. Not wanting to endanger himself or his uncle, Lawrence remains reluctant to defy him, but will that change once he learns the truth about what is going on?The mystery aspect of the storyline is quite fascinating. Cassandraâ€™s research is often tedious and yields little results, but she perseveres in spite of her lack of progress. The investigation is also very interesting since the time travel element allows both Cassandra and Lawrence to track down information during the different time periods. Lawrence is able to fully explore the clues that she unearths while Cassandra can then use the internet and local library to research the information he uncovers.The time travel portion of Until We Meet Again is equally well written and rather unique.  The fact that they are basically living parallel lives in the same place yet different time periods provides added interest to the overall plot. The novel alternates between Cassandra and Lawrenceâ€™s perspectives which gives readers the opportunity to experience life in both 1925 and the present.Until We Meet Again is a captivating young adult novel that is the perfect blend of mystery and romance. The storyline is distinctive and well-researched with the Roaring Twenties springing vibrantly to life. The characters are multi-dimensional with distinct voices that remain true to their respective time periods. Renee Collins brings the novel to a suspense-laden conclusion that is poignant yet realistic.

"The Splendor of Ordinary Days is another captivating addition to Jeff Highâ€™s Watervalley series starring Dr. Luke Bradford. With a cast of delightfully quirky but caring characters, this charming story is incredibly heartwarming with a poignant storyline that will tug at the readerâ€™s heartstrings.Although he still yearns for the anonymity of a large town and a career in medical research, Luke is pretty firmly entrenched in Watervalley. His medical practice is thriving, he has forged close friendships with many of the townspeople and he is deeply in love with elementary school teacher Christine Chambers. The only things Luke is still struggling to make peace with are the small town gossip and the residentsâ€™ well-meaning but intrusive prying into his personal life. Keeping secrets in the small rural town is difficult but not impossible and when local veteran Clayton Ross has a run in with Mennonite Levi Beiler, tension and resentment from unhealed wounds from the past spill into the present.Luke never intended to become so involved in his patients lives but living in a small town makes it impossible for him to hold them at armsâ€™ length. He is also quite caring and compassionate and he makes a practice of treating the whole person, not just their symptoms. Luke makes a concerted effort to look beneath the surface and when he is most frustrated by someoneâ€™s actions, he takes the time to ask questions about that personâ€™s life, including both their past and present.In this outing, Luke finds himself wondering about newspaper owner Luther Whitmoreâ€™s surprisingly biased reporting of a fire involving the local Mennonite community. While Luther is rather unpleasant, unfriendly and cantankerous, his reporting of the local news has always been impartial and fair so Luke is determined to understand what prompted the antagonist news article. The answers lie in Lutherâ€™s childhood friendship with the Yoder family and the series of events that occurred right before he shipped out to Vietnam. Luke has an uncanny ability to smooth over difficult situations but can he work his magic on the irascible Vietnam veteran?In between treating patients and trying to get to the bottom of the situation with Luther, Lukeâ€™s relationship with Christine is about to enter a new phase. Having finally confessed his feeling to her, their romance has deepened but will an unexpected crisis jeopardize their plans for the future?Written in first person from Lukeâ€™s point of view, The Splendor of Ordinary Days is an incredibly well-written novel with an engaging storyline.

Longtime family friend Daffyd Llewellyn is anxious and fighting not to sink into another depression. Grandmother Constance is embittered and her relationships with all of inhabitants reflect her dour, strict nature. Parents Eleanor and Anthony are deeply in love and they are shattered by Theoâ€™s kidnapping. In the wake of Theoâ€™s unsolved disappearance, the entire family departs from the estate with no one returning for the next seventy years.In 2003, Sadieâ€™s own personal history plays a role in her belief that Maggie Bailey did not abandon her young daughter, but with little evidence to support her theory, Sadie goes a little too far once the case is officially closed.

These shifts in perspective and time periods are clearly marked but the story gets a little bogged down in superfluous details. The characters are well-developed with distinct voices and the Edevane family dynamics are quite fascinating. The revelation of long held family secrets effectively keeps readers guessing the truth about Theoâ€™s fate and Kate Morton throws in a whopper of plot twist that is as delightful as it is unexpected.Atmospheric with plenty of family secrets, The Lake House is an intriguing mystery that I recommend to readers of police procedurals.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11J87ZY3NBNMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1S3PY#wasThisHelpful","R11J87ZY3NBNMK","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With the addition of a suspense element to the plot, See Me is a bit of a departure from Nicholas Sparksâ€™ usual novels. With a riveting storyline, wonderfully developed, complex characters and a sweet love story, this latest release is sure to be a hit with readers who enjoy romantic suspense.Maria Sanchez is the daughter of hardworking Mexican immigrants and she is close to them and her younger sister Serena. She has a strong work ethic and she is very dedicated to her career as an attorney. After working out of town for a few years, she returned to her hometown after becoming disillusioned in her previous job and while she still learning the ropes at her new firm, she puts in long hours preparing cases. Mariaâ€™s one serious relationship ended in heartbreak and she has not really dated anyone since the breakup. When a chance encounter leads to a little matchmaking by Serena, will Maria put aside her somewhat negative first impression and open herself to the possibility of a relationship with someone who is her complete opposite?Colin Hancock has a rough background but he has finally taken the opportunity to turn his life around. In and out of trouble for most of his life, he fully accepts responsibility for his very checkered past and he makes no excuses for the mistakes he has made. He has made peace with his past and he is now working hard at keeping his issues under control while dedicating himself to completing his college degree. Colin is mostly serene and tranquil but when his protective side comes into play, he throws common sense out the window and reacts to situations with an intensity that is rather frightening to whomever is on the receiving end.Despite their differences, Maria and Colin are a surprisingly compatible couple. In the beginning, Maria has a few reservations about Colin, but once she is able to get past her preconceived ideas about him, she enters into their relationship wholeheartedly. Their romance is not without problems, but they work through their issues and they remain committed to one another.The suspense element of the storyline is very well done and slowly escalates over the course of the novel. The threats are rather vague initially but as they become more overt, Maria becomes more and more afraid. With an uncomfortable situation with a co-worker looming over her, she at first suspects this person might be behind what is happening but as the situation escalates, she finally realizes the incidents might be related to her previous career. But narrowing down the suspect pool is not easy and the perpetratorâ€™s identity and motive is successfully concealed until nearly the end of the novel.See Me is a captivating novel with an engaging cast of characters, a realistic romance and an intriguing mystery. The plot is refreshingly unique and the characters are well-developed with relatable flaws and failings.  The suspense aspect of the story is credible and Nicholas Sparks brings the novel to a very dramatic and pulse pounding conclusion. An outstanding foray into romantic suspense that I greatly enjoyed and highly recommend to fans of the genre.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34SKWKT62HUZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455520616#wasThisHelpful","R34SKWKT62HUZQ","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"All the Things We Never Knew is the absolutely heartbreaking account of author Shelia Hamiltonâ€™s experience with her first husbandâ€™s battle with bipolar disorder and his subsequent suicide. This deeply emotional but incredibly powerful story is unflinchingly honest and shines a much needed light on mental illness and how easy it is to overlook, excuse or explain away loved onesâ€™ symptoms and behavior.  A courageous and heart wrenching story that will help raise awareness and hopefully destigmatize mental illness and suicide, I HIGHLY recommend this extraordinary novel to all readers.Right from her very first encounter with her soon to be husband, David Krol, Sheila Hamilton was smitten. Attracted to his enthusiastic zest for life, she fell fast and she fell hard for the successful contractor.  Sheila and David soon married and they were both overjoyed when she gave birth to their daughter, Sophie. However, their picture perfect life begins to unravel when Sheila learns of Davidâ€™s infidelity and despite her decision to remain married, their marriage never quite recovers from his betrayal. This discovery was an important red flag and it was just one of many symptoms of Davidâ€™s undiagnosed bipolar disorder that Sheila overlooked in the course of their ten year marriage.When Sheila married David, she was a highly successful and well respected television newsreporter and it is almost incomprehensible to understand her decision to stay with him. Her choice was not made lightly and while well-intentioned, living with David became unbearable in the face of his increasingly erratic behavior in the years to come. Although it was impossible not to notice his mood swings, irrational outbursts and unusual sensitivity to lights, sounds and smells, she never connected these symptoms to any type of mental illness. Denial, lack of information and little knowledge of his family history made it impossible to put the pieces of the puzzle together until Davidâ€™s condition deteriorated and he was hospitalized when she finally worked up the courage to begin divorce proceedings. It was during this time that Sheila uncovered the shocking state of his companyâ€™s finances and learned that David was deeply in debt. Before she could get to the bottom of the financial mess, David was released from the hospital, and he committed suicide, leaving Sheila and Sophie reeling with grief and trying to comprehend what drove him to take his own life.The chapters alternate between the events of Sheilaâ€™s and Davidâ€™s ten year marriage and valuable insight and staggering statistics about mental illness and treatment options. This information is often provided in the context of Sheilaâ€™s experiences with David but these resources would also be helpful to anyone whose life is affected by mental illness.  The narrative also offers a thought-provoking and compelling argument about the role genetics play in inheriting such illnesses. It is also provides an eye-opening discussion on how personal experiences and family history can affect the way someone deals with a loved one or acquaintance who suffers from a mental illness.All the Things We Never Knew is an unforgettable and poignant story about Shelia Hamiltonâ€™s marriage to a man with an undiagnosed mental disorder. Although sometimes difficult to read, this heartrending memoir is as educational as it is heartbreaking and it is a book I highly recommend.I received a complimentary copy for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SDD5BJNM8HVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1580055842#wasThisHelpful","R1SDD5BJNM8HVS","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With its unique premise and cast of eclectic characters, A Cowboy Firefighter for Christmas by Kim Redford is a lovely holiday romance that fans of contemporary western fiction will enjoy. This first installment in the Smokinâ€™ Hot Cowboys series features an investigation into a series of fires in the small town of Wildcat Bluff and a sizzling hot love story between Misty Reynolds and Trey Duvall.Misty does not let her fear of fire stop her from investigating a rash of suspicious fires in Wildcat Bluff. She immediately crosses paths with Trey and she overcomes her phobia long enough to help the sexy volunteer firefighter put out a grass fire and despite her attraction to him, she cannot completely rule him out as the arsonist. Trey is equally drawn to Misty but he quickly senses that she is being less than truthful with him about her reasons for visiting Wildcat Bluff.A Cowboy Firefighter for Christmas is a little slow paced with an over-the-top (but somewhat unusual) storyline. Insta-lust quickly turns to insta-love for both Misty and Trey as they investigate the fires. Endearing character traits and Mistyâ€™s cutesy nickname soon become annoying while the secondary characters are so quirky they comes across as caricatures instead of real people. The weakest part of the storyline is the fire investigation since there is little suspense as to who is responsible for the setting the fires.Despite these issues, A Cowboy Firefighter for Christmas is a well-written, light-hearted holiday romance. Kim Redford incorporates factual information into the storyline, which adds to the novelâ€™s overall appeal. Wildcat Bluff is a charming, close-knit town with interesting and diverse residents.

"Everything I Left Unsaid by M. Oâ€™Keefe is a scorching hot journey of healing and sexual awakening for lead protagonist Annie McKay. This first book in a two part series is a poignant and heartwarming romance that is quite captivating and will leave readers impatiently awaiting the release of the final book in the series.Fearing for her safety, Annie flees from her Oklahoma farm and makes a new life for herself in a rundown trailer park in North Carolina. Almost immediately upon her arrival, she answers a cell phone left by the previous occupant and she is instantly enthralled by the voice on the other end. Their flirtatious conversations quickly turn erotic and with Dylanâ€™s encouragement, Annie begins to explore her newly awakened sexuality.Annieâ€™s sheltered upbringing left her vulnerable and lacking confidence. She made a decision she soon came to regret but seeing no way out, she slowly but surely gave up pieces of herself in order to keep the peace. When things finally come to a head and she truly believes her life is in imminent danger, Annie works up the courage to leave. With no real plan in mind for her future, she is content to remain at the trailer park where she not only feels safe, but tentatively forms the first friendships of her life with her neighbors.Dylan is quite enigmatic and his life remains shrouded in mystery. He enters Annieâ€™s life at a time when she is ripe for change and although some of his requests are clearly out of her comfort zone, she refuses to let her unease stop her from acquiescing to his demands. Annieâ€™s explorations of her sexuality are the impetus for changes in all areas of her life while the growth of Dylanâ€™s character remains rather limited due to the narrow scope of their relationship.Dylan and Annieâ€™s relationship is very unusual and for much of the novel, it remains rather superficial since neither of them is willing to reveal their secrets to one another. There is no denying the sexual chemistry between them and the sex scenes are blistering hot. However, their relationship lacks an emotional depth since neither Dylan nor Annie reveals anything of importance until nearly the end of the novel.Everything I Left Unsaid by M. Oâ€™Keefe is a sexually charged novel of self-discovery and it is quite fascinating watching Annie gain confidence and become more comfortable in her own skin. The overall storyline is refreshingly unique and the characters are multi-dimensional and quite appealing. The novel comes to a rather dramatic conclusion that will leave readers anxiously awaiting The Truth about Him, the final installment of the two book series.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E4WYIWWKY0DZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCI48WM#wasThisHelpful","R1E4WYIWWKY0DZ","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fans of police procedurals do not want to miss Carrie Smithâ€™s Silent City, the first installment in the Claire Codella Mystery series. With a well-drawn cast of characters and an impossible to solve murder, this well-written and intriguing mystery provides readers a fascinating behind the scenes look at educational infighting and politics when new principal Hector Sanchez is murdered.Claire Codellaâ€™s first case when she returns to work following her intensive and aggressive treatment for cancer is an unexpected high profile murder investigation into Hectorâ€™s murder.  Paired up with newly promoted Eduardo Munoz, both detectives have a lot to prove to their co-workers and they, along with Codellaâ€™s former partner, Brian Haggerty, follow numerous leads in their search for Sanchezâ€™s killer. The staging of his body makes it appear that his murder is connected to his job as principal at PS 777 and the three investigators quickly learn there are many suspects who had motive to kill him.Codella is an intelligent detective whose new boss is not exactly her biggest fan. Despite his attempts to undermine her authority, she has managed to pull together an excellent team of investigators. Codella has a precise way of doing things and she follows the evidence instead of hunches. She is clever and resourceful and although she is still just getting back in the swing of things, Codella relentlessly pursues any and all leads in the case.Munoz and Haggerty are also excellent investigators, but most importantly, they are loyal to Codella. Munoz is also new to the squad and unfortunately, he is enduring some malicious harassment from one of his fellow detectives. Haggerty was Codellaâ€™s partner for seven years and right before her cancer diagnosis, she transferred out of their squad following an unpleasant altercation with him. He is hoping this case will heal the rift between them and although things are tense at first, they quickly put aside any residual animosity and concentrate on the case.Codella is a little surprised to discover that Sanchez was not as beloved as everyone has been lead to believe. Many of the staff at PS 777 disliked him due to his impossibly high standards, unfair performance assessments and bullying tactics toward staff members.

The sixth installment in the always fun Christmas, Colorado series is a laugh out loud novel that old and new fans are sure to enjoy.Cat Oâ€™Connor is an ex-Denver police woman now working for her spoiled twin sister Chloe, a popular soap opera actress. Tired of pandering to Chloeâ€™s whims, Cat is ready to quit and return to Colorado when she discovers someone is trying to kill her sister. Unbeknownst to Cat (or anyone else on the set), the showâ€™s newest guest star, Grayson Alexander, is working undercover to investigate the threats on Chloeâ€™s life.  Despite the sparks that immediately fly between them, there is little trust between Grayson and Cat since they both suspect the other of being behind the threats on Chloeâ€™s life.Cat is a strong heroine who pretty much deserves sainthood for putting up with Chloeâ€™s over the top behavior. Cat has had a rough time ever since her ex-boyfriendâ€™s Ponzi scheme was uncovered and everyone thinks (but cannot) prove she knew what he was doing. Working for her sister has worn very thin since Chloe is demanding and spoiled but when Cat discovers someone is trying to kill her, Cat knows she has stay by her side to protect her from harm and uncover the identity of the assailant.Grayson is about to embark on a much needed vacation when he is unexpectedly saddled with his grandmother Estelle. When he tries to find another relative to take her off his hands, his cousin calls in a favor which means Grayson is not only going undercover but he also must bring his grandmother with him. The number one suspect on his list is Cat and he is dismayed by his attraction to her. He is equally disconcerted when Chloe sets her sights on him and his grandmother decides to try her hand at a little matchmaking.The supporting cast of characters are well drawn and range from delightfully quirky to downright annoying. Catâ€™s close friend Ty is a wonderful breath of fresh air and his antics are quite funny. Estelle is also a pretty fun character although her matchmaking attempts are a bit misguided. Chloe is nearly impossible to like and it is extremely frustrating watching her manipulate Cat for much of the story.For a good part of the novel, the storyline focuses on the ensuing investigation. Grayson and Cat continually butt heads as they pursue various leads and their attraction for one another only complicates things between them. Neither of them trust their instincts at this point since Cat cannot believe she missed what her ex-boyfriend was up to and Grayson completely misjudged someone on his last case.  It is not until they, along with the cast and crew of Chloeâ€™s soap opera, relocate to Catâ€™s hometown in Colorado, that their relationship becomes less adversarial. As Cat and Grayson begin working together on the investigation, their attraction deepens but just as they are considering telling one another the truth about their respective roles in the investigation, Chloeâ€™s latest shenanigans cause problems for them.With an intriguing storyline, a cast of eclectic characters and a sweet love story, Snowbound at Christmas is a captivating novel that is fast paced and engaging. This latest installment in Debbie Masonâ€™s heartwarming Colorado, Christmas series is an absolutely delightful read that I highly recommend to readers of contemporary romances.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP25BH5PQFDBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RTY0BHC#wasThisHelpful","RP25BH5PQFDBX","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Now back at the hospital awaiting trial, Alice and another patient, Chase Ward, try to track down Celia before she can attack Alice again.Alice is an uncooperative patient but there is no getting around her private and group therapy sessions. The doctor in charge of her case suggests keeping a journal to help her understand the events of her past and these entries provide a heartrending look into her life from the time she and Celia lost their grandfather and entered into the foster care system. As she reflects on the series of events that culminated in their first trip to Savage Isle, Alice is stunned by emerging portrait of Jason and the events that led her, Celia and Jason to this point in their lives.Alice is essentially the good twin who is unfailingly upbeat and positive whereas Celia has been troubled right from the start.

Convinced he can help her face certain facts about her past, Chase takes matters into his own hands, but in doing so, will he cause Alice irreparable harm?Weâ€™ll Never Be Apart by Emiko Jean is a suspense-laden psychological thriller. The novel is incredibly well written with a rather ingenious and engrossing plot. The characters are superbly developed and quite appealing despite their troubled pasts.

"My Secret to Tell by Natalie D. Richards is a very intriguing young adult mystery. With just a hint of romance, this suspense-laden novel is sure to be a hit with teen readers.Emerson â€œEmmieâ€ May is a good girl who does everything right but even she is feeling the strain of her parentsâ€™ expectations for her future. Ever since her older brother Landon crashed and burned during his first year of college, all of her parentsâ€™ dreams are resting on her shoulders. However, even her fear of disappointing them cannot withstand her loyalty to the Westfield family and despite their pleas to stay away from them after their father is brutally attacked, Emmie cannot abandon her friend Chelsea and her brother (and Emmieâ€™s secret crush), Deacon.Emmie and Chelsea have been best friends for years and the two share everything. So when Chelseaâ€™s father is assaulted in their home, Emmie is the first person she calls. Emmie is shocked to learn that Deacon is the prime suspect in the attack due to their tempestuous relationship. But when she returns home to find him waiting in her bathroom covered in blood, Emmie does what she does best: she cleans him up and offers her support. However, even she begins to doubt his innocence in the days after the attack once Deacon goes into hiding. Although Emmie remains unsure of his guilt, one thing is absolutely certain: both Chelsea and Deacon are keeping secrets from her. But do these secrets have anything to do with the attack on their father?Emmie and Deacon are well-developed, multi-faceted characters. Emmie is caught between her loyalty to her friends and her need to please her parents (which is something teens will definitely relate to). The issues she is dealing with are pretty straight forward but it is only a matter of time before she has to decide whether to follow her heart regardless of her parentsâ€™ expectations.On the surface, Deacon certainly seems troubled but he is also a caring and compassionate young man. He has had a few scrapes here and there but there is no denying his relationship with his father is deeply troubled. Although the police have good reason to suspect he has something to do with his fatherâ€™s assault, it soon becomes obvious the police have focused exclusively on him. Deacon is not just avoiding the police; he is conducting an investigation of his own. He uncovers some puzzling clues, but, to his frustration, this new information does little to help him figure out the identity of his fatherâ€™s attacker.My Secret to Tell is a clever whodunit with a fabulous cast of characters and an alluring romance that will appeal to teens. The mystery element is interesting and full of unexpected twists and turns. The motive for the crime remains elusive and Natalie B. Richards skillfully utilizes numerous red herrings to keep readers guessing the perpetratorâ€™s identity right up until the novelâ€™s rather dramatic and pulse pounding conclusion.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MIDRWAKT93OD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWMC5RE#wasThisHelpful","R1MIDRWAKT93OD","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pop Goes the Weasel, the second book in M.J. Arlidgeâ€™s DI Helen Grace series, is an perplexing murder mystery that takes readers deep into the heart of the seedy world of prostitution. Who is behind the series of grisly murders in the red light district? Why is the murderer delivering gruesome trophies to the victimsâ€™ families and co-workers? Will Detective Inspector Helen Grace and her team of crack investigators catch the killer before he or she strikes again?Although still dealing with a few lingering events from Eeny Meeny, Helen Grace has put most of what happened behind her. She has a new boss, Detective Sergeant Cheri Harwood, and although they get along in the beginning, their professional relationship grows increasingly strained over the course of the investigation into the brutal deaths. Equally troubling is her relationship with Detective Constable Charlie Brooks who is finally returning to work after a long absence. Helen is also distracted by the demands of sleazy reporter Emilia Garanita who somehow seems to know all of Helenâ€™s secrets and tries to use this knowledge to her advantage.The investigation of the horrific murders takes many unexpected twists and turns. Just as Helen and her team seem to have a viable suspect, they hit one dead end after another. When one of the investigators tracks down a seemingly credible witness, the case takes another shocking turn that puts Helen at further odds with her boss. She is under mounting pressure from Harwood to find the killer and the future of her career is soon in jeopardy.Pop Goes the Weasel is written from multiple perspectives and there are numerous story arcs taking place simultaneously. While it is not completely necessary to read the first book in the series, a few of the unresolved plotlines from Eeny Meeny carry over into Pop Goes the Weasel.  These issues dominate the first part of the story which makes for a bit of a confusing read until the focus shifts to the investigation of the murders. The novel is slow paced for about the first half of the book and the abrupt shifts in perspective and short chapters are a bit jarring.Pop Goes the Weasel is an outstanding mystery that old and new fans of the DI Helen Grace series do not want to miss. The overall investigation is fascinating and M.J. Arlidge does an excellent job conveying both Helenâ€™s frustration at the lack of progress with the case and her deepening enmity towards her boss. The perpetratorâ€™s identity is cleverly concealed right up until the action-packed and highly dramatic conclusion.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DR9PJQIC3JU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02FC0#wasThisHelpful","R3DR9PJQIC3JU5","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Set in the world of politics, the cynical son of a Democratic president and an earnest, idealistic Republican are surprised when their one night stand leads to a real relationship.Due to his parentsâ€™ unconventional but lasting union, Trevor Moga knows what he wants and more importantly, what he doesnâ€™t want in a marriage. He is an out and proud, highly successful businessman who stays as far away from politics as he can, so he is absolutely stunned when he cannot stop thinking about Ford Hollingsworth, an ultra conservative, deeply closeted congressman. Although he is not too happy about Fordâ€™s need for secrecy, he continues to see Ford as often as possible. As the months go by and his feelings for Ford deepen, Trevor finds himself rethinking his long held beliefs about his parentsâ€™ marriage and this new perspective leads him to a surprising decision after an unexpected career opportunity comes Fordâ€™s way.Ford is deeply religious and he has struggled to reconcile his sexuality with his religious teachings for most of his life.

He is concerned about disappointing his parents and he also worries about the impact his sexuality will have on his career. Ford is a little naive but he is a sincere, honest politician who truly believes in the political system.The relationship between Ford and Trevor is an intriguing mix of seriously hot sex and sweet, tender moments. Trevor is the more sexually experienced of the two and he knows what he wants and likes and he isnâ€™t afraid to go after it.

"Softer Than Steel is the second installment in Jessica Topperâ€™s fabulous rocker series, Love & Steel. This leisurely paced romance between guitarist Rick â€œRiff Rottenâ€ Rottenberg and yoga instructor Sidra Sullivan is quite captivating and delectably sensual. Although characters from the previous novel in the series make guest appearances, it can be read as a standalone but I HIGHLY recommend the other books in the series as well.Rick is thrilled to be reunited with his former band mates but now their latest tour is over and they are back in the recording studio, he is having difficulty focusing on their next album. With a bad case of writerâ€™s block, mounting anxiety and a raging case of insomnia, he is getting pretty desperate for some relief from his stress. After yet another panic attack, Rick takes a friendâ€™s advice to give yoga a chance and he is delighted when he discovers his new instructor is the woman he unsuccessfully tried to charm when they met by chance a few days earlier. Sidra shares his attraction, but she does not mix business with pleasure and after having her heart crushed by her musician ex-boyfriend, she is really not in any hurry to become involved in another relationship.Now in his mid forties, Rickâ€™s life is full of changes. His three sons are now grown and on their own and he is having a little trouble coping with his empty nest. Although it has been fourteen years since her death, he is still deeply mourning the loss of this beloved wife, Simone. He is also still wracked with guilt and regrets from the mistakes he made in the years leading up to her death. Reuniting with his band mates is a dream come true, and while Rick is ecstatic to be back in the business, there is unexpected tension between the band members as they try to strike a balance between work and their personal lives.Sidra is a warm, caring and compassionate woman who is very devoted to her family. She is slowly building her yoga business and she also helps out in her cousinâ€™s second hand record shop. Her relationship with her ex-boyfriend ended when she found out he was cheating on her and she has no intention of dating another musician. Sidra does not trust easily and this becomes a major problem when she jumps to conclusions about Rick throughout the course of their romance.The relationship between Rick and Sidra is fairly slow growing and Rick displays a surprising amount of patience as he tries to win Sidra over. They each carry significant baggage from their respective pasts and these unresolved issues lead to many of the problems between them. Both of them find it difficult to open up and communication is one of the coupleâ€™s biggest issues. Sidraâ€™s mistrust leads her to jump to conclusions when she misconstrues Rickâ€™s involvement in a situation concerning her family and she is not easily persuaded to give him a second chance.Softer Than Steel is a wonderful addition to Jessica Topperâ€™s Love & Steel series. The characters are vibrantly developed with realistic flaws and issues to overcome. The romance between Rick and Sidra builds at a unhurried pace and it is quite enjoyable watching Rick patiently work his way through Sidraâ€™s somewhat formidable defenses. Although the conflict between them is rather easy to predict, their separation provides both characters with an unexpected opportunity to make some much needed changes in their lives. All in all, it is another highly entertaining novel that old and new fans are going to love.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SC1AMWHI4S2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3GARZM#wasThisHelpful","R1SC1AMWHI4S2B","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Better Man by Leah McLaren is a captivating, thought-provoking novel about a couple whose troubled marriage is on the verge of collapsing.Nick and Maya Wakefield were, at one time, the perfect couple with a happy, sex-filled marriage. However, their once happy union has slowly disintegrated in the three years since the birth of their twins, Foster and Isla. Maya gave up her career as a lawyer to become a stay at home mom while Nick gradually turned into a workaholic. Nick is ready to move on but after learning how much a divorce will cost him, he instead decides to take their mutual friend (and fellow lawyer) Adam Grayâ€™s advice to minimize how much the dissolution of his marriage will cost him. However, once Nick begins spending more time with his wife and kids, he rethinks the divorce but will a shocking betrayal cost him his family?In the beginning, neither Nick nor Maya are particularly likable or sympathetic characters. Both are rather selfish and the gulf between them is of their own making. Maya is a bit of a control freak whose fears for her childrenâ€™s safety borders on the ridiculous and her childrearing philosophy is cringe inducing. As for Nick, his ambivalence toward fatherhood plays a huge role in allowing Maya to make him a spectator in not only his childrenâ€™s lives, but their marriage.  Each of them is clearly unhappy, but they deal with their dissatisfaction in different ways. Maya tries to deal with her frustrations through exercise and fantasies about her personal trainer while Nick manages his discontent by working long hours and indulging in flirtatious liaisons with other women.However, once Nick follows Adamâ€™s advice about pretending to become a better husband and father, both Nick and Maya begin to evolve. At first, Maya is a bit distrustful of Nickâ€™s motives, but she willingly chooses to ignore her doubts and enjoy the changes in their lives. She begins to loosen up and relax her standards once Nick starts becoming more present in their lives. The pair begin â€œdatingâ€ and while their first attempts at intimacy do not exactly go as planned, they do make progress in becoming a couple again. This shift in their status leads to Maya letting go of her tight hold on Isla and Foster and Nick begins to step up and become a parent to their children.Now that their marriage is on a more even keel, Maya decides it is time to consider going back to work. Their friend Adam is a logical starting point and she is soon back on track with her law career. Nick is nothing but supportive and he eagerly picks up the slack at home. At this point, he is rethinking his plans to divorce Maya but outside interference threatens to derail their relationship.A Better Man is a well-written novel with a unique storyline.

"Ten Things Sloane Hates About Tru is an absolutely delightful contemporary young adult novel. Although it has a super sweet romance, it is the subtle life lessons that Tera Lynn Childs incorporates into the storyline that make it such an exceptional read. This first installment in the CreAtive Hearts series is a truly unforgettable story that I highly recommend to readers of all ages.After â€œThe Incidentâ€ that lands her in an incredible amount of trouble, Sloane Whitakerâ€™s parents decide that a move from New York to Austin will keep her on the straight and narrow. Leaving her father and younger brother behind, she and her mother move to Texas right before her senior year of high school begins. Sloane must follow a huge laundry list of rules to keep her mother happy and at the top of the list is staying away from next door neighbor, bad boy Tru Dorsey. Which should be easy since she has talked her mom into maybe, possibly, reconsidering their exile if she follows all those rules, but Sloane does not count on falling for Tru. Will Sloaneâ€™s wish to return to New York come true? Or will Tru convince her to give Austin (and him) a chance?Sloane makes no effort to hide her unhappiness over the move or her motherâ€™s role in the fateful decision. She makes her displeasure known in a myriad of unsubtle (and sometimes comical) ways, but her biggest rebellion is her secret friendship with Tru. After her mom agrees to consider returning to New York early, Sloane makes a real effort to mend her relationship with her mom, but her momâ€™s lack trust continues to come between them.One of Sloaneâ€™s best (and worst) traits is her loyalty to her friends. This is quite admirable when it comes to protecting her friend in regards to â€œThe Incidentâ€. However, in other instances, this has the potential to land her in big trouble. And when it comes to Truâ€™s situation, Sloaneâ€™s silence might just do more harm than good.Tru is cocky but charming and it is impossible not to like him. A bit of a class clown, he is well liked by his classmates and teachers but behind his good natured facade, he is hiding some dark secrets. He is not exactly the bad boy Sloaneâ€™s mom thinks he is, but he definitely has a few demons to overcome. Tru is drawn to Sloane right from their first meeting, and he reveals more of himself to her than anyone else in his life. His part of the story is absolutely heartbreaking and Tru deals with his problems in unhealthy ways but Sloane is incredibly supportive once he begins to open up to her.While on the surface, â€œThe Incidentâ€ that led to the move is not too serious, there were some pretty major unintended consequences of Sloaneâ€™s impetuous decision. She learned a very valuable lesson about thinking before she acts and for the most part, this whole thing was just a momentary lapse of judgment. But, as Sloane learns the hard way, regaining lost trust is never easy and it is going to take time to demonstrate her trustworthiness to her parents.The other important thing Sloane is about to discover is that appearances can be deceiving. She quickly learns a seemingly â€œperfectâ€ life bears very little resemblance to what really occurs behind closed doors. Through her new friendships and acquaintances, Sloane realizes the importance of not taking people at face value and that trusting the wrong people can have serious repercussions.Ten Things Sloane Hates About Tru is a fast-paced and engaging novel. The storyline has unexpected depth and Tera Lynn Childs explores serious topics with a great deal of sensitivity. The characters are beautifully developed and their growth over the course of the story is phenomenal. Not all of the story arcs are completely resolved by the novelâ€™s conclusion, so hopefully readers will see Sloane and Tru again in future installments of the CreAtive Hearts series.I received a complimentary copy for revew.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YLQI6UKKBBH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CS5MNU#wasThisHelpful","R1YLQI6UKKBBH4","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In addition to his infidelity, he also ran up a staggering amount of debt on their joint credit cards and as a result, she lost both her business and the family home. The final straw comes after most of her household furnishings are repossessed and she is served with an eviction notice. Having recently met wealthy businessman Scott Elias through her sister, she reconsiders his proposition to sleep with him after he offers to pay her for her services. However, things takes a bit of a dark turn when Roz tries to end their arrangement and one of her co-workers goes missing.Roz is a surprisingly sympathetic character despite her rather unpalatable choice to sleep with a married man for financial gain. Once the full scope of her financial situation is revealed, it is easy to understand why she feels like she has no other option but to accept Scottâ€™s offer. Her estranged husband refuses to pay child support and she is truly at witsâ€™ end with the looming eviction. Adding to her stress is her nine year old son, Georgeâ€™s misbehavior at school but she is surprisingly patient with him as she tries to understand what is motivating his actions.Although Roz has qualms about what her agreement, she feels as though she she has no choice but to follow through with their arrangement. She grows increasingly uncomfortable with the situation as their lives become more entwined socially but trying to extricate herself from Scott is unexpectedly complicated by his reluctance to end their affair. Her life becomes even difficult in the wake of her co-workerâ€™s disappearance and the subsequent police investigation. However, once Roz realizes the full implications of her fateful decision, she makes a surprising choice that could have a disastrous effect on her future.Despite a bit of a slow beginning and a somewhat predictable storyline, The Mistake I Made by Paula Daly is nonetheless a compelling novel. The plot is quite unique with plenty of tension to hold the readersâ€™ interest as the story winds its way to an unanticipated but thoroughly satisfying conclusion. An overall outstanding mystery that fans of the genre do not want to miss.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KGQWNHMO6YCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802124097#wasThisHelpful","R3KGQWNHMO6YCX","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sea Keeperâ€™s Daughters by Lisa Wingate is a beautiful journey of self-discovery and healing for lead protagonist Whitney Monroe. This third installment in the delightful Carolina Chronicles can be read as a standalone but I highly recommend all of the books in the series.Desperately trying to save the restaurant she co-owns with her cousin, Whitneyâ€™s life is further complicated after her stepfather, Clyde Fransczyk, falls and she is forced to confront the complicated past she has ignored since her motherâ€™s death. Traveling to the Outer Banks to take care of her stepfather and the Excelsior, her familyâ€™s historic waterfront hotel, Whitney uncovers startling information about her familyâ€™s history that provides surprising insight into herself, her grandmother and her strained relationship with her stepfather. She also learns new information about her mother and her late in life marriage to Clyde that makes it very difficult to for her to go through with her plans to convince him to move into assisted living so she can sell the family hotel to an overzealous developer. Before Whitney can decide what she is going to do, the situation with the restaurants takes a dark turn and she is torn between preserving her familyâ€™s legacy and her duty to her loyal employees.For the first time in her life, Whitney is on the verge of failure and with so many people counting on her, she is stubbornly fighting to keep the second restaurant from closing down. Her tenacity is admirable but her reasons for refusing to concede defeat are wrapped up in her guilt over making an impetuous business decision that could destroy what she and her cousin have worked so hard to create. This stubbornness extends to her attitude towards Clyde and it is incredibly frustrating watching Whitney refuse to consider other options for his care. She also seems incredibly short-sighted about her decision to continue the battle to keep the second restaurant afloat. She is so certain that she knows what is right that she remains on her chosen path long after she should have explored other options. Overall, Whitney is a likable but exasperating character who lets her fears and inability to trust prevent her from moving forward until she is forced to by outside influences.Through a series of newly discovered letters written by her grandmotherâ€™s twin sister, Alice, Whitney learns intriguing information about the 1930â€™s Federal Writerâ€™s Project. As one of the Project writers, Alice traveled to distant areas throughout Appalachia where she interviewed and gathered oral histories from as many people as possible for the program. This peek into a long forgotten piece of American history is incredibly fascinating but it also provides Whitney with a different viewpoint of her grandmother and how those long ago events shaped her into the woman she came to know. She also sees how her motherâ€™s past experiences influenced her decisions later in life and this new perspective helps Whitney make peace with her loss.The Sea Keeperâ€™s Daughters by Lisa Wingate is an incredibly well-written and compelling novel of redemption. It is a marvelous tale that weaves fact and fiction into an enthralling story of love and healing that I highly recommend to old and new fans of the Carolina Chronicles.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NJ9U3HIMRDY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCEQTTK#wasThisHelpful","R3NJ9U3HIMRDY7","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Two Across by Jeff Bartsch is a quirky yet clever romance between two slightly awkward and geeky protagonists. Spanning about fourteen years from their initial introduction, a love of crossword puzzles helps Stanley Owens and Vera Baxter reconnect time and again only to have their relationship falter under the weight of dishonesty.Meeting as fifteen year olds at the National Spelling Bee, Vera and Stanleyâ€™s long distance friendship culminates in a faux marriage before beginning college. Stanley comes up with the harebrained scheme as a way to gain his freedom from his mother and keep her in the dark about the fact that he is not attending college. Vera goes along with his plan because she is secretly in love with him. As the years pass, Stanley and Vera create crossword puzzles with clues to facilitate their reunions but their relationship implodes time and again when Stanleyâ€™s schemes are uncovered and Vera runs away instead of facing their issues.Stanley is the only child of an agoraphobic mother who has his future all mapped out for him. He is super intelligent but his only career goal is creating crossword puzzles. He dreams up some very elaborate yet ingenious schemes to convince his mom he has been accepted at Harvard and he uses the money from his sham marriage to Vera to keep up the facade. Stanley is content to make just enough money to maintain a simple lifestyle while he creates and submits various crossword puzzles over the years. Stanleyâ€™s lackadaisical attitude spills over into his private life with Vera and he is content to just coast along without truly committing to her or putting much effort into taking nurturing their relationship.Vera is also crazy smart but unlike Stanley, she has clear goals and dreams that she works hard to achieve. She, too, is less than honest about her marriage, but unlike Stanley, she wants a real relationship. However, due to her fear of rejection, Vera keeps quiet about her feelings for him and their romance falls apart time and again when the truth about Stanleyâ€™s shenanigans or their relationship is discovered. Finally deciding enough is enough, Vera finally comes clean about their marriage and leaves Stanley behind while she completes her education and focuses on her career.The premise of Two Across is quite unique but the story quickly gets bogged down in the on again/off again romance between Vera and Stanley. Stanleyâ€™s lack of honesty with his mother becomes tiresome as he continually falls back on schemes and lies instead of admitting the truth about what he wants in life. Vera is the more likable of the two but her propensity to run away when trouble strikes is frustrating as is her failure to take a risk and admit her feelings to Stanley. The crossword puzzles are quite fun and the manner in which Jeff Bartsch incorporates them into the plot is rather ingenious. Overall, an inventive romance with a bittersweet conclusion that readers of literary fiction will enjoy.I received a complimentary copy for review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32GQ0V4C4TYKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455554626#wasThisHelpful","R32GQ0V4C4TYKO","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Your Voice Is All I Hear is a powerful and thought-provoking young adult novel about the rarely discussed mental illness schizophrenia. Leah Scheier provides a gritty and insightful look into the devastating effect this disorder has on not only the patient, but also their family and friends. This unflinchingly honest depiction of the progression of symptoms and treatment is poignant and oftentimes, heartbreaking. It is a truly captivating novel that is impossible to put down and I highly recommend it to readers of all ages.Socially awkward April Wesley is dreading the beginning of the school year now that her best (and sadly, only) friend, Kristin, has transferred to a private school. She is surprised but delighted when handsome, new student Jonah Golden befriends her on the first day of school. Despite a few uncomfortable interactions with Jonah, the two become inseparable almost immediately and their friendship soon turns romantic. April notices, but easily ignores or explains away, Jonahâ€™s increasingly troubling behavior since his initial symptoms are somewhat vague and non-threatening. Unfortunately it is only a matter of time before Jonah descends into full blown psychosis and paranoia and his parents have no choice but to sign him into a psychiatric hospital for treatment. April stands by Jonah and dedicates herself to aiding him during his recovery but learning the full extent of his illness causes her to doubt their entire relationship.April is such a lonely character that is easy to understand how easily she fell for Jonah. She is shy and finds it impossible to talk to people she does not know very well. She definitely struggles with her first few conversations with Jonah, but they click with one another pretty much right from the start. April is uneasy with his mood swings but since he recovers from them so quickly, she overlooks them.She is also very easily swayed and she is a little too compliant although her loyalty to Jonah is commendable. She never wavers from her commitment to him but April willingly remains in the dark about his condition until one of her teachers challenges her to begin some long overdue research into schizophrenia.Jonah is a sweet, sensitive young man in the beginning but there are hints early on that something is not quite right. While he is fairly open and honest with April, there are some aspects of his past that are clearly off limits. His tenderness with his younger sister is touching as is his devotion to April. Despite his reluctance to talk about his early symptoms, he is aware on some level that something is drastically wrong. Unfortunately, he is embarrassed to admit some of what he is experiencing and as his condition worsens, Jonah tries to cope with his problems on his own.Your Voice Is All I Hear is an extremely emotional story that is incredibly compelling. The storyline is well-written with an outstanding cast of fully developed, sympathetic characters. Leah Scheierâ€™s research is phenomenal and she creatively works factual information about schizophrenia into the storyline in such a way that readers cannot help but experience the terrifying effects of this condition. The skillful use of foreshadowing makes it impossible to put down this engaging story and the novel thunders to a heartrending, but entirely realistic, conclusion.I received a complimentary copy for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WE1U3BY31VH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W3WTVUI#wasThisHelpful","R1WE1U3BY31VH6","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Gates of Evangeline by Hester Young is a spine-tingling mystery with supernatural elements. This captivating thriller stars Charlotte â€œCharlieâ€ Cates, a grieving mother whose chilling dreams compel her to accept a writing assignment about the unsolved abduction of a young boy thirty years earlier. Traveling to a remote southern plantation in the swamps of Louisiana, Charlie works with Remy Minot, a detective in the sheriffâ€™s office, while gathering information about the cold case.  She is quickly immersed in the perplexing case but her life is endangered when she uncovers long buried family secrets that someone is willing to go to any lengths to keep from being revealed.Months after her sonâ€™s tragic death, Charlie knows there is no going back to her old life so she is intrigued by a job offer from her old editor, Isaac Cohen. After their initial meeting, she is on the verge turning down the assignment until Gabriel Deveau, the missing boy, visits her in a dream pleading for help. With the Deveau family agreeing to co-operate with her, Charlie temporarily moves to the plantation, Evangeline, on a fact finding mission. There, she meets with family matriarch, Hettie, who is in the final stages of terminal cancer and Gabrielâ€™s siblings, Sydney, Brigette and Andre. Although they prove less than helpful, Charlie continues poking around in the familyâ€™s past hoping to uncover clues that will answer the haunting question of what happened to Gabriel.Charlie is a well developed, sympathetic character. She is a bit of a loner and after her son Keeganâ€™s death, she retreats even further into herself as she mourns his loss. Immersing herself in the mystery of what happened to Gabriel is the first step in moving on from his death and the distance from her old life provides her with some much needed clarity about what comes next for her.Charlieâ€™s investigation is hindered by a lack of co-operation from the Deveau family but a surprising connection to Detective Minot gives her access to old and new evidence in the case. Her psychic dreams continue and while she and Minot discover new information, they end up with more questions than answers.  Some of these clues are easy to figure out (although Charlie is sometimes a little slow to catch on) but there are quite a few shocking plot twists that are completely unexpected and impossible to predict.There is also a slight romantic element to the storyline when Charlie meets Hettieâ€™s landscaper, Noah. Her interest in Noah is piqued when she discovers he is the grandson of Gabrielâ€™s nanny. They quickly indulge in a bit of no strings fling but Charlie soon grows a little apprehensive of him when a routine background check turns up startling information.  Her misgivings deepen when new information emerges and Charlie grows suspicious of Noahâ€™s possible involvement in a troubling incident.Gates of Evangeline is well written debut novel with an intriguing storyline and an appealing cast of characters.

"In The Middle of Somewhere by Sonja Yoerg, a three-week hike on the John Muir Trail turns into a complicated journey of healing for main protagonist Liz Kroft and her boyfriend Dante Espinoza. Looking forward to her solitary trek, Liz is dismayed when Dante decides to join her but when the weight of her mistakes grows too heavy to bear, she finally reveals her deepest secrets to him. Will her confessions bring the couple closer together? Or will these revelations devastate their relationship beyond repair?Raised by her distant (and uninvolved) single mother, Claire, Lizâ€™s childhood was anything but normal. Learning from a young age to take care of herself, Liz is independent and quite self-sufficient. She finds it difficult to make friends but when she reconnects with classmate, Gabriel Pemberton, in college, she unexpectedly falls in love with him (and his family). The two eventually marry and settle down, but without firsthand experience with â€œnormalâ€ relationships due to her unconventional upbringing, Liz has no idea how to fix her soon floundering marriage. After Gabrielâ€™s death, she begins her life over in a new state and plans to remain single until she meets her co-worker, Dante. Despite the cautious progression of her unexpected romance with him, Liz is still unsure she made the right choice to move in with him.  In the aftermath of a panicked decision she made without consulting him, she hopes the 220 mile hike will provide her with some much needed clarity about what comes next for her and their relationship.Liz is not at all thrilled by Danteâ€™s decision to accompany her on the John Muir Trail. He is not exactly an outdoorsman and the upcoming hike will be strenuous with few creature comforts. Her irritation increases when he fails to follow her advice and he is miserable almost as soon as they begin their journey. However, Liz is most frustrated by the lack of solitude to reflect on the choices she has made.Despite the rather inauspicious beginning to their expedition, Liz unexpectedly begins to confide in Dante about her previous marriage. However, she remains very introspective and it is soon clear that she is deeply troubled by a recent decision. In spite of her reluctance to divulge this upsetting secret, Liz is finding it increasingly difficult to keep this distressing information from Dante. Unfortunately, her suspicions about his reaction are accurate but as she tries to explain the reasons behind her decision, Liz gains unexpected insight about herself. Her explanations fall on deaf ears and Dante pulls away from her both physically and emotionally as he tries to process this unexpected revelation. Before they can repair the rift between them, Liz and Dante find themselves in sudden danger when two hikers they meet on the trial embark on a menacing game of cat and mouse with them.The Middle of Somewhere is an incredibly well-written novel with an unusual storyline.

Liz and Danteâ€™s journey is laden with arduous obstacles to overcome both physically and emotionally and the suspense element provides an unexpected opportunity for healing.

"In A Taste of Sugar, good girl Southern belle, Dr. Charlotte Holden, takes another walk on the wild side with her tattooed, bad-boy not quite ex-husband, Jace McGraw. This second chance at love romance by Marina Adair is a sweet yet scorching hot love story but it is also a beautiful journey of self discovery for the lead protagonists. Although it is the third installment in the sassy Sugar, Georgia series, it can be read as a standalone (but I highly recommend the entire series).Jace and Charlotte impulsively (and secretly) tied the knot four years earlier and just as quickly, their marriage ended. Charlotte eventually returned to their small hometown to work in her familyâ€™s medical center while Jace steadily built his reputation as a high performance engine mechanic. Now, both are on the verge of fulfilling their longtime career goals when Jace discovers their annulment did not go through and they are, in fact, still married. Dismayed to discover it will take three weeks until their marriage is annulled, Jace and Charlotte decide give their relationship another chance. But with Jace planning on leaving and Charlotte firmly rooted in Sugar, will these two live happily ever after?Charlotte is a highly successful and well regarded doctor who has worked hard to secure the funding for an outpatient center for children. She has finally bought a house of her own but she is still having trouble standing up to her parents. Despite having no interest in a relationship, she continues going out on blind dates arranged by her matchmaking mother. However, the biggest point of contention for her is the lack of professional respect from her father. Their working relationship is growing increasingly strained as he continues to treat her like daddyâ€™s little girl instead of a capable adult. Afraid of disappointing her parents with her decision to keep their marriage a secret all these years, Charlotte agrees to work on her relationship with Jace, but only if he agrees to keep their marriage and current involvement under wraps.Jace has mostly outgrown his bad boy reputation but he is afraid no one in Sugar views him as the successful man he has become instead of the wild child he used to be. He has a long history of running away from his problems and he continues to blame himself for his parentsâ€™ death. He has kept both an emotional and physical distance from his family for years but once he agrees to Charlotteâ€™s terms, Jace knows he will finally have to face his past mistakes. Repairing his strained relationship with his brothers and reconnecting with his niece is easier than he thought but will it be enough to convince him to reassess his future plans?Jaceâ€™s relationship with Charlotte also figures heavily into his decision about his future. Having barely recovered from her broken heart the first time he left her, Charlotte is not willing to risk getting hurt by Jace again. At first, he gives her the space she needs, but he slowly comes to the realization that she will avoid him until it is too late if he does not take drastic action. She reluctantly agrees to let him stay with her and while she would be more than happy to explore their scorching hot attraction, Jace wants more than a physical relationship. He is sweetly romantic but Charlotte resists his touching gestures until she grows weary of playing it safe. With their three week deadline looming over them, Jace and Charlotte agree to explore the possibilities between them, but outside interference eventually threatens their chance at happiness.A Taste of Sugar is a light-hearted romance that is full of down home, Southern charm. Jace and Charlotte are well developed, charming protagonists and it is utterly delightful watching their personal growth as they make peace with their respective pasts. The secondary cast of characters is quite colorful and add to the novelâ€™s overall appeal.  The storyline is well-written, unique and quite captivating. Sweet, sexy and oh so gratifying, this third installment in Marina Adairâ€™s Sugar, Georgia series is an absolutely outstanding novel that I thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend to fans of contemporary, small town romances.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R127EOZ562FOH8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455528706#wasThisHelpful","R127EOZ562FOH8","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fan favorite Susan Wiggs returns with her beloved Lakeshore Chronicles series with her newest release, Starlight on Willow Lake.

Even worse, they quickly discover their mom, Alice, has driven yet another caregiver to quit without notice. With neither his brother Adam nor his sister Ivy able to stay with her until a new home health aid is hired, Mason has no choice but to move in temporarily and help interview prospective employees.

"Wildest Dreams, Robyn Carrâ€™s latest stop in Thunder Point, pairs up Blake Smiley and Lin Su Simmons, both of whom were introduced in an earlier book in the series. The languorous romance between the hardworking single mom and the champion triathlete is sweet but it is teenage Charlie who manages to steal readersâ€™ hearts.Lin Su is working as a home health care nurse and she meets Blake when he moves in next door to her patient Winnie Banks. Lin Suâ€™s fourteen year old son Charlie is immediately enthralled with him but her first few encounters with Blake are adversarial. She is extremely overprotective of Charlie due to his asthma and weakened immune system and although he is doing much better, she refuses to let the poor boy spread his wings. Lin Su is great with Winnie but in her personal life, she is secretive, inflexible and judgmental. She is also extremely proud and getting her to accept help from anyone is next to impossible. Quite frankly, Lin Su is frustrating, stubborn and almost impossible to like for much of the story.Blake is a dedicated athlete but he knows his career is beginning to wind down and buying a house is just the first step for the next stage in his life. He has come a long way from his very humble childhood and he is committed to helping other underprivileged youths. He is a genuinely caring and compassionate man who might have overstepped with Charlie initially, but to be fair, Charlie was not exactly forthcoming about his health issues. Blake is pretty unflappable and while he understands Lin Suâ€™s concerns, he presents a calm and well thought out rebuttal to her somewhat irrational fears for Charlieâ€™s health.Charlie is a super smart kid who has a good head on his shoulders. He is aware of his limitations but he is also ready to be an active participant in his life. He is also incredibly curious about his family but Lin Su flat out refuses to discuss her past with him. When his curiosity gets the better of him, Charlie takes matters into his own hands but he is ill prepared for his motherâ€™s response to the information he uncovers.The storyline of Wildest Dreams is interesting and unique but it is very slow paced. The triathlon aspect is well researched but these details sometimes overwhelm the rest of the story. There are multiple mentions of characters from previous installments of the Thunder Point series and while it is nice to catch up with them, these peeks are a bit of a distraction from the main storyline.The relationship between Lin Su and Blake builds at a leisurely pace but their romance does not develop until nearly the end of the novel. Once Lin Su begins dating Blake, she begins to soften somewhat but she still remains tightlipped about her past.  Things are going smoothly between the couple until Charlieâ€™s revelations and in the aftermath, Lin Su is quick to end things with Blake. The resolution of these issues occurs in an unexpected but realistic fashion and Robyn Carr wraps up Wildest Dreams with a heartwarming epilogue that is sure to delight readers.I received a complimentary copy for review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CVGOPJUHLQIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXM1FKA#wasThisHelpful","R2CVGOPJUHLQIP","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This heartwarming novel is a realistic depiction of their friendship and the various up and downs they encounter as they embark on life-altering events.Diana Taylor is newly married and a little lonely since leaving Great Britain to move to the US with her husband, Dan. After yet another unsettling conversation with her sister, Artemis, she places an ad in hopes of meeting other women she can connect with. Much to her delight, Lise Barrett, Sylvia Goldsmith and Cindy Cox answer the ad and despite their somewhat awkward introduction, the women soon become close friends. After no-nonsense, outspoken Sylvia challenges the women to do something about the areas of their lives they are dissatisfied with, they eagerly begin working on their goals.Dianaâ€™s weight has always been an issue for her and after Sylviaâ€™s common sense advice, she researches weight-loss options. She quickly decides to undergo gastric bypass surgery while Dan is out of town for a business trip. The only problems? She makes the decision without talking it over with Dan and her recovery is not as easy as she thought it would be. Delighted with the immediate effects of the surgery, Diana is soon obsessed with daily weigh-ins, counting calories and exercise. Although her weight loss is dramatic and she is ecstatic with the results, her self-esteem remains low and she requires enormous amounts of reassurance about her new look. Her relationship with Dan also continues to deteriorate as Diana strikes up a long distance friendship that goes in a questionable direction.Lise is a college professor who put aside her dream to write a novel after she began her teaching career. She has been involved an in on again/off again relationship with Tony DiCaprio for quite a few years and she does not plan on making any changes to their arrangement. After Sylviaâ€™s blunt advice, she quickly begins working on a novel but finds it difficult to balance writing with her regular job. Lise makes an impulsive decision that shocks her family and jeopardizes her relationship with Tony.Cindy Cox lives with her boyfriend, Eddie and works at a lingerie store in the mall.  Her dream is to have a baby and after hearing Sylviaâ€™s suggestion, she throws out her birth control. She quickly gets pregnant but her life with Eddie is anything but stable and once everyone realize how volatile he is, Sylvia whisks her away to safety. Cindy then must decide whether returning to Eddie is the best choice for her and her unborn child.Sylvia is gruff and plainspoken but she has a heart of gold. She has never married and she is still mourning the loss of her twin sister, Minnie. She is reluctant to talk about her problems but after a health scare, she forms an unexpectedly close bond with Cindy. Dianaâ€™s weight-loss surgery pulls the women together and Sylvia eventually becomes the groupâ€™s unofficial mother figure. While Sylvia does not really have any big issues initially, a surprising friendship with Dr. Sunil â€œSunnyâ€ Gupta leads to the possibility of a romance and an unexpected job opportunity also comes her way.While there are several secondary story arcs for each of the women, The Sisters Club is easy to follow. The chapters alternate between the four womenâ€™s points of view, but these perspective changes are clearly marked at the beginning of each chapter. The characters are beautifully developed with easy to relate to flaws and imperfections. The womenâ€™s relationships are realistically portrayed and the dynamics between them ebb and flow throughout the story. Tempers sometimes flare and the various relationships occasionally become tense but everyone easily sets aside their differences to support their friends when needed.An absolutely delightful story that resonates with genuine emotion, The Sisters Club by Lauren Baratz-Logsted is a heartfelt and engaging novel that I highly recommend to readers of contemporary fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REBLVQB2OVDYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X6HK392#wasThisHelpful","REBLVQB2OVDYW","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Treasured by Thursday, the final installment in Catherine Bybeeâ€™s Weekday Brides series, is another marvelous romance with a few suspense elements. This delightful novel pairs up Gabriella â€œGabiâ€ Masini, a matchmaker at Alliance, and Hunter Blackwell, a billionaire in desperate need of a wife. After Gabi deems him an unsuitable candidate for Alliance, the ruthless businessman does a little digging into her background and coerces her into a marriage of convenience.

When it comes to Gabi, Hunter does not think past what he needs and he will do whatever it takes to achieve his goal of finding a wife.

Despite the extra security measures, danger comes at them from all sides and Gabi inadvertently puts herself in harmâ€™s way when she reacts without thinking things through.  This part of the storyline is a little predictable but there are enough twists and turns to keep the story moving at a brisk pace.Treasured by Thursday is an entertaining, action-packed novel with a wonderful cast of appealing characters. Catherine Bybee puts another unique spin on the marriage of convenience plot device and the resulting love story between Gabi and Hunter is quite captivating.

"The Murdererâ€™s Daughter is a very intriguing mystery starring an intrepid psychologist turned sleuth. This latest release by Jonathan Kellerman is well written with an unique storyline but it is lead protagonist Grace Bladeâ€™s backstory that makes it such a riveting read.Grace entered the foster care system after witnessing her parentsâ€™ murder/suicide when she was five years old. She bounced from home to home until her case worker, Wayne Knutsen, placed her with Ramona Stage, one of the few foster parents who cared actually cared about the childrenâ€™s welfare. Through the help of her brother-in-law Malcolm, a psychology professor, Grace received a specialized education tailored to her genius level intelligence. For several years, things went smoothly for Grace until the arrival of three young children late one night. Although their stay was brief, their appearance irrevocably changed Graceâ€™s life.In the present, Grace is a successful psychologist who specializes in caring for patients whose lives have been altered by trauma. She is a survivor and she learned the hard way not to depend on anyone but herself. She is empathetic and caring with her patients, but in her personal life, she has no emotional attachments or relationships of any type. Grace is rather detached and unemotional but given her horrific background, it is understandable that she does not (or maybe cannot), truly connect with anyone.Graceâ€™s present collides with her long forgotten past after her newest client, Andrew Toner, is murdered. Andrew tracked her down through an obscure article she published years earlier and although he changes his mind about discussing his problems, Grace surmises one of his relatives is most likely a killer. When she realizes she has a distant connection to him, she begins her own investigation into his death. With very little outside help, Grace single-mindedly tracks down the evidence she needs to find his killer.The Murderâ€™s Daughter is a compelling but leisurely paced novel that seamlessly alternates between Graceâ€™s investigation and her heartbreaking past. Grace is an interesting and complex character although it is sometimes difficult to like her. The storyline is quite clever and brilliantly executed. An outstanding mystery that old and new fans of Jonathan Kellerman do not want to miss.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22FEIOE8YRDZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MZWA65K#wasThisHelpful","R22FEIOE8YRDZM","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In The Three-Nine Line, David Freedâ€™s fourth novel in the highly entertaining and always fascinating Cordell Logan Mystery series, past and present collide when â€œMr. Wonderfulâ€, a brutal guard at the Hanoi Hilton, is murdered after a reconciliation ceremony with three of his former POWs. Ex-fighter pilot and one-time covert government operator Cordell Logan travels to Vietnam to investigate the murder and help the Americans leave the country before news of the murder reaches the American press. With a US trade agreement with Vietnam hanging in the balance, Logan must outwit Truong Tan Sang, an overzealous investigator with the Ministry of Public Security, before the ex-POWs are convicted of the crime.Cordell is still coming to terms with the tragic events that occurred six months earlier when his old friend and comrade in arms Buzz reaches out to him about the tense situation in Hanoi. Cordell is a little reluctant to become involved in the investigation, but when he learns his former philosophy professor, Steven Cohen, is one of the men under house arrest, he quickly agrees to help. Posing as psychologist Bob Barker, Logan travels to Vietnam where he meets with Cohen and the other ex-POW, Virgil Stoneburner, while at the same time he secretly investigates the murder. With very few resources to aid him on his search for answers, Logan and his interpreter, Nguyen Phu Dung are soon looking into â€œMr. Wonderfulâ€™sâ€ sordid dealings in hopes of discovering the identity of his killer.Logan is still the same intelligent, sarcastic and somewhat reluctant investigator introduced in previous installments of the series. However he has been out of the covert ops game just long enough to be slightly off balance. He seems a bit distracted occasionally and although he gets results, he is sometimes a little reckless. Cordell is also on his own for much of the investigation and lacks some of the resources he needs to obtain necessary information.As Dr. Barker, Logan has limited access to Cohen and Stoneburner, and they continue to deny any involvement in the murder. The third ex-POW Billy Hallady is out of Cordellâ€™s reach since he returned to the US with his grandson, Sean, before Mr. Wonderfulâ€™s body was discovered. Is their early return as innocent as Hallady proclaims? Or is the reason a sign of their involvement in Mr. Wonderfulâ€™s death? Will Logan unmask the killer(s) before Cohen and Stoneburner become scapegoats for his murder?The Three-Nine Line is a very clever and intriguing addition to the Cordell Logan Mystery series. David Freed has once again written an impossible to solve mystery that will keep readers guessing the perpetratorâ€™s identity right up until the novelâ€™s dramatic conclusion. The return of an old love interest will leave fans eagerly awaiting the next book in this delightful series.

"Fans of horror stories are absolutely going to love Alive by Chandler Baker. This young adult novel starring seventeen year old Stella Cross is a deliciously eerie and spooky thriller with supernatural elements. It is an utterly outstanding debut novel that I recommend to readers of all ages.Stellaâ€™s two year wait for a new heart has finally ended and she has successfully undergone transplant surgery. Although fully recovered from the surgery, she is plagued by a searing pain in her chest that occurs every day at the same time, but all of her tests have come back normal. Ready to get back to regular life, Stella returns to school where she begins dating new student, Levi Zin. Much to her surprise, when she is with Levi, the horrendous pain in her chest disappears. However, her friendsâ€™ begin to grow concerned about her when she begins acting out of character, but it is their observations about Leviâ€™s behavior that worry her. It is not until her bizarre hallucinations start coming true that Stella becomes truly frightened. She then turns to her good friend, Henry, and they uncover shocking information about Levi.Stella handles most of the changes in her life with grace but once she meets Levi, she slowly becomes obsessed with him. In the beginning, she wants to spend time with him because of their strong attraction but then she realizes when they are together, she is blissfully pain free. Stella does not question this strange phenomena too deeply especially since Levi opens her up to new and exciting experiences. While she feels twinges of guilt over how badly she is treating her friends, she becomes deliberately hurtful when they try to talk to her about Levi. It is not until she attends a party with Levi that Stella realizes that her friends have been right all along and at long last, she delves into Leviâ€™s past.Stella has an amazing set of loyal friends who easily forgive her despite how badly she treats them. Brynn is no nonsense and honest to a fault. Henry is the only guy in the mix and while their feelings for one another run a little deeper than friendship, the timing has never been right for their relationship to turn romantic. They share a love of all things paranormal and Henry is the logical choice for her to turn to when she needs help getting to the bottom of the mystery surrounding Levi.The supernatural/paranormal aspect of Alive is extremely well written. Stellaâ€™s bizarre experiences are initially easy to discount because the visions are so fleeting. Her hallucinations become more vivid and frightening but they are still infrequent enough that she continues to ignore them. It is not until her visions start coming true and she is plagued with nightmares that Stella is forced to confront her growing fear that an otherworldly influence might be responsible for what is happening to her. After her investigation hits a dead end, she turns to Henry for help and together, they learn the horrifying truth about Levi and her connection to him.Alive by Chandler Baker is a riveting young adult novel with a unique and well-written storyline. The characters are multi-faceted and superbly developed. The supernatural element is brilliantly executed and fans of the genre are going to love how this aspect of the plot plays out. An positively marvelous debut that I highly recommend to anyone who loves reading horror stories.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32F7ZIO0L9TDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RY6YXBA#wasThisHelpful","R32F7ZIO0L9TDL","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Guilty One by Sophie Littlefield is an intriguing character study that focuses primarily on two parents whose lives are forever intertwined by a senseless murder. What makes the premise of the novel so fascinating is one character is Maris Parker, the mother of the murdered teen while the other character is Ron Isherwood, the father of the convicted killer. The story begins about six weeks after the trial has ended and in the aftermath of the conviction, both families are attempting to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives.For the past year, Maris has been paralyzed by overwhelming grief and her life has come to a virtual standstill. Now the trial is over, the sentence has been handed down and she must figure out what comes next for her. Her husband, Jeff, has moved out and announced he wants a divorce. While she contemplates her future, she is planning to spend a few weeks with her sister. She is rather ambivalent about the upcoming visit and after her car is broken into, Maris befriends a young woman and impulsively rents an apartment in her building where she begins re-evaluating her life.Unlike his wife, Deb, Ron has never been completely convinced of his sonâ€™s innocence and after his conviction, Ron cannot bring himself to visit him in prison. He has come to the realization that his familyâ€™s history of violence might have passed down to his son and he is overcome with guilt for his sonâ€™s crime. Like Maris, Ron has essentially checked out life and as the story begins, he is finally ready to end his own life in a misguided effort to atone for his son Karlâ€™s misdeeds. However, Ron makes a fateful decision to phone Maris before jumping which essentially saves his life and winds up being the impetus for both of them to truly move forward with their lives.Both Ron and Maris are sympathetic characters but it is sometimes difficult to like them. Maris is not honest with her new friends and she takes a little too long to come clean about her past. She is also incredibly angry with Jeff and her anger seems a little over the top considering that she made her share of mistakes during their marriage. It is also very frustrating how Maris continually avoids confrontation instead of facing it head on. Her grief over her daughterâ€™s death is particularly heartbreaking but her new friends and simpler lifestyle provide her with a different perspective that helps Maris decide what she wants in life.Ron grew up in an abusive household and he has tried very hard to leave his violent past behind him. He kept much of what occurred in his childhood hidden from Deb and he has worked hard to maintain tight control over his own aggressive tendencies. Looking back, Ron now wonders if he was too hard on Karl and one incident in particular continues to haunt him. One of the biggest questions that weighs heavily on Ron is how much responsibility he bears for his sonâ€™s actions. In hindight, he cannot but question his decision to have children considering his familyâ€™s history.With underlying themes of forgiveness and redemption, The Guilty One is a compelling novel. Although not a true mystery, Sophie Littlefield builds suspense about Karlâ€™s guilt or innocence and the resolution of this part of the storyline is full of unexpected twists and turns. Overall, it is an engaging story that is poignant, thought-provoking and emotionally satisfying.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E8C38RPE0YZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RM266Z2#wasThisHelpful","R2E8C38RPE0YZJ","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Still Life Las Vegas by James Sie is a young adult novel that is unique and intriguing. Written from multiple points of view, the story goes back and forth in time and details the somewhat tragic life of the Stahl family but it mainly focuses on seventeen year old Walter. Interspersed with beautifully rendered illustrations by Sungyoon Choi, some parts of the story are told in graphic novel format while some of drawings are from Walterâ€™s sketchbook.Walter lives in a seedy part of Las Vegas with his father Owen who suffers from debilitating bouts of depression. Walter keenly feels the loss of his mother, Emily, who abandoned the family when he was five years old. He works in a tourist attraction where he searches the faces of the visitors hoping to catch a glimpse of his mom. He leads a rather lonely life until he befriends living statues Chrysto and his sister Acacia. This acquaintance becomes a time of discovery for Walter as his friendship with Chrysto takes a surprising turn while an unanticipated visit brings him unexpected news about his mom.Forced to grow up too soon, Walter is extremely mature for his age. He often finds himself in the role of caregiver for Owen and he is responsible for most of the household chores and managing their meager finances. Although he has no memories of his mother, Walter finds himself looking for her in the faces of the tourists he meets. However, she is relegated to the back of his mind after he becomes enthralled with Chrysto. This friendship opens Walter to new experiences and also provides him with startling insight about himself. Shocking news about his mom coincides with a betrayal and sends Walter into a downward spiral.The chapters in the novel alternate between Walter, Owen and Emilyâ€™s points of view. Walterâ€™s chapters take place when he seventeen while Owen and Emilyâ€™s jump around to different time periods in their lives. Emilyâ€™s perspective includes pivotal information about her childhood while Owenâ€™s detail the early years of his romance with Emily and their marriage. There are also chapters detailing Emilyâ€™s life after she abandons the family and her experiences reach nearly mythical proportions by the novelâ€™s conclusion.The coming of age aspect of the storyline, Walterâ€™s personal awakening and learning the series of events that led to Emilyâ€™s abandonment are quite fascinating but the overall execution of the novel is disjointed and difficult to follow. Although the perspective changes are clearly marked, the time periods are fluid and some of the chapters end rather abruptly. The graphic novel sections are interesting but if you are not a reader of graphic novels, this switch from prose can be annoying. (I personally found the longer segments with the graphic elements frustrating since they contained vital information about the unfolding story.)Although the plot is a little busy, Still Life Las Vegas is a poignant and engrossing novel coming of age novel. The characters are well-developed, the storyline is quite distinctive and the illustrations are absolutely beautiful. The Las Vegas setting is the perfect backdrop for the unfolding story and James Sie brings the city vibrantly to life. Unexpected plot twists keep the novel moving at a brisk pace and the conclusion is realistic and mostly satisfying.I received a complimentary copy for review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7M1F2D0DFO3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFB0PRY#wasThisHelpful","R7M1F2D0DFO3B","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Although there is no residual tension between them, Maya is quick to apologize for the way she handled their break up and their failed romance is pretty much a non-issue for them.Del is not close to his extended family and his relationship with his artist father is particularly strained.

"Taking the Heat is another scorching hot installment in Victoria Dahlâ€™s fabulous Jackson: Girlsâ€™ Night Out series. In this outing, newcomer Gabe MacKenzie is paired up with Veronica Chandler and their romance is a delightful blend of light-hearted banter and fiery sex scenes.Veronica Chandlerâ€™s dream of living in New York was not everything she hoped it would be so she returned to Jackson where she writes an advice column for the local paper. Although her column is well received, she feels like a huge fraud handing out advice when her own life is such a mess. She lives in fear that everyone will see the insecurities and inexperience she keeps carefully hidden. Her insecurities stem from her emotionally distant father and the long term bullying she endured from her ex-stepbrother. But it is her lack of experience with relationships that makes her feel completely inadequate when it comes to dispensing romantic advice.  It is not until Veronica decides to take her own advice that she begins to become more self confident and find the courage to stand up for herself.Gabe absolutely loves everything about Wyoming, but his time in Jackson is limited due to family obligations. Despite his enjoyment of rock climbing and other outdoor activities, he has never regretted becoming a librarian and he is still very enthusiastic about his career. He is not looking for a romance but he is very intrigued by Veronica and he cannot seem to stay away from her. Gabe is a really great guy but he also likes to take care of people so he has a tendency to keep unpleasant things to himself. Which turns out to be a bit of problem in his burgeoning relationship with Veronica.The romance between Veronica and Gabe is so much fun to watch unfold. Although Veronica wants to rush headlong into a physical relationship, Gabe insists on taking things slow. Their scenes are full of sexual tension and mercy, it is amazing that Gabe is able to resist Veronica as long as he does!However, there is much more to Gabe and Veronicaâ€™s relationship than witty dialogue, sexy flirting and naughty love scenes.

"The Color of Light is another thought-provoking and poignant addition to Emilie Richardsâ€™ wonderful Goddesses Anonymous series. In this outing, minister Analiese â€œAnaâ€ Wagnerâ€™s judgment is called into question when she steps in to help a homeless family. As if she does not have enough on her plate, she is surprised by the sudden reappearance of her longtime friend and mentor Father Isaiah Colburn. Although they have been out of touch for several years, they easily pick up where they left off but Ana is disconcerted by the realization that she is still in love with Isaiah. Unbeknownst to Ana, Isaiah is close to finalizing a decision that will change the course of his life. Both of them are at a crossroads that leaves each of them questioning whether they have chosen the right path and if not, what comes next for them professionally and personally?While Ana is not having a crisis of faith, she does begin to question whether or not she wants to continue her career as a minister. She is continually butting heads with some of the churchâ€™s leadership and members of the congregation and her days are filled with putting out fires and juggling meetings. Her decision to help the Fowler family is met with resistance and Ana is frustrated by some of her parishionerâ€™s lack of compassion for their situation. Trying to get the family some assistance is a burden she willingly takes on, but Ana is coming dangerously close to burning out as she devotes most of her time to helping others.Isaiah is also having trouble reconciling the demands of priesthood with his personal life. He is on a sabbatical to try to decide whether or not to leave the priesthood when he reconnects with Ana. Although he is close to making a final decision about his future, both Isaiah and Ana are concerned about the effect his choice will have on the future of their relationship and their careers.The story arc about the Fowler family is particularly heart wrenching. A job loss devastated the family and they have been trying to get back on their feet for quite some time. Much of the familyâ€™s care rests on the shoulders of fourteen year old Shiloh due to her father Manâ€™s depression and her mother Belleâ€™s poor health. Ana steps in to help Man find work and get Belle some much needed medical attention and as their lives finally begin to turn around, Shiloh discovers she can rely on her parents to take care of her after a traumatic incident.The Color of Light is a very heartwarming and inspiring story.

"Bad News Cowboy, the latest installment in Maisey Yatesâ€™ fantastic Copper Ridge series, is a deliciously sexy friends to lovers romance.  This outing pairs the Garrett familyâ€™s youngest sister Kate with their bad boy friend Jack Monaghan and the resulting story is a sizzling hot story of love and healing.Kate was only two years old when her mother abandoned her and her older brothers, Eli and Connor. With their alcoholic father unable to take care of himself let alone his children, the boys stepped in and raised her while at the keeping the family ranch from going under. Another constant in her life is Eli and Connorâ€™s best friend, Jack, but lately, their once easygoing, sibling-like friendship has turned into a source of friction for Kate. She does not understand why Jack suddenly rubs her the wrong way but when he offers to teach her how to flirt, Kate rapidly figures out she is attracted to him. After they share a very steamy and unexpected kiss, Jack is rather disconcerted by his sudden desire for his friendsâ€™ little sister. There is absolutely NO way Eli and Connor will approve of Kate dating Jack, but one passionate night turns into a romance both are determined to keep hidden from prying eyes.Growing up with nothing but male role models, Kate is a bit of a tomboy. She is most comfortable in jeans and boots and she practically breaks out in hives at the thought of wearing a dress. Kate has not been interested in dating but now that her brothers have fallen in love, she has come to realize that everyone else is moving forward while she has become stagnant. Getting a little experience in the romance department is just one of several changes she is planning on making and Jack is the safe choice to help her learn how to interact with men as a woman instead of just one of the guys. He is also the logical person to go to when she needs some assistance making sure she is ready to hit the professional rodeo circuit. Kate is feisty, independent and stubborn, but she feels safe revealing her vulnerabilities to Jack since their backgrounds share many similarities.Everyone views Jack as a laidback and easygoing man who does not take anything too seriously. He has a well-earned reputation as heartbreaker since he prefers one night stands and he has never been involved in a serious relationship. However, underneath his surface charm and carefree exterior, Jack is a bit damaged and carrying a lot of pain from his dysfunctional childhood. He hides his insecurities behind his cocky attitude and he also harbors a great deal of residual anger toward his absentee father. While Jack eagerly accepts the blame when he does something wrong, he is unwilling to take credit for the good things he does. Kate quickly picks up on this pattern but she is reluctant to push the issue with him and eventually Jack will have to do a little soul searching on his own so he can make peace with his past.The chemistry between Jack and Kate is off the charts smoking hot and their friendship easily withstands the change in their relationship. They find it easy to confide in each other about their fears and they also have some very serious discussions about their respective childhoods. Kate is surprisingly intuitive despite her age and her perspective helps Jack see himself more clearly. While they are in agreement about indulging in a short term fling, both are very concerned about not letting anyone find out about their romance. However once Jack realizes how deep his feelings for Kate run, he does not hesitate to attempt to move their relationship out into the open. Unfortunately, Jack underestimates Kateâ€™s reaction to going public and he stands to lose everything he holds dear when their romance is revealed.Bad News Cowboy is another captivating addition to Maisey Yatesâ€™ Copper Ridge series. Jack and Kate are wonderfully developed protagonists with believable flaws and realistic problems to overcome. Their relationship is greatly enhanced by their longstanding friendship and their transition from friends to lovers feels natural. Both of the characters grow and evolve throughout the novel and this is, in part, a direct result of their romance. Sweet, steamy and heartfelt, it is an absolutely delightful romance that old and new fans to the series are going to love.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30XQXIYMDAWFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFQTMWI#wasThisHelpful","R30XQXIYMDAWFG","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ones We Trust by Kimberly Belle is a poignant and emotional novel that is also quite intriguing. This sometimes heartbreaking story of redemption about an ex-journalist searching for the truth about a soldierâ€™s death in Afghanistan is quite captivating and very moving. A thought-provoking novel that touches on some very relevant issues, it is the underlying themes of loyalty, trust and betrayal that makes it such an outstanding read.After one of her stories ended in a horrible tragedy three years ago, Abigail Wolff walked away from her career as a journalist. Now working as a website content curator, Abigail is reluctantly drawn into investigating the person who gave her the initial information for the story that she still feels guilty about writing. At the same time, she receives an anonymous delivery containing uncensored transcripts that prove the Army is covering up the death of Zack Armstrong, an actor turned soldier who tragically died in Afghanistan. Once she realizes the implications, she takes the information to the Armstrong family who are currently embroiled in a lawsuit to uncover the truth about Zackâ€™s death. Zackâ€™s mom, Jean, asks Abigail to write Zackâ€™s story while his brother Gabe, demands she stay away from the family. Curiously, Nick, the third Armstrong brother and the one person who knows more than anyone about Zackâ€™s death since he was present when he died, is ominously silent. Finding the truth becomes even more complicated when Abigail discovers she has close personal ties to Army brass who are also involved with the case. When she begins to fall in love with Gabe, Abigailâ€™s loyalty is tested when the people closest to her refuse to tell her the truth but betrayal comes from an unexpected source.For Abigail, truth trumps everything and at one time, she was determined to tell it no matter the cost. But after the case that ended tragically, she not only felt guilty that was the catalyst, but she began to doubt her judgment. In the years since, she has been content to sit back and work a safe job where she can do no harm. But when one of the children from her earlier story comes forward with puzzling information about her informant, Abigail knows she has to investigate if only to satisfy her own questions about what she might have initially missed. She still has no plans to report on the story, but if she can bring peace to the family, Abigail feels compelled to uncover the truth.When it comes to the Armstrong case, Abigail still has no interest in writing a story, but she feels the family deserves to know what the Army is hiding. She remains reluctant to become involved in the case but while she is deciding whether or not to help Jean write about Zack, Gabe has a change of heart. Unable to say no when he asks for her help, Abigail is soon immersed in discovering what happened that fateful day. When her father warns her off the case, she begins to doubt him and she becomes even more determined to learn the truth. However once she exposes what lies at the heart of the conspiracy, will Abigail lose the people she loves?Heartrending and full of unexpected twists and turns, The Ones We Trust by Kimberly Belle is a captivating novel about love, loyalty and betrayal.

"Pretty Baby by Mary Kubica is a very clever and intriguing mystery. Full of suspense and drama, an act of kindness takes several unexpected turns that make this compelling novel very hard to put down.Heidi Wood is a giving and caring married mother whose altruistic nature is her best and sometimes, worst, trait. Her husband Chris is used to her unilateral approach to decision making but even he is stunned when she returns home one morning with a homeless teen and her baby. His questions about how long the pair are going to stay with the family remain unanswered and when he returns from a business trip, he is absolutely horrified by the changes that have occurred in his absence.Heidi is a bit off balance when she first crosses path with Willow and her baby, Ruby. Chris is frequently out of town for business and she is less than pleased that his beautiful, sexy co-worker often accompanies him on these trips. Her once close relationship with daughter Zoe has become tense and she is at a loss as to how to handle her now Zoe is entering her teen years. Years earlier, Heidi suffered two defining and life altering losses and although hit hard by these events, she appears to have fully recovered in the intervening years. However once she brings Willow and Ruby into the home, she is haunted by memories of what happened and the choices she made.Chris is often distracted by work and while he still loves Heidi, he feels a little neglected as she pours her heart and soul into her job. He is also a bit resentful of how she makes decisions without consulting him and he is rightfully concerned about her bringing Willow and Ruby into their home. Chris wants answers that Willow is unwilling to provide and he takes steps to learn exactly what she is hiding.Willow is shrouded in mystery and she is very hesitant to divulge anything about herself or her baby. She is clearly uncomfortable with some aspects of motherhood and Heidi is very concerned about Rubyâ€™s welfare. Despite her current situation, Willow is very sympathetic and as more information about her traumatic and tragic past are revealed, it is easy to understand the reasons for her actions. Could Willow have done things differently? Absolutely. But once her age and her circumstances are taken into consideration, her decisions are reasonable, albeit misguided.While always interesting, the first half of the novel is rather slow paced. The story is written in alternating points of views with Chris and Heidiâ€™s chapters taking place in the present and following the events as they unfold. In sharp contrast, Willowâ€™s chapters take place in after everything has occurred, but they give away few details about what actually transpired while she was with Heidi and Chris. It is through these chapters that the shocking truth about her tragic past is fully revealed.Riveting and complex with a strong psychological aspect, Pretty Baby by Mary Kubica is a well-written, character driven novel. While not a traditional mystery, there is a great deal of suspense surrounding Willowâ€™s identity and what happens after she enters Heidiâ€™s home. Although the reader is eventually able to see where the story is going, the conclusion is still quite shocking and completely unexpected.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY8TXKISOI5GY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S4ZH70Y#wasThisHelpful","RY8TXKISOI5GY","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gonzo Girl is an engrossing debut novel by Cheryl Della Pietra. Based on the authorâ€™s experiences as Hunter S. Thompsonâ€™s personal assistant, this fictionalized story is a poignant and sometimes harrowing account of a recent college graduateâ€™s daily life with an author whose days are a drug and alcohol fueled blur of outrageous and oftentimes, dangerous, excess.Alley Russo has big dreams of escaping her familyâ€™s blue collar life and while she has a degree from an Ivy League college, she is still tending bar while working as an unpaid intern at a magazine. When she learns Walker Reade is looking for a personal assistant, she jumps at the chance to work for the iconic writer. She is horrified when her job interview entails dropping acid, snorting coke and binge drinking, but she desperately needs the connection to publish her own manuscript. Although she has a few reservations, Alley accepts the job and since she does not get paid until Walker finishes his latest book, she has more than enough incentive to motivate him to write. He manages to churn out a page or two a day, but Alley is appalled at the lackluster drivel he produces and she begins rewriting these dismal attempts before submitting them to his editor. Trying to manage Walkerâ€™s excessive behavior becomes increasingly difficult as he begins a downward spiral that turns violent and it is up to his long time assistant Claudia Reynolds to smooth over the numerous problems that threaten to topple the one time literary genius.By the time Alley begins working for Walker, he is in his early fifties and definitely on the downside of his once illustrious career. His over the top behavior once enhanced his writing ability, but his brilliance is now lost in a haze of drugs and alcohol. He is verbally abusive to the women around him and once he adds coke to the mix, he is downright mean. Walker surrounds himself with a cadre of hangers-on who encourage his out of control behavior and their antics escalate to the point Walker is a danger himself and everyone around him.Gonzo Girl is definitely an entertaining novel that is fast-paced and compelling (in a train wreck kind of way). Cheryl Della Pietra offers a fascinating peek into the self-indulgent and somewhat debauched lifestyle of a larger than life author whose once impressive talent becomes lost in a haze of addiction. All in all, a surprisingly enjoyable (if sometimes horrifying) read that I highly recommend to fans of Hunter S. Thompson.I received a complimentary copy for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WAQZZVEIU4CC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WRFA#wasThisHelpful","R1WAQZZVEIU4CC","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Kindness by Polly Samson is a novel about an older woman/younger man whose relationship falls apart when their young daughter falls ill.  Spanning nearly 23 years, much of the past is revealed through flashbacks and a great deal of suspense surrounds the fate of the coupleâ€™s daughter.In the beginning, Julia and Julianâ€™s relationship is quite idyllic and the two are deeply in love. Their romance had a bit of rocky beginning since Julia was still married to her abusive husband and Julian had not yet finished college. Neither of them were too concerned about their eight year age gap, but it is a point of contention for Julianâ€™s over protective mother. The birth of their daughter Mira completes their family but their relationship falters when Julian purchases his old family home Firdaws without consulting Julia. Unfortunately, when Mira falls ill, their once close bond cannot withstand the stress and Julian returns to Firdaws alone to grieve his loss.Most of the novel is written from Julianâ€™s point of view. He is deeply depressed and living alone at Firdaws. His loss is keenly felt and his family and friends are growing increasingly concerned about him. It is obvious he is quite grief stricken, but there are many questions about what he is mourning since neither Mira nor Julia are mentioned except through flashbacks. As Julian tries to make it through his days, he reminisces about his relationship with Julia, whom he deeply loves. He is overjoyed at Miraâ€™s birth but after he moves to Firdaws, he becomes her primary caregiver since Juliaâ€™s career keeps her in town most of the week. Miraâ€™s mysterious illness comes and goes and although they take her to a local doctor, her symptoms are too vague to reach a conclusive diagnosis. Julian eventually becomes impatient with her frequent bouts of sickness and in the present, he is obviously wracked with guilt for not being more concerned about her health.The last hundred pages are written from Julia perspective and the entire truth is finally revealed. Her dysfunctional past makes her a mostly sympathetic character but some of her decisions are hard to understand. The secrets she has been keeping are quite shocking and completely unexpected.Although beautifully written with very descriptive prose, The Kindness is a rather difficult novel to follow. The pacing is rather slow and the abrupt transitions between past and present are confusing. The narrative is exquisitely detailed but many of these details do not really add anything to the plot. While the main â€œmysteryâ€ is completely resolved, the conclusion is a little ambiguous and the fate of some of the characters is unclear.In spite of these issues, The Kindness is a enjoyable read. Polly Samson brings the charactersâ€™ emotions and the various settings vibrantly to life. The plot twists are brilliantly executed and it is only through hindsight that seemingly innocuous events begin to make sense. A leisurely paced novel that fans of literary fiction should add to their summer reading list.I received a complimentary copy for review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K7G2UJ2RL4ZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVCWCO8#wasThisHelpful","R3K7G2UJ2RL4ZD","A3RHTYOGSITLWN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RHTYOGSITLWN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been looking for a lower cost alternative to my Mephisto dress/walking shoes. At about 300 dollars, I find them to be a bit rich for my budget, but the only dress shoe that seemed to meet the dual need for comfort and looking like an adult businessman at the same time. I used to buy Rockports 30 years ago when they were still made in the USA. Now, they are made at all the usual outsource locations. I've checked them out in the intervening years and have never been happy with them as I was back in the day. They seemed to lack quality and had wildly varying fit. Then, given the Amazon easy return policy and the advent of some new models of Lockport, I decided to give them a shot again.These lightweight loafers are, definitely, light in weight. I didn't take the scale to them, but they seem about half the weight of my Mephisto loafers. The sole is nicely cushioned and they have a supportive arch. It is not a super big arch, but good enough for me. I have learned to use the Amazon fitting notes for shoes when it is available, and have found it really helps me decide whether to go a half size up or down on my nominal 9.5 shoe size. These shoes seemed to be hitting everyone about right on the mark with actual fit and stated size matching pretty well.The great part of this is that the shoes are high in quality again, look great and are comfortable enough to wear all day. Coming in at about half price during a ""Lightning Deal"" makes them a great buy, too. I've got black and brown. What with the free return policy at Amazon, I say look at the sizing notes and get these if you need nice dress shoes that won't kill your wallet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F9YVYE8N3R2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z1BZVFW#wasThisHelpful","R3F9YVYE8N3R2V","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update: 11/9/15.Adobe got back to me after I posted my review, as well as another user, and I was able to download and use the program. It is a big leap ahead of the version I was using (PE10). I especially like the masking, background fill-in features so far. It turns out the reason I could not find  any download instructions (or any instructions at all for that matter) on or in the packaging initially is that they are on a small card that can easily get stuck inside the inner package box. In my sample, it was not coming out with the DVDs or with a casual shake. I had to about take the packaging apart, as opposed to just opening it. So, check that out if you are in a similar situation and need the download URL.Additionally, the serial number needed for activation is only on the Windows disk envelope. Not a huge issue, but something to know if you are a Mac person - don't go running off with just the Mac disk thinking you have all you need for installation. A second installation detail is that the downloaded folders make it look like you can just drag the PE folder to applications and get going, but it's actually just an installer program (which is the Adobe norm) so you need to be connected to the internet and then run the installer. By the way, downloading the installer itself is about 1.5GB. Not a huge deal if you have a good net connection, but if you have ""standard"" service you may want to let it download and run while you are doing something else for a while. :-)Anyways, I am giving Adobe another star for getting back to me quickly and accurately. Good support! And, I already like the program a lot. If you are coming from 10, like I was, it is quantum leap time!**************************I am sure I will like this latest update to PE after I get a DVD drive to use with my late model MacBook Pro. The last year or two if MBPs do not have optical drives built in so you have to either get an external drive or use one connected via some other Mac that has optical in your network.I will revise my review once I get it loaded. In the meantime, it would have been great to have a download option that I could enter the key on the box (that had the dvd in it) to activate with. Or ship the program on a USB stick.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ML4NPA8KE8XK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GP8XGM#wasThisHelpful","R2ML4NPA8KE8XK","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I had downgraded it because it didn't cover as much area for me as stated on the package. With this bag, however, it does seem to cover its rated area. I used a Scott's drop spreader.

"I really, really like wristwatches. I have reviewed several for Amazon and always enjoy finding out how the watch industry is pushing back against the ongoing erosion of their principle value (telling time) by the smartphone (or even cell phones, for that matter). Principally, there seems to be two ways the watch players market:1. Provide a certain style that is unique to the watch. Watches are thus becoming more and more of a fashion item.2. Provide a functionality that a smartphone would have trouble duplicating. e.g. super ruggedness, certain types of telemetry).The Swiss Legend that I am writing about here has a style that incorporates the outdoors/diver look with a flashy blue color ring which is made of rubber. It is big; really, really big. When I wore it to work, the team had to take a closer look because it is so much larger than the ""normal"" sized Seiko that my daily timekeeper. The black, brushed metal band looks  rugged and also evokes a ""tough"" image. The blue rubber is showy, but not too showy - looks like it is from the current decade. I am told that really big men's watches are ""a thing"" so, this one certainly meets. It is the largest watch I own, and that includes an Invicta diver's chronometer. Anyways, if you like this kind of style, and the look of quality, this is a great watch. It looks like it might actually sell for a few hundred dollars. (street price is actually much less, usually).One negative is that the watch is not only huge, but it weighs a LOT. It feels like the case is a solid chunk of metal. It probably is. I think they could have cut the weight down by a third and nobody would think it was a cheap and light weight unit. It's funny, nobody made so much fun of the size or look, but they all remarked that this is a HEAVY thing to have on one's wrist all day.Functionally, I have to take a star off because it does NOT have instructions to adjust the huge band. If you are at all technically inclined, this is not an obstacle, but you need to have a small slotted (why not Philips head?) screwdriver to pull the links off the band. The instructions recommend that you take the watch to an authorized dealer for this work. Really? Anyways, I was able to size it correctly, but if you are not a handy person, you should budget for this as an issue.The watch has a nice, water tight screw on crown. So, it might actually meet its 100m depth claim, but I didn't test that. It certainly adds to the macho diver aspect.Another odd thing is that although the lettering/numbering on the face is nice and large, the date window is not. I think it should and could be about 2x the size that it is. (OK, maybe 33% bigger would be OK). It gets lost among the other numerals and marks and is hard to see for an old guy w/o classes.The watch is easy to set and runs accurately on its claimed Swiss movement. I checked this out because most movements of ""better than crummy, but not super"" watches are made by a Japanese company called Miyota. All the references to Swiss Legend say it's Swiss. In any case, it sets easily, keeps time well and doesn't feel cheap when you set it.With all the size, weight and such, I would have liked a little more function in the watch, but it's still a nicely done device. I rate it a solid 4.So, overall, I rate this a solid 4","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14XS31AQ00VUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K5F1TU#wasThisHelpful","R14XS31AQ00VUU","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I believe that the unit I received for review is defective. All the online reports for this speaker state that it has great bass range and sound really solid. My unit sounds like the bass speaker (woofer) is not working. The midrange/tweeters appear to be working fine. SO, I should downgrade the Bass Sport to a one but am holding off to see if Nyne will fix the issue. I called the support center first thing this morning (9am). It is six hours later and I have not heard back.Pros:Easy to pair.Controls work great with my iPhone 6The built in microphone works well with Siri, and presumably on normal calls, although I have not tried yet.Cons:The bass appears to be broken. The online support was not helpful (mostly help for BT pairing, which was already OK).  I tried to see if using the Aux wire would be better - it sounded the same.  I adjusted the source (iPhone 6) to full bass EQ and it made no difference. Then tried all the other EQ settings and found that only the treble and midrange EQ had an effect. The iPhone works fine with my other headphones and speakers.The phone support never got back to me.The ""black on black"" keys are hard to see - I'm thinking of painting the raised symbols with white paint or ink.I will update when and if Nyne attempts to resolve the problem. To me, support for a >$100 speaker is one of the reasons you might consider it instead of going cheap.

"I recommend this product, but it does not quite live up to all of its claims.Because I have a fondness for Ahava products, especially their hand cream, I was excited to try their mud mask which claims to deeply clarify and purify your skin. Additionally, the product claims to provide renewed freshness and a smoother complexion. Although itâ€™s difficult to determine whether my skin was deeply clarified and purified, my face did feel fresh which usually happens after I cleanse with a wash cloth. As for a smoother complexion, Iâ€™ve too many age spots and freckles to have a smoother complexion, but my skin did feel smooth and soft after the mud mask. Contributing to the smoothness is probably the gritty material in the mask. Surprisingly, the instructions say to rinse after 2 minutes which probably prevents dryness and the reason why I would recommend this mud mask over others.

"This is a slightly oversized dial watch with simple time and date functionality. The box it comes in is very nicely made and looks like it may have cost at least as much as the watch to make (e.g. heavy construction with a leather like - maybe actual leather - covering, etc.).It looks well made and feels pretty decent on the wrist, although the leather band arrives a bit stiff and will need breaking in. The band hardware is all sturdy looking and functional, and the case is similarly well appointed.I was able to ""hack"" the time of the watch, which makes me happy. One thing I noticed when I was doing this is that the action on the stem is a little ""notchy"" - it's not super smooth. This is typical of the kind of quartz movement inside watches like these, and I don't find it a problem other than to say that although this claims to be a multi-hundred dollar watch, it is not built that way IMHO. The quartz movement inside these watches is typically mass produced by companies like Miyota of Japan. They are reliable and keep good time, but they are not usually ""impressive"" in the feel of the stem action. In fact, the movement is a Miyota 2415, which works well, but is available as a part online for about nine dollars. To give you and idea, the similar Miyota time and date modules for popular men's watches like the Swiss Army line are about fifteen dollars or so. Now, these are single unit prices, so you can bet the Invicta brand group is able to get the movements for a lot less. The key takeaway here is, keeps time, does it at a good value price, is NOT a multi-hundred dollar movement. They put the money into the watch case, the styling, the box it comes in and the watchband. I am not hating on them for that, because it is a nice looking watch. If you don't need the marketing, it's a fifty dollar watch. This is why it sells for so much below list here - the actual cost of goods is not that high. Of course, this is typical of all things fashion - the value is not in the underlying material cost - it's in the image you are working to achieve.The good news about the movement is that it is from a reputable Japanese supplier, it is inexpensive to replace if that should need to be done later, the batteries are commonly available (i.e. 377) and it keeps time. YaySO, I am giving this a net of four stars because it works well (e.g. keeps time) and looks and feels good. I am taking off one star because there is no way they should be talking about this as a $285 watch. It's a very nice $80 watch that would be a good value if it sold for below $50. I would boost up the rating to five stars if the action of the crown was smoother and felt more ""expensive"" instead of the more tinny feeling it has. I would recommend it at the fifty dollar price, should it become available for that and the styling fits your taste.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G6EYENJYRV82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011N5PI02#wasThisHelpful","R1G6EYENJYRV82","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After seeing my ma-in-law's iRobot Roomba in action, I figured I did not need to get a robotic room vac. It just seemed to me like they combined expense with a lack of flexibility and low vacuum power. This Neato D80 has completely turned my attitude around! I've used the heck out of it since it arrived. It was a key partner in helping me clean my son and daughter's rooms up for some guests. Using this little robo-vac, I was able to set it loose to clean the floor on its own while I removed the floor clutter and dusted the next room. It saved much more time than I would have thought previously. Also, it seemed to catch dust, hair and other dirt that our regular vacuum has trouble picking up.First test: My home officeMy home office has a hardwood floor and has about 120 square feet of floor space. The big test here was to see how it handled the thick 3'x5' Persian-style rug that sits on one end of the floor. I would have thought it would stall or get sent off track, but it absolutely handled going on and off the edge between the rug and the floor. The under-carriage raises and lowers as the vacuum comes near low obstructions like this and allows the vac to get over them. Also, it seems to memorize the room such that it can re-orient itself if it gets off track a little when going over obstacles. Oh, and it cleaned a bunch of dust and stuff that I absolutely didn't see before. Brilliant!Second test: Daughter's carpeted roomMy daughter is away at college now, but her dust, hair, etc. apparently still littered the floor of her room, even after the housekeeper went over it with our Kenmore upright direct drive bagless vac. In fact, it was a pretty surprising amount of dirt that the D80 picked up. I believe that part of this is because our housecleaner does not get under some of the obstructions that the D80 does. For instance, the D80 was able to go beneath the closet shoe rack, which has a low clearance. Also, the edge brush seems to do a better job in the corners then our housekeep's attempt to shove the big Kenmore into corners. Both of these factors probably contribute a lot to the difference in performance. In any case, the D80 navigated the bed, chairs and into the closet once I de-cluttered the room's floor. Very nice job. I re-ran the D80 twice to see if it picked up a lot more the second time, and it did not pick up appreciable extra dirt. Yay!Third Test: Son's RoomMy son is now out of the house and working full time in another city, but his stuff is still here, along with his last load of dirt. His room has a hardwood floor, no rugs, but it does have a loft bed with the resulting extra posts on the floor. Bottom line- worked great.This vac does come with an extra filter, extra brush roller, and a handy filter cleaner. You need to clean out the pleated filter that closes one end of the dirt container, and this would be a lot harder without the little comb-shaped filter cleaner too. In any case, I appreciate the extra parts.The vac is easy to use, too. You do not have to do a lot other than read the short intro brochure to use it. i thought the menu system was intuitive and worked well.My conclusion is that this is a fine vacuum and that if you want a robotic vacuum, this is an excellent choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FZTAGTPFGULM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XELDPL8#wasThisHelpful","R2FZTAGTPFGULM","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had to kill a lot of rats over the years. After having checked out many variations of traps, poisons, repellents, etc., I've become partial to the good old Victor wooden rat trap. So, when I had a chance to check out this new one - literally, a ""better rat trap"" - I was skeptical. This skepticism was quickly banished when I tried it out and bagged a big rat on the first use. These things are great and seem to trigger and kill more surely than my standby ""rev 01, Mod 00"" Victors. They are also easier to bait, set and then empty when sprung.Baiting: I had learned to modify my old traps to out a small cup of duct tape on the trigger to hold the bait. This forced the rats to more fully commit to the trap to get the bait. The new trap has a plastic bait cup already in place. I put some peanut butter and while peanuts in it with a lot less fuss than before.Trigger plate: the new design surrounds the bait cup with a trigger plate instead of having the bait holder and trigger combined. In the old design it was possible for a smart rat to carefully pick out the hair without triggering the trap. The new design forces the rat to step on the trigger to reach the bait. This seems to provide a much surer kill.Easy setting: the wire lever bar that you press to set the trap is MUCH easier to use than the old design. I can do it one handed. This is safer, because you never have to touch or get in the way of the kill bar.Easy release: using the one handed setting lever design, I was able to release the dead rat into the bag I was holding under it with my other hand. Also, I didn't have to get my hand close to the soiled prt of the trap. Sweet!I am making these my number one recommended trap. My next trap purchase, it's gonna be these. They cost more, but they're worth it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J2SAN9NS4BYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AH3DNS#wasThisHelpful","R2J2SAN9NS4BYN","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are a ""value"" level on-ear headphone. They are not particularly expensive, sound OK and have a working basic function microphone if you need to be able to talk on your cell phone while listening to tunes at work. They don't look or feel bad, but are clearly not a ""premium grade"" set upon close inspection.I compared these to my other on/over ear headphones (Bose QC 15) which is not a fair fight, but then again it's not like the Bose are ""audiophile"" gear, either. Not counting the noise isolation feature, and just the sound, these are listenable and sound better than Apple earbuds in most cases. Since many of you may have heard the Bose before, or are able to go to a local store and listen to them, I am including them in this review for reference.Pros:+ Good bass response.+ Satisfactory treble response (but not super stellar).+ Fold flat+ Built-in microphone in the cord and an integrated single button control for starting and stopping song playback or for beginning or ending calls.  - There is no built-in volume control.+ Microphone is legible (but not super high fidelity or anything - not as good as iPhone bud mic).+ Ear and head pads are decent, mid-grade pads. They feel comfortable for the price range.+ These are not sound canceling, but the sound isolation they give me is good enough for the office environment. It helps me keep out the chatter in our open office environment and does not let enough sound out to disturb the neighbors.Not so Good- The mid to high end frequency response is not so clear. I compared the sound to my Bose QC15, and the Panasonic are not even close to the definition and clarity. They are also about one tenth the price.- The amount of time I can wear these is about half the amount of time I can wear my Bose due to the pads and general fit. It's not bad, but the ear pads in particular are about half as soft and supple as my Bose, best case. Once again, good value, but not to be confused with higher end phones. Your mileage may vary, but these are a one or two hour headphone for me, and not a ""fly across the Pacific"" level of comfort.- The plug is right angle and does not extend far enough to clear some cases. For instance, I have an Otterbox Extender, battery backed case. The earphone access hole is too deep for the Panasonic plug to go through so I have to use an extender for the plug. I am including a photo of the plug end with a ruler to show how little case clearance it provides. They should have followed the Apple lead on this and made a skinny, straight body plug cover instead of the right angle one with tiny clearance. As it is, if you have a cover for your phone it is unlikely that this plug will fit all the way through it.ConclusionThese are a good, inexpensive over ear headphone. I would recommend them for decent listening on a budget or to let your kids use them. In the latter case, the bass response is good enough for most of them (I think) and the price is low enough you won't care so much when they lose or destroy them. They seem durable and they look good, too. If your budget won't allow you to pay more than $50 for a set of headphones, consider these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU32Q1VONVD6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVERQKO#wasThisHelpful","RU32Q1VONVD6B","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first time I have tried this style of coconut syrup. In the past, I have had coconut flavored,syrupy, pancake/waffle toppings, but not a product like this one that is apparently rendered from coconut sugars. They don't really say exactly on the table, which lists the ingredients as ""organic coconut syrup"".I would say that in general, I liked it, but don't love it. The syrup pretty much looks like classic ""maple syrup"" but has a taste that is somewhat different. The predominant flavor to me was the strong caramel taste. It is sweet and caramel, but I didn't taste so much of the ""buttery"" taste that the product description mentions. I compared it to some other toppings on my Belgian waffles and found it to be a solid contender. However, it is not a new ""must have"" topping for my starchy breakfast days.The bottle is convenient and the flip top stop works well. The inner seal was harder to remove than I would have thought it should be. I had to  work on the edges of the seal with my fingernails as well as using the provided pull tab.Overall, my family felt about the same way about it. Would definitely eat it if sitting next to the waffles or pancakes. If we run out, nobody is going to beg for more.

"I have mounted this industrial-strength fan in my garage to keep myself cool while doing projects during the summer and to help blow wood dust from sanding away from my work. In my experience so far, it is a great choice for this kind of use and all the parts seem heavy duty - I expect it to last a long time. In  fact, I would say that once installed, it is a five star unit, but the installation takes away a bit, especially if you are not experienced in assembling and installing this sort of equipment.The Good:* The fan came well packed and had no shipping damage.* Not only were all parts included and in good shape, but there were some extra pieces that are not mentioned in the instructions or description.  * Safety cable to guard against the mounting base or its attachment to the fan failing.  * Safety cable clamps (2pcs) so that you can clamp the ends of the cable where you need them. Much easier than a swage fitting - they use nuts and bolts.  * A cotter pin for retaining the large bolt that joins the fan to the mount.* When installed, the operatioon is very smooth. The fan has no vibration, the control has no dead spots.* It pushes a lot of air when you need it to and can also be easily regulated to a very gentle breeze.* All pieces feel like they are well made and of high quality.* The fit and finish is very good - did not need to trim or modify anything, which was a pleasant surprise.* The cords for power and the controller are both long enough to be useful.* The mount not only is very sturdy and made of heavy gauge steel, but it comes with the necessary lag screws for mounting to wood beams.The Not So Good:* Instructions. The instructioons are well written, but the assembly diagrams are so tiny that they are very hard to see. In order to understand them you pretty much need to stare at the actual parts and the written instruction while ignoring the diagrams because they are too small.* The instructions do not say what to do with the cable and cable clamps.* There is a step where you have to insert a large screwdriver in between the front and back fan guard cages to force them together, which would likely chip the paint if you did it that way. I used a plastic car interior pry bar to avoid this. It seems like they couuld have made this part of the design a little better. It is far from a deal killer, but it did make assembly harder than it could be otherwise.* The instructions call out torque settings for all of the nuts and bolts. I think it would be hard to access several of the nuts with a torque wrench. I ended up just guessing because I could not get my torque wrench to fit in the spaces with all the nuts and bolts. I ended up just making them all ""tight"". Now, this is not a huge deal, but it could be confusing for some. Also, if you need to get a torque wrennch on some of these nut/bolts it would have been great if they had made access just a bit better.* It would be nice to have just a bit more range in the tilt of the fan. It's OK, but it would be better if there was more vertical adjustemnt.I have included photos of the above issues. All that said, it''s excellent and I'm happy and more comfortable, having it in my garage this summer.

"This is the first plug cutter I've owned. Over the last thirty years of hobby level woodworking I have always used ready made plugs or caps when the need arose to cover a countersunk screw. My last project, an outdoor bench. required fifty or so plugs to match the rest of the quarter sawn cedar it's made from. I didn't even bother looking for plugs and found this CMT cutter here on Amazon. I read the other reviews and decided that having more waste in the cuts was better than having bad cuts to begin with. Glad I made that choice!CMT has a pretty good overall reputation and this relatiely inexpensive cutter should add to it. Althouugh the packaging says it is made in China instead of Italy as most of their other bits are, the quality was as good as I would have expected. It was well packaged and super sharp out of the plastic. After cleaning it up with a rag and some WD, I chucked it up in my old Delta 17-900 drill press and went to work. I set the RPM to the package recommendation and started cutting plugs. The cutter is designed to be used with a thin board laid flat on the drill press table (with proper backing board on top, of course :-). I was making half inch thick plugs by cutting all the way through a resawn board. As you cut each plug, you do NOT have to remove it when it is done. Cutting the next plug will push it out through the slot in the middle of the cuttter body. Thus, when cutting a series of plugs, the only one you should have to remove manually is the last one.I cranked out the fifty plugs I needed as well as a bunch of spares in fifteen or twenty minutes once I was set up. It is actually kind of fun in itself and the cedar plugs were very clean. They were also precise - withing a few mils using my digital calipers. I would guess that with the soft and spongy wood I was using, a few mils is as good as can be done because it compresses and rebounds easily. Perhaps maple plugs would be about dead on. In any case, the plugs fit perfectly in my project and I'm a happy guy with some impressive results to report.I don't know if there are better plug cutters, but if there are it would be immaterial to me because this one is so far above the bar I would not bother with the others!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R218BLZVMDA49O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P4NNN2#wasThisHelpful","R218BLZVMDA49O","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the slickest non-stick pan we've had, and we've had many. For cooking dishes like fried rice, we can cut our use of oil or grease down by more than half. In fact, if we use the normal amount of oil for our previous pans, there is too much oil left on the food because it doesn't stick to the pan as much as it does the rice. The rice doesn't stick at all.I fried some sausage in it and they also don't stick to the surface at all. In fact, if you normally count on having a litttle friction on the bottom of the frying pan to help roll sausages around to cook all sides, this pan will require an adjustment in your style because it is so slippery compared to others. Whatever we cook with it comes out great and has the easiest cleanup we've seen in a while.We did attempt to make crepes the other day, and although the surface is great, the shape of the sides of the pan is not quite right for that. They are too steep and don't allow you to ""angle in"" to the edge of the crepe to flip it or remove it easily. For this we remove one star. This might not affect every cook, but we would have appreciated a slightly shallower side angle.The handle is comfortable to use and does not seem to get hot. It is also a brushed finish that gives you a good grip even when it has a spot of grease on it. This is much better than some others that have pretty, shiny handles that tend to require a serious grip to keep them from turning in your hand.The body of the pan is nicely finished on the outside and is made of thick aluminum. It spreads heat nicely. Additionally, the bottom of the pan is flat and does not rock around on the burner or countertop. The overall workmanship appears to be just great.If you care about this sort of thing, the packaging does say the pan is made in China. I would say that the quality is world-class, however, and you need to look at the origin mark to notice that it is from China. As I write above, no quality issues. Looks, works and feels great.If you don't need to edge crepes or pancakes off the bottom of your pan, and don't typically bake in it (e.g. ""Dutch/German panckages"") this is a five star pan. In fact, this is one of those cases where I wish we had half star resolution so I could give it a 4.5 star rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27XPJNQ84Y6ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C3XVR0E#wasThisHelpful","R27XPJNQ84Y6ZJ","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son helped out on this review. He used the pan to fry a variety of items on his small apartment stove where he lives in NYC. Overall, he really likes the pan and has no hesitation to give it a solid four star rating. He was considering 5 stars, but can't quite get himself to go to that level.He likes the non-stick finish, which seems to be superior to Teflon coated pans he's tried. It is super slippery and allows him to use less oil or grease. This is part of the pan's sales pitch, and it seems to be true.He likes the nice sturdy handle. It is easy to grip and does not really weigh the pan down.He likes the weight of the pan - substantial yet does not feel like it is an exercise just to lift it up.It cooks well, providing even heat.Overall, we give it a solid four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LM14ZXC0VU0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV666I2#wasThisHelpful","R1LM14ZXC0VU0L","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always liked Belkin branded cables because they are higher than average quality, ruggedness and have some amount of thought put into their design and marketing. This four foot cable is no exception. It works as advertised and does both data communication for syncing and is heavy duty enough to run a full speed, 2.4A charge for iPads and other Lightning ported devices that can use higher current.Pros:1. Works to both charge and sync my iPhone 6 as well as  my iPad mini 3.2. The 4 foot length is perfect for use to plug into my charger on the wall and the nightstand near my bed. Same with my desk.3. The fabric covered cable does not tangle easily and wraps nicely when I want to put it away.4. The gold colored unit I received complaints my gold iPhone 4.5. The connector covers at each end are fairly compact - almost as much so as the Apple original.

"I bought this form my wife's new iPhone 6+. I already had an iPhone 6 with an Otterbox Defender case. This left me sold on the protective ability and overall quality of Otterbox, but it turns out I really disliked a few of the features of the Defender (hard to scan finger sensor, built in less than great screen protector, seals that you have to move to use the ports, etc.). I knew these would make for a bunch of unhappy wife moments, so I decided that for her use it would be better to give up a bit of protection for the phone in favor of ease of use. To me, the Commuter hits this on the head. It eliminates the annoying ""mil-spec"" features of the Defender and still protects the phone. Additionally, it does not make the phone too thick to comfortably handle. And, since it does NOT have a built in screen protector, you can choose a replaceable, high quality screen protector that you can actually replace if it sacrifices itself to save your phone. Additionally, there is sufficient clearance around the home button/fingerprint sensor to allow ease of use.If you don't need the extreme protection and dust seals of the Defender, I heartily recommend this case - no complaints from the user!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF76VQB0YS883/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N28AUK2#wasThisHelpful","RF76VQB0YS883","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the last few years, I have put on my share of screen protector products. It started with the Palm Pilot devices (remember those?) and now on to my latest toy - the iPad Mini 3. I've done good jobs and bad, but by now I would rate myself as pretty competent at getting a bubble free protector application done. That said, the Tech Armor screen protector products, including this one, have become my favorites. This is because they make it relatively easy to do a nearly invisible screen protector application.First, the instructions are well written and there are great supplements online.Second, the protective film that covers the screen protector product is well labeled so that you can identify which part to pull off first and which side faces the screen, etc.Third, the quality is high. After getting the protector in place, I really like the feel of the TA products on my fingers. I don't ""baby"" my iDevices, so the screen protectors are often called upon to actually protect. Unlike some others I've used, the TA products do not easily scratch or abrade. They are very, very clear, and still allow great sensitivity on the touch screen.Adding to all the above, the pricing on Amazon has been good, and you get multiple pieces of protector with each kit (as well as cleaner cloth and smoother). Solid value for the money even if it were not so totally better than the no-name brands.There are a lot of screen protectors out there, but when asked (I am my tribe's tech-nerd) I always recommend Tech Armor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HX9IPLDLK9IH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009QQMEEY#wasThisHelpful","R1HX9IPLDLK9IH","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I asked my acne-prone son to try these out and see if they helped the face on his skin. His summary pronouncement is that he likes the Proactiv+ product and felt that it helped reduce the number and severity of existing blemishes on his face. It did lighten some of the darkness and scarring on those blemishes, but it was not a ""miracle"" cure. He has used many other similar products (e.g. Acne Free, etc.) and says that this one would be in the top group. That said, he also would probably not buy them at their nominal price of over forty dollars for 15 pads. He would be interested if they were about half that. If they cost fifteen dollars a package (one dollar a pad) he would definitely buy them.Other than that, they are pleasant to use as well as convenient. And, once again, they did have a noticeable benefit for his tough acne issues. It would have been a five star product except when considering cost and the shortfall, in his opinion, of the skin lightening effect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DVN61JA5YLIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UTCUPZE#wasThisHelpful","R3DVN61JA5YLIM","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would not have thought that a mono speaker system would be all that useful to me, but this one is actually very interesting and useful for working out in the yard, the garage or cleaning up the kid's rooms while listening to my iPhone. In all cases, I could just put on some headphones, but when working in the yard under the sun, or in the garage with the occasional need to put on my face and hearing protection, it's easier to just have a speaker. I'm also not usually doing critical music listening at those times - usually podcasts or background music. So, that is the use that I have for a speaker like this one.The speaker I actually received for review looked much different than the one in the product description. I think it is a different model, actually. I have attached a photo to this review that shows it is clearly more compact, and is colored white and black.I was easily able to pair the speaker with my iPhone 6. The unit comes partially charged (it has a built in battery) so I didn't have to plug it in to get started. I have a test for BT pairing. If I need to use the manual, it is too complex. Out of every ten BT items that I check out, maybe one of them ends up needing a trip to the manual in order to get pairing going. I evaluate a fair number of units, so your experience may differ, but in my estimation this unit is on the easy side for pairing. This is common to a lot of ""one way"" BT devices where you are just sending an audio stream from your phone, pod, pc, or whatever since there is no real need for passwords (the data is just going out and there is no reverse stream into the device).In order to keep the device compact and packable, the ends of the unit collapse into the middle and reduce the height of it by about half. Additionally, the instructions, and my actual listening, show that the bass response of the speaker is much better with the ends extended. That said, it still functions fine with the ends collapsed. With the ends extended I rate the sound as ""better than a transistor radio of old"". When the ends are retracted, I call it ""the same as a transistor radio of old"". Or, perhaps better in each case since we don't have to worry about radio reception from a distant or variable source. The BT signal reception was clean when sourced from my iPhone 6 up to the rated 30' clear distance.The controls are simple. there is an off/on switch that also selects between a wired audio connection and BT. There is a separate ""pairing"" button that is used for first time connection to your device. There are two hardware connectors on the unit - an audio in port for a 1/8"" mini jack cable and a micro USB connector for charging the internal battery.The speaker comes with a handy strap/cord that I used hang it from in the garage and kitchen. I found that this yielded the best sound output vs. setting on a counter or other flat surface. If you want to optimize the sound a little bit, you can experiment with turning the speaker direction and stabilizing it with whatever McGyver-esque contraption you want to come with. In general, I decided that this was not the point of this unit, however. The goal is to provide better and more powerful sound for your phone when you are away from better sound systems, and it does this well.Overall, I like this speaker and continue to use it. I would like it better if it were the black or charcoal color all through as shown in the product photo. This is especially true of the grill, which is white painted metal. I also think it would be good if the hard white plastic midsection of the device I received could be available in other colors and that it would also be beneficial to have the middle have a bit more of a ""grippy"" texture. These are very minor issues to me, however.So, why not a five star? I guess it comes down to the few issues above, albeit minor as they are, and the fact that I just like the speaker, I don't love it. Not quantifiable, but that is it. I have Apple products in part because they possess a certain design style, and this speaker does not support that, really. It has a sort of ""the engineers felt they were done"" look, and although that is not hatable, it is not lovable to me, either. If you find it on super sale, though, I think you'll be happy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B82HYHS3169Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTDDAMC#wasThisHelpful","R2B82HYHS3169Y","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before receiving this steam mop as an evaluation item, my wife and I had not considered getting one. We have been blessed by being able to have a housecleaner come in once a week and mop the kitchen floor, which is vinyl. Although the floor is ""clean"" when she is done, I had a theory that ""steam cleaning"" would remove some dirt that mopping with detergent could not reach.To test this, I used the steam mop after the most recent visit by our house cleaner. Our kitchen floor is almost twenty years old, so there are some spots of surface wear that remain dirty looking even after normal mopping and/or scrubbing. The steam mop did not change the appearance of these spots and areas. It did do a good job of picking up a bit more dirt than the normal weekly cleaning. I am posting some photos that show the rough floor before and after as well as the floor mop itself after steam cleaning the entire kitchen floor.To sum up this test, the floor didn't look a lot cleaner when done, but the mop did show that dirt had been picked up. It probably has a bit more dirt than would be expected because there was a lapse between when the initial cleaning had happened and when the steam cleaning was done, but I did take a look at the mop mid process after cleaning non-trafficked areas. It does pick up a little extra dirt. Now, this may make me seem like a slacker, but the results didn't make me feel like this is a must have item at this point. If you have toddlers on the floor, maybe, but we are two middle age folks whose kidsOK, so far so good.The next thing to look at is how the mop itself picks up the dirt. I have included a photo that shows the mop after all the cleaning. It really concentrates the dirt in the middle near the steam port. Perhaps this is not a super critical issue, but since you can't really wring the mop out mid-job very easily (my version of easy does not include removing a dirty, velcro attached mop head, washing it out somewhere and re-attaching it) I think it would be great if the mop applied pressure and steam in a more distributed pattern that essentially spreads the dirt pickup on the mop more, thus increasing its capacity. This may not be a deal-killer, but I just thought it was not what I would have expected.On a more general note, although I have not had it long enough to speak to durability, the unit seems to be fairly well made. It is a compromise between durability and weight, it seems, so by no means would I call it ""rugged"", but it does not seem fragile. The assembly took about 10 minutes out of the box, but this was mainly because there are two sub-boxes and a lot of parts included. You need to pull this stuff out and sort it. I would say this took up more than half the time. The actual assembly just takes a couple minutes. You click in the handle, the mop head frame and then cover that frame with the mop. The electrical cord is heavy duty and a nice length that can wrap around the hooks on the handle. A nice Velcroâ„¢ strip comes with the cord, but it was inexplicably unattached to the cord itself. There is a small loop in the material that is supposed to be fused around the cord, but it was just fused to itself and thus the strip remained loose after un-doing the cord wrap. Not a deal-killer, but an odd thing to put in a heavy duty Velcroâ„¢ strip and then waste it. You would expect to use this to bundle the cord if you use the mop as a hand-held steamer.If you are still with me, my next test will be to use the hand wand and mop on my barbecue. This will come later as I need to get the unit greasy again. Although I am not valuing the floor experience so much, I have a theory that this will be the miracle tool to remove grease from our stainless steel BBQ and the range hood in the kitchen. I will amend the report when this is done.Conclusion: This seems to be an OK steam mop. It has a few issues as noted above, but not killer ones. My rating reflects my lack of enthusiasm for steam mops in general as much as it does for this one in particular.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7TGD6B97N17X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLAVM02#wasThisHelpful","R7TGD6B97N17X","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I had just started working a few decades back, I had thought that Social Security was a long, long ways off and that it would already be bankrupt by the time I would need it. Wrong, wrong, wrong. I lived that long and iso did SS. When I had a chance to review this book, I thought it would be helpful to strategize my exit from the active workforce in a couple years. This has proven to be true.Like all ""Dummies"" books, this one is logically divided into topical sections that allow you to pick and choose which sections to read and when, rather than forcing you to read all of it in sequence. I chose to work on the aforementioned timing of retirement strategy. The section on this topic can show you how to avoid losing more than 30% opportunity of you do it wrong. It also has clear explanations about survivor benefits and how to maximize your return.Overall, i highly recommend this book if you are about 60 and need to look ahead to the next few years. you will reach eligibility in the next two years and depending on your situation it may or may not make sense to start collecting. this book and its tables will show you what to do.I heartily recommend this book","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ADFRX6RAVG6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118967569#wasThisHelpful","R2ADFRX6RAVG6C","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my favorite hand cream! There are a lot of assorted hand creams on the market, but the Ahava brand has had my vote as the one to get for the last 16 or so years that I have been aware of it. It originated in Israel and really does use ""minerals from the Dead Sea"". Whatever actually goes into it, it has always seemed to help heal my skin as well as keep it moist and pliable. It does this without making my fingers greasy feeling or causing me to leave smudges all over any shiny surface. This ""Water"" version seems as good as the rest of the variations I've tried, and comes in an assortment of different sizes. This one is a smaller ""travel"" size that is within the TSA rules for liquids carried aboard aircraft.In addition to keeping my hands, which I wash a lot due my hobbies of woodworking and gardening, Ahava has been helpful in soothing body rash that I occasionally get from the heat or allergies. I can often use it in place of over-the-counter hydrocortisone products. Your reaction may be different, but I think it is a good trade-off to be able to use something like this cream vs. hydro if you can (hydrocortisone can cause problems if you use it too much), so I always try to remedy skin issues with Ahava first, before moving on to ""medicines"".Finally, if you are a manly man, like myself, you will like the fact that the packaging is not too flashy or feminine and the scent is relatively neutral.

"My big test of this unit was to see if would reduce the amount of pollen in the air in our home. We have had a very tough allergy season this year and both my wife and I have struggled with sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, etc.The unit came packaged very nicely in a doubled cardboard container with nicely made foam pads in each end. It was undamaged and easy to remove. All the elements of the packaging will go in my recycle bin.It installed easily with one small exception. The unit comes installed in the unit, but it is not removed from its protective packaging. The instructions/installation guide make no mention of this. I noticed it when I turned the unit on and found that the output was very weak at any setting. The good news here is that I found that the filter door at the rear of the unit is easy to remove, the filter packaging comes off easily once you know you have to do it, and the re-installation process is not at all challenging. It's just an odd omission to not inform the user that the filter needs to be removed from its packaging while the instructions DO have lots of lawyer crap informing me of all sorts of ridiculous or inapplicable cautions from the company's indemnity boiler plate.In use, the unit works very nicely. I put it on about halfway and let it run for an hour using the timer feature just before going to bed. It is not loud at that setting, so I can sleep with it as ""white noise"". It would be a bit too loud for me to do this at the full setting. The controls all work well and are easy to understand, which is good because the instructions are not very detailed.This brings me to another gripe about the instructions. I can guess what the ionizer and the UV functions are supposed to do, but I'd rather have a bit of instruction about their deployment. The instructions don't really do that. They just say how to turn the functions on and off. The web page for the product has some hints, but since they went to the trouble of creating a paper manual, why not include fifty words each on the two interesting functions? For instance, why or when would you use each one? Does it preserve or tax the filter more? etc. None of that is available.The only real functional issue for me, other than the instructions, is that the timer function has a granularity of one hour. I think that is a bit coarse and would like to have it be something more like fifteen or thirty minutes. This isn't a killer issue, but I think that it feels like an oversight since the controller seems like it would easily have the smarts to add that flexibility.By the way, it did help to clean the pollen out of the air in our bedroom and give us a better sleep.In the end, it would have been five stars, but since the instructions are funky and the timer only gives me hours, I am taking off one star, but would still recommend this to anyone looking for this level of air filtering appliance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13DJHWRU9MXY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBJ8PDQ#wasThisHelpful","R13DJHWRU9MXY2","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a pretty good selection of hand tools in my home arsenal. In addition to the usual selection of shears, I have sets of metal snips (L, R and S), diagonal cutters, end cutters, bolt cutters, etc. So, when I had the opportunity to review these Wiss multi-purpose shears, I was actually a bit hesitant to add one more thing to the tool box. I am glad I decided to do so.I tried cutting a variety of materials with these shears. One of the ,most treacherous, IMHO, are those heavy duty plastiic fruity holders from Costco. They are big, thick, and take up too much room in the recycle bin. I have previously cut them with a utility knife or scissors, but using the Wiss shears feels way more secure and seems to keep the sharp edges of the plastic away from my hands better. The compound cutting leverage really makes even the reinforced or folded parts of the plastic cut easily.Another test was to take a coat hangar wire and make a bunch of cuts and bends in it. I used both the bending holes and the wire cutter feature for this test. The bender works well and allowed me to both straighten the coat hangar (I personally think this is a difficult test vs. curving wire) and make some bends for S-hooks. The one slight fault I would give the bending holds in this task is that the edges of the holes are sharp enough to nick the wire a bit. Keep in mind, these are steel coat hangars, so copper wire would get more nicked. I think a very slight relief of the sharp edges with a small dremel grinding stone will take care of it. The cutting was totally easy and the steel wire did not damage or dull the cutter edges. The compound grips made it very easy.One fault of shop shears is that they tend to be good at cutting heavy material, but not thin or flimsy sheets of material like cloth or paper. These had no trouble at that end of the spectrum. I even cut some loose thread at the end of the shop towel with no issue.There is a neutral issue you should be aware of - these are pretty big shears if you have petite hands. I take a men's medium glove but have relatively short fingers compared to other guys my build (5'7"" 180b, bench press 220#) which I would call slightly more than medium (YMMV). I think if you have smaller hands than mine, these would be fatiguing to use for a long time because the handles would be too big. They are, however, well designed for a cushion grip if they fit. The lock works well to keep them closed and compact when not in use.There is one small defect - smell. These are made in China (what isn't?) and although they seem to be made to high standards of fit and finish, the rubber used in the handles has the characteristic ""Harbor Freight rubber"" smell. I you are a tool person, you know what I mean. A strong solvent smell that is standard with HF tools. It has weakened by about half in the five days I've had them out of the plastic packaging, but is still present. I'm OK with it, but I know that some other folks are more sensitive than me and you'd want to know about it. For this, the plastic packaging that you would want these shears to use to open and the too sharp bending hole, I remove one star.In conclusion, I like this tool and will move my metal snips lower in the ""grab"" order. They are more versatile and seem to work better in general, which is an unexpectedly good combo. I would definitely recommend these to someone looking for these capabilities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T81R2BEXKSJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDT5PL0#wasThisHelpful","R3T81R2BEXKSJF","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A great place to put your ""elevator pitch""I've always found that explaining the business of my company ends up involving drawing on napkins, hand motions and too-detailed discussions. Some of it would just be a lot easier if I had a small drawing ready to show. Maybe a few drawings and a photo or two. These cards are perfect for that. They give me enough room to put the normal business card information in decent sized type, add a QR code, and then three sides of elevator pitch. I can also put in one side that has my name in big letters so I can slip it into a name card holder at conventions. All with one card.

"We received this item as a Vine reviewer and gave it a good run to check it out.My wife and I are ""Asians of modest height"" and have to get chairs to reach the upper shelves in our kitchen and other places in our home. Also, when reaching behind, underneath or around furniture to get fallen items, our relatively short arms are challenged to get there and back. Now that we have the ""PikStik"" most of these problems are easily solved. We particularly like the following features:1. The rubber jaws are grippy and have enough spring in them that we can grab relatively delicate items and not crush them, but still hold them securely.2. The jaws rotate and lock securely at two positions, 90° from each other. This gives a lot of flexibility at to how we grip the stick and squeeze the trigger.3. It is well made and sturdy enough for our use. The heavy duty plastic grip and handle go well with the aluminum shaft to provide strength without excessive weight.4. It has a hangar hole so we can put it up on the wall next to our broom, dustpan, etc.No real negatives at all.

"This unit replaces an RCA brand #WP2UWR that had only one AC outlet and two USB plugs. Compared to that device, this one is a clear winner.Pros:1. No hum or whine from the internal circuits. The RCA, as well as other combo units I've experienced, makes a humming/whining noise that is noticeable and bothersome to me. This RND power station is quiet.2. Two AC as well as two USB outlets. This is greater capacity, and that is not counting the pull-out micro USB plug.3. This RND station is compact as stated in its description. It is compact enough that it leaves one of the two plugs on the wall plate open for other use (unlike the RCA and others), thus giving up to three AC plugs off the same wall plate in addition to the 2 + 1 USB.4. Looks like it is well built.5. The micro USB pigtail can be neatly stored when not in use. Part of the overall clever design.6. The AC plugs on the back are interchangeable, presumably for international AC use. (Although, it does not come with any plug other than US).7. 2.4 Amp is better capacity than the usual 2.1 Amp found on other similar units.8. Has  little ledge on top to hold a cell phone while it is charging.Cons1. I would have appreciated a micro USB to Apple lightning converter, but this is a minor complaint and I would not take off a star for it.2. The unit secures to the wall socket by plug friction alone, so you need to support it with one hand while removing any AC plug from it to keep the whole unit from pulling off of the wall. Once again, i don't think this was in the design spec and it's not a big hassle, but would have been nice to have a screw to hold it onto the wall plate.SummaryThe RND Compact Power Station now owns our kitchen wall socket near the phone!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YRK5BM4ZSPUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTME78M#wasThisHelpful","R2YRK5BM4ZSPUX","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I make a lot of PowerPoint presentations for my job. Additionally, our small company does not have enough money to pay for outside video production, so I produce our short demo and product vids - to low standards. I had hoped that this book would give me some pointers to improve my work, and, actually, that is not what it is really for. Writing for Visual Media looks like it was written to be the textbook for a college level overview course.Virtually all topics regarding writing for all visual media types from film and video to web pages and mobile devices are covered at some level of depth. It's over 400 pages of dense text describing how to architect stories for commercials, movies, corporate pieces, ads, web pages, etc. It gives you a suggested method to construct stories for various types of media and messaging. There are chapters for each media type that lay out a path to get our story line and find a suitable construct.I found the text to be solidly written and arranged in a way that made sense once I started reading it. Also, the different media types are addressed in separate chapters, so you do not have to read the entire book to receive some benefit.I would be somewhat critical of the lack of graphics in the book. There are a few diagrams and photos, with the emphasis on few. I think it could have benefitted by including a few sample story boards, and more diagrams and flowcharts than it has.This is not a casually approachable book, but a good reference for crafting text for visual media. You will have to spend time with it to benefit, but depending on the depth you want to get to, it could be worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2975FB6BEC62L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0415815851#wasThisHelpful","R2975FB6BEC62L","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a slightly more deluxe than average USB 3.0 hub. It performs well so far, and the things I like about it include:* It uses a switching power supply, which means it is much more energy efficient than a cheaper analog supply. Of course, if it was a poorly made switcher, it would hum and introduce noise, but this one is quiet and has sufficiently high capacity to power the peripherals I plugged into the hub.* There is a power switch on the hub so I can easily power it down when away from my desk. Since the above power supply is a switcher, powering down the hub also powers down the supply and reduces power consumption to near zero.* The transfers are appropriately fast as I would expect, although I admit I didn't do a rigorous test. My laptop is older and I have a PCIE34 card in the side to get it to perform with USB 3.0. (Macbook pro, circa 2008/9).* The hub and power supply are black and look good.* The LED pilot light is not too bright or obnoxious. It comes on when the power is on and off otherwise.

"My wife likes to use reading glasses for close up work (reading, nails, computer, etc.) when she is wearing her contact lenses. I asked her to test these Foster Grants (a brand from my childhood - a few years ago ....) when they came up in my Vine queue.Overall, she really likes these relatively high-end, non-prescription reading glasses. The highlights are:* She really likes the look and the apparent quality versus cheaper drugstore models.* The lenses are clear and do not have wavy distortions of any kind. They do not stress her eyes.* The frames have spring loaded hinges to keep them from being damaged if the earpieces are flexed out, as happens when you take glasses off quickly.* She tested them doing a variety of close hand-work such as painting nails, reading books, the laptop, and her iPod Touch's tiny screen. No problem - these are an enabler.* Although it is implied above, they are comfortable and she can wear them for a long time without fatigue.Be aware of:These samples were rated at +2.75 diopter. She would normally only use +1.25 to +1.5 power reading glasses. Her input is that although these were fine, if she had her choice she would get these in the correct diopter. You should check that out before you buy and make sure you get the correct power of lenses.Conclusion:These are now my wife's best reading glasses.

"I've been a Nespresso fan for years. Our family first encountered Nespresso during a trip to Europe back in 2010 and have had a machine and the OEM capsules ever since. Despite the big lead of K-cups in the US, it seems that Nespresso has become more and more available (the machines were at Costco this Christmas!). The capsules were always the expensive, but great, OEM, however. Now, I had a chance to test a less expensive alternative to the Nespresso (What I keep calling OEM) capsules.The Aldecoa ""Intense"" capsules taste more like a ""6"" to me rather than an ""8"". That's not bad, but it is not quite as fully intense as I would have expected. The flavor is more like the dark or strong ratings you come across in K-cups. The crema on top is much better than a premium K, but not what I have come to expect from Nespresso. It just doesn't have that fully smooth and satisfying fullness. All that said, it is not hateful. It is still better than most of my K-cup experiences. It's just not as good as Nespresso (I realize there are lots of Nespresso choices - I've had most of them), and feels like ""less for less $"". That said, I will still drink all 40 of the sample I was given. It's ""good enough"" to drink.The material that capsules are made of is some sort of plastic vs. the metal construction of the Nespresso. The good about this is that they don't dent from casual fumbling or dropping on to a hard surface. They seem to give a tighter fit in the machine when closing the chamber, which is a neutral for me, but could be a negative for others. The cardboard box the capsules come in is a plus for me because it is far easier to keep on a shelf than the Nespresso tubes. Additionally, there is no need to slide the capsules down the tube, which is how I end up fumbling and dropping them. So, packaging is a plus.When the capsules are brewing in the machine, there are some differences that may or may not explain some of the way the coffee comes out. The OEM brew typically takes longer than these (maybe 1.5x as long?) and has a period of 10-15 seconds at the end where there are a bunch of drips coming off the spout into the brew cup. These Aldecoas do not do that. They brew relatively quickly and then cut off cleanly. This may seem like a plus (brews faster and cleaner at the end), but I think it is why the crema is not well formed.SO, in the end, I would consider these if they are available at half price vs. the OEM and drink them as a ""goes with food"" option for coffee. I would also use them in espresso mixed drinks where the coffee is not standing on its own so much. For a more satisfying espresso experience, I would still go with the many Nespresso flavors and deluxe aroma, crema, etc. This is not a direct replacement for that premium priced experience, which, I am reminded, is still a lot less expensive than going to Starbucks :-)","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28RE2NE4I4YS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLDPQUG#wasThisHelpful","R28RE2NE4I4YS4","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update 1/26/15Had some more folks taste this sauce and came up with some other attributes. I thought it was important to get some opinion from folks who have more snack counter nachos than I do.* Guest tasters liked the smooth texture of the sauce. They thought that it really was superior to other more ""gloppy"" or chunky sauces that they had had.* One commented that it didn't have that ""canned"" taste that many snack counter versions have.* The thickness of this sauce is a little less than some others and this was viewed as a real plus for getting it successfully on to a chip and into ones mouth.* It does not become glue like after sitting for a couple minutes.* Many disagreed with the the ""bland"" judgment and said it was more cheesy than I had thought. BTW, I tend to favor really strong flavors, so this is not surprising to me.* We served it with other condiments - Pace Picante sauce (medium), Stagg's chili. It went fast.* I forgot to mention in the original review that there is a sticker on the top to help you pull the lid off after using a can opener on it (vs. sticking a knife or your finger under the sharp edge). This is a nice feature and worked quite well to prevent getting that nasty steel can cut.* We had nachos for 30+ with plenty of sauce left over.***** Original review below *****So, if you just have a family of four and like spicy food, this may not be the way for you to go. It is fairly bland tasting, but makes a good base for spicing it up to something you would like afterwards. It does not, in my opinion, come out of the can ready to go. Rather, since it is about a gallon of sauce, it is a cheese base for you to put together nachos for a larger party or in a restaurant. Like the label says, ""basic cheddar cheese sauce"".We used ours to make nachos for the social meeting time after the church service, and it was fine for that. Especially after we added some tabasco, peppers, vinegar, Worcestershire, etc. to taste. Smooth, heats easily and, did I mention, you just have to open one can for  pretty good size group.BTW, I felt it was more ""American/Velveeta"" cheese flavor rather than cheddar.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K4YZ2M7XK1LG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CFOE2U#wasThisHelpful","R1K4YZ2M7XK1LG","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a bunch of papers in my office that needed to be laminated so it was really fortuitous that my Vine review queue ended up having these Fellowes branded laminating pouches in it. I fired up my generic, cheapie laminator (""GBC"" brand) and got ready to clean up some of my wall postings a bit. The first thing I found is that this 200 pouch package does not come with a sleeve to pass the sheets through the laminator with. Most other packages of material that I've purchased in the past from vendors like Royal and others had a sleeve. This is nothing more than a hinged folder made of cardboard, so I cut up a FedEx envelope to make my own substitute. This worked fine, but I thought it was a missing feature for this pack of pouches. Those sleeves don't last forever, and I would expect to definitely wear one out within a 200 piece package of consumables. I removed one star for this. Additionally, I found no instructions of any kind on the package referring to temperature setting, compatibility, etc. Not a huge deal, but I thought there should have been something there instead of nothing.All that said, I found that everything ended up working fine with my jury rigged setup. The results were well bonded, bubble free and clear. I didn't test water resistance, but I did check out the ""wipes clean"" claim by using a dry erase marker on some of the laminations. This erased with no smudges.If they included the lamination sleeve and still left out the instructions or heat specs, I would give this a five as a product. And, if the price is good, you would still do well to get them because you can always just make a sleeve like did, presuming moderate handiness. :-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YX7XE2GHP35Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOAPL1Q#wasThisHelpful","R1YX7XE2GHP35Q","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think these are a decent value. They are not as nice as the 3M Command equivalent, but if you use them within their capabilities, they seem to do well. I tested mine on a smooth surface (semi gloss enamel paint) and found that they hold at least 1 pound (the package spec.) in two directions. The first is pulling down vertically. The second is pulling away from the wall. My guess is that it would take about three pounds or more pulling straight out to pull it off the wall. If I can find my fishing scale, I will measure it directly.The release feature worked fine on the smooth finish, and I also regret the fact that replacement adhesive does not appear to be available. So, down one star for that.The removal tab is very visible with these hooks, and although that might be convenient, for me it means these are going to be used in closets, laundry room and the garage. I would say, not for the home kitchen unless you're a bachelor and and engineer :-)The hooks are a bit less adhesive on a textured, flat finish wall. I could still get them to stick and give me about a pound of resistance, but not tons more. I would not put anything two pounds worth on the hook with these on a flat, textured wall. I have not had them fall off, but it is not confidence inspiring and I was able to pull the hook off the wall along with the adhesive with perhaps three pounds of force. That would make this a bad way to hang a wall plaque or ceramic object in your living room or office.So, what am I using them for? Keys, wires (I have a lot of USB, firewire and LAN cables at home), small flashlights, scissors and other small and light tools. I am not putting them up on rough surfaces, but always using smooth surfaces. I clean the surface with Formula 409 cleaner first to make sure it is fully degreased to get the maximum adhesion. Finally, let the adhesive sit for an hour after attachment to give it time to ""set up"". If you follow all these directions, you'll have better results than otherwise. Or, you can just pay up and get the ""Command"" version ...All that said, if your use fits the above profiles, you should be able to get good use out of these for a relatively attractive price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TIL667JAKLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J12Q3ZY#wasThisHelpful","R1TIL667JAKLD","A27H0T39U3FZB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27H0T39U3FZB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Hamswan smart watch is a value smart watch geared towards android devices. The screen is not bad, fairly easy to use, and comfortable to wear.This watch is attractive and looks very cool.

Again, can't really be expecting a samsung s5 or iphone resolution here.Though it is fairly limited, it is still relatively responsive and takes calls, notifications fine. The touch screen is okay.

"The PDP AG 9 is a wireless headset built for xbox one. It intends to provide booming and balanced sound, clear chat transmission, and a comfortable headset for gaming sessions. In those three areas, the AG 9 lives up to the bill with some (possible) annoyances.Sound - lots of power, bass, explosive, and pleasing for games I've played (tomb raider, nhl 16, destiny). Comparable to the sound quality of Creative and Corsair on PC gaming headsets.Microphone - The microphone is detachable and inserts into the headset with mini jack. It must be firmly inserted and not have any wiggling room. It is not a flip up and down style nor is it concealable when not in use. I found that microphone quality was decent. I am audible in xbox chats. It sounds like I'm far away from the microphone when it in fact I'm basically about to eat the mic. I wished plantronics made mics for PDP. I didn't experience any connection or audio transmission issues.Design (comfort, build, battery life):Comfort - The highlight of the design. Cushioned well on the earcups and headband. I wear glasses and can still get a fairly comfortable session (1+ hours). The earcups are huge and fully cover my ears.Build - Durable, well built. I love the green LED lights on the earcups. The left speaker button has a few commands: 1) Hold button to power on 2) Hold button to power off 3) hit once to mute/unmute. There are dials for the volume and game vs chat volume.16 hours of battery life is somewhat of a stretch but a decent estimate nonetheless. I experienced about 13 hours, mostly with tomb raider (no mic) and madden(consistent trash talking). I wished gaming headsets would come with like a city vs highway MPG type of estimate. Maybe something like battery life while using mic vs battery life without using mic.One really annoying (but maybe not to you) quip: whenever the headset is having some hiccups (delay in transmission), low in battery, or is not in range, there is a very loud beep. The volume of this beep is NOT something you can change. Please inform if I am able to. I wished it was more of a doot doot, instead of a BEEP BEEEP HONK.It seems there are some lemons (mostly regarding the microphone) out there. I suppose I'm a lucky one (knock on wood). This wireless has been great so far and the microphone has been fine. At its best, the AG 9 serves the xbox one gamer quite well with great sound, a decent mic, and excellent build and comfort. At its worst, it seems some have experienced subpar/non functional microphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GVF44WNSIHIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016K122XU#wasThisHelpful","R3GVF44WNSIHIN","A3R4794K2RVU1S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4794K2RVU1S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Python for Kids is an excellent python beginnerâ€™s tutorial. This book aims to introduce the python language and engaging kids to immediately learn this language. The writing style is concise, has the tone of an elementary school teacher, and is also great for adult beginners like myself (sometimes the best way to learn is reading kids/children books for the subject matter).Hereâ€™s the structure of the book: 1) Introduce the project for the chapter 2) Go through each block of code 3) Flush through some tips 4) Summary of the points covered for the projectWriting style â€“ the writer assumes you know nothing about this subject. I like the conversationalist style and dummed down(pun intended) style. In between the coding, I enjoyed some of the humor as such: â€œMake sure you know the flow (and go with the flow, too).  It is very easy to just stop at a section, trying it out on your computer, and then continue.Project content â€“ of the 10 projects, two are geared to getting you started â€“ setting up your coding environment and some pointers to getting started. The rest of the projects will cover topics like dictionaries, functions, loops, classes (shivers), list,  and modules(os, random, string, etc.).As an adult beginner, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

"I've tried this on several small engines that were developing carburetor problems.  It helped clean out a 2-cycle leaf blower somewhat - at least it got to the point where it would idle, but had no effect on high-speed.  It had no effect on gunky Honda GX-31 4-cycle (I had to get a new Honda carb), and minimal effect on a Craftsman Gas lawn mower.  In all cases, I followed mfgr. directions for use.  Perhaps it would have worked better as a ""conditioner"" rather than de-gunker.  Who knows.My unscientific hunch is that this is no more effective at de-gunking than Marvel Mystery Oil and Sea Foam, both of which have been around for nearly a century, have a proven track record of not doing damage, and are considerably less expensive.  I thought I'd try MIABGT as an experiment to see if it would be more effective than MMO and SF.

"Fine replacement for 650E OEM filters.  Note that as other reviewers have mentioned, the cartridges are now black (not white as pictured).  I have no idea what the difference is.  My 650E seems to work the same with either varieties.These are expensive for what they are.  I have noticed that the ""replace filter"" light seems to come on every 6 months or so.  The last two times i didn't think the filters were all that soiled - e.g., you could see light through them at the folds.  This next time, I'm going to reset the 650E and try to get a few extra months out of the filters.  If this turns out to be a bad idea, I'll update this review.Expensive but seem to be effective.p.s. one thing i should add.  I subscribed to the Blueair reminder system.

"I had no idea what this show was going to be about when I began streaming it, but something about it caught my eye. I really dislike procedural crime shows for the most part, which is what Longmire more or less is. However, it's presented in such a unique fashion, and exectued so perfectly, it instantly got me hooked. I blasted through the first 2 seasons in no time! The casting is brilliant, with every character being richly portrayed, for all their strengths and weaknesses. The setting is stunning and one that has rarely been utilized in television. I love watching these characters struggle to maintain law and order in the vast wilderness of Wyoming. In addition to the individual crimes that present themselves each episode, there are also a few long-arc stories that are teasingly developed over the course of the season, done so in a manner that engages the viewer's curiosity, but gives them just enough to stay satisified (no long, long periods with no answers but just more questions). Longmire is one of my new favorites shows!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB6UA5PGCI6Z7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFAIH68#wasThisHelpful","RB6UA5PGCI6Z7","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game lives up to its reputation for being insanely, diabolically difficult. However, you shouldn't let that deter you. Cooperative board games are only fun if they're challenging, and this one certainly fits the bill! What I love most about Ghost Stories is the richly presented theme. It really puts you into this Halloween-style atmosphere, and it gets your imagination going as you and your team of monks attempt to battle back these terrifying creatures. You really do feel like you're experiencing an ""onslaught"", and you have to pool all of your resources, special abilities, and brain power to survive. Ideal with 4 players, I recommend playing multiple monks if you have any empty seats at your table. That makes for a process that is much easier to follow, it's more fun, and as an added bonus - you're more likely to survive with additional monks there to help you!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H36I299IMFJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001J77UUQ#wasThisHelpful","R2H36I299IMFJ4","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Willingham continues to surprise me with the new life he can breathe into these ancient characters, utilizing clever storylines and twists that you won't see coming.

"I am very wary whenever approaching a fantasy-themed comic, because they are incredibly formulaic, generic, and boring. Fortuantely, this first volume of Pathfinder, collecting issues 1-6, delivers something not often seen in the realm of fantasy comic - a fun, entertaining story, beautifully delivered with vibrant artwork and excellent dialogue. Pathfinder is not immune to the tropes of the fantasy genre, and you will definitely see many of the typical stereotypes, such as the brash fighter, the surly dwarf, the lowly goblin cannon fodder, and the awakening of an ancient evil that can only be confronted by the well balanced party of adventurers that happens to include a fighter, rogue, soceror, wizard, and cleric. However...What prevents Pathfinder from becoming another boring fantasy romp is the execution itself. Sure, these characters are based on stereotypes, but they are instilled with such wonderful personality and unique quirks, they persevered and won me over. Furthermore, most of them have unique quirks that make them interesting. For instance, the elderly wizard may seem terribly cliche... if not for the fact that he started studying magic remarkably late in life, only after his status of privileged statesman fell apart. What really makes these characters come to life is their interactions with one another. They have excellent chemistry, which is brought to life with their dialogue, adventuring, and team combat.The other thing that helps Pathfinder so much is the outstanding artwork. It's bright, colorful, and pencilled with great skill. It brings the characters, monsters, and story to life, and it has a great capacity for capturing ""motion""- when characters are involved in combat, the intensity of their movements is evident, further enhanced by their richly drawn expressions and features.I have no familiarity whatsoever with the Pathfinder universe, but I found this graphic novel to be a fun, worthwhile read that stirred my imagination and kept me captivated throughout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E8GSULN4LSEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606903926#wasThisHelpful","R2E8GSULN4LSEK","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another outstanding entry in the Fables series by Bill Willingham. It was a delight to watch Snow with her very, very strange 6 (or is it 7?) new children, as she begins the journey of being a mother in the weirdest place on earth. The introduction of the babies' grandfather, the North Wind, was executed very well, as was the murder mystery that cleverly plays out over the course of this story arc. My favorite part, however, was the retelling of Bigby Wolf's time assisting the U.S. Army durring WWII, involving a siege on a Nazi castle and a downright awesome monster mash featuring the Wolfman Vs. Frankenstein in a throwback to the classics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9X5X45UNVYT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401204864#wasThisHelpful","R9X5X45UNVYT4","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this game free with the month's PS Plus bonuses. It sat on my PS4, unused, for several weeks. I didn't think I would have any interest in the game - but I was wrong. I fired Rocket League up last night, and I was immediately delighted. The thing that instantly makes this game a 10/10 is that it actually features COUCH CO-OP PLAY! Not only that, but it's incredibly fun! We were sitting in the living room last night, laughing uncontrollably, cursing at the TV screen, and having a blast. Rocket League reminds me of the old days, when you could sit together with your firends and family and play fun games on the same console, on the same TV, in the same room. The best single word for this game is: FUN! The concept is simple, the physics are genius, and the results are hilarious.

"I think this is the best collected volume in the Fables series thus far. It featured plenty of action, intrigue, and surprise. The story is fast paced and engaging, featuring many, many fables from all corners of this comic's universe, including the big guys and the lesser known ones, as well. Perhaps most impressive of all is the fact that Willingham is willing to make major sacrifices by offing certain characters (though some of these will undoubtedly return via the magic of fables). My favorite part of this volume, however, is the growing relationship between Bigby and Snow. These characters are very well done and I'm enjoying watching them grow to know one another and care for each other. I can't wait for volume 5!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12CYHYFOZ4T1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401202225#wasThisHelpful","R12CYHYFOZ4T1K","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I came upon the Fables universe by playing the excellent ""The Wolf Among Us"" game on PS4. I was immediately captured by the charming nature of the characters, from the big ones like Bigby and Snow, all the way to the little guys like Flycatcher and Collin. Playing that game is what got me interested in looking up this first collection of the Fables comic, and if you're a similar fan of ""The Wolf Among Us"", you will not be disappointed. It's similar in nature, featuring Bigby's hardboiled detective adventures as he interviews legends from a plethora of tales, with Snow White by his side, the both of them trying to retain order in the madhouse neighborhood of NYC that is Fabletown. I love the dialogue in this series, which develops the characters with excellent depth, as well as moving the story along at a perfect pacing. Finally, this volume deserves credit for being a credible murder mystery of moderate complexity, with enough clues sprinkled throughout so that the reader can solve the case on their own (if they're possessed of the ambition to do so - as well as a little luck!).","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPCJUM1HWALMZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140123755X#wasThisHelpful","RPCJUM1HWALMZ","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of all the possible genres, I think comedy is by far the hardest one to tackle. To write something that others will find funny is extremely challenging, but Ionia Martin pulls it off with this book. Plundering the Romance Novel is somewhat without peer, insofar as I cannot think of any similiar books by which to compare it (and I have read many, many books). Rather than reminding me of any books I might have read in the past, it actually calls to mind classic satire/parody movies, such as Space Balls, Blazing Saddles, and The Princess Bride, and that is some very good company to be around. I felt sort of like I was reading a Mel Brooks screenplay or something, with the outlandish, over-the-top characters lampooning themselves with hilarious self-awareness as they smashed their flip-flops and boots through the fourth wall, accosting the sensibilities of the reader while pursuing fortune, romance, and cheap wine suitable for bathing. Comedic entries are somewhat rare when it comes to novels, so this treat will be greatly appreciated by anybody hungry for humor!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34O6MM99SDAOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011CTUA16#wasThisHelpful","R34O6MM99SDAOP","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am Invincible's #1 fan, so I was happy to see this miniseries spinoff in the Invincible universe. After all, it means more time spent in the whacky world filled with unique, downright bizarre characters and storylines. As such, I enjoyed it for what it was - a short distraction within Invincible's dimension, highlighted by OctoBoss' trademark horrendous grammar. Although the ramifications of the story are ultimately meaningless in the longterm for Invincible, it does manage to develop some further character detail for fan favorites like Brit and Yeti. However, I would only recommend this book if you are already a diehard Invincible fan - otherwise, you'll be completely bewildered by Kirkman's spoof-style take on superhero comics, and you'll be left scratching your head and mumbling beneath your breath as to what the heck you just read. Start with the core Invincible series instead, and for those of you who are all caught up, this is a decent addition to the universe, though not as good as Tech Jacket, Brit, or Invincible Universe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H7XTQR56Z6I7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607063565#wasThisHelpful","R1H7XTQR56Z6I7","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though this game does not in any way look like a ""next gen"" title (at best, it looks like a decent PS3 game), that doesn't really matter, because it's just plain fun to play. The mechanics of this game work wonderfully, particularly the hand-to-hand combat and the driving, which has perfect, arcade style physics that fit the wonkiness of the premise. I love that this game lets you do all the fun stuff you want to, without punishing you for doing so or making the game harder to play if you cause a ruckus- that's the way I like open world games, to encourage freedom and wackiness at all moments. The story of this game is also awesome, as is the voice acting, although its serious nature creates a very odd contrast to the totally goofy gameplay.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF424M61QFG3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MA5TSFQ#wasThisHelpful","RF424M61QFG3R","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The jungle island in which our hero battles dinos, mammoths, madmen, and monsters is a vibrant, beautifully realized world in which the artists of this book excelled.

"I'm a big fan of tabletop games, fiction, and mysteries, and this game successfully blends all three of those things into a unique and enjoyable experience. It has elements of the ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books many people in their 30s grew up with, as well as the ""Carmen Sandiego"" games that were so popular in the 80s. One of the best things about this game is how well it works when played cooperatively. This is the ONLY way I would recommend playing Sherlock Holmes, as it creates a fun, exciting dynamic where everybody gets to contribute and be part of the team's successes and failures. The team brainstorming and deduction is incredibly fun, as you attempt to unravel these well written mysteries and solve the questions posed to you by Holmes. Conversely, playing in competetive mode leads to looooong periods of silence and thumb twiddling while you wait for the others follow their leads and read the respective clues (and the more players you have, the longer those idle periods become).There's nothing else quite like this game out there. It's a ton of fun (especially for people who enjoyed Carmen Sandiego and are fans of modern shows like Psyche), the scenarios are excellent, the writing is detailed (putting you right into Victorian London), and the components are top notch. The only bummer is that there are only 10 cases, but I still think this is a solid value, and I remain hopeful that there will one day be expansions!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35A4JE5WKACAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2914849893#wasThisHelpful","R35A4JE5WKACAU","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is something about this game that keeps drawing me back. I find myself thinking of it when I'm at work, and I can't wait to get home to continue Geralt's quest for a couple more hours. It's weird... the game is a little slow for my liking, and I find the interactions between quest points (random encounters in the open world) to be rather sparse. Yet, I find the world of this game utterly compelling. It's a fascinating place, beautifully realized, and I just want to keep on exploring it with Geralt. I haven't yet been able to wrap my head around all the crafting and inventory details, but that hasn't impacted my enjoyment. Although animations aren't the best I've seen, the combat is very much enjoyable, thanks to the inclusion of magic with Geralt's superior swordsmanship.

"In short, this is the best guide I've ever seen in my 35 years (25 of which have been spent gaming). The quality is simply outstanding, with a durable cover, superior binding, rich colors, thick pages, and crisp text. In terms of content, this thing is loaded beyond all reckoning - you'll probably never read the entire thing (it's over 500 pages!), but everything's in there if you need it. In addition to comprehensive quest directives, glossarys, and guides to crafting, I particularly enjoy all the supplemental stuff that covers the many characters of the series. As a newcomer to the Witcher, I found this most useful and interesting. As a final bonus, there's an awesome smaller book (about 90 pages, I think) that is included. It features unique binding and a bunch of additional content to further flesh out the universe of the Witcher. Even if you don't think you want to use the guide to help you with the game, I would recommend this book to anybody who is a fan and wants to get even more out of the Wild Hunt experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SA0ODKRCKRYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804162980#wasThisHelpful","R3SA0ODKRCKRYT","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Volume 2 of the new TMNT series doesn't suffer the sophomore slump. Rather, this title picks up right where the last one left off, firing on all cylinders. Just as in the first volume, the artwork and writing are executed at a level of near perfection, fitting this series just the way it needs to appease both newcomers and turtle lifers. I particularly loved the parts of this volume that occur in feudal Japan, and the artwork portraying the ninja clans and their battles is amazing. I thought the idea of tying these ancient feuds into the turtles' current struggles was a brilliant idea. Sure, the reincarnation theory that Master Splinter is advancing is downright absurd, but the comic is about teenage mutant ninja turtles... so anything goes, and this is hardly the craziest thing that has happened in the sewers of NYC.

"This is another outstanding tale from Jonathan Hickman. For anybody who has ever been a fan of weird science shows like Warehouse 13, Eureka, or Fringe, you will get a kick out this. The premise- that the group of genius scientists who assembled to create the atomic bomb were actually more preoccupied with their ""special"" projects is a fun one. However, this is also a very twisted tale... from Oppenheimer's evil twin to Einstein's inconceivable secret, this is an alternate history that is very dark indeed. The art style is bizarre...

"When I first read the synopsis for this series, I was not interested in the slightest. The premise, that of a world approaching the apocalypse, under siege by the Four Horsemen, seemed kind of cliched to me. I'm happy to say I was completely wrong! This comic is incredible. First, let me compliment the writing. The story is completely unique, and it truly stands out in an over saturated market of ""me too"" apocalyptic tales. The writing is downright eloquent for any medium, and without peer among comics. Both the dialogue and the descriptions is perfectly written, and I oftentimes found myself going back and reading passages two or three times - something I nearly never do when reading comics. It's almost poetic in nature. And the alternate history timeline that Hickman has created is fascinating and exciting.The artwork is the perfect match for the writing. I love the renditions of all the characters, especially Wolf and Crow. Those characters have transforming abilities that must make them extremely challenging to illustrate, but they are brought to life on the page like magic. They are so convincingly portrayed, it adds to their aura of power and mystique.I liked Volume 1 so much, I immediately ordered Volume 2 and 3 and subscribed to the series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R165K1TS8SU24B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607067706#wasThisHelpful","R165K1TS8SU24B","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Somehow this movie slipped under my radar when it was released at the theater, so much so that I didn't even recognize the title. When my son showed up with this from the Red Box, I was thinking, ""What is this garbage? Some direct to DVD animated silliness?"" I sat down to watch it with him, and was delightfully surprised. This movie is really, really funny (and I typically prefer the hard R stuff like ""Horrible Bosses"" and ""Team America""), and I was thrilled to see such big roles from some great actors, like Steve Carell. There is some stuff in here that will definitely embarrass and possibly enrage more squeamish or conservative parents, but all things considered (this is the age of the internet, people! Your kids have already seen horrible, horrible things!), this movie is pretty tame. Personally, I thought Dick Van Dyke's profanity in a book shop full of little kids and parents was classic stuff in the making. Ultimately, this is a Disney movie, so we have the requisite amount of sentimental, tear-jerking, manipulative plot points, but it all works well and makes you pull for this wacky family. Also, I have to say, the rendering of high school life, office life, and family life is pretty spot-on, though obviously told through the lens of exaggeration for the purposes of entertainment.

It's impossible for me to adequately explain why, but this game is absolutely amazing. I'm 35 years old, and have no interest in high school, but for some reason, P4 makes taking on the role of a high school student FUN. I absolutely loved the characters in this game. I loved going to class, going to the food court. Heck, I even loved studying and taking exams. Weird, right? The developers of this game must be straight up geniuses, to make such mundane things so fun.My least favorite part, ironically, was the combat and ""dungeon delving"" (if you could call it that - it's really weird).

"This issue is quite a bit slower than the previous three, in terms of action. It is, however, just as engaging when it comes to story. There are several exciting new revelations in #4, not least of which is the return of Warren/Archangel, who seems to have forgotten who he is, and taken up the notion that he is, in fact, a real angel. As ludicrous as it sounds, evidence is presented that he might actually be able to resurrect the dead...? Deathlok makes an interesting cameo, but the most startling bit of story here is a young Apocalypse, apparently created from the DNA of the big guy in a lab somewhere. Unaware of his origins or true potential, he's a troubled young man, to put it mildly. But Wolverine seems to have no plans of informing the youngster of his true nature, instead opting to wing it and hope for the best, Logan-style. But is this wise?

"Having not kept up with the X-Men in recent years, the character of Quentin Quire is a complete mystery to me, and I was glad to learn more of him in this issue, as well as catch a glimpse of his impressive psychic power. Kid Gladiator is another character who I was not familiar with, and I'm enjoying my exposure to him in this comic. Like Quire, he's brash and arrogant, yet those traits seem to work for him in his free-spirited, destructive lifestyle. I also like Broo, the alien student who looks a bit like E.T. There's obviously a huge culture gap between the world he comes from and our own, and the results of this discrepancy are hilarious, such as when he invites enemy monsters (""brother omnivores"") to accompany him to the snack machines in a failed quest for friendship.I'm only three issues into this series, of course, but so far this is one of the most exciting Marvel books I've read in years. Not only is it intelligently written and superbly illustrated, but it's a real page turner - I loved seeing what would happen next, as Wolverine battled a giant earth monster and Beast desperately labored in his lab for a solution, doing his best to ignore the rising tide of lava. Oh, and the X-Men get a new member in this new issue... an utterly bizarre one that you will not be expecting!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MMEEIVUOF83C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006NDPL8E#wasThisHelpful","R1MMEEIVUOF83C","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the comic series that is making the X-Men feel fun and fresh for me again. There have been so many story lines and spin offs and rehashes, it's hard to keep them straight. But this series, so far, has been unique and entertaining. This issue was just as exciting as the first one, and there is a remarkable amount of creativity put on display here. The writers came up with some nutty ideas, and the artist brought them to life brilliantly. The pages are filled with vibrant, exciting panels that depict a massive battle for the survival of Wolverine's new school (on its very first day of existence, of course). There are some CRAZY monsters in this one, and I loved the way they were brought to life on paper. And it's the little things that really make it excel - things like Iceman's impressive display of power and (my favorite moment) when two stuffy pencil pushers get transformed into a Yeti and a Sauron... totally bizarre and hilarious!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN7GKDI83R46R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYY4JP6#wasThisHelpful","RN7GKDI83R46R","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great expansion for the Legendary base game, and you get a lot of content for your dollar. Five new heroes are added, those being the Fantastic Four and the Silver Surfer. Each of these characters can hold their own, and they each have a unique set of abilities that matches their comic personas. They're well balanced, though the Silver Surfer leans a bit toward being obscenely powerful (as he should be), but that's okay, because it's fun to add his cards to your deck. The villains and masterminds are likewise superbly implemented, and they are a very colorful and diverse set (Moleman's subterranean followers and Galactus' interstellar flunkies). The new abilities, like ""focus"" and ""burrow"" are great additions, and they are not complex, making it very easy to learn them quickly and implement them in the game. Last but not least, the artwork deserves special kudos. In my opinion, this expansion features the best illustrations of any cards in the Legendary universe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NZLV71C146T3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E6K8CUA#wasThisHelpful","R3NZLV71C146T3","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw this series, I was thinking ""Oh no, not ANOTHER X-Men spin off!"" To my surprise and delight, this is a really enjoyable, unique take on the franchise. Mind you, I haven't been keeping up with the X-Men, so I have no idea what led up to the current state of affairs (as it begins in this issue). But with the interesting premise of a new school for mutants being formed, not by Professor X, but by Wolverine (with Kitty Pryde serving as head mistress), this is shaping up to be a fun story.The dialogue between the characters and the artwork complement each other really well, making for a smooth flowing comic that is exciting and engaging. It kept me turning the pages to see what would happen next, as a stressed out Wolverine (complete with suit and tie) tries to assure the education authorities that his school is on the up and up (while all sorts of shenanigans are happening all around them, of course). The table was amply set with all sorts of characters, conflicts, and villains, and this will almost certainly turn out to be a really wild ride.

"This is a fantastic graphic novel, carried by the strength of its characters and the humor with which they investigate their wacky assignments. So many comics attempt to be super serious, mature, and/or gory, and Atomic Robo is none of the above. Instead, this comic goes in the polar opposite direction - and it succeeds wildly.Atomic Robo is the star of the show, of course, and within this Tesla-built mechanized detective/warrior/comedian beats a surprisingly human heart. His dialogue is always spot-on, and his jokes are always the perfect blend of cheesiness and uniqueness. The way in which he is artistically depicted matches his personality perfectly, and his big ol' eyes are wonderful for conveying his emotions. He is perpetually upbeat and ethically sound, yet he doesn't come off as preachy or corny. Rather, Atomic Robo seems like the kind of guy you would love to sit around and drink a few beers with (or go on adventures with). In fact, Atomic Robo recounts the time he convinced one of his fellow soldiers (a human one) that robots could get drunk, and challenged him to a drinking contest. Mind you, Atomic Robo does not have a mouth or any way of drinking, so this was quite a feat.The adventures that Atomic Robo sets out upon with his band of Action Scientists are exciting and varied. Thanks to his essential immortality, he has a vast number of experiences that have spanned generations, making for a fantastic collection of tales. Whether he's battling giant ants in the desert, or walking pyramids, or Nazi war criminals, Atomic Robo is guaranteed to have some exciting feats to keep his readers entertained!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R59EYU0IK0D7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0980930200#wasThisHelpful","R59EYU0IK0D7P","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's a bombastic, visual thrill ride, and a true treat for Invincible fans. Mr. Liu's dragon rampage is a sight to behold, as is the massive alliance that is formed to take him down (the afterword credits massive get-togethers like Infinite Crisis and Secret Wars for his inspiration).

"For those of us that can't enough of the fantastic characters in Invincible, this comic is a godsend, as it basically double the monthly content we can get our hands on. It was a great way to get our Invincible fix while it lasted (hopefully, they'll bring this one back soon!). The story, art, colors, and personality of this comic gels with the Invincible universe perfectly. And that particular universe is so thickly jammed with interesting, fun characters, it's great to have an extra outlet where we can further explore their stories. In this first issue, the world has been torn asunder by the tomfoolery of Dinosaurus, and we get to watch as the earth's heroes struggle to put things right (if even just a little bit). As if that wasn't enough, we also get a taste of two other majorly interesting storylines that beginning to emerge: the death and resurrection of Kid Thor and the emerging dragon monster that is about to bust out of Mr. Liu's aging body.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UQ3TI7V2N1F0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C6LAQSW#wasThisHelpful","R3UQ3TI7V2N1F0","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the conclusion to the 2011 Incredible Hulk series, and I have to say, it was one wild ride, truly living up to the title ""Incredible"". It's one of my favorite Hulk stories of all time, and the breadth of craziness that has been created on paper has truly been astonishing (and satisfying). My only complaint is that the final showdown between Hulk and Doom never actually happens, and we have to try to be satisfied with him simply smashing up a bunch of Doombots. I'm not sure why that decision was reached, particularly when this is the end of this particular run. Doom's motives are also never fully explained, leaving a rather noticeable gap. However, I loved this series overall, and the highlight of this particular issue was the surprisingly funny dialogue between the Doombots as they pondered the existential dilemma and cracked wise with one another.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M42U9ZEANDGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009TI9Y2Y#wasThisHelpful","R2M42U9ZEANDGG","A1U6XPYATU9OPG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U6XPYATU9OPG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love trivia games but usually find the questions too simple. This game is not simple. While it is true that most of the questions seem to be about popular culture, at least they are interesting (mostly).We played with 7 people, and the game is only set up for 6, but that didn't seem to matter. Everyone loved it, even the people who didn't get any correct answers. That is what makes the game so different: answering questions isn't necessarily the way to win, but gambling on who else MIGHT or MIGHT NOT answer the question, is.There is one small flaw and one of our smarties figured it out pretty quickly. If you put your counter on the very last spot every single time you will have the best odds of getting the right answer. You won't get the highest points, but getting to listen to all of the other players' answers ups your chances of getting it correct.Anyhow, everyone really liked this game and wanted to play a second game immediately. I would say this is for adults as many of the questions are dependent on life experience or education (some geography and history questions, for example).We will definitely play this a lot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8AF20TKSE0ZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9HG3PI#wasThisHelpful","R8AF20TKSE0ZV","A1ZH5ULI4SBO48","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZH5ULI4SBO48?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of the few products I've purchased this year that I actually researched. It seemed like many of the machines on the market were no longer being manufactured and I can only assume that is because of the danger that is inherent in having a trimmer with so much exposed cutting area (I can see people hurting themselves and others, very easily). That said, this is a must have tool if you have a lot of yard, but not enough to justify the 'real deal,' like a brush hog. The price was what decided me on this machine. Several of the companies who specialize in this type of cutter offer machines that look more substantial, but the price is three times more.I used this machine with extreme prejudice.

"This is my second expansion, the first being Seaside. The two expansions are very different in concept, and I find that I like Hinterlands much better. It doesn't have all the extra parts and pieces you get in Seaside, but the cards are so good you don't need them. This is a nice game that doesn't focus too much on the adversarial potential of the game.I would highly recommend this as a first expansion to people wanting to throw a little spice into the original game.

"I hadn't read a Cornwell book for at least ten years and couldn't recall why. This book reminded me pretty quickly.The author is clearly a skilled hand at writing an interesting and well turned-out plot. The characters, however, were often hard to swallow.I realize there are a ton of books in the series before this one, so I've missed a lot. But that's not the problem. The problem is that I just didn't like any of the characters. Everyone was just a little 'too'. Not only is the niece an unbelievable Einstein-esque genius, but she's also beautiful, fiery, et cetera. But that's okay because Aunt Kay is a doctor, a lawyer, a colonel, an astronaut, one of the founders of the Impressionist  School (okay, so those last two I just threw in, but...)Yes, a lot of stuff about the characters has taken place in the preceding two dozen books (something around that, anyhow) so I don't know all the ins and outs of the characters' pasts. That doesn't matter to understanding their motivations, Cornwell is a pro and does a good job filling in the backstory. You don't need to read the other books to get a good idea about who is who and why they're the way they are. I just couldn't bring myself to care.Anyhow, although I found the characters hard to take, the dialogue was good and the pacing was enough to keep me plodding to the end, which is. . . surprise. . . a setup for the next novel, which I don't plan on reading.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KDIMEBKJAD2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006232540X#wasThisHelpful","R3KDIMEBKJAD2E","A1ZH5ULI4SBO48","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZH5ULI4SBO48?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very attractive-looking planner, nicer than the at-a-glance plastic coated books. That said, this is not nearly as resilient. I've been carrying it in my bag for a week and it is already looking scuffed. That isn't a big deal to me, just as long as it doesn't get so battered it falls apart.This is the second planner I've looked at this year, both by at-a-glance. I think it is interesting that each has a different way of presenting the full month calendar. This one starts the week on a Monday. The last started the week on a Sunday. I prefer the more traditional (although less intuitive) Sunday start, just because I'm accustomed to it.This is a great book in that there is a lot of space for each month and each day -- the daily calendar is great and has plenty of room to jot notes if you don't have an hourly schedule to keep. I also really like the two bookmarks, especially the elastic one that keeps the book closed.The pages are more of a cream color than stark white, which makes the planner look much nicer somehow.

"I think a person's evaluation of this book will depend a great deal on what expectations you have going into it. I am a lawyer and have taught US history on the college level, so I have a fair understanding of The Supremes (as my Con Law prof used to call them) and their place in American history. As such, I didn't expect any great revelations from Mr. Urofsky, and I wasn't surprised or disappointed by his book. That said, I did find the book a very elegantly written general overview of some of the most important cases in Supreme Court history.To me it is obvious dissent has been a major factor when it comes to developing American domestic policy -- just as it is in any long-term political relationship. The Founding Fathers considered dissent such a critical part of American politics that they drafted the Constitution in a way that wouldn't hedge or direct dissent (hence the lack of any reference or provision for political parties in the document). I think the history of the Court, and how it has developed over time and created its place in the federal government is covered very well in this book.Mr. Urofsky is eloquent on most of the subject matter and excessively interesting on anything that touches on Brandeis, which apparently is his real subject of expertise (or one of them ?)Anyhow, this was a nice refresher for me and got me thinking about cases I haven't given much thought to since law school. If you want a very readable account of the Court's history and how dissent has shaped the Court, this is a pleasurable read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGPQME27XBIST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030737940X#wasThisHelpful","RGPQME27XBIST","A1ZH5ULI4SBO48","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZH5ULI4SBO48?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the tenth book I've read by this author. I really appreciate her sense of humor -- and her metaphors are the most hilarious in the HR business. I've started to notice a bit of a trend, in every one of her books other than the Marquess book and the Duke book, and that is a distinctly anticlimactic ending. This one had that in spades.I really liked both characters at the beginning, but there was a serious 'huh' factor when this prickly French prince (anyone who has read anything about the French aristocracy would find the depiction of Phillipe even more disbelief suspending than usual) becomes as tame as a pussy cat within mere pages. I needed a little more between him hurling vases and him calling her by her first name.All that said, I do enjoy so much about Long's writing. Very, very humorous and good characters that just sometimes lose their way.

I'd probably give it 3.5 stars, but I'll round up because I thought the writing was quite well-done.The style and pacing of the writing is a bit hard to get into, but by the third or fourth chapter I began to get the rhythm of the book.I think my main problem with the book is that the characters were not particularly well-developed. That said, this is the sixteenth in the series and I suspect a lot of the development has happened over the prior books.This is an interesting historical period to have a detective novel and the author deftly handles the relationship between the two leads as well as the political difficulties of that existed at the time.

I live in the high desert, where everything desiccates so fast the tubs just don't last.

"I hate giving less than three stars to a book, but I can't avoid it in this situation.The writing in the book starts off overwrought and never lets up. The way the author describes her characters and their emotions, (I'll get to the dialect issue in a minute) and the general description of the setting (weather, countryside, et cetera) swings from saccharine to hysterical melodrama over and over and over again. Instead of feeling empathy (or sympathy) for the lead character, whose child has died, I just felt annoyed by her. The way Charlie is depicted lacks any subtlety and I quickly became tired of being bludgeoned by her tedious personality and by about page 82 I started to skim paragraphs and expedite the experience, just to see if the ending irritated me as much as the rest of the book. It did.I lived in Louisiana and Texas for 23 years and people don't sound the way they do in Young's book.  It grated on me and I had to put down the book frequently before I threw it across the room.I'm open to the supernatural, weird, unexplained, et cetera, but this just didn't give me a creepy feeling (except for some of the super sweet dialogue and internal dialogue) or make me wonder or question or anything.I'm going to stop this ranting and end with a disclosure: I regularly read people like Palahniuk and Gischler, so maybe I'm not the intended market for a book like this -- maybe I expected something too edgy and new. Still, I read my share of sappy chick lit. I've also read several other books recently that I would put in a somewhat similar genre as this book (elements of supernatural, romance, mystery) -- books by James Oswald, Stephen Marche, and (not yet out) Sophia Jaff -- and they all pulled the elements together in a much more convincing and enjoyable manner.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FUY9HMBTIHZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399174001#wasThisHelpful","R2FUY9HMBTIHZ8","A1ZH5ULI4SBO48","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZH5ULI4SBO48?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is more of a 3.5 stars, but I rounded up to 4 because I'm a sucker for the genre.I've only seen the first half of the movie Avatar, but this book did have some similarities. That said, the concept of using remote bodies was still fun to read about. This book won't provide any big surprises, there are no genre- shaking moments, but the story is told in a way that captivated my interest and had me reading late into the night.I think Golden does a great job with the action sequences, but a lot of the dialogue is kind of stiff. Also, the some of the characters tended to stretch my suspension of disbelief pretty thin. There could be a bit more nuance when it comes to all the characters, just to make them more convincing.I am also not a fan of the big, awkward, info dump, which happens in several places and is not effective. The first one is near the beginning of the book and really put me off for a while. It's a blurb-type of description of the future that does nothing to enhance the story as most of the details in that particular dump come out later, more neatly stitched into the story.Anyhow, I enjoyed this book in spite of my few gripes. I'd read another by Golden, which is always the highest praise I can give any author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DT9M40JRR87D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=034554885X#wasThisHelpful","R3DT9M40JRR87D","A1ZH5ULI4SBO48","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZH5ULI4SBO48?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was surprised at the quality of this corset.I had a corset made to my measurements 10 years ago and it ran about $450. For considerably less money this corset is a steal. I'm 5'8"", 38 28 38 and the large fit fine, the lacing open about an inch, with room to make it either bigger or smaller. The corset is boned in a way that makes it feel like it will be able to support for a good, long time. There is a flap at the back, beneath the laces, that makes sure they won't cut into your skin.If you've never bought a corset and are considering investing in an expensive one, this is an excellent way to get an idea of how they fit.I received a free sample to try and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HBMWKE06SCA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7W0MA8#wasThisHelpful","R3HBMWKE06SCA6","A1ZH5ULI4SBO48","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZH5ULI4SBO48?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second microplaner, as the first finally broke after a decade of use. This one feels slightly more substantial than the last one I had and this has a much larger planing surface.If you've never tried one of these you are in for a treat. They make grating things like lemon peel or ginger a real pleasure. I've never used it for big grating projects like potato pancakes and think the result would be too fine (not to mention tedious to do). I've used it on a whole nutmeg, but you don't want to use too small of pieces as a knuckle grating would not be fun.This has a good heft, balance, and feel to it.

"These are very pretty lace curtains that are priced appropriately. They're not blinding white, which adds to their appeal, in  my opinion.  I put them on a pair of French doors and they offer privacy while allowing light.I have two other sets of lace curtains, one very expensive and one mid-range, and these curtains are comparable in the way they feel and drape.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K68DXPEMYSUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXYDMZS#wasThisHelpful","R1K68DXPEMYSUD","A1ZH5ULI4SBO48","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZH5ULI4SBO48?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"â€œHand on the Line â€“ Challenging Men to Follow Godâ€™s Callâ€ is Steve Wikinews's personal testimony of pursuing God with reckless abandon.The book is packed with powerful analogies comparing the disciplines required for success in the sports arena with those comparable spiritual disciplines and the cost of discipleship after becoming a follower of Jesus. He also discusses the similarity of camaraderie and the sense of community among team members and the common sense of brotherhood, unity, and shared devotion among Christian brothers who experience a mutual faith in Christ.I especially like the â€œChalk Talksâ€ feature at the end of each chapter in which Steve asks the reader to consider â€œpointed questionsâ€ regarding handling routine matters like stress, disappointment, or failures. These questions follow the progression of Steveâ€™s own faith journey with more probing questions of trust, commitment, finding Godâ€™s will, and an honest appraisal of personal  spiritual progress, counting the cost of obedience, and investing your life in Godâ€™s service. These questions become an excellent resource tool and can easily be adapted for mentoring, discipleship building, or for menâ€™s Bible study groups.Wisniewski is an advocate for a strong emphasis on the mission of evangelism as evidenced by a bold natural â€œoverflowingâ€ witness. The book is well written, deeply spiritual made up of stories, truths and insighs from â€œfootball and faithâ€ with practical personal life applications for men of every age and faith. Steve is open, genuine, sincere, and exemplary in his Christian walk.â€œHand on the Line â€“ Challenging Men to Follow Godâ€™s Callâ€ is a book I plan to recommend to my sons, my brothers, and my friends. It is a powerful testimony of finding and following Godâ€™s destiny, unique purpose, and life calling.A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review purposes.

"In his book â€œReceptivity â€“ Tuning in to Godâ€™s Voiceâ€ evangelist Daniel K. Norris proclaims a life changing message which prepares the reader to actively pursue, identify, and hear the voice of God. He challenges the reader to move beyond being apathetic, lukewarm, and complacent to become an uncompromising radical believer and follower of Jesus.I was captivated by Danielâ€™s powerful stories of miraculous ministry, select testimonies from thousands who received the message of salvation, and physical healing. I was also inspired by examples of spiritual mentoring and passing on the revival message to generation after generation to young evangelists as exemplified by Leonard Ravenhill, Steve Hill and now through Daniel Norris to another generation.My spiritual eyes were opened to new insights and a clearer understanding of listening for Godâ€™s voice through seeds of truth while becoming more receptive to His Word. Daniel draws lessons from Jesusâ€™ parable of the sower for keys to dying to self, becoming a selfless sower, and how to establish a mindset for drawing near to God.Danielâ€™s writing is well articulated and spiritualy anointed; a must read for those fully receptive to hear and respond to the voice and will of God. â€œReceptivityâ€ calls on the reader to tune in to Godâ€™s voice.A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review purposes.

"In his book â€œA Way Through the Wilderness â€“ Growing in Faith When Life is Hardâ€ Rob Renfroe reminds the reader that â€œlife is hardâ€ and that we can grow through these times of aloneness, feeling devastated, and â€œbereftâ€ of Godâ€™s presence.  He shares beautiful stories of individuals, examples of how they have become strong through hardship; enabling them to bring meaning and hope to others.Renfroe introduced new insight into the wilderness experiences of familiar Bible personalities: Abraham, Moses, David, from the Old Testament, and Jesus and the Apostle Paul in the New Testament. I especially appreciated the way he emphasized that Jesus died to make us holy and that Godâ€™s purpose in our lives is to make us more like Jesus, more concerned about our character than our comfort. And that, these barren times prepare us for spiritual battles (temptations) in self-centeredness, materialism, and discouragement; producing humility, motivating us to lives of giving rather than accumulating.â€œA Way Through the Wilderness â€“ Growing in Faith When Life is Hardâ€ is written with the warm sensitivity of a pastorâ€™s heart; inspiring, encouraging, and motivating without being â€œpreachy,â€ or â€œjudgmental.â€  Renfroe offers hope, healing, and purpose to the hurting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G8MP1SB4W2SE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501800957#wasThisHelpful","R1G8MP1SB4W2SE","A292NDEAXUNW62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A292NDEAXUNW62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The book is written for those who desire a purposeful life characterized by effectiveness, efficiency, and fulfillment.Dr. Munroe encourages the reader to ask probing questions about themselves that will challenge and unleash purpose. These questions stimulate discussion and reflection that lead to motivation for taking action steps toward application the key principles covered in the chapter. I especially appreciate that the basis for every principle or key to personal fulfillment presented throughout the book is Biblically based.  The chapter summaries become resource tools for assimilation of the material.Of the many lessons I learned, three stand out: the chapter titled â€œPrinciples of Purposeâ€ helped me identify five people or influencers in finding  my lifeâ€™s purpose, to find out who I am, to be myself, recognize my special niche and work toward fulfilling my dreams.The principles regarding time and purpose helped me recognize the danger of mistaking busyness and distracting activity as productive purpose; this becomes an important reminder of the importance of prioritizing.I was challenged and inspired by the keys introduced in the chapter on â€œPurpose and Visonâ€ and the need to unify my decisions, companions, choices, and priorities in a quantitative and qualitative standard of measure.

Upon her graduation from UCLA in Los Angeles his daughter Erin determines, against the families will, to make a trip to Siran in an effort to learn more about her fatherâ€™s life, her family roots, and Turkish culture and traditions; and to learn the secrets behind the family feuds and what had transpired to cause her father to be forced into a life of exile and guilt after his family in Turkey were killed in a hateful murder rampage.Through a number of sub plots Kaya introduces the brutal, vengeful nature of Turkish culture as well as the incredible beauty and opulence of the architect, museums, and exhibits. Erin could not resist the exciting drama, romantic nature, and excitement of the night life in Istanbul. She was soon caught up in an addiction to its cutting edge adventure.Kaya draws on his training,  and experience as an actor, as well as his early passion for reading the works of Kurdish writers of his native country, Turkey. Hi characters are multidimensional, sensitive, naïve, deceptive, vindictive, and romantic.I appreciated the inclusion of a dictionary or glossary of Turkish terms introduced throughout the book. These termscombined with the use of Turkish dialog add a unique dimension to the authenticity of the culture, the old world charm of ancient Turkey, the opulence, grandeur, and wealth in contrast to its modern ambiance.Already and award winning author, Behcet Kaya is quickly building up a fan base of loyal readers.

"Henri J. M. Nouwen draws from the teachings of Jesus taken from the Gospels for the three meditations on the Christian Life in his book â€œOut of Solitude.â€ He helps the reader recognize the relationship between solitude, community, and expectation.Nouwen describes the importance of finding a quiet center, a lonely place where we can enter into feeling a closeness for others â€“ straight from the heart; a place where care becomes the basis for community.I especially appreciated his reference to how real care is the opposite of apathy, to grieve with and share the pain of â€œthe wounds of othersâ€ with a gentle touch, a tender hand, in a silent moment of compassion and empathy. I was struck with the simplicity of his teaching style.

"Larry Sparks skillfully teams up with authors Dr. Michael L. Brown and apostolic leader John Kilpatrick to adapt and apply the stories, insights and principles gleaned from their writings to produce â€œThe Fire That Never Stops: Keys for Sustaining Personal Revival.â€After reading the forward by Jack Hayford and the endorsements of a number of international Christian leaders I knew I was in for a rich reading experience. I was not disappointed.This is a remarkable work on the history of revival over the last 100 years and its impact on the American Church. The authors have captured the passion of personal renewal by applying spiritual lessons learned from the insights of revivalists and visionaries, including: Charles Wesley, Charles Finney, William Booth, George Whitfield Leonard Ravenhill, Vance Havner, A. W. Tozer, and D. L. Moody.Although much of the book is uniquely Pentecostal and Charismatic in appeal Christians from mainline denominations, and evangelicals will benefit from these examples of the spiritual awakenings led by these men.A unique feature embraced by the authors of this book is a respect for the dramatic conversions, conviction of sin, tears of repentance, and uncontrolled emotion manifest by people smitten by the Holy Spirit as they received, deliverance, healing, and salvation during these services. The resultant agonies and commotions were accepted as a natural part of the â€œoutpouring of the Holy Spiritâ€ in the revival setting.The authors are genuine and passionate in their writing; they are expressive, and inspiring. The work is carefully researched and well documented.â€œThe Fire That Never Stops: Keys for Sustaining Personal Revivalâ€ is a book for anyone hungering for more of Jesus, His power, His strength, and desirous of living a Spirit filled life.A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review purposes.

"â€œNo Greater Love â€“ An Afghan Memoirâ€ has a great beginning. Tim Moynihan had my attention within the first two paragraphs. By the end of chapter one I was hooked. I had to keep readingSpecial Forces soldier Colonel Mike Sanchez served in the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. As he began sharing experiences from his military experiences he soon entered into a new career as an ""inspirational"" motivational speaker. He was deeply moved by a painful memory of two brothers â€“ who lost their lives in a bloody battle on a ridge in Afghanistan, when challenged by a college student in his audience.Sanchez records the story of these brothers, Zachery and Daniel Taylor, in a book detailing events that led up to the dramatic circumstances surrounding the battle that took their lives. It is a dramatic story of how brotherly love overcame fear in a final act of sacrificial love.The common denominator between the Taylor brothers and Sanchez is the fact they were all pastorâ€™s sons, who understood the message of the gospel; having a personal relationship as followers of Jesus. The message is seeker friendly, not pushy or preachy, but heartfelt.I was so moved by the story I lost sight of the fact that I was reading Tim Moynihanâ€™s novella, not his memoirs. His characters are believable; the fast moving action is cutting edge. The reader is confronted with hard questions regarding war, fighting for the cause of freedom, and with the impact of faith on the battlefield.Moynihanâ€™s writing is tight with a lot of action, drama, and descriptive word pictures. â€œNo Greater Love â€“ An Afghan Memoirâ€ is an inspiring story of hope packaged in a three chapter novella.A complimentary copy of this novella was provided for review purposes.

"Rev. Bob Larson, internationally recognized for his books on Spiritual Warfare, Angelology, and Demonology alerts the reader to the evidence Christians must face; the reality that spiritual warfare is happening throughout the world today.In his book â€œJezebel â€“ Defeating Your #1 Spiritual Enemyâ€ Larson presents Jezebel as a fallen angel taking on the identity and spirit of the despicable Queen, wife of King Ahaz, in the days of the Old Testament prophet Elijah. Beginning with basic history and background during the period in Israelâ€™s history from the Old Testament book of l Kings, Larson details lessons we can learn from some of the significant events that transpired in the nation of Israel, including: the confrontation of Elijah and the prophets of Baal at Mt. Carmel, Nabothâ€™s stolen vineyard and ruthless murder, Jezebelâ€™s arrogance and tyranny, the death of Ahaz, and Jezebelâ€™s dramatic demise.Larson has a unique approach of using dialog with demon personalities as a process for determining the spiritual strategy to bring about resolution in the exorcism and deliverance process. He equips the reader with guidelines and spiritual weapons to recognize the â€œJezebel spiritâ€ as evidenced by abuse, generational curses, blood sacrifice and witchcraft. He goes on to explain steps to help victims break from bondage and move on to freedom and victory, to find peace. He also provides sample narratives for use in exorcism for deliverance.These stories of stolen destinies, idolatrous religions, occultism, fallen angels, witchcraft and demonology are disturbing. They record actual spiritual battles of individuals documented in Larsonâ€™s archives of exorcisms. The nature of Larsonâ€™s subject matter of spiritual warfare will be interpreted differently by readers of various backgrounds and traditions.â€œJezebel â€“ Defeating Your #1 Enemyâ€ is a wake-up call for Christians today of the need to recognize the power of spiritual truth when facing supernatural spiritual battle.A Complimentary Copy of this book was provided for review purposes.

"By the end of the first chapter I knew I was hooked. Ace Collins had my attention. I knew â€œThe Color of Justiceâ€ would be a reading experience I would long remember.A cloud of despair hung over Cooper Lindseyâ€™s head; one he could not quite pinpoint. Although, as he compared the 100 year history of family in his hometown, Justice, Mississippi with progress being made in 1964; he was faced with the reality of the townâ€™s acceptance of racial division.As a lawyer and the son of a minister he recognized the double standard of justice was yet to be faced. Ironically in a town named Justice, the townâ€™s culture did not value a personâ€™s worth by the same standard. Collins was faced with the question â€“ what will wake up the community?â€œThe Color of Justiceâ€ is a dramatic story of bigotry. It is a haunting reminder of the reality how hate, anger and hostility can become so deeply imbedded in an individualâ€™s character, a communityâ€™s core values, that a whole society is tainted.When Coop Lindseyâ€™s took the challenge to be true to his values and made the decision to represent Calvin Ross, a young black man, accused of murdering the teenage daughter of an upstanding white family he is ostracized by the citizenry of the community.Part one covers the trial, the verdict and the consequences Coop faced. Part two takes place 50 years later, when in 2014 when Coopâ€™s grandson returns to Justice to determine the circumstances that polluted the Lindsey familyâ€™s character and legacy. While there the younger Coop Lindsey he is challenged by a new case and a new generation with deeply rooted prejudice, hostility and bitterness.Collinâ€™s intricate word phrases and descriptions make his characters come alive on the page. Often their actions and attitudes are so intense my emotions were moved in a way that made me ponder the question if my own bias and true values. I found the questions in the Discussion Guide probing and personal. They validate the impact of the authorâ€™s ability to use a fictional story to deliver a message of social significance.The haunting story and theme of Ace Collinâ€™s â€œThe Color of Justiceâ€ continue to have an impact on the reader long after reading the final chapter and vivid conclusion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UV6QG2GPQ5SQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426770030#wasThisHelpful","R3UV6QG2GPQ5SQ","A292NDEAXUNW62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A292NDEAXUNW62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The highlight of my reading this month is the Book â€œNo More Excusesâ€ by Sam Silverstein. Silverstein is dedicated to helping company leadership create organizations that prioritize and inspire accountability. The bookâ€™s subtitle â€œThe Five Accountabilities for Personal and Organizational Growthâ€ describes this premise and is the primary theme.Silverstein draws on his person experience, from case studies and interviews with 50 internationally known CEOs, and other highly accountable individuals in fields of business, sports, government, and medicine. These leaders are known for their productive and proactive accountability. Their true stories illustrate a standard of holding themselves and others in their organizations accountable for making accountable choices.I benefited from the insights I gained on: Improving my communication skills; developing the skill of personal accountability, the importance of being openly transparent, the need to establish high targets, the art of empowering others, and the need for clarity in building relationships. I found the Accountability checks at the end of each chapter practical and challenging, providing helpful action steps for implementing and reinforcing each of the five growth accountabilities. A unique feature of this edition of â€œNo More Excusesâ€ is an excerpt from Silversteinâ€™s new book â€œNNegotiable â€“ The Story of Happy State Bank and the Power of Accountability.â€â€œNo More Excusesâ€ is an important book for Corporate CEOs, executives, and every member of their leadership team.A complimentary review copy of this book was provided for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK20KXKOHVVW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0768407524#wasThisHelpful","RK20KXKOHVVW5","A292NDEAXUNW62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A292NDEAXUNW62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In his book â€œJesus Culture: Calling a Generation to Revivalâ€ Banning Liebscher begins by describing what a new breed of revivalists looks like and how we are living in the greatest hour of history. He draws lessons from the relationship of Mosesâ€™ authority and Joshuaâ€™s courage to illustrate the importance of spiritual covering and the power of alignment in ministry. He goes on to introduce the reader to Godâ€™s extravagant love and how we can ignite revival fires across the world. He challenges the reader to see the connection of a life of prayer and a life of power. In the final chapters he calls the reader to accept responsibility, and the role of â€œrisk takingâ€ in the realm of the supernatural.He tells the story of Godâ€™s call on his life, of his childhood salvation experience, of a teenage encounter with Jesus, and of being overwhelmed with a sense of gratefulness for Godâ€™s presence, of his anointing, and of being captivated with Jesus.Banning describes a wholehearted consecration to prayer and revival, and of the strong desire to join others for the purpose uniting together on the â€œbrink of a new wave of global revival; fanning the flames of revivalâ€ He tells how God used prophetic words, revelation, and dreams to call him to raise up and guide a new breed of revivalists: a generation of anointed revivalists, a remnant raised up to change the course of history.I was deeply moved by Banningâ€™s articulate/word patterns and fervor as he describes the new revivalist, as burning ones (igniting fires) abiding in the love of Jesus and burning with passion for Him.The book is filled with wisdom for life, insights into scripture, and keys for successful and victorious living. Banning discusses cultivating God ordained relationships, unity and discernment. Banning brings a message of life changing principles written with authority and passion. Each chapter includes profound questions which stimulate (awaken) self-examination, commitment, and a challenge to wholehearted livingPage after page Banning conveys a sense of urgency for a new focus to individual destiny, and to pursing holiness with a new passion.

"While working on a personal project over the last few months I have taken the opportunity to revisit books on my library shelf dealing with the subject of world missions. Many of these are biographies and memoirs of Christians who have dedicated their lives to the cause of Christ in providing people groups without the scriptures in their native mother tongue.Sent to â€œThe River God Forgotâ€ is one of those stories. Jim and Janice Walton tell of their life-changing experiences as a young American family living in the Amazon jungle of Colombia, South America.Their stories of conquering fear and overcoming obstacles tell of lessons they gleaned in trusting the Lord while earning the trust and learning to adapt to the societal differences, the cultural values, traditions, customs, and foods of the Muinane Indians.Their stories provided me enlightening insight into another culture, equipping me to better face the challenge and vision of expanding my own world view in light of todayâ€™s horizons of new opportunity of sharing the Gospel cross-culturally.The technique of using frequent backstory to illustrate lessons may cause the reader a sense of fragmentation or confusion. Some of these stand-alone stories are powerful examples of how God can turn disappointment to blessing.â€œThe River God Forgotâ€ has an important message for Cross-Cultural cooperation, understanding, today.

"Bob Creson captures the passion of Bible translators through stories of peoples around the world who are discovering the powerful message of the Gospel for the first time in their native tongue or â€œheart language.â€I have been an avid reader of missionary biographies and stories since a teenager. These included Cameron Townsend and Kenneth Pike early visionaries in the Bible Translation movement. The lives and stories of Nate Saint, Jim Elliott, and Chuck Bitterman have made an impact on my commitment to the cause of missions.More recently I have been a regular reader of â€œIn Focusâ€ a Wycliffe Bible Translation publication with stories and updates on Bible Translation taking place around the world today. Bob Creson is a regular contributor to this publication, so I was pleased to receive a gift copy of his book â€œThe Finish Line â€“ Stories of Hope Through Bible Translations.â€Creson describes a spreading hunger for the Word of God, a growing momentum of the explosive growth in a movement to reach the more than eighteen hundred people groups without the Scripture in their language.Each chapter is filled with stories of answered prayer, sacrificial giving, dedicated disciples, miracles of conversions, churches started, and hope for the future. The number of people groups, dialects, and the number of difficult names to pronounce is difficult to assimilate but add to the authenticity, reality, impact, and urgency of the stories.The dreams, visions, and solid foundation of the Wycliffe Bible Translators begun by early pioneers are being accomplished on a broader scope at a much faster rate as a result of new developments in technology, and the teamwork of thousands of committed men and women in the task of getting to the finish line, a Bible for every people group by the year 2025.Cresonâ€™s passion comes through in his writing. He is meticulous in detail, acquainted with every facet of the Wycliffe organization, principles of translation, and sound in his theology.â€œThe Finish Lineâ€ is an important book for Church Missions Committees, Pastors, Christian educators, and anyone considering missions as a life commitment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC79ZGV72D6MD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVOTQ9G#wasThisHelpful","RC79ZGV72D6MD","A292NDEAXUNW62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A292NDEAXUNW62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"â€œWill â€“ Godâ€™s Mighty Warriorâ€ is clever and imaginative; an enjoyable reading experience. Meredith Johnsonâ€™s illustrations add a wonderful dimension to the story line, perfectly melding page by page.Will and his friend Josh are self-proclaimed super heroes; warriors with capes, swords, and shields.

"Pastor Mike Slaughter challenges the reader to reexamine the Gospel of Jesus.In his book â€œRenegade Gospel â€“ the Rebel Jesusâ€ he is passionate in his enthusiasm, articulate in his delivery, and contagious in his impact. He leads the reader in a profound checkup regarding their perception of the Gospel of Jesus by reading through the â€œlensâ€ of a Kingdom of God worldview. A worldview with a rally cry, â€œJesus is Lord.â€I found the suggested activities, prayers, spiritual exercises, interactive questions, and personal improvement journal approach, especially helpful. Slaughter those Christians, the called out ones, who make up the Church, to hear, heed, and practice the word of Jesusâ€™ recognizing themselves as the rebellious fringe in contrast to the status quo. He further calls the reader to recognize the inconsistency of the pursuit of the comfort of wealth with Jesus teaching on the command to â€˜bring good news to the poor, to bind up the broken, and to proclaim release to the captives.â€  He shares from experiences along his personal spiritual journey  and â€œlife callingâ€ to become a disciple of Jesus.Slaughterâ€™s writing is practical in approach, relevant to todayâ€™s culture, cutting edge in application. â€œRenegade Gospelâ€ ia highly endorsed by recognized church as inspiring and challenging for fervent believers or questioning skeptics alike.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RAUJ47OPBVC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426792794#wasThisHelpful","R3RAUJ47OPBVC4","A292NDEAXUNW62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A292NDEAXUNW62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Four Intelligences of the Business Mind: How to Rewrite Your Brain and Your Business for SuccessBy: Valeh NazemoffCA Press978-1430261643, 2014, 118 pagesReviewed by Richard R. Blake, richard330@yahoo.comIn her book â€œThe Four Intelligences of the Business Mind"" Valeh Nazemoff introduces Keys to increasing focus, resulting in clarity of thought, enhancing decision making skills, and setting priorities, through transnational Intelligence impacting complex organizations: people, processes, technology, information, and performance.Nazemoff goes on to combine a balance of analytic, intuitive, social, and brain/mind consciousness in the individualâ€™s recognition of both personal and shared strengths and weaknesses within an organization. She describes how the brain and mind function. I found this discussion extremely interesting and especially helpful in understanding the area of the frontal lobe of the brain in decision making, problem solving and planning. This is also the area that enables cognitive thinking and controls judgment, speech, and reasoning.I was personally drawn to the chapters that highlighted pattern recognition and what can be done to sharpen and transform our entire business mind and strategy mapping for integrating the four intelligences for success.Among other things I found helpful include:â€¢ A highly important discussion of determining a mission statement, vision, and values.â€¢ The inclusion of intentional deliberate exercises for raising the level of consciousness resulting in a heightened state of alertness.â€¢ Her conclusions regarding the inter-link of collaborating: Financial, Customer, Data, and Mastermind with Money, Manpower, and Resources.The author demonstrates â€œa keen understandingâ€ of business operation, organization, and principles; brilliantly linking them to organization psychology, neuroscience, and technology.The book is highly endorsed by leaders in the fields of business, education, management.I received a complimentary copy of this book for review purposes.

"Claire was sad as she finished her Easter project; a gift intended for her friend Mr. Washington, the school custodian. He always had a smile on his face and a song on his lips as he greeted the children in the halls of the school throughout his working day. Just when spring was bringing the promise new life â€“ Mr. Washington died. Claire would not be able to deliver her gift to him.The lifelike drawings and careful attention to detail of Susan Stoehr Morikisâ€™ illustrations convey the emotions of disappointment, curiosity, playfulness, pensiveness and pure joy, bringing out full impact James Nelesenâ€™s adaptation of the Easter message and discover the meaning behind the resurrection of Jesus and the traveling song of Mr. Washington.Children five through nine will identify with Claire and her little brother Ben as they color Easter eggs and prepare baskets for the traditional family celebration.The story-line of the narrative, the accompanying illustrations, and the dialog will stimulate questions, conversation and discussion, and provide those opportune unexpected teaching moments.â€œ. Washingtonâ€™s Traveling Music â€“ A Joyous Story of Eastertimeâ€ is an important resource for family night reading, as well as in the Christian Education resource library, and church school classroom.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z3MBH2DUBBEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0570041511#wasThisHelpful","R2Z3MBH2DUBBEM","A292NDEAXUNW62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A292NDEAXUNW62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This highly imaginative story of Sidney and Norman showcase the highly imaginative gift of master storyteller Phil Vischer, creator of the Veggie Tales series and the artistic brilliance of illustrator Justin Gerard. This parable like tale helps juvenile readers get a glimpse of Godâ€™s love through the eyes of Sidney, and a lesson in humility and sensitivity to others through Normanâ€™s awakening to his pride and self-centered attitudes.â€œSidney and Norman a Tale of Two Pigsâ€ is good family read aloud entertainment or for developing the reading skills for middle elementary and preteen readers.

"Jacob a young carpenterâ€™s apprentice is in completion with three other young apprenticeâ€™s for the honor of participating with Rabbi Simeon in the building of the new synagogue.Max Lucado is an author who always comes through with good spiritual applications, interesting background situations, and leaves the reader wanting more. Illustrator Robert Hunt is an award winning illustrator. Maybe my expectations were too high. I was personally disappointed with the story line. With the exception of one or two of the color illustrations I was left with a feeling sadness or hopelessness.The book or the accompanying DVD provides excellent discussion starters for family night reading and viewing, especially when the children vary in age. I was unable to determine the intended target audience as the narrative is too advanced for young readers and somewhat juvenile for preteen and youth readers. The dramatic closing scenes are touching and rich in life application.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37FIFJB529BL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003RCJCQQ#wasThisHelpful","R37FIFJB529BL","A292NDEAXUNW62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A292NDEAXUNW62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is BY FAR the best Argan Oil Conditioner I've tried so far!  I love the way it makes my hair soft, manageable and tangle-free.  It smells nice also.  I've tried both Agadir Argan Oil Daily Moisturizing Conditioner and HSI Professional Argan Oil Smoothing Conditioner.  The Agadir is much lighter and the HSI is about the same as the Amir (as far as being a heavier conditioner).  I just liked the results from the Amir Conditioner better.  It is very rich and moisturizing.  All 3 brands smell really nice.  I also tried the Amir Shampoo, but prefer the Agadir Argan Oil Daily Moisturizing Shampoo better because it was more moisturizing (and easier to lather up).  I do plan to continue using the Amir Shampoo though.

"I generally buy the Fiskars brand scissors, but have also purchased Scotch (as well as some of the generic brands).  These Scotch pointed tip scissors are great for 2nd grade through 5th grade students.  They are easy to grip and sharp enough to cut without being dangerous.  One thing I have noticed about kids scissors is that the quality between the SAME, EXACT scissors can vary wildly.  This set is no exception.  Some scissors did open/close and cut more easily than others, but I've noticed this will all of the brands I've used.

"I love in-wash scent boosters.  I use them all the time now.  It's been many years since I have used Dreft detergent, but the Dreft Blissful in-wash scent booster smells exactly like the Dreft I remember.  It reminds me of Johnson's baby oil.  I like it, but for some reason it is much more expensive than Downy's scent boosters.I have tried several different brands and scents over the last 2 years.  Downy Unstopables Spring In-Wash Scent Booster Spring 26.5 Oz/Downy Unstopables In Wash Spring Scent Booster Laundry Fabric Softener, 13.2 Ounce is my favorite.  (It is the famous April Fresh Scent (just like the Downy Fabric Softener Sheets, April Fresh, 120 Count)).  I have also tried Bounce Bursts In-Wash Scent Booster Outdoor Fresh 26.5 Oz (which is now my 2nd favorite), Downy Unstopables In Wash Booster, Fresh Scent, 19.5 Oz and Downy Unstopables Dreams Scent Beads 31 loads, 19.5 Fluid Ounce, and Gain Fireworks In-Wash Original Scent Booster 26.5 Oz (which I don't really like).All of the in-wash scent boosters smell much stronger in the container than they do after the clothes have gone through a wash cycle.  I primarily use less a half a cup to help neutralize smelly clothing odors and about a fourth of a cup on my regular loads.  I use to only use the in-wash scent boosters on my smelly clothes, but I liked it so much that I now add it to all of my loads.  It even makes the house smell nice and fresh.  The only difference between Dreft, Downy, Bounce and Gain ... the scents, that's all.As far as cost, $5.99 for a 13.2oz bottle and $11.99 for a 26.5oz bottle is a good price for in-wash scent boosters.  Like Dreft, the Dreft Blissful scent boosters are more expensive.A word of caution ... keep these (as with all cleaners) well out of the reach of small children.  The in-wash scent boosters all look like small pieces of candy or Dippin' Dots ice cream.  And, the containers are really easy for small children to open.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DFUCCS7CRW20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEMWNRQ#wasThisHelpful","R2DFUCCS7CRW20","AM8J1UVGVYAL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM8J1UVGVYAL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this for my son, who plays competitive baseball.  He owns about 4 or 5 different brands of compression arm sleeves, and this one is his favorite because of the fit (and grippy material on the inside bicep).  He says this one feels comfortable and stays in place on his arm during baseball practices and games.  Our only issue with the arm sleeve is the white contrast stitching on the black sleeve.  At many baseball tournaments, they are very strict with what pitchers can wear.  Sometimes contrast stitching (especially white or gray colored stitching) is considered a ""distraction"" and not allowed.  I actually colored the white stitching on ours with a black Sharpie laundry pen, so that is was no longer an issue.  I do wish that more colors (like red and blue) were offered.As far as sizing, the manufacturer shows the following sizing chart on the images/pictures.YS:  wrist 4.75""  bicep 6.75""  length 12""YM: wrist 5.50""  bicep 7.25""  length 14""YL:  wrist 6.00""  bicep 8.00""  length 15""My son's wrist measures 5.5"" and his bicep measures 8.5"".

One workaround is to apply a gloss or moisturizing lip balm prior to applying the lipstick.

"As with all leather cleaning/conditioning products, you should test on a small, hidden area first.  I cleaned an old black, faux leather office chair first.  It did a good job of cleaning, but the chair was a little slippery afterwards.  I used another towel, and was able to wipe most of the slippery residue off.  I also cleaned the beige, leather interior of my car.  It also did a relatively decent job on cleaning the dirt off the leather portions of the doors.  Again, it left a slippery residue, but I was able to wipe most of that off with a clean rag.As a word of caution -- You do have to be careful that the spray mist doesn't get on other items like the floor, carpet or glass.

"I've used several tension rods.  They can be pretty picky ... finding that exact spot and tension to get it to stay.  I used the 19""-30"" rod in a spare bedroom doorway.

"I currently own 2 Eatsmart and 1 Bowflex scale, and now this Taylor scale.  I like all of the scales, which range in price from roughly $30-$50 here on Amazon.  This Taylor scale is the cheapest of the three brands.  This is a great basic plus scale.  What all of these scales lack is an interactive APP that could tie in the calorie intake app, with the calories burned app.  Now that would make one useful scale ... where a person could see when they burned more calories than they took in, that they actually do lose pounds.  Seems obvious, but images are powerful ... especially in weight loss.  This is a really good scale.

"I owned a similar one (different brand and way less functions) of these back in the 90s.  In fact, I still have it, and it still shrieks.  I like the First Alert brand.  I have owned many of their smoke and carbon dioxide detectors over the years.  Let me start off by saying that this device is not going to deter anyone intent on doing harm, especially with all the cray crays out there.  Only a firearm is going to stop them in their tracks.What this alarm is good for, though, is to hang on a hotel, dorm or apartment door to alert you (and bystanders/neighbors) of possible trouble and to give you advanced warning to take action (i.e., hide, run, grab your firearm).  This alarm is also good to carry while hiking or when seeking shelter in a storm shelter.  The alarm serves as a continuous loud ""scream/yell/whistle"" so that rescuers can hear and find you.  When using for this purpose, you will also want to have some disposable ear plugs for yourself.  This is also a good alarm to attach to your handbag or carry-on bag while you are traveling.

"Prior to getting this StriVectinLABS Extreme Cream, I had been using the following Olay face creams: Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum Fragrance Free Moisturizer 1.7 fl. Oz., Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum Fragrance Free, 1.7 fl. Oz., Olay Age Defying 2-In-1 Anti-Wrinkle Day Cream + Serum 1.7 Fl Oz, and Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Night Firming Treatment, 1.7 fl. Oz..  All of the Olay creams moisturized and gave my face a smoother texture.  I usually only wore the Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum Fragrance Free Moisturizer 1.7 fl. Oz. under my make-up because it has absolutely no greasy feel or look to it.  All of the Olay creams COMBINED cost way less than this StriVectinLABS Extreme Cream.So, I have to admit that I was skeptical of this StriVectinLABS Extreme cream.  Whenever I try a new cream, I first only put in on a small portion of my face (in case there are any negative side effects).  I put the StriVectinLABS on and had absolutely no problems.  It is a very thick cream and goes on a little greasy.  But after about 10-15 minutes, the greasy look and feeling are both gone.  I do have to say that this cream really moisturizes.  In fact, I re-applied it about 5 times yesterday to see if I could speed-up the results/effects.  My face definitely is softer and smoother.  No, the wrinkles are not gone (yet! :) ).  I've only used it 2 days, but definitely plan to keep using it because I like how it makes my face feel.  It has a subtle lemony scent, which is nice.  I have several other face and hair care products that have that similar lemony scent, which does eventually fade away.  Personally, because I need to get ready quickly in the morning (and don't have 10-15 extra minutes to wait for the greasy look to fade), I will only apply this in the evening.  However, I will re-apply it at least 3 times in the evening.I will come back and update this review when my wrinkles dramatically fade or the jar is empty, whichever comes first.  BTW, this cream is made in the USA.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35L27PEHX70RO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRVOQ78#wasThisHelpful","R35L27PEHX70RO","AM8J1UVGVYAL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM8J1UVGVYAL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My husband has had this book in his Amazon cart for a little while now, so I decided to grab it for him.  This is a good book of youth baseball drills for the right target audience.  Unfortunately, my husband is not that right target audience.  First, my husband was looking for more of a reference-type book (i.e., looking to do a specific drill for a specific skill).  He didn't want to sit down and read the entire book, instead he wanted to read on a specific skill he was trying to drill that day.  He said that the book was not organized so that he could do that.  Also, he said that the book did not break the drills down by level of play.In fairness, my husband has been coaching/assistant coaching kids aged 7-12 years old for several years now, where he runs/helps run drills at the practices.  Also, he takes our boys to training sessions/camps and lessons that are taught by former professional major and minor league players.  At these sessions/lessons they run various drills for various skills.  In all honesty, this book was not written for someone like him.  Instead it was written for someone trying to familiarize with the various baseball drills.  Again, good book for the right target audience.

"Cobb captures the heart of a small town in his latest book, Darkness the Color of Snow. The novel opens with a tragic scene where a young man dies, and the line between accident and murder is blurred at the start. Rather than resolve this tension, Cobb draws the reader deeper into the ambiguity of good and evil, fate and chance.What I liked:* Dark book that is extremely realistic and believable* No easy answers given* Explores the evil underlying normal people* Beautifully written. Plays out like a movie while you are reading it* Surprising twists, but never cheap twists* Having grown up and lived in small towns, this captures them perfectlyWhat I didn't like:* Still thinking through the ending . . . can't decide if I like it or not. Only part of the book that feels a little forced, but I think it is growing on me.All in all, a great read and highly recommended if you like dark novels that explore human nature.

"Great, helpful read. I can't remember where I saw it, but I remember reading somewhere that the best indicator of a child's future success is how many books their parents had in their house. Not necessarily how many they read, just how much they had access to.This book is filled with practical tips that you can use for any age kids. If you are a reader already and want to pass on your love of reading to your kids, this is a great place to start. If you wish you read more yourself, I would still pick this up and read it first.

"This is a great read for Ariely fans. I wasn't aware he wrote an advice column, and this is a quick compilation of some favorites. It's an excellent read and very well done, but I can't give it five stars for a couple of reasons.First, there is some really good advice here. For instance, pretending to tell your best friend what to do is one of the best decision making tools I have found, and Ariely points it out in just a few paragraphs. That's great . . . but its interspersed with so-so advice and comedic relief. I think that works well for a column, but its an easy book to read quickly and pass over the good stuff.Second, I would recommend at least three of his other books before this. In my opinion, this is for Ariely fans but not for very many other people. I would recommend Predictably Irrational before this one to almost anyone.It's good, it's priced right, it's a quick read in a short paperback - recommended for Ariely fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZODX85V22UM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062379992#wasThisHelpful","RZODX85V22UM7","A1NOBRCN20NGD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NOBRCN20NGD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My least favorite of the series so far. The only ones I liked were the Coronation Kings and the coins in a strange land variation. The other tricks involve a little too much setup or seem too obvious to be much more than puzzles.Also, this one is strangely missing a table of contents at the beginning.

"Best of the bunch, if you get just Impuzzibilities book, get this one.Of the first four, this is the best. The variations on his nine card trick are excellent - you name the specific card here instead of the card's location. The Automatic Ace Triumph is probably my favorite 'long distance' trick of the series. Surprising and easy to do. Three equivoque 'think-of-a-card' tricks, all have good ideas. My favorite is the Cardless Cantico. Moraskill is a great variation on Miraskill, the Tuzot Sensu mystery is excellent for a group, and Dining Out is also very good.If you want to try the series, start with this one and maybe the very first one as well, which has the best trick of the series in the Ten Boys Deal and the interesting Bermuda Triangle Trick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KONCNCE2JE48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDLBT22#wasThisHelpful","R1KONCNCE2JE48","A1NOBRCN20NGD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NOBRCN20NGD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is good, has some good ideas, but too many similarities to the first book in the series, Impuzzibilities.

But, there are not really any new principles here compared to the first book, just new presentations.

"Great, short book of self-working tricks. This has some real gems in it and if you build on the author's ideas, you can create many more tricks using the principles that he reveals in the book. Most of these should probably be classified as 'puzzles' more than tricks, but with the right presentation a few of them are definite keepers.My favorite is a 3 phase ten card poker deal, shuffled between each hand, and ending with a royal flush. Very clean, undetectable, and as easy as it gets. If you are looking for a ten card deal or want something to add to it, this is worth getting the book by itself.Other highlights include the Five Card Trick, 3 Card Monte, Nine Card Trick and Full Deck Version - all of these can also be performed long distance, whether over the phone or on video.

"This is a hard one to review, mainly because I have a lot of pop culture/theology books and they all share many similarities. This book is well-written, but I wouldn't say it is any better or any worse than the other ones of the genre. One unique chapter on video games, but other than that not much new here. If you are really interested in how pop culture and theology can intersect and point to Christ, I would suggest picking up a book that focuses on one movie and many allusions and symbols, rather than a book that covers one or two symbols in many movies. Almost any show or movie that you really like will have something available, and it may help you 'see' the symbols in other areas better than the scattershot approach.Again, well-written, nothing I disagree with, but would be hard to recommend over any other book. It is the most recent and has newer references, so if you don't have any books on this subject yet give this one a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUBLP5K2B2K9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426787413#wasThisHelpful","RUBLP5K2B2K9C","A1NOBRCN20NGD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NOBRCN20NGD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is another book in a long line of books on habits and behavior change available now. There are some good things here, but not much that is new or that will change your mind. In fact, one of the best parts of this book is that he points out more than once that change is hard and you need help, ideally a coach. Speaking from personal experience, having a business coach is one of the best things you can do to affect change.Some points I really liked, unique or not:Triggers cause behavior, and our environment has an enormous influence on us.You are not exceptional.Change is ridiculously hard for adults.Mindfulness as an integral part of breaking/changing the habit loop for behaviors is a great addition. Implied in other works, but I thought this was one area where the author really added something new. (The six questions to kick-start change were also new and helpful, but in some ways a let down and too generic.)Unfortunately, I'm not sure you need this book. It will help if you are coaching others, and its a pretty good overview of habits and habit change, though I found Better Than Before to be a more engaging read and with more helpful insights. That coupled with the shorter length of this book and higher price make this one hard to recommend, at least when compared with what else is out there. If you like Goldsmith's other books already, probably worth getting - otherwise get a copy of Better Than Before.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V8JE8FLKYNU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804141231#wasThisHelpful","R2V8JE8FLKYNU6","A1NOBRCN20NGD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NOBRCN20NGD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this book as a gift, did not know anything about it before picking it up. I am an avid reader, but science fiction is one of the areas I have read the least in. This collection convinced me to change that . . .Some things I really like about this collection:Before each story, there are two quotes talking about science fiction and genre. These were really great insights into the writers. In many collections, these quotes are worthless throwaways. Not so here, much of it was thought provoking and new to me.Out of the 19 stories, I've read works by only one of the authors before - so a true newcomer. This is a great introduction to works of authors. Here are my two favorites, by far:The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas, Le Guin: By far, my favorite. Worth the price of the book, the shortest story of the bunch. Can't wait to put this in front of more people, just a great take on life, storytelling, and layers of truth. Stands out as one of my favorite short stories ever now and one that I will return to.The Ziggurat, Wolfe: This is an odd story involving a custody dispute and . . . some science fiction. I'm not sure if I can point to exactly what it is, but its awesome. Some of the best writing and storytelling I have come across. Many Gene Wolfe books are now on their way to my house . . .One more of honorable mention: Angouleme, Disch: Bizarre, interesting, mysterious. I didn't love this story, the first in the collection, but I think might eventually. It's stuck with me and there is definitely more beneath the surface.All in all, a great collection, a great intro to some modern science fiction authors.

It is often a harsh, unflinching look at the worst in humanity and death and sadness and abuse.Gifted writers sharing some of their most personal stories . . . only reason I don't think its a five star is that there were a couple of essays that didn't seem to fit as well and it's also a hard one to recommend to others because of the subject matter.Recommended if you aren't offended easily and love short essays.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNEW0YH5036KA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544309901#wasThisHelpful","RNEW0YH5036KA","A1NOBRCN20NGD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NOBRCN20NGD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This short primer on marketing is a must read for any entrepreneur. The author has distilled a ton of marketing wisdom into an easy to read book that will pay for itself many, many times over. Good books are always inexpensive when the content is valuable, and this content is very good.Two things that stand out to me for this book as a great recommendation for others. First, it's an easy read. As an avid reader, I read books all the time and have no problem reading 500 page business books. Most people aren't like this, and of the hundreds of book recommendations I have made almost none of them have really been picked up and read. A big part of what makes this book valuable is that its readable in a couple of hours, and even non-readers will be hooked and actually read the whole thing.Second, it really applies to anything. The model of marketing here encompasses start-ups, product launches, books, and basically any business, non-profit, or product you want to launch. One of my other favorite business recommendations for others that is extremely actionable is The $100 Startup: Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future, but you have to read between the lines to apply much of the content to businesses other than information products.Highly Recommended and Highly Recommendable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I76GYYX7XEZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591847389#wasThisHelpful","R3I76GYYX7XEZR","A1NOBRCN20NGD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NOBRCN20NGD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great little touchscreen laptop, very impressed for the price. With the included Office subscription, its really, ridiculously cheap.I've got big hands, and one of my pet peeves is a keyboard that is too small. This one is small, but its actually not that bad. They maximized the space and you should not have a problem returning emails on it and browsing sites.First time I've used the new Windows Operating System since switching to a Mac years ago. Works surprisingly well, very intuitive, love the the options here.One thing I don't like that has started happening recently: The mousepad gets 'off track'. No idea why this happens or how to fix it, but you have to line up the arrow a few millimeters away from where you actually want to click. Annoying, but I'm sure there is a fix for this or its a fluke and I haven't figured it out yet.This has become by go-to laptop for working on the go. It's very easy to carry, like the keyboard better than my iPad keyboard, and its cheap . . . if I lose it, you can get another one quickly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NIRIXLUO0IAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGK92IM#wasThisHelpful","R2NIRIXLUO0IAP","A1NOBRCN20NGD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NOBRCN20NGD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Came across this book through a random post online, decided to give it a try - glad I did. It reads a little dryly at points, but it is a fascinating look at the current prison system and how it is on the inside. From an economist's perspective, there is a lot of information to sift through. I like how the author included an anecdote with each facet of the system he examined as well.Some of the things you will learn:* How governance systems are created - this was an unexpected look at political and social science, very interesting to see what groups of people will do when they are not provided governance, as many prisoners are not* How gangs were created in the system* Why gangs on the outside pay tribute to those inside* 13,000+ cell phones confiscated in California Prison system in one year . . . estimated 10% of what there is* How gangs can serve to lower violence in prison* How broken the system is right now - too many prisoners, not enough protection. There is almost no choice but to join a gang for your own protection* How gangs are created to provide the goods others wantThis is well worth the read, one of the most interesting and thought-provoking books I have read this year.

"This is a great, quick read on how to change from a Biblical perspective. The authors succeed in writing a gospel-saturated God-help book with none of the modern psychology usually worked into Christian books like this. Again and again, the authors point out that if you are relying on anything except Jesus (yourself, others, the world, or religion) then you will fail.Great advice and, more importantly, a moving book. The personal anecdotes are short and to the point, the love of Christ is clear, and the book is very well written. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who is 'trapped in sin' or looking for a way to really change.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ERW2LS1IC6KG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433683881#wasThisHelpful","R2ERW2LS1IC6KG","A1NOBRCN20NGD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NOBRCN20NGD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just set this up yesterday for my kids who started playing basketball.  I picked this up at a local Target for a lot less than what seleers are charging here on Amazon at the time of writing.I was worried about the install as I was going to be doing most of this by myself.  I have all the tools but was still worried based on other reviews here.  The one I bought had a scan thing on it that I used with my ophone to dowload an app on my Iphone which had detailed video of the entire install.  Overall, the install took me about 4 hours of working time.  Here are my recommendations and thoughts1.  Download the app on your phone.  it is super helpful during install.  Much better than printed instructions2.  Saw horses, hammer, block of wood and a good set of wrenches and socket sets are needed.  1/2"", 9/16"" and 3/4"".  have 2 of each.  I used both sockets and wrenches.3.  The base was easily assembled by myself.  The hardest part was atatching the pole to the base but was able to do it by having the base on its side and lining up everything that way.  One note to add, I followed the instructions about marking the poles and banging them into place.  I did everything correctly but i actually had the poles come apart when the entire thing was completed when I was trying to move it.  The middle piece came out of the bottom pole.  I was furious but was able to get it back in and bang it down to the 3 1/2"" mark.  I will just have to be careful to not pull it out again when moving.4.  Connecting the backboard to the arms on the pole....that was awful.  Needed two people for this and thankfully my neighbor was out walking and gave me a hand.  It only took 10 minutes but there was no way I was going to be able to do it myself.  When you lean the pole to hook up the board, it has too much weight so it jams the long bolt and you need a second person to move the board around.  And a hammer.  A hammer made it much easier.  But the lower arms still were tough to get enough spacing for the rubber spacer and spring.  But we made it work.5.  Assembled...this thing is HEAVY.  I have a bad shoulder that I had surgery on 8 weeks ago.  It was awful trying to push this up by myself once I had everything installed.  For safety reasons, I would suggest having a second person to help move it even when the base is not full.6.  The backboard is thin and is loud but my kids love the sound.  it held up well our first night shooting in the driveway.  I haven't decided what to fill the base with yet so we were using some makeshift weight to hold it sturdy.  Even with only 75 pounds or so, it held up fine.  I need to find the permanent location for it before deciding on the fill for the base.7. I have this adjusted to 8' as that is what my oldest sons basketball league uses.  IT WAS SO HARD to get the height adjusted to this point.  the springs are so tight that I had issues.  I actually got it to adjust easier by doing it while on its side.  Used it's own weight as leverage.  I did seem to notice it got eaier once I passed the 9' area.  Almsot like there is a real tight area betweem 10 and 9 feet and then it finally got easier.  Whatever it is, it is staying at 8 feet for a long time!  LOL.8.  the installed size is huge.  The pole has a lean in it (which is so much better than the straight ones) and the base is pretty big so it takes up a lot of real estate.  My original plan of putting it between garage doors is not going to happen.Compared to other ones I've seen, this Spalding seems to be of higher quality than the others.  Hoping this lasts because getting rid of it will not be fun based on how big it is!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMM667C7OL4JK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015ZQHQK#wasThisHelpful","RMM667C7OL4JK","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Got this game yesterday and it was an instant hit with both my kids (boys age 8 and 5).  Setup was easy and luckily I had 2 AA batteries available so we were playing within minutes.  The game is made for up to 3 people.  Playing with any less puts one person at an advantage since you can hit the falcon precisely to knock a players chip off.  It doesn't happen all the time but if only 2 players are playing, the person that does not have someone hitting the ship before it reaches their area definitely has the advantage.  This game does not teach you math, reading, or any other educational item I can think of that most games offer.  However, it does help with hand eye coordination and, if I might stretch it a bit, some aspects of geometry and physics since you can figure out proper amount of pressure and angle of attack that you need to knock a players chip off their area.  OK...maybe a stretch but both my kids were quick to catch on so it made it possible for anyone to win.  Fun game and wish I had this when I was a kid!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EY9TX96EFLY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00THAGEHW#wasThisHelpful","R2EY9TX96EFLY1","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this clock but I find the lack of betteries included with the product a major mistake from the manufacturer.  I could let it go if it was just the AAA batteries but to not include the watch style/round battery is just ridiculous.  Most people have regular batteries around the house but don't usually stock up on other styles.Anyway, the clock is nice looking.  Easy to read and has a minimalistic look to it.  The main clock requires a power outlet to run whereas the outside temp controller only needs batteries.  When I tunred everything on, it took a long time for the clock to start looking for the receiver (indicated by a blicking wireless picture under the time).  It took several attempts to get this to find the receiver but it finally did.  My only other issue with the clock is trying to find a safe/secure place to keep the receiver outside.  I haven't found a permanent location yet where it won't blow away, get covered by snow and doesn't require me to screw it into my house or deck.

"I own a lot of headphones.  I am somewhat of a headphone junkie.  I own several pairs of V-MODA headphones including the older wired pair of the over the ear Crossfades.  They are excellent headphones but they are not my first choice for everyday use.  I have been using my Audio technica ATM-M50's as my daily headphones for probably over a year now.  Sometimes I switch it up to get a different sound signature but the M50's are just so well balanced that I have a difficult time finding something that can compete in this proce range.But...enter wireless headphones.  I have a few sets including a nice pair of senheiser active noise cancelling ones but I haven't found a great set that was free of soem issue (the Senheisers volume is too low for me).  When I was offered as et of these I jumped at the chance because I have had good luck with V-MODA.Design and comfort -  Like the older Crossfades I have, these are some of the most comfortable headphones I own.  I can wear these for hours.  The design is beautiful and you don;t feel silly wearing them like I do with my M50's.  having no crod flying around makes these very easy to use while cutting the lawn, on a train or just lounging around the house.Pairing - I had no issues pairing this to my Iphone 5S.  Following the included instaruction, I was up and running within a minute or so.Battery life - This is one area that I am hoping I will see improvements.  The first 2 charges have not lasted very long.  I have gotten about 6 hours per charge so far and I believe these are supposed to last more like 12.  I know some batteries improve with a few uses so I am hoping that is the case here.  Or it is possible that the rated battery life is based on lower volumes or something.  I tend to listen loud so maybe that is killing my battery.Sound - These headphones were a bit disappointing at first.  Coming off the M50's and having my ears trained to hear those, I found these headphones a bit flat and a bit too bass heavy at first.  I tend to listen to music with no EQ with my M50's but I find I need to EQ these headphones a bit.  I have been playing around with various settings (on Spotify) and find that a treble boost seems to take away some of the ""muddy"" lowe end sound.  It is not perfect but it helps a lot.  I think these are just designed to push the bass a bit more since people think that equals quality.  As far as soundstage, I find these to be very up front with little soundstage.  Great for heavy rock music that I listen to.  However, I do get some separation at times wich makes them feel a bit more full.  But not a wide soundsatage by any means.  If you are listebing to orchestra type music, I would try these before you buy to make sure they work well for that environment.Cord vs Cordless - the great news so far is that I haven't heard any difference between the two with quality of the music.  Running cordless, these are LOUD headphones with my 5S.  I am running them at about 75% volume which is in line with my M50's.  I find they run the same with the cord.  I have had no dropped sound running wireless.  These just work well.Overall these are going to be with me for the near term.  I love the fact that I am no longer restricted by a cord to get great sound.  I can live with the need to EQ to deal with the low end issue (although this does not work with amazon music) . These are definitley worth considering if you are in the market for quality cordless headphones","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MTM4Y0II9WUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015R7AGHC#wasThisHelpful","R2MTM4Y0II9WUK","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We had some smaller nerf ones so this is a little bigger than what they are used to.  My 8 year old can grip this but it is too big for my 5 year old.  Overall, this is somewhat like a nerf but maybe a bit harder so I wouldn't say it's OK to throw around the house too much.  The plays found on the ball are easy to follow so I think it is would be a good teaching tool for kids either playing real football or just having fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30ATDJRHHS32D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJL5P4E#wasThisHelpful","R30ATDJRHHS32D","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This will not replace my regualr after shave balm that I use on a daily basis.  I find this formular to be a bit thick and it goes on like a sunscreen so it requires a lot more massaging into the skin.  If you have razor burn, it makes for an unpleasant experience while applying it.  The good news is that it doesn't cause my skin any adverse reactions after it is applied.  I usually use a sensitive skin balm made by nivea as it has no smell and never causes issues with me.  This seems to be in line with that as far as no reactions but it does have a smell.  Like any hand or face lotion.

This one is not as soft as my other one (a brand I got at Target),  This one allows you to feel the knobs a bit more which I suppose means better non-slip ability.  It was just a bit more rough than what I was used to.  But I think I prefer this more than the other style I had.The suction cups held OK but I could still move this around a bit with my foot.  Something I could always do with my other one as well. It didn;t move as easy so I got no bunching up or slippage.  The material is a bit thicker so I think the added weight helps.I like this brand enough to try their rectangle ones so I will probably move this to my shower stall since the overall size will be more in line with that.  Overall, it is a nice mat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LPHITFWFXP7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4QC4XU#wasThisHelpful","R3LPHITFWFXP7I","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very heavy canvas cover that I am using to cover my redwood furniture during the winter.  It is large enough to cover two chairs and a table in between them.  I also have a second table stacked on top of the other one and leg rests sitting on the chairs.  This covers all of it and has straps built in so you can tighten them around the bottom to prevent the cover from blowing off in the wind.

"I always keep a bunch of these meals in mu house for emergency purposes.  I usually buy in the large bucket sizes which are brokwn down between breakfast and lunch/dinner meals.  This pack is nice because it contains both together in the pack.  I have eaten every one of the variety that is included in this apck and most are very good for dehydrated food like this.  Much better than others I have tried.  I have used these while camping since they pack well and only require hot water to cook.  I use a Jetboil to quickly heat the required amount of water.  And I keep some readily available at home in case we lose power for a few days like we normally do during snowy winter periods.Not much else to say other than everybody should have emergency food stored somewhere in their house.  And from a taste perspective, it is hard to beat Mountain House.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B5Y7FDFN9VIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ER40RI#wasThisHelpful","R1B5Y7FDFN9VIM","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am hoping I can rate this a 5 star sometime soon but right now I can't.  There is a major issue I am having with the 2.4ghz spectrum where the signal is horribly unstable.  When it works, I can get awesome Dl speeds around 30mbps.  But when it doesn't work, the speeds seem to be cutting out around 1 to 2 mbps.  So there seems to be something interfering badly from the extender.  As soon as I turn it off, my speeds return to normal.  And rebooting it works for a while then the interference comes back again.As far as the signal strength, I give it 5 stars.  The range is awesome and I maintain full bars even in places where I had no signal without the extender.  However, on the 2.4ghz spectrum, I can have full bars but horrible DL speeds.  My guess is that this issue can be fixed by a firmware update but as of today, the only firmware available is version 1.0.For my troubleshooting so far, the only thing I had done is to reload the firmware.  That has not fixed the issue.Install was easy when I used the auto setup by pushing the buttons on my router and the extender.  I could not get the Ethernet method to work.  The website it tells you to log into kept coming up with an error that something went wrong and try these 4 steps.  None worked ntil I went into my router settings to find the IP address for the extender and logged in that way.  But the other method worked flawlessly.So right now I am running my devices on the 5ghz band whenever I can to avoid the severe drop offs in speed.  I will be contacting TP Link customer service to see if there are settings I can try to fix the issue or if they have new firmware coming out soon.  Do not buy this extender right now.  If TP link fixes it, it will be great.  If they treat this as final with no updates, run away!!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K1FMZ13INPU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010S6RYUY#wasThisHelpful","R3K1FMZ13INPU8","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my first basketball game in about 10 years so I can't compare how this year's version looks vs. last years.  I have started both a GM mode and a Mycareer mode in this game so far.  I wanted to get the feel for both modes since I am used to playing sports game where you control every player but have never played a game where I am only one person.  The mycareer story is interesting.  I actually like it but it is very linear so even if you don;t win the game, offers come in and you keep progressing.  The GM mode is what I am used to so I am enjoying that.  My only issue is I am terrible at the game right now.  Even on rookie, I am losing games.  I figure I will get better with more time but it is a very complicated gane with all the moves you can do.Graphics are great.  Gameplay is smooth.  It is hard getting used to players not having split second timing on going back and forth.  You actually see delays when someone is turning.  Definitely realistic.As for other customizations, I tried the scan your face which took some time and the end result was something that looked like a blob.  I ended up going with a pre-installed face and customized from there.  My player looks rather frankenstein""ish"" fo the name Frek (freak) seems to fit!Was this version worth the extra money?  Hmm...tough one.  the Poster is OK.  It is the picture on the box and my kids are fighting over it so that is goof.  the fathead sticker is an absolute joke.  I was expecting a wall sticker but it is about the size of an Iphone 6 plus.  Not exactly what i was hoping for.  The 30K in currency helped me with my player as I could quickly boost his stats.  It would take me many games to earn that much so that was very helpful.  I haven't found the Jordan gear in the game yet that I supposedly unlocked.  That isn't why I bough this version though.  I wanted the poster and fathead.....so I got one of those!I think this version is overpriced and not worth it unless you are a HUGE Jordan fan and already own every poster of him.  If not, skip this and get the regular edition.  But overall, this game is awesome and will occupy my time for a while.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UBZ30GLHLQGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01071CDW4#wasThisHelpful","R2UBZ30GLHLQGK","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No one in my family has a gluten allergy but we are always looking for more healthy ways of eating.  The pancakes are the first gluten free product they we have tried that we haven't immediately disliked.  We have tried a million different bread recipes but they always come out tasting flat and stiff.  The good thing about this mix is that the pancakes come up pretty fluffy.  I made these for my kids with some chocolate chips in them (yes, not exactly healthy) and they seemed to like them except they said they were really dry.  I also made some standard ones using the recipe on the package.  It's hard to compare these to other brands as this is my first gluten free pancake mix so I can only compare them to regular pancakes.  What I can say is that these don't taste like panacakes I normally eat.  They have a different initial flavor, almost sweeter, and are a bit stiff even though they come out fluffy.  They are diefinitely dry like my kids said.  But I wasn't immediately turned off by the taste like I have been in the past.Overall, I don't think these will replace my morning pancake breakfast (not something I have often anyway).  As I said, we are not allergic to gluten so we don;t have to be as careful as others.  I think if we were, these would be a great option.  We plan on trying some other recipes with the remaining mix as we have read some other reviewers who have tried a few other ingriedients with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q7VFM1SJ6H5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LOUREM#wasThisHelpful","R2Q7VFM1SJ6H5F","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very durable latex gloves.  I have a medium/large size hand but I got these in large and they fit well.  I would go one size up when ordering these.  I used them this weekend while fixing my tractor deck and one pair held up the entire time without ripping.  The one thing I would do differently though is not get the powder free ones.  It was a bit humid yesterday so getting them on took a bit of effort.  I also found that the gloves were somewaht stuck together in the box so when you go an pull one out, you end up getting a big chunk of them.

"I have last year's version of this toothbrush as well as this one.  The one I bought last was this model ""Philips Sonicare HX9110/02 Flexcare Platinum Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush""The overall brushing exeprience is pretty much the same.  This is a good thing.  It is probably the best toothbrush I have even used even when compared to Oral B.  I prefer Sonicare.There are a couple of differences with this new model.  The cleaning types are slight different.  Last year's model has a gum care setting which produces a slower clean but with greater virbations (kind of hard to explain but feels like a massage).  This new model adds a deep clean type and I don;t see a specific gum care setting.  The other difference is with the head design.  The new model uses a different shape and bristled head that suppsoedly gives you a deeper clean.  My old heads fit is so it seems to be interchanegable with a lot of the prior designs which is good since I have a bunch of them.Overall this is a great toothbrush and would highly recommend it.  If last year's model is still available, I'd say that is equally as good so if it costs less, grab that instead,","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VT2LM3W974GE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR7YP8#wasThisHelpful","R2VT2LM3W974GE","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I woke up this morning and immediately purchased this album.  Normally I will check out new stuff on Spotify first but Riverside is one of my favorite bands and I've been gearing teasers on their Facebook page for weeks now.  One thing that jumps out when the first song comes on is the overall production is top notch.  I am listening to it through my home Sonos system which is very good quality for my ears (I am not an audiophile).  Unlike Shrine of a New Generation which had to grow on me (and has now become one of my favorite albums from them, Love, fear and the Time Machine was instantly gratifying.  The mood, like all riverside, has a dark tone to it but somehow still makes me feel good.  Guitars are a bit more prominent in the backing tracks which I am finding as a nice touch.  The guitar solos are classic Riverside which I love.  Vocals are solid and sound great.The album does not continue where Shrine left off.  In my opinion it brings back some of the older sound but with better production.  More complex, more sounds (the range of guitar sounds is much larger than anything they have done in the past).  It has a much more full sound but the way it was mixed still aloows you to hear separation of instruments.  Hard to describe but it just sounds complete.There are two slowish song on the album, Afloat and Time Travelers.  I would say Afloat is good is good but not my favorite moody/slow song.  Travellers is very nice with acoustic guitars being the most prominent instrument.Overall, a beautiful album that will take many listens o fully appreciate what went into making this.  It is much more complex than earlier material but it does not get cloudy or give up the magic that has made Riverside such a great band.  Looking forward to ""hearing"" the music now that I have gone through a full listening of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFWB0PHEEDDS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WOSHTG#wasThisHelpful","RFWB0PHEEDDS8","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so excited for this album as Dead Letter Circus has become one of my favorite bands.  The Catalyst Fire is such an incredible album so I was either expecting a complete dud or some kind of miracle with this album.  What I got was completely different.  If this was a different band, I would say that this is a great album.  For DLC, I would say it is a solid effort worthy of praise but falls a bit short to their last release.  The first single (While you Wait) that was releaesd before the album came out left me scratching my head as it just sounded way different from what I was used to.  Thankfully, that sound is not the dominant sound on this album but it probably was the best ""single"" type song.The album starts oss a little weak in my opinion.  Nothing stabds out until you get to the 4th song ""The Lie We live"".  That is when things get better.  Y A N A has to be one of my favorites right now as is Show Me.  I really can't stand the song Silence beacuse of the part where backround vocalists are singing ""Liar"".  Annoys me!  After that, the albums gets strong again and finishes out on a high note.Overall, there is something lacking in this release and what I am coming up with is something to do with the vocals.  It sounds like Benzie is using a more controlled voice in most of the songs.  He is focuing more on singing (like when he does a lot of acoustic stuff) and is not letting his voice hit all the ranges (which can sound wild at times) like on earlier albums.  Here We Divide and The Cure are examples where his signing just sounds more passionate.  However, his voice is still very strong on this album and it does, at times, show some of his range.  The weird thing I am hearing in the mix is when he signs at a higher octave, he reminds me of Jon Anderson from yes.  The Lie we Live is a good eaxmple with both the sound and delivery of the vocals.  Good thing I like Yes!This remains in my current playlist and it is soemthing I will continue to go back to.  I think any DLC is something my ears will enjoy for a long time (or at least until the new Riverside release on 9/1).  Can't wait to see how their newish lineup continues to develop on future releases!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XKH4AJV512U4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011N4CCVG#wasThisHelpful","R1XKH4AJV512U4","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun Nerf gun.  Not my favorite and not the best shooter by any means but its unique design makes it fun to shoot.  This uses a standard pump action and trigger type shooting so no batteries are needed.  It comes with 4 magazines that can be easily rotated using the secondary double loop trigger.  This is not something to be used for accuracy or distance shooting but more for closer combat.  During my testing, I was seeing a big range among the darts.  I had a few shoot straight downward at first but after several rounds, that seemed to stop.  On average, I was getting about 36 to 40 feet where the majority of the darts were landing.  They were scattered in about a 3 foor radius.  The shortest shots were coming in around 25 to 30 feet and the longest reached about 50 feet.  We have other nerf guns that easily shoot 70 feet so this one is one of the shortest we own.Weight wise, my 5 year old was able to use it with just a little effort.  My 8 year old had no issues.  We had some minor jams from time to time but I think that was user error and not the guns fault.  Overall it shoots pretty consistently without major issues.This is not something you would buy as your main battle gun but it is definitely a cool gun to own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FC15RIWTDO5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDP7R2W#wasThisHelpful","R3FC15RIWTDO5A","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used the regular Cetaphil for years...like over 15 years.  It is my final step before I shave every morning.  When I saw that Cetaphil came out with a wash specifically for men, I had to try it.  This wash is not like the regaulr one.  First, it foams up a lot more than the other cleanser.  The ingredients are completely different so I am not surprised.  Second, there is a rather strong smell that this wash has.  I can't explain what it smells like.  Something between a ""man smell"" and medicinal.  I don't like it at all and the smell lingers for quite some time.The face wash does clean very well but it leaves my face a bit dry compared to the regular formula. The claim is it keeps your face hydrated but I didn't feel that at all.  I actually felt like I needed to apply after shave balm on my face to get some hydration back.The good news is that I haven't had any negative reactions to the soap.  But I don't see me using this every day like I do the original formula.  I don't know whay Cetaphil came out with a men's only product as I don;t think it was needed.

"This sligshot is really fun.  we just got this yesterday and my kids had a blast playing with this.  It is very different from all the other nerf guns we have because it does not use a trigger.  It uses a very simple pull tab attached to a strong band that acts just like a sligshot (hence the name).  Like a few other nerf guns we have, this is a single loader but that doesn't take away from the fun of it.  In fact, every single loader we have tried has never had a jamming problem.  They shoot everytime.Accurace seems to be pretty good from about 15 feet.  After that, too many elements can interfere with it.  We couldn't get a good read on overall disctance because it was very windy outside.  I don;t think this will break any distance records for nerf guns but it is definitely not the shortest one.  I would say 25-40 feet will be average.My 5 year old was able to operate this without any issue but I found the overall design a bit uncomfortable with the grip.  From a ""game"" standpoint, this is not something you would want to carry on you.  Due to the single shot and ability to only hold one other dart, it is not practical as a main weapon.  Where it would be good is in a hiding spot where you can get that ""last shot"" when your main weapon runs out of darts.  My kids tend to put a lot of their single shot guns around the yard for this purpose.At the price point for the slingshot, it is something worth having if you collect all the nerf guns.  But again, this is not a good option for your first or primary gun for use in battles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GAWCZPTJS97G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQ7M89I#wasThisHelpful","R1GAWCZPTJS97G","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I mixed feelings about this nerf gun.  First the good stuff.  My kids really enjoy playing with this gun.  Mostly in its pistol/handgun style.  Ok, now that bad stuff.  First, we have had some issues with the slide sticking in the open position and my kids can't close it.  They think it is jammed.  It takes me a bit but I can push it forward hard enough to get it unstuck.  Second, with the extended barrel, the range is awful  Darts tend to shoot straight downward after maybe 6 feet.  Without the extended barrel, it is Ok but nowhere near the range of our other nerf guns that can reach 40 to 60 feet.  This gun is maybe 10 feet with accuracy then maybe another 10 to 20 before it finally falls.  Finally, in the holster setup, the holding of the gun and the trigger are just awkward to use.  Too bad it couldn't somehow transition to some kind of real holster.  It is more of a box gun when it is in the setup.So far, my kids have kept this in the pistol setup and find it fun to use even though range stinks.  If it wasn't for my kids enjoying it, I probably would have rated this 2 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EQL1BV4KIP96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD6KJXI#wasThisHelpful","R2EQL1BV4KIP96","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife was so happy when she saw these!  She is an art teacher (high school) and she actually uses this type of scissor in her class.  Due to limited budgets, her orders are usually the bare minimum so if a single item gets broken or stolen, that means someone in her class has to go without that items.  Unfortunately (and rather scary) scissors are on that list.The quality of these scissors is on par with what she normally buys through the school so no complaints there.  The holder itself is small enough that it doesn;t take up a lot of space.  And the color options are also very nice especially if you have young kids doing projects at home.  My wife tends to host arts and crafts parties for our kids and friends so this product gives a nice variety to make both boys and girls happy.Overall, these scissors will remian at our house for those arts and crafts moments.  Hopefully my wife won't need to dig into these for replacements anytime soon at her school but it is nice to have that option so no child goes without something at school.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35KFQWA1S5O2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TUE7RHQ#wasThisHelpful","R35KFQWA1S5O2V","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife uses grocery store bought reusable bags which are made from recycles plastic.  They generally last a few months before they start to break down and require replacing.  They cost her around $10 for a set of 3 I believe.  When I got these canvas bags, she stated how great these were compared to the ones she normally uses.  Overall, these are heavy duty bags, look decent and hold a lot more weight than the recyled plastic type we have been using.  For the price, the 3 pack is less than what 2 canvas bags sell for around my area.  Very happy with these and they have offcially made it into the weekly shopping ritual","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QAIXF27QQT78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGQAA9S#wasThisHelpful","R3QAIXF27QQT78","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I finnaly applied this pest cntrol this past weekend and so far it seems to be working.  Every year around this time I do my usual spraying around the foundation of my house to keep the ant population in control.  I normally use an Ortho product that needs to be applied only once a season.  So I can't comment on how long this stuff lasts but at least it works initially.A few things1.  This did not kill on contact for me.  I had a lot of black ants (non-carpenter ants) that were crawling on my brick steps.  I sprayed them and they easily walked around for close to 5 minutes.  However, within that time, I could see them slow down and finally die.  So it works, just not instantly for me.2.  This stuff smells! - When I opened the bottle, the smell was overpowering.  After I sprayed it, I could even smell it in my house a little.  This is not a friendly type product that smells like lemons, it is a pesticide.  But it works!3. The bottle made 2 gallons for me.  Enough for my foundation and a few other areas around my property using my sprayer.  The size of the concentrated bottle makes it easy to store and dispose.  Very happy with the packaging.As long as the ants don;t return within a few weeks, I will continue using this.  The size of the bottle is the big selling point for me as long as it works.  Keeping fingers crossed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QON64DWFDCAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKTAROQ#wasThisHelpful","R1QON64DWFDCAA","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used Cyberlink products for years.  Mostly the Power director software for editing home movies.  A few of those versions I've owned came bundled with power DVD but this is the first time I have every used a standalone product like this.  Other than older versions I have through my other bundles, the only other video software I;ve used on my current desktop is windows media player.  Compard to that, this software opens and plays everything much more quickly.  All f the videos I have on my computer fall into either backed up DVD's (so quality os not HD), HD videos shot with various camcorders using 1080 and up to 60fps and some videos taking on my Iphone.  Windows Media Player can play most of them fairly well with maybe the exception of the 60fps ones where I get some choppy type playback at times.  PowerDVD plays those fine.I haven't played any 4K material yet as I don;t have any on my computer so I can;t comment on that.  One of my friends works for a compnay that is at the forefront of 4k technoligies so I will hopefully get some stuff from him to test through his company's website.The big question is who will buy this?  This is expensive software for most people and it basically only does playback.  Sure, it does every single format out their so you reduce the hassle of downloading codecs or whatever but most people simply watch YouTube or play back basic DVD's or Blue Rays on their computers.  And most computers will come with software that support their drives.  I think the biggest benefit of this software will be the 4K support but we are still so early in adotping 4K standards that this software will only be needed by a small percentage of people today.  If you are feeding a home entertainment system through a PC then this software is very nice to have.  Again, not sure a large percentage of people do this as most use standalone players or game systems but there are some that have the full HTPC setup.I will post back once I have a chance to play around with 4K video.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FQOJ53T1GD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV3VCLC#wasThisHelpful","R1FQOJ53T1GD1","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been a while since my college days with a red Solo cup but I got a bit nostalgic while using this the first time.  Granted, this is a bit more upscale than the Solo cup but at least it brought back some memories!  The claim here is that the design will somehow keep a beverage cold for up to 8 hours.  There is absolutely no way I will be able to test this claim as a beer will last, on average, maybe 8 minutes when I am drinking one!  With that said, I actually haven't used this for alcoholic beverages just yet but I have used it for various water based drinks such as water and water with artificial sweetner/flavor packets that are probably doing more harm to my body than beer is.  What I can say is that the 16 ounces of liquid that I put into this cup remains cold from beginning to end.  I usually add some ice, then water from my fridge which somewhat dissolves the ice and by the end, the ice is still there.I would say that the design with the stainless steel is keeping my beverage cold throughout it's life cycle.  Perhaps one day I will find a beer that will require a full 8 hour drinking session to complete a 16 ounce bottle.  If I do, I will gladly test the 8 hour claim on this party cup.  But for now, I will be happy sitting around my pool drinking from this and remembering my young days back in college.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20WTFGURRBZOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLNX6K8#wasThisHelpful","R20WTFGURRBZOI","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cleaner did not work at all for me at cleaning vinyl siding.  In the past I have used a few products similar to this have that have done a great job of cleaning my siding.  The downside has always been the strong presence of bleach in those products.  USing them means you have to be careful when spraying it so you don;t ruin clothes or get fumes up your nose.  This Scotts one does not have the strong odor of bleach but, unfortunately, it did not clean any of the mildew off my siding.Now, to be fair, the bottle does state that some scrubbing might be necessary.  I did not do any scrubbing at all but simply sprayed it on, let it sit and then rinsed off.  Nothing came off.  I will try and upload some before and after pics if I can find the old review page where you can upload.One additional item I did not like.  I could not find a way to get a strong stream that is capable of reaching high on a house.  Other products I've used have the ability to shoor the water almost to the top of my 2 story house.  This barely shooter 6 feet.  And to rinse, you have to remove the bottle completely whereas other ones I've used have the ability to pass water through and use the bottles powerful stream to rinse.  Not here.Overall, I can't recommend this product at this time.  I will give it another shot to see if scrubbing works any better but that still puts this product at a disadvantage over others on the market.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D4AP38VHIPJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3ZO2YS#wasThisHelpful","R3D4AP38VHIPJF","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first coloring book that we have tried that works alongside an app to show the picture in a more animated 3d type way.  My kids were excited because it is Skylanders.  They love everything to do about Skylanders.  When we first got it, my 8 year old tried getting the cryons out and proceeded to rip the main cover.  Great start.  My wife told me we have other Crayola books like this and it happens frequently. Perhaps Crayola should rethink how they package the crayons.My youngest started out on a picture using the ""special"" color crayon that is the main color that the app uses to add the live action type look in the app.  while he was doing that, we downloaded the app onto our Ipad and opened it up.  It was a bit tricky at first as the directions did not provide us with what we were seeing in the app.  So each step was rather useless.  Finally, after a lot of trial and error, we got the special crayon to be recognized and we saw the first picture my kids colored.  They loved what they saw and then proceeded to color every picture in the book.Since the first day of coloring, my kids have not gone back to use the app at all.  It was like they were now done with it.  I suppose that is Ok as these books are priced very low.  It's not like spending $50 on a video game that they never play.  We may look to get some of the other versions of this but I don;t see it as anything more than one time use....just like other coloring books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJHT2735QIXIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PMAPYCW#wasThisHelpful","RJHT2735QIXIN","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm not surprised as the issues I've had with other ones tend to be with the main food item in it like steak whereas this one if mostly rice and vegetables. The chicken in it is small enough to not overpower the taste but I find the chicken actually tastes pretty good anyway.

"It's OK.  This is one of the larger portion packs so you can feed up to 3 people.  Realistically, it will feed 2 adults.  The steak is a bit chewy and the flavor has a fake taste but it is not terrible.  I found a bit of hot sauce added (a staple for any zombie apocalypse) made this taste much better.  It will not be my first choice to eat when camping or in an emergency but I've had much worse than this.One downside is the amount of water it takes to heat.  This requires 1 3/4 cups of water.  Most I've had require 1 cup so this one requires additional heating of water if you are using something like a jetboil.  The larger Jetboil will do up to 2 cups I think (I don't have the large one) as would most camping travel kettle pots but if you travel very lightly, your water boiler might not be big enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35EKFFDRQQZ49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RJM2GX6#wasThisHelpful","R35EKFFDRQQZ49","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is not my favorite Boomco gun but still fun.  Unlike the others I have that use an internal spring type system to shoot the darts, this one uses a pump action.  First, it is super easy to pump so even small kids can easily shoot with it.  The nerf style pump guns require a bit more force so I would say BOOMco has an edge for kids that don't have a lot of strength.  The accuracy is OK from short distances if you pump it carefully and slowly.  Otherwise, it can go anywhere.  But the side effect of this is you don't get much distance or speed on the dart.  If you are trying for distance, you need to angle to gun up higher to produce a higher arc than the spring loaded ones.Overall, it is still a fun gun to shoot and for the money, it is something BOOMco fans should add.  It is very small and light so pretty much anyone can use it.  Just don't rely on this for your main ""battle"" gun since accuracy is compromised over longer distances and the fact that it is a single shooter that requires a reload after each shot.  It will be good for the last ditch effort!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4Y1SPO57Y2UR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJYI822#wasThisHelpful","R4Y1SPO57Y2UR","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my second Boomco gun.  We have another one that uses a rotary type handle to reset the gun which has been very fun to use.  This one uses a cartridge that holds 6 darts but I believe you can buy bigger cartridges that hold more.  I appreciate the idea behind the cartridge and my kids love the way it works but I do find it a bit ""off"" sometimes when you place the cartridge back in after reloading.  If you don;t push it down far enough you may go too far making one of the darts not shootable since it is past the firing pin.  Not a huge deal and I'm sure we will get the hang out of it eventually.Like out other gun, this has great range and can easily shoot 60 feet as we have tested this in our backyard.  Some people don;t like the ""drinking straw"" type material of the darts but I find them totally fine and they seem to hold up well.  The included target is the only thing we can find that these actually stock to.  But my kids hardly use it as they would prefer to shoot any other things than just the target.The value of the Boomco guns in very good.  We have many Nerf guns as well which get expensive.  I find the Boomco works just as well as the nerf guns and my kids don't have a preference as long as they are having fun.  If cost is an issue, these are an awesome substitute for Nerf.  I just picked up two sets of 40 darts (2 different colors) that I'm sure my kids will love.  I have a feeling we will probably upgrade our guns to some of the bigger ones that Boomco offers as my kids like them that much","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKH2FKW8LGM74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJYHTCC#wasThisHelpful","RKH2FKW8LGM74","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am in total shock with this album.  Been a fan of Steven Wilson for years but mostly with his non-solo projects.  Porcupine Tree remains one of my favorite bands and I've been thoroughly disappointed with most of Steven's solo work and collaborations since he put PT on hiatus.  The last two solo releases left me underwhelmed due to their overly progressive and somewhat disjointed sound.  A lot of his work has been non-accessible lately so you truly have to believe that he can do no wrong to love it.Hand.Cannot.Erase breaks that streak for me.  The first track started and I was immediately thinking it was going to be the same.  But all of a sudden the entire sound seemd to change and I was blown away with it.  I'm not a music major so not sure on the right terms but this album has a different tone than his last few.  While the subject matter is rather dark, I don;t get that anxious feeling from the music like I do with his other solor stuff.  This is a pure pleasure to listen to.As I prgressed through the album, most of the first few songs continued with this.  And the woman singer on the album is fanatastic and brings another dimension to the sound.  There isn;t one song that I dislike.  A few towrds the end have their ""Steven Wilson"" moments but all of them have parts that are incredble.I am glad I didn;t discount this album before I gave it a try.

"I keep a few cases of these in my house for emergency purposes.  Living in the northeast, esepcially in 2015, we get hit hard during the winter and frequently lose power.  These are used for quick and easy to make meals during those times as we usually can still boil water on out stove.  I also bring these when I go camping as they pack easy and don;t take up much space.This was the first ever breakfast version I tried.  The packaging is basically air packed so it has no evtra bulk compared to the other mountain house ones I usually get.  Once opened, you simply add a cup of boiling water, stir, wait about 5 minutes and you are ready to eat.  I am usually the type of breaksaft eater that prefers my eggs separate from everything else so this was a bit different in that it is a medley of stuff all thrown together.  Surprisngly, I enjoyed it.  It doesn't have a terrible salty taste like you would get from things like raman noodles.  This is pure dehydrated food so you get real food.  At first I thought the eggs didn't fully rehydrate as I was getting some addtional ""texture"" but then I realized that it was the has brown pieces.  It became a good combo.

"These are a great way to introduce little ones to the alphabet.  For toddlers not quite old enough to really start reading, they act as a fun ""toy"" by letting them stick them on a fridge or other magnetic surface.

I still prefer a utility knife but these are a bit safer to use when kids are around....I think!.  These also work great on denim as we have used them to cut up old jeans to make into chew toys for our beagles.They are light, comfortable and the protective sheath that comes with them holds nice and tight when not in use.  The closest pair of scissor I have ever used that cut as well as these are the Cutco ones we have that can cut through a penny.

Nothing fancy at all and probably similar to what others have and the surround mix is great on the blue ray.  The concert is probably my favorite other than Score.  Hearing them play with a symphony again is just awesome and this one is special since a few of the band actually went and/or taught at Berkley.The only negative about the disc is lack of any extra content.

"I bought these twice for my two beagles.  Both times, one of the chews was broken in half.  This is the only reason I don;t give it 5 stars.  However, it does allow me to get a ""2"" treats per dog rather than an odd amount.  My beagles love these and they last longer than any other chew we have tried including 12"" bully sticks.  There is no smell with these either which is great.  The part that my dogs love the most is when these get chewed down to a smaller size.  You can put these in the microwave for about a minute or so and they will expand to rather funny shapes and sizes.  The end product looks like a big cheese ball/puff that now becomes much more edible/chewable for the dog.  Like a popcorn ball of cheese.  My dog go nuts when they smell it.  The cooked smell is actually quite pleasant.We have tried a few other brands of these but this specifc package seems to be of better quality overall so that is why I ordered this a second. time.

"This thing saved me from a nightmare time when changing dishwashers.  The store wanted $280 to install my new dishwasher (plumber and electrician were supposedly needed).  The electrical was not really needed as I can do that but the plumbing part scared me.  I needed to go from a solid copper pipe connection to a flexi hose style which meant cutting off the old copper pipe and figuring out a way to connct the new flexi hose.  Thankfully, a friend of mine told me about these where you simply push it onto the copper end with no need to solder it.  The flexi end just screwed onto the other end and it was done.  No leakes, easy to use and it gave me a secondary shutoff on case the primary one fails for some reason.

"I bought one of these for each of my beagles.  They are about 10 months old and already wore out their cheaper collars.  I bought this one from Amazon and another one from a local pet store (mom and pop shop).  These are a nice thick collar that provide a bit more strength compared to thinner styles.  The material is nice and heavy and has a refelctive nature to them for anyone who walks their dogs at night.  I also bought matching leashes that go with the collars and they have the same reflective nature to them as well.The clasp on this collar is very strong and easy to use.  I feel that it is more secure then the plastic one on the smaller collars we had.  The loop for the leash is very big which makes it easy to hook, especially when you have eager beagles jumping around to go outside.  The leashes has an awesome latch that works well with the collars.

Compared to other brands I've used, these just seem to be a much higher quality.  I am finding that I don;t need to change patches as often when cleaning as these absorb more.

"I use 3 in one oil on my Jeep for various suspension components as well as assistance at lossening rusty bolts.  My usual go to is PB blaster but there are times when I can't spray it in my garage and properly air it out due to weather outside.  So 3 and one is my go to.  This brand seems to be a little thinner than others that I have used which means dripping it on a joint end can be a little messier.  However, one benefit to it is for the few greasble joints I still have where 3 and one oil is needed (vs. a standard grease gun).  A few of my control arm joints use a very small screw that comes out so you can add oil into the joint.  The recommneded oil is a 3 and One.  It usually is difficult to do but the thinner viscocity of this oil makes it easier to fill.  Not sure how well it will hold up over time if these joints went ungreased but I usually don't let them go too long so I doubt it will be a problem.Everyone should keep something like this handy as you never know when you will need help breaking a rusty bolt free.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX43TI8C0XF4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J25JD6Q#wasThisHelpful","RX43TI8C0XF4B","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second crank radio that I own.  I few years back my wife started a ""survival pack"" for me as I like to take camping trips where there is little to no cell service, electric, water, etc...  My first one is a Kato radio that has crank, solar and a/c capabilties for charging.  It also has HAM radio access which is essential for a true emergency.This radio does not have solar or a/c ways of charging it so you are stuck with just a hand crank.  However, the radio charges very quickly and gives you about 10 minutes of use with just a minute of cranking.  My other radio requires significantly more cranks to get that kind of charge.  The directions claim that a full battery will yield 2 and a half hours of use which is amazing.  And 1 minute of crank will give you about 30 minutes of flashlight use.  Again, that is amazing.I would give this 5 stars if it had HAM radio.  I can overlook the solar since most of thise cheap solar panels on electronics require ""perfect"" days to actually charge.  As a standalone radio for use while camping, this does a great job.  I was able to easily find plenty of radio stations at my house which is usually hard so the antenna seems to work well.  But, for true emergencies, I would prefer to have HAM access since it's those operators that tend to give the best updates.  And in some cases, the only updates.Overall, for the size, it is a great radio for anyone that camps or just wants music/radio access if the power goes out.  The flashlight is ""OK"".  Nothing great but I wouldn't expect a full blown flood light for a device this small.  It is good enough to use for walking in the dark to avoid tripping over stuff directly in front of you.  Similar to an smart phone flash when used as a flashlight.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CJQFL2KT7DZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTRVO12#wasThisHelpful","R1CJQFL2KT7DZJ","AC1YLEFC9AN5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC1YLEFC9AN5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have the LeapPad 2 for both our kids.  Our youngest is almost 5 and he uses his more than my almost 8 year old.  This rainforest game seems to be a good fit for his age.  The game so far is similar to a lot of the console type side scrolling games (with also the ability to climb various things).  He is only through the first level which has multiple sub levels to it.  The goal is to find the largest rodent during your journey.  You run, jump and climb while collecting diamonds/jewels.  Along the way you will find various animals/reptiles and the game will ask you a bunch of questions about what you just found.  It is a nice way to teach young kids some of the main characteristics of mammals, reptiles, etc...So far the game is a bit repetitive but there are a couple of fun things thrown in like levels where you shrink and ride a dragonfly to get through a certain area.  Overall, my youngest son enjoys the game and hopefully he is learning a bit along the way.The game runs fine of the Leappad 2 with no noticeable lag or issues that I've seen.  This is another great game for kids to play and learn.  Not many systems offer that these days, especially as kids get older.  Hopefully as my son progresses in the game, it will keep his interest.

My youngest son is always taking them to play with and build his own stuff which aggravates his older brother.  Sharing them has worked but it always results in one of them getting mad because they don;t have enough tiles to finish something.  This set seemed like a good option to get for my younger son for his own set.  They are a different brand from what we already have so I was very interested in comparing quality.It is a very nice set that is actually larger than the original Magnatile brand set we have.  The building options are basically limitless.  Like our other set, the magnets in the tiles are very strong and hold together nicely.  They are much higher quality than some of the other brands we have tried but probably equal to the Magantile brand  The plastic on them is so strong that I don't worry about them being stepped on.

He thinks he may have found an out when he meets his violent double in his own home.When it turns out that Nick is in New Hampshire not Boston when Tess saw him, she wants to investigate. Her friend Lili agrees to help her, and it becomes even stranger when  Lili also finds that she has a double. Their search leads them to an elegant townhouse on Beacon Hill where events begin to spin out of control.If you like ghosts, paranormal, and horror movies, you love this book.

"Even on Christmas Eve, a farmer's work continues. Casey lives on a farm with her animal and equipment friends. They're all looking forward to Christmas: decorating the farm, making cookies, putting up stockings, and preparing for the celebration.On Christmas Eve Casey still has to feed the animals, and when a fence needs mending she has to take care of it. On top of all the work, Casey feels ill and falls asleep before the preparations for Christmas are complete. It could be a very disappointing Christmas, but Casey has good friends on the farm.I love stories about farms probably because I grew up on one and live on one. If you don't live on a farm, it's hard to envision how much work has to be done every day to keep the animals fed, the equipment working, and the fences mended. This is a good book for children. It shows them a different way of life, unless they live on a farm.The book has a good message about the importance of friends and family.

Jake is the kind of almost too good man you'd love to know, and Lizzie has her own rebellious charm.The plot is a bit thin. There are no major catastrophes.

"When his father dies, Pete is left trying to manage Java Jive and hold down his regular job. Recruiting his ex-girlfriend, Juliette, as the new manager seems like a perfect solution. Juliette had her own cafÃ© before her fiancÃ© ran off with her cash and forced her to close.Juliette is experienced, but she's not totally ready for the fact that some of the staff, particularly the cook, just don't want her there. She's planning to get around the staff problem when the cook turns up dead, and she's afraid that she's the primary suspect.The plot is amusing and fast paced. It's fairly easy to figure out what's happening, but there are twists that keep it amusing. The setting in a coffeehouse is realistic and makes a good background for the unusual characters that populate the novel.Although the antics are amusing, I found Juliette too adventurous and naïve. She jumps to the conclusion that she must be the principal suspect and drags Pete along to help her solve the mystery before the police do. I did love Gertie, Pete's grandmother.

"Written by ten-year-old Theresa Seidltz, Countdown to Christmas tells the story of her family's Christmas tradition. Each night from the first of December, the family sings, Come of Come Emmanuel, reads a Bible story, and hangs an ornament on their small tree. The ornaments bear the likeness of the person the story is about. As the family progresses through the Bible from Adam and Eve, to Abraham and Sarah, Saul and David, and Jesus, the tree becomes adorned with the people who helped shape Judaism and Christianity.The stories in the book are short, each being one page. They're suitable for an adult to read to younger children, but older children could read them for themselves or read them aloud to younger brothers and sisters. Each story is accompanied by a drawing introducing the characters. At the end of the book, the family places the final ornament for Jesus and sings Silent Night. The paper ornaments are included in the book and could be used for many years.I highly recommend this book. It's a good way for families to be together to enjoy the religious aspects of the Christmas season. It's also a good time for parents and children to talk about the Bible stories and what they mean in their own lives.I received this book from PR by the Book for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1855SK05COKD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0985243961#wasThisHelpful","R1855SK05COKD4","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dr. Amens is a practicing psychiatrist who was one of the first to use SPECT scans in diagnosing and treating patients. SPECT scans were originally intended for research purposes. Using these scans to diagnose patients mental problems was innovative and controversial. I found it fascinating because when I did research in the mental health field there was always the nagging feeling that the diagnosis categories were too broad. It would have been helpful to have a basis on which to make specific treatment suggestions. However, much as I admire Dr. Amen for using this technique, I recognize that it isn't perfect.The book is written at a level that makes it relatively easy for the average reader to understand brain function. The SPECT scans included in this book make clear where the brain defects are located and are a useful adjunct to the text.Problems with the brain come in a variety of guises from ADD, to anxiety, Alzheimers and schizophrenia. In addition there are brain injuries such as concussion and problems stemming from tumors and other abnormalities. Dr. Amen goes into each of these areas, explains which parts of the brain are affected and suggests treatment plans. Although he does use psychoactive drugs, he also uses talk therapy, natural substances, and understanding you life's purpose.I highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning about brain function. Some of the exercises may even be helpful in giving you a better understanding of your personality and functioning.I received this book from Blogging for Books for this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3WHSUF5AXDCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=110190464X#wasThisHelpful","R3WHSUF5AXDCZ","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Women helped to form the Judeo-Christian culture, and the Bible is filled with their stories, both good and bad. (Wicked can mean both very bad and very good. Sometimes that's confusing.) However, in the stories from the Bible there's no confusion about who was evil and who was good. The stories range from Eve in the Garden of Eden and Jezebel, the wicked queen, to Deborah, Ruth and Esther.The author tells the stories in narrative form giving thoughts and actions to the characters. Of course, no one can know today what these women thought, but reading the stories like a novel is fun, and it makes you wonder about the underlying basis of the stories. I couldn't help thinking about the role Adam played in getting them expelled from Eden.At the end of each story the author goes into a short description of the culture of the times. I found these very interesting, and they added depth to my understanding of the context of the Bible stories. There is also a section giving questions that can be used in group Bible study.

"Lucy Ailling loves her job. She works for Sid, one of the most respected antique dealers in Chicago. Most of her work centers on keeping Sid's inventory and meeting customers, but Lucy has a side line. From her earliest childhood, she has lost herself in books feeling that they are more her friends than the people she knows. Now she finds old editions and sells them from Sid's shop. The problem is that some of the editions may not have the provenance she provides.At the opening of the story, Lucy meets James, a promising young attorney. They become romantically involved, and through James, Lucy meets his grandmother, Helen. When Lucy's sideline begins to unravel, Helen hires her to be her companion on a trip to England where Helen must deal with her own secrets. Visiting some of the sites famous for the BrontÃ« novels and the places where the BrontÃ« sisters lived, a friendship is born and both ladies realize that they must redeem past mistakes.The book is filled with sensual descriptions. If you want to experience England through the senses, you'll enjoy this book. I found the Lucy's character somewhat bland. She's very focused on her conman father and the gift he gave her for the love of books, but he gave her other gifts as well, and Lucy isn't very good at distinguishing helpful from disruptive. James is a good foil for Lucy, He's kind and loving, but I didn't feel that his personality added much to the story except to put Lucy in touch with his grandmother. Sid, while being a good role model, seems to leave Lucy too much to her own devices thereby setting the stage for the problems that follow.I enjoyed the book because I love literature and because it was refreshing to read a romance that didn't require numerous bedroom scenes.I reviewed this book for Thomas Nelson.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10S9SRY9H6NQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401689752#wasThisHelpful","R10S9SRY9H6NQ1","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Karen Vail and her fiancÃ©, Robbie Hernandez, are enjoying a quiet date. Hearing two gunshots, they rush into the street where they stumble across the body of an FBI agent. Karen sees the perp running away, shoots, hits him and causes a major explosion. This incident pulls Karen into an undercover assignment linked to terrorists trying to take over the United States and Europe.The historical link is the Codex, an ancient scroll that could change the history of Judaism and Christianity. The terrorists want the scroll, but so does the US Government. Looking for the scroll and trying to root out the terrorists take Karen and her team from the US to Europe and to the Near East.The book is a fast, paced-action thriller. The action sequences are very well done and there are many of them. However, some parts of the novel are disappointing. Karen Vail, the FBI Profiler who has been featured in some of Jacobson's previous novels, is not as forceful as usual. Some of her internal monologues are simplistic and detract from her mission.I was also disappointed in the role given the Codex. I love historical mysteries and looked forward to this one, but the Codex turned out to be a subplot. We get glimpses of it from time to time, but it plays a minor role in the action.The part I most enjoyed was Jacobson's discussions of terrorism. It's worth reading the book to become involved in how terrorist networks perform in western countries. The book was enjoyable, but I wish the balance between the historical mystery and the present day terrorist activities had been more equal.I reviewed this book for Net Galley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBU0YV0UBMLU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1504003632#wasThisHelpful","RBU0YV0UBMLU4","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It makes for a lively, fast paced read. If you enjoy romance that has more than just bedroom scenes, you'll enjoy this book. The sisters are all different. The author has managed to make each one a realistic character.The author has included some culture references that make it seem like he's working too hard to raise the book above the level of a quick read. For me, it didn't work. The story is about the sisters. He does a good job portraying them and how they react to the difficult situations in their lives.

"Churchill was a man uniquely suited to the role he played in WWII. He was a warlord and a statesman, a unique combination that gave him the personality to lead his nation through one of the worst periods in world history. The question this book seeks to answer is: What made Churchill that way?Three periods of Churchill's life are the focus of the book: war, empire and peace. In the section on war, the author highlights Churchill's experiences during the Boer War and the war in the Sudan. Here he saw the horror or modern warfare against the traditional tactics of earlier generations. It gave him a dislike for scientific warfare, but also the realization that the challenge must be met. He also realized that more than a soldier he had to be a statesman to affect the outcome of world conflict. This section was my favorite and has lessons that we can help us today.Churchill believed in democracy. People should be allowed to rule themselves, but he was also a staunch supporter of the empire. The empire gave Britain status in the world that Churchill was loath to lose.In peacetime, he was less successful in leading the country. Being a firm believer in constitutionality, he disliked Socialism. Although it cost him political office, he staunchly criticized Socialism believing that it was bad for the country.This is an excellent book. Not only does it present a comprehensive look at the events that formed Churchill and how he used his experiences, it gives us lessons for today that we should understand. I highly recommend the book.I reviewed this book for Booklook Bloggers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14EZ914K3RSAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595555307#wasThisHelpful","R14EZ914K3RSAV","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Twain's End is a novel, but based on  extensive research done by Lynn Cullen. Mark Twain was an exceptionally talented writer, but his real life persona, Samuel Clemens, was far from the kindly old man telling marvelous stories. In fact, he was irritable, crotchety, and difficult. He was also a womanizer.The story is told largely from the point of view of Isabel Lyon, his longtime secretary, whose extensive diaries gave Cullen the picture of the Twain household. Lyon came to work for Twain when his family was in tatters. His wife was fragile and ill, his daughters and his finances out of control. Isabel managed to turn things around and fell in love with Twain. When his wife died, she thought that marriage might be in the offing. Twain, however, had other ideas.Twain was  fond of young girls. One of his special favorites was Helen Keller. He supported her through a crisis in her writing career and enjoyed her company. I found the portrait of Keller and her relationship with the Macys one of the most interesting parts of the book. Her original teacher, Annie, Sullivan, was married to John Macy. Together the three of them formed a literary partnership.If you enjoy well researched historical fiction, I highly recommend this book. The characters from Twain to Helen Keller present an intimate portrait I would never have suspected. The character of Isabel Lyon is based on her diaries where she is clearly unhappy, hoping for more of a relationship with Twain than he offered. I found her thoughts circled constantly on the same topic and made it difficult to like her, although I felt sorry for her.The settings from Twain's mansion to the streets of New York capture the flavor of the era and enhance the picture of the characters and their lifestyle.I reviewed this book for Net Galley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EQWUJXKLHV3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476758964#wasThisHelpful","R3EQWUJXKLHV3M","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kara Cooney called her book, The Woman Who Would be King, a social history because she takes the liberty of imagining what Hatshepstu thought and felt. The book isn't fiction. It's a well researched narrative about the reign of a remarkable woman by an Egyptologist who has studied the period extensively.A woman pharaoh was unknown in Egypt before Hatshepsut. Other women had ruled for more or less extensive periods of time as regents; however, she ruled as the senior pharaoh with her stepson, Thutmose III, for twenty-two years. The period of their joint reign was marked by prosperity and extensive influence in the ancient world. There is no indication that she denied power to Thutmose III, rather it appears that they had a mutually agreeable arrangement.In addition to the portrait of Hatshepsut, Cooney gives a detailed picture of what life was like for a royal princess. It reads almost like a good novel and enhances our understanding of Hatshepsut without taking liberties with her thoughts or feelings.I thought Cooney did an excellent job of pointing out where she was taking liberties with the historical record. Her ideas about Hatshepsut's inner life make the book more readable, but she also gives the reader a chance to view the facts. The book has extensive notes that allow the interested reader to go more in depth and to test Cooney's conclusions.I highly recommend this book if you enjoy reading about ancient Egypt. It's very well written. The pace is good. You may find it hard to put down.I reviewed this book for Blogging for Books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RQXJVEO95AUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307956776#wasThisHelpful","R1RQXJVEO95AUZ","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Elia, a lit student, is infatuated with Cameron Beck's masterpiece, Secrets of Odysseus. The book is a compilation of poems Beck wrote to his mysterious muse, but no one knows who she is. Elia is determined to find out. She desperately wants to know what love is and Cameron seems to have the answer.In a coffee house one night before the end of term, she thinks she hears Beck read a new poem. The poem is left behind when the poet vanishes. Elia rescues it and now is determined to find Beck. The search leads her to a remote Caribbean Island. The islanders have befriended Beck and resent the stranger's intrusion, but she persists.This love story is told from several perspectives. Elia is the protagonist in the present day, but we also see Cameron. In the past, we see him and his lost love. Usually, I find stories told in two time periods don't work well. However, in this case with the secret of lost love as the thread holding the story together, it works well.Elia is a delightfully naive character. She is desperately searching for the meaning of love, but she is also capable of determination to see her adventure through to completion. Beck is a more nebulous character. We glimpse his total infatuation with his lover, but in the present day he is more subdued yet willing to part with his secret to the right person.The characters who inhabit the island: Isabella, the island matriarch, Fatty, the medical doctor with a drug habit, Paco, the cantina owner, and Falcon, the pilot, are extremely well drawn. Each is unique and each fits the setting perfectly. They were some of the best parts of the book.If you enjoy an adventure wrapped in a romance, you'll enjoy this book.I reviewed this book for PR by the Book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34G56Z8NM94EY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990320006#wasThisHelpful","R34G56Z8NM94EY","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although FDR left no detailed memoir giving the reasons for his political decisions, Daniels has captured his words and used them in the context of events to give us a picture of what FDR thought. The book opens with a brief view of Franklin's early life, but the concentration is on his political career. While I had read several biographies of Roosevelt, this is the first one to go in depth about his early office holding. I found it instructive in light of his later political ideas including the New Deal.I also found it fascinating to read about how FDR was able to control the information about his polio and was able to act as normal as possible. It's enlightening to see how he overcome his affliction.On the positive side, this is a very detailed, perhaps definitive, look at FDR. Because there is so much detail from quotes to actions to what other historians have said about him, it is a sometime difficult book to read. However, if you're interested in a comprehensive history, this is it.On the negative side, because the book is crammed with historical detail it is sometimes hard to read. I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're interested in becoming immersed in FDRs life.The book ends before the US enters WWII. Although the transitions seems rather abrupt when you've been following the history closely, it leaves you wanting to go more in depth into the next segment of FDRs career.If you enjoy history, this is an extremely well done book. I highly recommend it.I reviewed this book for Net Galley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CR6YTI4Y1TZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0252039513#wasThisHelpful","R3CR6YTI4Y1TZ5","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wes Avery, a tail gunner during WWII, is a good man. He loves his wife and daughter and works hard at his Texaco Station not far from McCoy Air Force base near Orlando, Florida. His wife, Sarah, has not been the same since her hysterectomy. Now with an approaching hurricane, she is withdrawing from reality and popping pills.His daughter Charlotte is in her senior year of high school. She's caught up in being selected as a member of the homecoming court and falling in love with Emilio, a Cuban refugee boy. Avery likes the boy well enough, but Sarah doesn't want Charlotte associating with him. This creates tension in the family and raises the specter of the family secret.As if the approaching hurricane weren't enough, Avery notices the buildup of aircraft, including U2 stealth aircraft, at McCoy. This is the start of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Everyone is worried, but it affects Sarah especially.The description of Florida at the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis is excellent. For anyone alive at the time, it will bring back memories; for younger people, it provides a glimpse of what life was like at the time.Wes Avery, the main character, is well done. He's struggling with a family situation he doesn't understand, trying to manage his gas station, and keep his fear for his family in check. The other characters, Sarah and Charlotte, felt sketchy. Sarah is a fairly typical wife and mother caught in the trap of too many pills and a harrowing time. Charlotte makes only fleeting appearances except for the beginning and end.I enjoyed the book for the glimpse of history and recommend it for that reason. Some of the plot didn't work for me. The family secret seemed to be dragged in at the end, and the conclusion wasn't satisfying.I reviewed this book for BantamDell.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JRYE6ZPGBAMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080417654X#wasThisHelpful","R1JRYE6ZPGBAMY","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brueggemann's thesis is that it is necessary to deal with the human rights issues before the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be resolved. He uses the Bible to trace the history of the claims to the land Israel now occupies and tries to draw conclusions about the legitimacy of Israel's claim and the counter claim of the Palestinians.Although he discusses the conflict in terms of the oppression of the Palestinians and the idea that the Israelis are the chosen people of God, I didn't think he did enough in depth discussion to prove his points beyond a superficial level that most people are familiar with.The topic is relevant to the political situation today. I was interested to see how Brueggemann would address the fact that Israel is placed in an extremely dangerous situation and that the Palestinians have religious and secular ties to Israel's neighbors.Although the book makes some good points, I was disappointed in the shallowness of the presentation. For me, the more relevant discussion today is the terrible human suffering wrecked upon the region by ISIS.

"The stories of seven women living out their Christian faith in difficult circumstances are awe inspiring. I was pleased that Metaxas picked women who chose to do what they felt called to do as women. They didn't try to be men or compete with men. They used their female strengths: love, giving, mothering, and compassion. They didn't plan to be heroines. They did the work they felt God called them to do.I was familiar with some of the women's stories: Joan of Arc, Rosa Parks and Mother Theresa. I hadn't heard of the other women: Susanna Wesley, mother of John and Charles Wesley; Corrie ten Boom, who suffered in a concentration camp for helping Jews during WWII; Hannah More, who worked with Wilberforce to abolish the slave trade; and Saint Maria of Paris, who served the poor in spite of her eccentric ways, marriages, and collisions with church doctrine.Each woman had a story to tell and Metaxas did an excellent job of bringing them to life in a short biography. I found each one easy to read bringing out the highlights of the woman's life and showing them as real people with severe problems but living out their faith.I highly recommend this book for both women and men.

Charles, an ambitions, middle-class, young man, has been in love with Georgia since freshman year, but she sees him only as a friend. Alice, a brilliant, unstable girl, has been best friends with Georgia, but she's jealous and after the murder leaks the information about Georgia's affair.Storrow and Julie Patel were locked in a dispute about what was appropriate for the professor to teach.  Because of the disagreement, he becomes the focus of the murder investigation.The characters in this book are very well drawn and in the beginning pull you into the story.

Meanwhile, the author explores the backstory on each of the characters.I enjoyed the beginning of the book, but quickly got tired of waiting for the murder and detection to start. Even after the dead girl is discovered, the plot goes back to the friends and the professor and we get only small peeks at the process of trying to solve the murder.Instead of solving the crime.

"Sumner Jackson, a renowned surgeon, head of the American Hospital in Paris, hates what the Nazis are doing to his beloved Paris. An American, he grew to love Paris after marrying his Swiss wife, Toquette. They and their only child, Phillip want to do everything they can to aid the Allies.Sumner uses his position in the hospital to smuggle British and French fighters to Spain and then to Britain. Toquette becomes involved in the French Resistance. Living on the Avenue Foch where the other houses had been commandeered by the Gestapo, makes becoming involved in the Resistance an extremely dangerous activity and the Jacksons and their son paid the price.Seen through the eyes of the Jacksons from their vantage point on the Avenue Foch, this book shows the horror of the Nazi occupation of Paris in vivid colors. Many of the beautiful mansions that had been commandeered by the Gestapo were used as torture chambers to encourage people to turn in their neighbors and locate any Jews in hiding.The story is particularly poignant by, in addition to telling the story of the Jacksons, following the career of Gestapo agent Knochen, Dr. Bones. Knochen is a charming, learned individual who loves Paris, but he wants the power to form it in his image. The contrast between the Jackson family and Knochen is startling.If you're interested in WWII and the Nazi occupation of Paris, this is one of the best books I've read.

"Many books have been written about the political factors leading up to WWII and the Holocaust, but The Black Earth is remarkable in the way it pulls history,  social conditions, and political theory together to create a picture of the factors allowing the Holocaust to happen.One factor was Hitler's severe racial hatred. His plan was always to exterminate the Jews. Another was the destruction of the identity of the state in areas like Poland and Eastern Europe. When the state was dissolved, citizens lost their identity as members of the larger group, and there was no organization to protect them. Snyder recounts the history of how this came about as part of Hitler's plan and the devastating consequences.However, the book also has a hopeful section. The author recounts numerous stories of non-Jews hiding Jews, or helping them escape. It reinforces the idea that people to people contact is important in enabling people of all political and religious groups to show compassion to those in need.The final chapter is something I believe everyone should read. We like to think we have put the Holocaust behind us, but there are factors in the world today which could tip the balance and return the world to something resembling that terrible time. When people fear global catastrophe, they can become rapacious trying to secure their own survival with radical action and become less amenable to political solutions. It's something for all of us to think about.I highly recommend this book. It puts into perspective much of what led to the Holocaust and cautions us against complacency.I reviewed this book for Net Galley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H5S2A5II9IQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101903457#wasThisHelpful","R2H5S2A5II9IQZ","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Christians are familiar with the Sermon on the Mount, but this book takes it one step further. Schuller breaks Bible passages down into sections and devotes a chapter to each section. The substance of the chapters is familiar from the Beatitudes, to the Lord's Prayer, but Schuller has brought the sections into everyday parlance.Each section contains theological theory, but also examples from the author's own life. There are also explanations of what the ancient Hebrews would have understood some of the passages to mean. I found this particularly fascinating. In the section on marriage and divorce. Schuller goes to some length to explain that women were considered almost like property. At the time, a husband could divorce his wife for almost any reason from adultery to putting too much salt in his food. If the woman was divorced, she had few options to keep from starving to death, one of them being prostitution. If she was given a Certificate of Divorce, at least she had a clean reputation. This makes sense of some of the ideas in that section that seem out of step with our modern era.I encourage every Christian to read this book. It's easy to understand, almost like chatting with an old friend. While each chapter discusses different verses from the Sermon on the Mount, the prevailing image is that Jesus is trying to encourage his followers to believe with their hearts, not to blindly follow the law. That's an excellent lesson for today as well.I reviewed this book for PR by the Book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKEHEU8UTNNKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617955213#wasThisHelpful","RKEHEU8UTNNKG","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Familiarity with your camera and lenses to the point where you don't have to think constantly about the technical details, leads to more creative photos. This is what Peterson suggests. Play with you camera and lenses. Lie on your back and look up, climb a tree and look down, use different lenses to capture the same scene and evaluate the differences. He includes an exercise that while time consuming is designed to accomplish this.In addition to his suggestions for developing an intimacy with your camera, Peterson covers the basics for taking outstanding photos: design, composition, light, and a short section on Photoshop. The text in each section is easily within the scope of beginners as well as more advanced photographers. I found the use of several examples of the same scene taken from different perspectives the most useful part. Peterson discuss each example: what's good, what's lacking, and why he chose to experiment with another perspective. Necessarily, this leads to a certain amount of autobiography, but I found it fascinating. It's instructive to see how a professional thinks about his compositions.Whether you're a seasoned photographer, or more importantly, a beginner, this book gives you something to think about. Most seasoned photographers should know the contents of the text very well, but the glimpse of how another photographer constructs his shots is illuminating.I highly recommend this book. I enjoyed it and felt that I learned a great deal. I'm not a professional, rather an enthusiastic amateur, but I plan to try all his exercises. I'm sure they will help me to feel more at ease with my equipment.I reviewed this book for Blogging for Books","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OYC5EFE3GKNA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607748274#wasThisHelpful","R1OYC5EFE3GKNA","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gwen Marcey, a forensic artist, spots her dog, Winston, digging in her yard. She races from the house to make him stop. When he relinquishes his prize, she's shocked to discover that it's a human skull with a bullet hole in it. Relying on her artistic sense and forensic skill, she decides it's the skull of a young girl. The local sheriff isn't sure, but when Gwen and Winston find the rest of the body, he knows he has a problem on his hands.Finding the first body leads to the recovery of the bodies of more young girls on the farms through the rural Montana county. Eerily, the first body reminds Gwen of her teenage daughter Aynslee. The more bodies that are uncovered, it becomes clear that the resemblance is no accident and Gwen and her daughter are in the cross hairs of a serial killer.This is a fast paced novel. Although the author includes a considerable amount of forensic detail, it's done in short sections that don't slow the story. The descriptions of rural Montana enhance the feeling of menace, but also show the beauty of the area.Gwen and Aynslee are strong characters. Although Gwen is experiencing all the maternal trials of teenage rebellion, when it counts, the two are able to rely on each other in life-threatening situations. Beth, Gwen's assistant, and best friend is another strong character. Beth is the source of Christian faith in the book. She isn't preachy, but she tries to help Gwen deal with the need for forgiveness in her divorce.The ending is a twist, but not all that surprising if you've been following the clues carefully. The author is good at planting her clues.If you like fast paced thrillers, this is a good one. I recommend it.I reviewed this book for BookLook Bloggers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DQ1LLE4AYM5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401690459#wasThisHelpful","R2DQ1LLE4AYM5R","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Storme wants nothing to do with it until he realizes that his good friend, Matt Jenkins, may be involved and in trouble.Storme enlists his buddy, Chick Easton, to keep the delivery under surveillance and assist if necessary. It becomes necessary and Chick and Wyatt find themselves involved with crooked politicians, mobsters, and a deadly conspiracy.If you like a book with plenty of action, this is it. Storme and Chick are in it up to their necks from the first page. There is no let up in the action, and it keeps you turning the pages.However, the book isn't just action, the characters are well done. There are sassy, humorous exchanges between Chick and Storme and between Storme and his sexy, newscaster girlfriend that are fun to read. The plot is very complex and with all the twists it's hard to figure out what's happening until it all comes together at the end.I recommend this book if you like hulking heroes, a little sex and plenty of action.I reviewed this book for Net Galley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNO1W0FC367AB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941298818#wasThisHelpful","RNO1W0FC367AB","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Evelyn at twenty-six is still the outsider she was in prep-school. For years she worked in New York for a text book publisher, but now she has a job trying to recruit members for an exclusive social media site designed for the upper crust, People Like Us. Evelyn convinces her bosses that she can succeed by using her entrÃ©e through her upper class friends to sign up people appropriate for the site.Although she hasn't seen her special friends, Charlotte and Preston, for some time, she connects with them to use their background for her job. Basically inviting herself to Preston's camp in the Adirondacks and his parties, she becomes entranced by the people she's trying to recruit. Finally, she comes within range of Camilla Rutherford, the queen of 2006 New York social set. Evelyn falls under her spell and in trying to fit in, she takes a page from her social climbing mother's playbook, spending more than she can afford and building a fictitious background for herself. Of course, this can't last and that's the point of the novel.I have mixed feelings about this book. Evelyn is not an attractive character. I couldn't get interested in her even enough to care about her eventual downfall. On the other hand Camilla's character is well done and Evelyn's prep school friends are engaging.The setting, the New York social scene in 2006 just before the recession, is interesting. The author takes us to elite parties, compounds in the Adirondacks, and summer homes in the Hamptons. However, the attention to the details of this life style becomes tedious since it takes up almost half the book.The theme of the book, what rises must fall, has been done many times. I didn't find the plot original. Since you know what must eventually happen, it isn't an inducement to keep reading.The writing is clear and the descriptions good, but for me it wasn't enough to carry the book.I reviewed this book for Net Galley.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D2N8FSFA2LW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250077176#wasThisHelpful","R1D2N8FSFA2LW5","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Grace Blades, a brilliant, lonely child, lives in a trailer-park with her underachieving parents until in a drug and alcohol induced rage, they kill each other. Graces is catapulted into the foster care system which fits her poorly because of her brains and her penchant for being alone.Fast forward twenty years and Grace is a psychotherapist. Her empathy for people haunted by tragedy makes her exceptionally successful, but Grace has a dark side. When she slips out of her normal life to seduce a man, she meets someone from her past. His murder puts Grace on the run trying to find the killer before she's the next victim.Grace's early life makes a good case study. The scenes from her childhood and adolescence give a picture of why she lives the way she does and how she has the strength to search for a murderer in spite of the danger to herself. The murder investigation is less believable than the chapters exploring her life. I found it uncomfortable to switch back and forth. I barely got involved in her character development before being dumped back into the chase scene in the present.Grace's character is very well done. I loved Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels and wondered how he would portray a female character. He does an excellent job. Grace is a character it's hard to forget. In a bow to his male character, she mentions Alex a few times as a mentor.The pace is good, if you get used to the time switches.

"The diagnosis of autism is on the rise and such a diagnosis terrifies parents. This book puts into perspective what the diagnosis means and how autistic people can realize their potential. Autistic people range from the genius level to being barely able to cope with self-care. However, each child has potential, and the parents and teachers need to find ways to bring out their special gifts.The story of autism is a long one. Autistic people have always been with us. I particularly enjoyed the stories of Cavendish, the Wizard of Clapham, and Paul Dirac. Both men exhibited autistic tendencies, but made significant contributions to science. High functioning people with autistic tendencies in the past were considered eccentric. Low functioning autistic people ended up in asylums.The book covers Asperger's work with his â€œlittle professorsâ€ before the second world war, and the work of Kanner, a child psychiatrist, who suppressed the knowledge of the autism spectrum proposed by Asperger.The frightening controversy over whether the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was responsible for pushing susceptible children into autism is covered in detail, as is the current â€œneurodiversityâ€ movement. It also explains how the change in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual's criteria for autism led to an expanded diagnosis that had the appearance of an epidemic.If you have an interest in autism, or are working with an autistic child or adult, this is a must read book. It puts the history of autism in perspective and with the â€œneurodiversityâ€ movement gives hope that with improved teaching and behavioral management skills autistic people may be able to recognize and use their talents.I reviewed this book for Net Galley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27ZPSP0G09NYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=158333467X#wasThisHelpful","R27ZPSP0G09NYZ","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Book 1 of the Resistance Trilogy, Tommy and Careen, college students, meet when a drug to help protect the population from terrorism is passed out. The drug is not what it seems and Tommy and Careen band together to fight the web of lies that is causing the population to become unable to do anything but what the government decrees.In Book 2, Resist, Tommy and Careen are on the run. They've joined the resistance. Their goal is to rescue a group of dissenters that includes Tommy's parents. As they pursue this goal, they meet other people who think as they do and some who are deceptive. Their relationship is tested when they find they can't agree about everything, but they continue to work through their issues and help the other freedom fighters.This is a fast paced dystopian thriller. The action begins in the first chapter and continues at a relentless pace throughout the book. Although Tommy and Careen are the main characters, other characters, including those behind the evil, have chapters written in their point of view. This provides a vehicle for giving information about what is happening in the enemy camp, things Tommy and Careen can't know.I enjoyed the book.

"The devastation and heartbreak caused by Hurricane Katrina are in the past, but the people affected by the tragic events are still living with the aftermath. The Zimmer's house was gutted by the storm. They were forced to move in with their daughter and her son, Teddy, in Chicago. The hurricane changed their lives, but being forced to live together changed them even more.The Zimmers are only one of the families whose stories are told in this collection of short stories. However, their's is the thread that holds the collection together. It's a story of bravery, and growing, and giving in. I thoroughly enjoyed meeting this family.The collection of stories captures the triumphs and tragedies that resulted from this terrible event. The author does an excellent job of making the people come alive. Although I'm not familiar with the Gulf Coast. I felt that I came to know the area and the people.I usually prefer novels to short stories, but the combination of short stories with a continuing set of characters made the book very satisfying. I think the vignettes showing how lives were affected at various positions on the socio-economic spectrum was a very effective way to bring the story of what happened to people after Katrina to life.I highly recommend this book.

"Jack Dillon needs a good writing assignment. His work isn't selling, and his wife thinks he's a failure. Then miraculously he meets with Walt Stuckey, a famous TV comedian. Walt has a secret. He left his show suddenly and no one knows why. Now he wants to tell the story, and he chooses Jack to do it.Since childhood, Jack has been a fan of Stuckey. They're both from Jersey, and as the work progresses, that bond turns into friendship. Tragedy strikes when Walt suffers a stroke. His greedy son, Garrett, tries to take over the biography project and mold the book to suit his ideas, but Jack isn't having it. He can't let Walt down even if helping him means doing something illegal.The opening of the book moves slowly as Jack and Walt get to know each other. However, after Walt's stroke and Jack's decision to get him away from Garrett, the story devolves into a chase scene. Here the pace picks up substantially. However, much of what happens is hard to believe.I found Jack a rather flat character. He does some heroic things, but he seems to remain the potential failure of the first section of the book. Walt is an interesting character, but plays a smaller role than Jack. Garrett is a stereotype of the greedy son.If you enjoy mysteries that are primarily a chase scene, you may enjoy this one. It's not one of my favorite plots so I can't recommend it highly.

"Mack Dalton, owner of Mack's bar, has a unique neurological disorder, synesthesia. She can taste or see things she hears. Seeing things can be perceived as a tactile sensation, and smells and tastes are accompanied by sounds or a physical sensation. Mack has developed a talent for using her unique abilities to help solve crimes. Her boy friend, Duncan Alright, is a cop who has used her talents in the past. In fact, their crime solving as a team was so successful that the newspapers have started following her as a major news story.Mack is in hiding from the press when she receives a letter from an unknown admirer. He plans to set her a series of tests. If she doesn't pass one of her friends from the Capone Club, her bar patrons who help solve crimes, will die.In addition to the trials by the unknown admirer, Mack and the Capone club are involved in solving the cold case murder of Tiny's sister. This is a straightforward mystery and not difficult to figure out.The book is fast paced with a dose of romance between Mack and Duncan as well as the two crimes. While I found the use of synesthesia as a talent for a detective interesting, Mack's character was not otherwise memorable.For me, the major flaw in the book is the cliff hanger ending. Although the club solves Tiny's case, the series of trials remains open with a new murder and trial at the end of the book.

"Darwin's theory of evolution explains much about how humans and other animals change over time. However, even Darwin felt that his theory was incomplete. He wrote that he was convinced that Natural selection was the main but not exclusive means of modification. Lamarck, a contemporary of Darwin's had a theory that internal factors were responsible for modification. He believed that modification was based on what an organism's environment required and how the organism related to that environment.Although not espousing Lamarck's theory, the present book stresses the importance of internal factors, particularly in the evolution of humans. The authors believe that today's environment for humans is safer than in the past, and therefore humans have more opportunity to effect changes in themselves. His chapters on why we die and on mind-body medicine are interesting in this context.The book, although presenting complex concepts, is relatively easy to read. The authors use analogies, such as a card game for how the information cycle allows for internal processes to bring about changes and help the organism maintain it's present status. It also helps to have some passing familiarity with information theory, although the authors do a good job of explaining the concepts.The concepts presented are not a way to negate Darwin's theory. They are rather a thought provoking set of ideas designed to enhance the theory. I recommend this book. While it may not be factually accurate, in fact it is based on theory not research, it is well worth reading for the ideas.I reviewed this book for Net Galley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UWMG31UEMBS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632990180#wasThisHelpful","R2UWMG31UEMBS3","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The new British Consul, Robert Bunch, was not happy with his placement in Charleston. He hated the weather, detested slavery, found the town provincial, and the people arrogant. He'd been stationed there with the assignment to get a repeal of the Negro Seaman Act. Under this act, British sailors who were Negros were taken off their ship when it was in port and jailed. Britain wanted this law repealed and felt Bunch was the man to do it.In spite of his dislike of Charleston and it's elite, Bunch had to become not only friendly with them, but a member of their society. He managed this very well, so well in fact that as war approached some in the North distrusted him as a secessionist. His reports to London and Lord Lyons, the ambassador in Washington, were some of the best intelligence they received on the Southern position. However, Bunch was playing a dangerous game and in the end it almost caught up with him.This is an excellent book about the Civil War. It is well researched including much of the correspondence from Bunch with the tensions in the South as background. In Bunch's mind and in the mind of Lord Palmerston, Prime Minister, the issue was slavery and the potential reopening of the African slave trade. It is very clear in this book that in fact reopening the slave trade and conquering territory in Central and South America for more land to support their cotton based economy was a major consideration in the minds of many in South Carolina.I highly recommend this book. Bunch is a fascinating character. Although the book is serious history, the description of his activities makes the book as interesting to read as a novel.

"A young couple are restoring a badly deteriorated farm house when they discover a skeleton in the backyard. Commissioner Van In and his wife, Deputy Prosecutor Hannelore, get the case. At first it seems to be a mysterious death, but when the skeleton is a murder victim the case changes.The farm was first owned by one of the wealthiest men in Bruges. He donated it to charity and from there it found it's way to the young couple. Donation to a charity seems straight forward, but many of the wealthiest men in Bruges were involved, and when one of them turns up dead, the picture changes.This is straightforward detective fiction. There are no surprising twists until the end, but even there it's fairly easy to see what's coming. The story is carried by the main characters. Van In is gruff and doesn't like a lot of people. Hannelore is young, beautiful and pregnant with their first child. She is the more sympathetic character.I was disappointed that there weren't more descriptions of Bruges. It's a fascinating city. The other problem is the names. Many of them start with 'V' and that makes it hard to remember who's who early in the novel. This is a somewhat unfair criticism because this book is a translation.

Several of the men who escaped the massacre vowed to kill everyone involved down to the last living descendant.Michael Bevan, a rare books dealer, has never heard of the Mormon vendetta, but Natalie Phelan, his friend and director of the Celtic Heritage Center, has fallen in love with Emery, one of the descents of the original Mormon vigilantes. He claims to love her and wants to marry her, but they need money. He has an original copy of one of the early Mormon books, which he gives to Michael to authenticate. For Bevan this is an opportunity to get a book good enough to allow him entry to the AABA, Antiquarian Book Association of America, but nothing is simple.This is a fun mystery with an interesting plot that revolves around an historical incident. It's a quick read. The characters are interesting. Michael Bevan is a mix of scholarship and physical ability. The small town he lives in is like having a vacation from the real world. The other characters Natalie, and particularly, Michael's lover Josie, and sympathetic and well drawn.If you enjoy mysteries with little violence and an interesting historical plot, you may enjoy this book.I reviewed this book for Net Galley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYZ76MZ9NF1RQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OEXM6QA#wasThisHelpful","RYZ76MZ9NF1RQ","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When their mother feels unable to care for them, Dionne and Phaedra are sent to their grandmother Hyacinth in Barbados for the summer. Natives of Brooklyn, the girls find Barbados a strange place. Dionne, the elder, interested in boys and becoming a woman hates it. Phaedra, the younger sister, finds the place strangely attractive.

The girls characters are believable. You can't help feeling excited for Phaedra who is discovering a place where she feels at home and is eager to learn the culture. Likewise you can feel Dionne's pain as a teenager uprooted from her culture.The plot while not exciting is filled with the drama and tragedy of real life. The prose draws the reader into the world of the girls and their grandmother and makes you see the beauty of love and the allure of the island.If you enjoy coming of age stories in a different culture, this is one you'll enjoy.I reviewed this book for Net Galley","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK5A8YTYPTTIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205957#wasThisHelpful","RK5A8YTYPTTIO","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Her childhood friend, Lara, sends her a note saying she is tired of her job working for a congressman in DC and is going home to Richmond. She doesn't arrive, and when her body ifs found it looks much like the other bodies that have been turning up.Meg is assigned to work with Matt, a seasoned FBI agent who is part of the Krewe Hunters. This is Meg's first experience with the paranormal investigators, but Matt has been at it for awhile and is dissatisfied with his job. Together they visit places where the ghosts talk to people with the ability to hear them, like Gettysburg.This book is part of series, the fifteenth. Although I hadn't read the previous books, I found the story easy to follow. It can be read as a standalone book. However, if you enjoy paranormal adventures you may want to read more.I enjoyed the mystery. It's filled with twists and the paranormal aspect is a nice touch. It's not easy to figure out who is responsible when a serial killer and a political conspiracy are intertwined.If you like mysteries, and enjoy a bit of paranormal, you'll like this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VVXLHY5N1AHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317994#wasThisHelpful","R1VVXLHY5N1AHX","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Charlie Cates is mourning the sudden death of her five-year-old son. She's alone because she and the boy's father are divorced. On top of the death, Charlie is faced with the loss of her job when the New York magazine she works for is purchased by another company.Luckily, Charlie's old editor form Cold Crimes Magazine offers her an assignment. Thirty years ago, a three-year-old boy disappeared from his bead on historic Evangeline plantation in Louisiana. The boy has never been found, but is presumed dead. Charlie grabs the assignment. Louisiana is far from New York and her problems, but then she starts having visions of trying to save children who are in danger.The book is a fun read with romance, mystery, and paranormal events. The author has created a very atmospheric book: lush Louisiana, a brooding mansion, and unusual visions. I enjoyed the descriptions. Although it's a modern setting, it feels timeless.The characters are well developed. Charlie is a particularly well done character. If you like fiction with a woman sleuth, you'll like Charlie. There is also romance and serious questions about who Charlie can trust.If you want a pleasant, escapist read, you'll enjoy this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22J5XMJZ7J7BJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399174001#wasThisHelpful","R22J5XMJZ7J7BJ","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was attracted to this faucet because it is taller than the normal bathroom faucet, 9.68 inches above the counter. You can use if with a raised bowl, but for me the attraction was that you can get a small bucket or other container under the faucet. This can be useful when you need to do cleaning chores in the bathroom that is removed from a utility sink. The faucet doesn't swivel, but that's not a big problem, particularly if you're dealing with a relatively small sink.The bronze color and finish works perfectly with most standard bathroom dÃ©cor. I particularly like it because I don't care for the shiny chrome fixtures that most bathrooms come with.The faucet is easy to install and comes with the flexible supply lines. These are reinforced with stainless braided covers which protect against breakage. I particularly like the integrated wire mesh filter included on each line. These help to keep particles out. Since we live in Florida with a well that often produces sand particles, this is a major plus.This is a very high quality faucet. All the parts appear to be able to withstand substantial use. I recommend it if you have a raised bowl, or if you want a tall faucet to be able to fill other vessels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNTWGPVQXGTA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SHQW85Y#wasThisHelpful","RNTWGPVQXGTA1","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Roberta works in a bookstore. She's half in love with the owner, but feels there's no chance for her since he is interested in someone else. When she finds a letter in her grandmother's suitcase, it opens the door to questioning who she really is, and more important what happened in her grandmother's life.The stories of Roberta and her grandmother, Dorothy are told in sequential chapters. Roberta's chapters are written in the first person: Dorothy's in the third person. I suppose this was meant to give a sense of immediacy to Roberta's chapters. However, since more can be done to set the scene in third person, I found those chapters more interesting.The theme of the book revolves around motherhood â€“ who wants to be a mother, who doesn't, and what will they do to either embrace the role or flee it. It's a theme that will appeal to women and will raise questions about their own choices.I enjoyed the book, but I found the back and forth between the eras more frustrating than enlightening.

"This is a great shower. Much more water than our old shower-head. However, when you install realize that the new fixture can come up higher than the old one. We have an old shower-stall. The whole thing is tile and the top comes down a foot from the ceiling. That foot made it difficult to install the new shower and in addition, we couldn't have stood under the shower comfortably since we're both tall.Our solution was to install the shower in a different bathroom where it works well. Our shower did not come with the steel hose or the shower heads.

"I have a Hinkle knife block that I've had for 30 years. This Kitchen Aid knife block is larger. The Hinkle has slots for four knives plus the scissors and knife sharpener. The Kitchen Aid Block is larger, approximately 5 inches by 5 inches. There are slots for 8 knives. The scissors and sharpener come with their own slots.This set comes with only four knives plus the sharpener and the scissors. This leaves several available slots.

The slots for the knives are a butcher block. I don't know whether the wood goes all the way to the bottom of the holder.The knives feel good in your hand. The handles are a composite, so they should be dishwasher safe. The blades are riveted into the grips, so that shouldn't be problem.

"Eve is on leave from her convent helping her father, the Captain, with his detective business. She's trying to decide whether to go back to the convent when a strange case arrives in the form of a man who wants to know what happened to his great grandfather, a miner in the area in the 1890s.Things become more complicated when Eve can't contact her sister, Dorisanne, who lives in Las Vegas. Dorisanne has always been in trouble, but now Eve thinks it's serious trouble. She and Daniel, the Captain's former partner, take off for Las Vegas to find out what's going on and get more than they expected.The central mystery of what's happening with Dorisanne is predictable, but a quick read. If you want an escapist mystery this is a good one. The secondary mystery of what happened to the great grandfather seemed unnecessary and stuck on. I understood the significance at the end, but I don't think it was necessary for the small amount of moralizing it allowed.The characters are stereotypical except for Eve. The Captain is what you think of as a crusty private eye, and Daniel is a typical police officer. I had trouble with Eve's character. I believe nuns can ride motorcycles and behave as she did, but her constant wondering about whether to leave the convent or work with her father seemed a bit extreme.I reviewed the book for BookLook Bloggers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ME8DEZ5W51QI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401691471#wasThisHelpful","R1ME8DEZ5W51QI","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ryder Creed, a former K-9 handles in Afghanistan and Iraq, now trains rescue dogs. He thought he had put his experience in Iraq and Afghanistan behind him when Peter Logan, a platoon leader he worked with, calls to cash in a favor. A serious landslide in North Carolina has buried a DARPA research facility. He wants Creed to bring his dogs and find the center and any survivors.Maggie O'Dell, an FBI agent who has worked with Creed before, gets the same call. Her current boy friend, Ben Platt, a Colonel at DAPA, asks her to got to North Carolina and find out what's happening. She agrees, partly because she'd secretly like to work with Creed again.The conditions in North Carolina are horrendous. The rain keeps coming, the site is a mass of mud, and dangerous debris is everywhere. But the conditions are not the only problem Creed and O'Dell have to contend with. One of the first bodies they find is a scientist who wasn't killed in the landslide. He has a bullet in his head. Now they have to find out what was really going on at the facility.I loved this mystery. O'Dell and Creed are characters that keep you interested in the case, but also in their attraction to each other. However, the real stars are the lovable rescue dogs. I knew very little about the training and use of rescue dogs, but the author does a good job of describing both without being heavy handed. The dogs themselves steal the show, hard-working, friendly, and very well trained.The chapters are short and move between the scenes of action from committee hearings in Washington, DC, to the disaster area in North Carolina. This not only makes for fast paced reading, it pulls you along to find out what happens next in each thread of the plot.I highly recommend this book if you love a good action-adventure story with a mystery. Even if you're not a dog-lover, I think you'll fall in love with these intelligent animals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23SPOF2F6C131/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399170774#wasThisHelpful","R23SPOF2F6C131","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the second book of the Church Builder series, Bethany Barkley is on the run from the FBI and other law enforcement agencies in the US. With the help of Ray Fuentes, an ex-CIA agent, she escapes to London where she tries to follow Annabelle's clues to discover the Pilate's Stone. Annabelle, her best friend, is now dead, and Bethany is searching for the clues because the Wilderness, an atheistic organization that is trying to discredit the church, has captured Janice, a brilliant young friend of Bethany's. To save Janice, Bethany must find the stone.The Pilate's Stone is supposedly a stone on which Pilate recorded his recollections of Jesus. The Wilderness and the Garden, a society dedicated to protecting the church, want the stone for different reasons. The Wilderness wants to erase the stone in order to disprove Christ's existence. The Garden wants it to prove that Christ was who he claimed to be.The novel is a chase scene with Bethany always on the verge of being caught, not knowing who to trust. Many characters are introduced in the process of the chase. Sometimes it's hard to remember who they are and how they fit into the overall story.I found Bethany a rather shallow character. As is typical in chase scenes, we hear more about Bethany's actions trying to escape than about her character. She seems tentative, unsure of what she's dong. While this may be realistic, it gets tedious. She wants to find the stone, save Janice, and redeem Annabelle's memory, but I didn't feel that we got to know Bethany well.The book is a sequel. I recommend reading the first book, The Church Builder, first. The second book starts immediately with Bethany on the run, but without the first book you miss the reason why she's being pursued by so many law enforcement agencies.I reviewed this book for BookLook Bloggers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11LYGE7KN18HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031033215X#wasThisHelpful","R11LYGE7KN18HA","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this companion workbook to his Whole-Brain Child book, Daniel Siegel focuses on the way a parent's mental health affects the child. Children are sensitive to a parent's moods. The way a parent praises, punishes and understands the child can affect both neurological and behavioral development.I think the workbook can be most helpful if you're already familiar with Siegel's work. However,  he includes enough explanation of his principles that the workbook can be used by anyone motivated to use the techniques to understand and help their child mature. The workbook is filled with exercises for the parents aimed at having them understand their motivations. This is an excellent approach because it's not so much the child's behavior as the parent's response that determines how well or poorly the child develops.The book discusses how the brain works in language that is easily understandable by parents with no formal education in behavioral therapy. It is easy to read and contains amusing cartoons to illustrate some of the principles. There are also exercises to do with your child which are easily understandable by elementary school and older children.I recommend this workbook and the book for any parent wanting to better understand and help their children mature.I reviewed this book for PR by the Book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GO0IVE39IPFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936128748#wasThisHelpful","R2GO0IVE39IPFC","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The pictures are colorful giving a good picture of the Texas Panhandle.Perhaps the best thing about the book is that this is a true story.

"I use this unit in our bedroom which is quite small, about ten by twelve. I have a larger Winix unit that I use in the rest of the house. Although the Winix unit doesn't have an ionizer, it works well in large areas.Since I've started using the Holmes unit in our bedroom, we have less problems with stuffy noses and post nasal drip. I run the unit during the day on medium and turn it to low at night. It's very quiet on the low setting and doesn't bother us at all.The unit can be used in a horizontal or vertical position. I use it in the horizontal position. It seems to be more stable.I can't say that the unit removes heavy odors, we don't have animals in the house nor are we smokers. However, since we don't have air conditioning and live in the country, we have a lot of pollen and dust from the outside. The unit does a good job with this.

"Sherman's march across the South from the destruction of Atlanta to the final minutes of the war when he accepts Johnston's surrender is the subject of the book. Although the Union forces are the focus of the book, we also see the Confederates namely, Hardee, Wheeler, Seeley and Johnson. Shaara also includes chapters from the Black's perspective in the person of Franklin, a freed slave who followed the army from Georgia until a battle near Bentonville, South Carolina.The book is well researched relying on primary sources as much as possible. Although it is a lengthy look at the end of the Civil War, the characters are so well done that you want to know what happens to them. Shaara accommodates this by including a short post-Civil War biography on each of the main characters at the end of the book. The prose is well crafted. It doesn't draw attention to itself, but keeps the story of Sherman's long march from Georgia to Virginia the focus of the novel.Although it's historically impossible to determine whether Shaara is correct in the thoughts he puts into the heads of his characters, they track history well enough that it's easy to believe the men could have felt this way. The use of the characters thoughts kept the book from being dry history and brought the characters and the battles to life.I enjoyed the book. It's well written, and although it's over 600 pages, it held my interest. I highly recommend it if you're a Civil War buff, or someone interested in military history. It can also be enjoyed by anyone who likes a good historical novel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25K457JH8OQHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345549198#wasThisHelpful","R25K457JH8OQHV","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lydia, alias the Fixer, and Mort. Seattle's chief of detectives, have been estranged since, Allie, Mort's wayward daughter, left Lydia's care to go away with Vadim Tokarev, a Russian drug lord. Mort is living on a houseboat and continuing his work as chief of detectives. Lydia is a practicing psychologist. She misses Mort's friendship and feels that she was unfairly accused of letting Allie escape.In Mort's latest case, a young woman's body is found, and it's evident that she was tortured before being killed. Then another young woman is found also tortured before being killed. Both are prostitutes and were involved with an unscrupulous loan shark who charged exorbitant interest rates designed to lead the women into prostitution. When Lydia's patient, another young woman, disappears, Mort and Lydia decide it's time to work together again.This is another fast paced Fixer novel. The characters of Mort and Lydia are more developed than in the previous books. He's devastated by his daughter's actions. Lydia is trying to leave behind her life as the Fixer. This book gives us insight into their struggles and their need for each other's friendship.The plot is fast moving and the author does a good job of misdirection. It's hard to tell until the very end who is responsible. Although the idea of young women being tortured and killed is horrendous, the violence is handled tastefully with a minimum of gory details.I recommend this book if you're a fan of the Fixer series, or if you enjoy a good mystery.I reviewed this book for Net Galley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12M05HF6ZIVAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKO6P4E#wasThisHelpful","R12M05HF6ZIVAG","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My box of six washable markers has the primary scents: cherry, orange, banana, mint, blueberry and grape. I'm not wild about the blueberry and banana, but the others are pleasant. I suspect children would be happier with the scents than I am.The markers are great for making simple drawings, but I use them primarily for making signs. The chisel tips give you a nice firm line perfect for letters. The only caution is: Don't use the markers for outdoor signs. They're washable. I like the washable factor, but it is also annoying that you can't use the colors for anything that might get wet,The clear plastic box is perfect for storing the markers. You can see exactly which one you want to use. The markers do bleed through soft paper so you have to have a hard backing.

"Mudas Summers is approaching her seventeenth birthday. Her parents are divorced, and she lives with her father, but she and her mother have a special relationship. On the eve of her birthday, she visits her mother to show off her birthday present, a new Mustang. The next morning her mother is found hanging from the rafters in her house. The sheriff wants to call it suicide, but Mudas knows her mother wouldn't commit suicide.Her mother's suicide parallels the hanging of a slave, Frannie Crow, in 1860. Frannie's mistress claimed that Frannie poisoned her, but it was a lie. From Frannie's gallows a Liar's Bench was built. Now people in town use the bench across from the courthouse, but often for telling lies.Mudas is a believable character. Starting as a frightened seventeen-year-old, she grows into an adult trying to find out what happened to her mother. Mudas is helped by Bobby Marshal, a mixed-race boy. The town is not pleased with their relationship, but Mudas vows to defy the town.The story is very Southern which includes the dialog, but without too much dialect. I though the author did a good job of portraying the racial tensions of the '70s without laboring the issue.

"If you're a fan of Fitzgerald, Hemingway, or Picasso, you'll be amused to find all these characters and others putting in an appearance in this long novel.Sara and Gerald Murphy are expats living on the Riviera in the early 1920s after the First World War. They're wealthy, sociable and devoted to each other and their children to the extent that they inspire jealousy in some of their friends. The era is depicted well from the late 1800s when Gerald and Sara meet to the early 1900s when they've established themselves on the French Riviera.The first half of the book is devoted to the strict families Gerald and Sara grew up in. They fight through the restrictions of their time and eventually marry. This is almost a standalone historical romance. As part of the book, I thought it was too long with too much backstory and too much description.The second half of the book focuses on the Murphy's life on the French Riviera. Here we meet their famous and not so famous friends and glimpse the glamorous life style of wealthy Americans in that era. Behind the glamour of the parties, the Murphy's marriage matures with some surprising twists.I enjoyed this book because I find the lost generation fascinating. However, the book is very long. The first half was particularly slow going into detail about life in the late 1800s.The pace picked up slightly in the second half of the novel. Some of the attraction was the famous people who fell under the Murphy's spell. The portrayal of these characters is realistic from what I've read. Zelda and Scott are particularly well portrayed with their frighteningly fraught marriage and uninhibited drinking.The book has many things to recommend it, but if you want a quick read, this is not it. If you want to savor the 1920s on the Riviera, you may enjoy it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ML8GV4Y5TGW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316211362#wasThisHelpful","R3ML8GV4Y5TGW9","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Eighteen years ago, Evelyn's best friend Cassie, was kidnapped from her bedroom. The killer, dubbed the Nursery Rhyme killer, left notes based on nursery rhymes. In Cassie's note, it indicated that he also planned to take Evelyn, but something prevented him. It has haunted Evelyn ever since.Now Evelyn is a profiler working for the FBI. When more killings start in Rose Bay, her hometown, she grabs the chance to work on the case. Her boss thinks she's too emotionally involved to work the case well, but Evelyn insists and is assigned.After reading this book, I had to agree with Evelyn's boss. She was much too emotionally involved to do well on the case. Although she is supposed to be their best profiler, she misses the most obvious clues. Her profile is the basic profile used for any serial killer. Her emotions are on the ragged edge, and she makes errors in judgement that get her into trouble.  We constantly hear about how Cassie is her inspiration, but Evelyn can't seem to get her professional act together. She is so emotionally upset that she is usually crying, fainting or being sick on the floor. I found her a less than desirable character.Evelyn is billed as a strong woman playing in a man's game and winning. However, in this book she is always being rescued, usually by Kyle, another agent. He is a great character, but too good to be true.The plot is interesting, but the profiler missing clues keeps the book going on much too long. If there had been less of Evelyn emoting, it would have been a better book.I can only recommend this book if you like romantic suspense.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q4MW46NTENI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317382#wasThisHelpful","R3Q4MW46NTENI0","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use an Amped Wireless Router ( AC750). This router has only three Ethernet ports which aren't enough to support my modem, computer, external drive, and security device. Therefore, I was delighted to try the Linksys WRT 8-Port Gigabit switch. It works perfectly with my router.Setup was extremely easy. I plugged the Linksys device into my router then plugged the other devices into the available ports, and it worked perfectly. For this combination there were no compatibility issues.Since I only use my home computer for the surfing the net and streaming video, the available setup in the Linksys device is fine. However, it you want to do more sophisticated allocation of resources, this isn't a device you'll be happy with.The device is plastic, but it looks attractive and my Amped router sits comfortably on top of it. Since this is a home setup, we don't have heavy usage and plastic is a good option.I am very happy with the additional Ethernet ports.

"I love dangling earrings and these are particularly lovely. The white jade is complemented by small gold flowers at the top and one corner of the pear shaped teardrop. The flowers and the ear-wire are plated with 18 carat gold. I'm not a fan of gold plated earrings. I prefer sterling silver, or at least 10 carat gold. However, these look very nice and hopefully, the gold plating will not wear off with use.The ear-wires are long, but the rounded top is wide. I usually like to have the rounding smaller so that the earring is less likely to work it's way out of my ear. The earrings do come with small rubbery keepers that you can slide on the ear-wire to keep from losing the earring. I strongly recommend that you use them. I do, because I've lost earrings in the past when they slipped out of my ears.The earrings are very well made. The stone is held securely in place by the flowers and a tab at the other corner of the stone. The back to which the tab and flowers are attached is thick and looks like it will hold very well.I highly recommend these earrings. They're attractive for either day or evening wear, and most of all, they're comfortable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DESU0XBMIIJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PC6UMRS#wasThisHelpful","R3DESU0XBMIIJL","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Farming is big business. Big tractors are required to do the planting and harvesting on large commercial farms. Big Tractors gives an overview of how these tractors look and what they do in language a child can understand.The pictures are outstanding. They show off the tractors and implements to good advantage. In fact, the pictures are so good Daddy or Grandpa may be interested in looking through the book.Another feature I liked is the timeline showing how tractors have changed to adapt to the new farming methods. I highly recommend this book if your child is interested in tractors. Even if you live on a small farm and your child is familiar with tractors, the pictures of monster tractors give another perspective on farming.I reviewed this book for PR by the Book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18PL9Z9L0TDJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937747530#wasThisHelpful","R18PL9Z9L0TDJJ","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Looking for a quiet place to write, Max Gallagher rents a cabin in the Crazy Mountains of Montana. His quiet is immediately disturbed when he tries to light a fire in the fireplace, fills the cabin with smoke, and discovers a dead girl stuffed in the chimney.The girl turns out to be Cinderella Huntingdon who has been missing for five months. The teenager and a teenage boy who worked at the Huntingdon ranch disappeared at the same time and the speculation was that they were together, but only Cindy has been found.Since it's not clear that Cindy was murdered, Sheriff Martha Ettinger's resources to pursue the investigation are limited. She suggests that Cindy's mother, Etta Huntingdon, hire Sean Stranahan to find out. Stranahan is an artist, fly fisherman and sometime detective. From this point on it's his story.The plot has interesting twists, the Montana scenery is breathtaking, and the characters are suitably quirky for people living in a small town is in the wilds. However, the book moves very slowly, and the viewpoint shifts between characters making it difficult to identify with one character.I enjoyed the mystery.

"The House on Moody Avenue is supposed to be the story of the house, but in reality it is a scattered series of tales about the people who lived in the house.Lisette, the first mistress of the house, has a tragic history. Her mother and siblings died. Her father felt he could no longer manage the farm, so he migrated with her to New York City. There he abandoned her. Lisette experienced life on the streets, but didn't let it shake her strong faith. In a fairy tale like twist she meets and marries a wealthy man. The house was his wedding gift.After Lisette, the house passes through a series of residents from boarders to beatniks over the ninety years of it's life. The opening story is fairly well done, but after that the stories become less and less polished and therefore less interesting. It seemed  rushed as though the author felt she needed to finish the book quickly.This book has a great idea, the life and death of a house, but misses the mark. I believe the story would have been stronger if the house were the focus rather than the residents.The writing is archaic, reminiscent of writers like Louisa May Alcott, but without Alcott's perceptive character descriptions. I can't recommend this book. The plot is too scattered, and the characters aren't interesting.I reviewed this book for BookLook Bloggers.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TJ9CPLOJ58C0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1449768199#wasThisHelpful","R2TJ9CPLOJ58C0","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the most attractive headphones I've owned. The ear pads and the padding on the headband are brown. It looks rich against the brushed aluminum of the ear pieces. Brown is an unusual color for headphones, but it works well. I like it better than the typical black.The memory foam on the earpieces is comfortable and fits my ears perfectly. Likewise the padding on the headband is comfortable. The earpieces are attached to the headband so that they tilt in and out. This brings them close to the ear for the perfect fit.The sound quality is amazing. You can hear the various instruments in classical music distinctly. I also tried them with my Nexus which has amazing stereo quality. It was like being in the same room with the musicians.I find the balance very good, but I haven't tried them with bass heavy music.

"I installed the light over the side door. We use that door a lot and there is no porch light, so it's hard to open at night. The light installed easily. I used the Velcro strips. I may install with screws later, but want to see how well it works first.After charging for 12 hours as recommended, the light came on and responded to motion. If you open and close the door, the light goes off after about 30 seconds. Since our side door is in direct sunlight for at least half the day, it gets plenty of chance to charge.The light is not very bright. It gives a dull white glow, but it's enough to see to get out your keys and unlock the door. It's also enough light to see someone at the door.

"Although Pont-Aven is not his territory, Georges Dupin is assigned a brutal murder case because the Commissaire for that area is on holiday. Dupin isn't enthusiastic about the case. A famous hotelier has been murdered in the bar of his hotel. There are few clues, but the pressure is high to find the murderer, particularly since it's almost tourist season in Pont-AvenPont-Aven is a delightful small town in Brittany that was once home to a famous artist's colony who premier member was Gauguin. The area is beautifully described. It makes you want to visit. The history of the art colony is another plus. I enjoyed learning the history of this group.Dupin is a somewhat grumpy character. He dislikes authority, likes to work alone, and is sometimes difficult for the inspectors who work with him to keep up with. He loves long walks, coffee, and cafes. He works long hours, forgets to eat, and is often hungry. However, when he does eat the food is lovingly described.The other inspectors are good foils for Dupin. Le Ber, who works most closely with him, has learned to do what Dupin wants and not ask too many questions. Labat is much more formal and finds it harder to deal with Dupin's quirks.For me, the delight of this mystery was driven by the descriptions of Brittany and the history of the artist's colony. The murder itself is not hard to figure out because there aren't many suspects, but the motive is much more interesting. If you enjoy a mystery in an exotic setting, you'll enjoy this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2163GY7CTIHS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250061741#wasThisHelpful","R2163GY7CTIHS9","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hoped this styler would work on damp hair. It does, but the results are not impressive. I have very fine long hair. I thought that working on damp hair would give it more curl. Unfortunately it doesn't work that way for me.I have used the In Styler Max Two Way Rotating Iron. It works as well or better than the Wet to Dry Rotating Iron. It took some practice, but I can use that iron to give my hair some lift and a slight wave. I can do about the same thing with the wet to dry iron. The problem is that it takes a long time. I usually don't have that much time to spare in the morning.I like the brush. It holds the hair while the iron is moving through. You have to move slowly and with damp hair it does take longer. I also have to use the lowest heat setting and that also takes more time with damp hair.It's a good styler, however, there are limitations based on the type of hair you have.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A4O9R4ZZTOFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOJ8V5I#wasThisHelpful","R2A4O9R4ZZTOFB","AFBUDZ63FOLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFBUDZ63FOLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a hidden objects game with an interesting storyline, and appears to be challenging enough without being too difficult.As a start, you can play this game in the 'Classic Mode' which is timed, or play with no time limits. The time limits seem to be ample enough for the first few games I played, despite some of the objects being bit of a challenge. Pinching to zoom in & out was smooth for me, and the graphics seem sharp enough although I've seen better. In fact, some of the objects seem visibly sharper than the background. You start out with 4 hints, and you can get more by tapping on question marks you find in the scenes. There are usually more than one question mark in each scene. There are different find-by types, including the usual find-by-name and find-by-outline, etc., but also find-by-concept such as ""find all light sources"". Random tapping is not encouraged as this game will deduct 20 seconds if you do that repeatedly without a hit.I suppose every G5 game greets you with a carousel of their other games in their startup screen, and plenty of ways/links for you to check out those games. That's irritating but I got more or less used to them. Paranormal Agency, however, raised such irritation to a different level. Every time you've completed a level, there will be a message inviting you to post your achievement on Facebook. Accidentally tapping on the crystal ball thingy on the bottom right will also do the same. And there is no way to turn such promptings off!  Also, please note this game is set up to receive (promo?) messages from the cloud. I have not had this game long enough to determine how frequent those messages will be, but again there should be an option to disable all cloud-to-device messages for EVERY game.Under the hood I found nothing suspicious or questionable. This game does use the Internet to communicate with various servers, but you can play this game offline with no problem. It also exits cleanly too which is a relief.The game itself is close to 5 stars, but its promotion traps are such a nuisance that I cannot give it more than 4.[Addendum]Having read some of the earlier reviews after I posted mine, I can assure you that this game exits cleanly. This version anyway, not sure about previous ones. Also, I have not had any problems finding translucent objects because they were like hazy patches on a picture. I completed the classic (timed) game with 170 hints left unused & never ran out of time, so I'm sure most people won't find this game too difficult. I didn't like the mini games especially unraveling the threads but thank goodness you can skip them all!  And FYI there are only a few misnomers; no big deal.  In conclusion, 4 stars is about right.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22WJKE5M1ZWDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006R8GK2Q#wasThisHelpful","R22WJKE5M1ZWDO","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Anyway, this is a logic game that requires you to find the logical steps to produce a ball like the one shown. There are no fancy graphics or animations, nothing to get excited over, just satisfaction when you have solved a level. No malicious content. Uses the Internet but nothing nefarious & can be played offline just fine. Exits just fine too despite being an Adobe AIR game.

"I played this game like three years ago so I can't remember all the fine details. Anyway, this ""game"" is more like an INTERACTIVE storybook adventure, and it's all about the EXPERIENCE; so no reviews can adequately describe it, and you just have to TRY IT YOURSELF. That's why I recommend that you get this while it's free. Any other time, well, just watch its video, or search the Web for a free interactive teaser on how these games work, then decide whether to buy it.What I will tell you though is that this game is basically free of any dubious components. Some scanners might report the presence of Google Analytics but it doesn't appear to be active. It does use the Internet, but only accessed the Amazon servers, and can be run offline. There is unfortunately IAP, which lets you buy additional colours for drawing, unlock all levels, or the Armor Pencil with each costing $0.99 on top of the game's $1.99 regular price. (But you do NOT need to buy those extras to complete the game.) Sadly, although an exit confirmation box will pop up when you press your Back key in the main menu, it does NOT exit cleanly but instead continue to use up CPU cycles in the background. I hope these extra information will help you in making your purchase decision. For me, the game itself was actually worthy of 5 stars, but the IAP & the non-exit is what took a star away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OSBV1Z64ZVGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AA0TJO8#wasThisHelpful","R2OSBV1Z64ZVGP","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Appstore lists this game as first released on May 30, 2015, but I think it could be created a long time ago because I had played and completed the game Glass Tower 3 by the same developer almost three years ago!  Anyway, this game runs fine on my KitKat 4.4.4 2014 device.Please BE AWARE that this is an AD-SUPPORTED GAME.  There are no ad-free version that you can buy in the Appstore, and no in-app purchase to disable the ads. So, expect  LOTS OF ADS, as well as analytics that collect various info behind your back. It requires permissions to determine for example your location & the apps you have, and these should NOT be required for the game itself; only for those ad & analytics components. The good news is this game does not autostart with your device, does run OFFLINE & does exit cleanly.Gameplay is based on a simple premise:  break all the blue blocks to pass a level.  Each red block that you break will deduct a life (the hearts on the top left), and when you have no more lives, you would have to buy some more or wait for it to replenish before continue playing.  There will be coins that you can collect (if you're quick enough) that shoots up on either edge of your screen during play; but unfortunately it seems no coins are awarded even for perfect play (passing a level without breaking any red blocks).  After level 100, you will also occasionally come across a green block which will randomly turn red or blue on tapping; don't tap it twice unless it had turned blue.You will find out soon enough that some levels simply cannot be completed without breaking some of the red blocks.  Fortunately there are four special tools that can help:  MAGNET attracts all the blocks to the centre;  SHUFFLE will randomly shuffle the colour of all the blocks;  SWAP will change the colour of a single block;  and FREEZE will freeze a single block.  These tools will only be available one by one after you've completed a few levels, and you get three of each free as a start; but you would have to buy any additional ones.  Each tool has various degree of usefulness depending on the layout in question, but personally I think SHUFFLE is the least useful of them all due to its RANDOM unpredictable nature.This game supports MULTI-TOUCH, and you should take advantage of that by breaking two or three blocks SIMULTANEOUSLY when breaking one after the other might lead to imbalances.Glass Tower, as with other similar releases, is actually a fun and rather addicting game. It's easy to pick up, and good for quick games. However, I wish there was a easier way to earn coins, and an option to buy a ""clean, no dubious components"" version. These are the main reasons why I am not giving this game 5 stars.[Afterthoughts]For version 1.0.1 that I have just completed, there were a total of 327 levels. That's quite a lot especially when you only play a few levels at a time. I found the game enjoyable but sometimes also frustrating. The Magnet won't attract certain falling bricks, and often fail with the balls; but still, together with the Freeze, they are the principal tools that one needs. There are also levels that are inherently imbalanced, and the structure would start to fall as soon as you enter the level, so you would have to be quick with your tapping. If they were to release a ad-free paid version for a dollar, and one which lets you earn more coins, it could be a winner deserving of 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R190F70A5759IU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YI7ACBI#wasThisHelpful","R190F70A5759IU","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Counting Kingdom is a wonderful GAME to help your child practice his addition. You (or your child) will be the defender of the castle, and must destroy advancing monsters with spells. Each monster has a number on it, and can be destroyed only by a spell that has the same number. You can select multiple ADJACENT monsters, then destroy them with a single spell with the same number as their SUM. If there are no spells with the correct sum, you can ADD two spells to create one that does. There are also potions that let you adjust a monster's number by ADDING/SUBTRACTING the potion number to/from it.This game is not only FUN, but also CHALLENGING because you have to decide how to combine the monsters and spells. As you progress, new potions & larger numbered monsters come into play. No wonder the developer describes this game as ""for kids 6-8 and beyond""!  However, I am sure there will be some smart kids out there who might be younger but still up to the challenge. In the Map, the top right target icon lets you adjust the difficulty level, although I am not sure how to apply it to a specific castle (level).Under the hood I found NOTHING that you should be worried about. It asks for the Internet Access and the Precise Location Permissions, but it NEVER ACTUALLY USED THEM. In its main menu, you can tap the gear icon to access its settings. You can adjust the volume, select one of the available interface languages, and also read up on its Privacy Policy. In its policy it mentioned the use of Flurry, but it is NOT PRESENT in this version. I am guessing the permissions are related to Flurry which was used in a previous version but has since been removed. Hopefully the developer will see fit to remove those permissions as well in a future update for the ultimate peace of mind. This game exits cleanly too.I have no hesitation in recommending that you get this game while it's free. Even at its regular price of $2.99 I would still recommend it if it's within your budget.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20LQPSPEUI7RL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W865T50#wasThisHelpful","R20LQPSPEUI7RL","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many years ago, when Match-3 games were gaining in popularity, someone decided to add city building elements to it for something ""new"". The result was the Cradle of Rome which, as a Match-3 game, was pretty average and, as a city building game, just as average. (Not even close to SimCity or CityVille.) Not unlike those watered-down 3-course set lunches.The Heroes of Kalevala is something like that. This is essentially a Match-3 game, with the city building a sort of distraction. You earn coins & unlock resources by completing the Match-3 games, and then you buy resources to build your village(s). The tiles are distinctive enough from one another, but rather boring-looking. The board uses only part of your screen, and look small even on a 5.5"" display. It is playable, yes, but it's definitely better on a tablet. The ""Heroes"" are actually Hero Tiles that you unlock as you progress, they destroy tiles one way or another, but you have to match them like other tiles to activate them; and they can be destroyed by the bonus tiles that you get by matching 4 or more tiles. Also, the Match-3 games are timed, with a crow burning its way around the board's border & you have to complete a game before it covers the entire border.The field on which you build your village is again limited to your screen. You can't pan it nor zoom it. The scene and the items are all very plain looking. There doesn't seem to be much strategy nor time management involved. You earn more coins by having more houses, and you keep the villagers happy by planting trees. Other than that, there are very little instructions or guidelines telling you what you should do; and you would be scratching your head wondering what the villagers want (umbrella? another house to raise a family, or what!??). If I could disable the city building part, I would!Under the hood it seems to be quite safe. Some scanners might report the presence of Flurry, but I didn't detect it during gameplay. The game only accessed the Amazon Web Services servers, and could be played offline with no problem. It also performs a clean exit.If this game was $0.99 or free, I suppose I could be generous and give it a 4. But for $2.99? Overpriced & not worth it.  Better off spending that kind of money on a decent standalone Match-3 or city building game.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z374EKGR4PN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009RLG7RI#wasThisHelpful","R1Z374EKGR4PN2","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Flasia is an interactive visualizer. It's not a game, and there are no goals or achievements. It is similar to the developer's other apps like Atomus & Triple A in that it's all about the experience. Flasia is kind of like drawing with lights or manipulating fireflies - all on & within the confines of your screen. Some might find it to be a good way to relax, or even mentally therapeutic; while others might regard it as interesting but ultimately boring.There are no instructions, but you can adjust the settings by tapping the small 'i' in the bottom right. There are two Art Modes: the default Gesture Control is like manipulating fireflies that are already present, and Multi-Touch which I compare to drawing with lights. Pressing the Back key will pop up an exit confirmation box, on which there is a ""More Apps"" button that would allow you to look at (and buy if you choose the Appstore option instead of browser) the developer's other apps. I agree it's better if the said button was tucked away in Settings, but I think it's a bit extreme to rate this app as worthless over such a minor annoyance.Under the hood there are no undesirable components, nor does it require any questionable permissions. It doesn't even use the Internet.I am deducting a star, however, because this app cannot be used as a live wallpaper. I am not sure whether the developer intended it as a separately purchasable app, but for $1.99 I would expect that feature or function to be included in the package. I own other interactive apps that can also be used as a live wallpaper such as Waterfloo, Radiant Particles, etc. and they all cost less, so I find this omission to be quite inconsiderate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GQQDK1MDRKR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UTWEZP0#wasThisHelpful","R2GQQDK1MDRKR4","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This plain Hidden Objects game is exactly the same as Hidden Objects Ireland by the same developer: Just a bunch of random objects slapped on backgrounds related to the theme.Again the graphics are crisp & sharp, but again only part of each scene is displayed and you have to pan up & down to see it. Zooming also still the simple one-step zoom in, zoom out with no support for pinching. The same three game modes & three 'Find by' types, and with the same lack of replayability since the objects to find are always the same.No malware that you should be worried about. No IAP, and the number of hints will always return to 4 when you restart. Doesn't seem to access the Internet despite its permission & runs fine offline. Exits cleanly but, unfortunately, accidental tapping of the Back key during game play will also exit the game. (Use the 'i' button on the top right if you just want to pause or return to the main menu.)I am disappointed that the developer hasn't addressed any of the above issues that were also present in their earlier games so, despite it being a cheap fix at $0.99 for the Hidden Objects addicts, I can't give this game more than 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ID8JK23I46FW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEFTNVY#wasThisHelpful","R1ID8JK23I46FW","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you were like me - attracted by its clean lines & bright colours reminiscent of a certain comic style - you could be disappointed by its gameplay.Yes, the graphics looks nice (although not as good as for instance Sine Mora), but you can pretty much see all there is in the screenshots. The background, the asteroids, the minions basically remain the same and, with levels that seem too long, they can become a bit boring after a while. There is also a lack of distinctive & memorable bosses.Most aircraft shooter games either progress from bottom to top in portrait mode, or from left to right in landscape mode. Strange that M.A.C.E. chose a bottom to top progression in a landscape mode. This design choice made me feel not enough headroom to maneuver my plane. Moreover, the basic weapon is p*** poor, and the few more powerful ones unimaginative. Weapon upgrade availability seems too sparse too.This is a very plain shooter game that draws you in with its graphics, but lack the substance to keep you interested. At best worth a 4 as a free game, it gets a 3 from me considering its regular price is $1.99.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R50559HO28O5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EC9HWQK#wasThisHelpful","R50559HO28O5V","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Monkey Racing is a SIMPLE racing game. There are 80 tracks, and so far looks like none of them have sharp bends, or hairpin turns, or other difficult situations that require top driving skills. There are obstacles on the tracks, but they don't have any long-lasting damaging effects. You start out slow as a pig (incidentally that's the vehicle model I chose LOL), but there are bonuses you can pick up along the way that will help, and you can also earn coins to upgrade your vehicle's speed, acceleration, stability, and grip.This game appears to have been designed with ACHIEVABLE PROGRESS. (Be warned they really ramped up the difficulty after Track #29.) You have to complete (come first in) 5 successive tracks before unlocking the next 5, and every few tracks there is a ""champion"" whom you have to beat to unlock new vehicle models, but it's not too hard to accomplish that - especially if you picked up the appropriate bonuses. As I have said, you earn coins in each race and, although replaying a completed track will only give you peanuts (not in the literal sense), there is no IAP, and the upgrades increase in price only after 2-3 purchases. Customization made to your vehicle do not cost coins.I only played this on my phone (KitKat 4.4.4) and I encountered no bugs. I can only hope it will be the same on your device too.Monkey Racing contains no dubious components nor require questionable permissions. Despite listed as requiring the Internet permission, it never accessed the Internet during my sessions & played fine offline. It also exits cleanly.Its regular price of $2.99 might seem a bit pricey for some, but if you got it on discount or while free it should be well worth your money and time.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Afterthoughts]Having now completed all 80 levels in Normal Mode, I can say this game (1) cheats, and (2) have intermittent steering problems.This is not a fair game. It is rigged to favour the competition. Just off my head, they include (but not limited to):-  The competition have less downtime when they crash or gets blown up; and their ""wreckage"" can still block you somewhat, not so the other way around-  There's more boost for them in each nitro bonus, especially if they're coming from behind you-  If there's any coming together, you are more likely to be worse off; also, they find it easy to flip you over when they tail-end you, but not vice versa-  If there's an incoming rocket alert & you duck to one side, the rocket never comes! only when you're again in their line of fire then you can guess what will happenHonestly there is no need for the game to cheat! The competition already gets automatic upgrades and have faultless steering!! What more do you want? Frustrated players??While I was fortunate not to experience any start-up problem, nor force closes & with it failure to save my progress, I did find the steering sometimes unresponsive, and sometimes the car went the other way!  Now if you don't steer at all you will see that your car will just veer with the bend, it doesn't go straight. Also, sometime after you crashed you will have one side of your wheels ripped off or as if its tyres had blown, so your car will only trudge along & slanting toward the affected side. I suspect these two internal settings are affecting the steering, and the developer should really look at the code and fix it!Luckily, the steering problem doesn't manifest itself all the time, and despite a bias favouring the competition, they can be overcome (my upgrades in the end were a notch or two below maximum), so I will only deduct half-a-star for a revised rating of 4.5. But, seriously, you the developers should fix them for a more enjoyable game worthy of $2.99.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWO30UK52RMPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZCHR7I#wasThisHelpful","RWO30UK52RMPP","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A simple game like Connect Four that you play against your friends or family is OK as a time killer in the real world. It has been around for so long, and there are only so much possible moves, that you would likely want to move on to another game after just a few rounds.Converting it into an electronic game means you don't need the physical board (pass your device around to take turns to play), and you don't even need a physical opponent because there's always the A.I. (Artificial Intelligence). But it could still get a bit boring after a few games. EnsenaSoft, instead of designing some new twist to the game to extend your interest, opted to prettify it. So, you get soothing music, an animated background, and various animations during gameplay. The irony, however, is that the board itself become quite small (doesn't fill up the screen & occupy less than half the width!), and some of the animations are distracting with no way to turn them off.  I guess they never thought of providing a variable size board which is a pity.The version I'm reviewing is v1.1, and it has some questionable permissions like getting your accounts' info, read phone state, and get a list of running tasks. The first two could be related to Playphone which bills itself as a social gaming network but in truth just another game marketer & big data collector, but the latter is completely unnecessary. To be fair, this game didn't access the Internet during my testing & ran fine offline, but there is no guarantee that it will never do it. Why would you want a third-party network like Playphone when most if not all users already have access to Google Play or Amazon GameCircle or both? I definitely would like to see it removed together with those permissions. As a saving grace, at least this game exits cleanly.This is an average game, with some unwanted permissions & component, and overpriced at $1.99.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VCUG2XB0R1B2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTU7HK4#wasThisHelpful","R3VCUG2XB0R1B2","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've missed this the first time when it was free, get it now. (Or risking having to wait for the next time it goes on sale for a dollar.)This is a puzzle game that puts you in a surreal Escheresque environment, and you have to guide the protagonist Princess Ida past each chapter to see what's it all about. An excellent example of immersive gaming experience, it's best that I don't reveal any spoilers so that you could explore it like a babe in the woods.I didn't bother to write a review when I first bought this game, nor the last time when it was free, because there were plenty of reviews praising & recommending it already. I downloaded it today to see if there are any new content* and, yes, there is a new chapter called ""Ida's Dream"" which you can access via the + icon on the top center of the main screen. (The right icon is Settings, the left Credits. To exit the game just use your Back key.) Unfortunately, I don't think we will be seeing any more new free chapters, because they're offering ""Forgotten Shores"" (8 new chapters) as an In-App Purchase for $1.99.This game does contain Flurry although it seems to have been disabled.

"Looks like someone took a look at 2048, decided not to produce another clone but instead give it a new twist by making shapes instead of adding up numbers, and ended up with this.It's an endless game but if you played until there are no more moves, you might not want another go. It's BORING.  Each slide that doesn't result in merging of blocks will generate a new block and, several times I found myself left with only two blocks, slid to merge them, then having to slide them meaninglessly to another side just so a new block will appear (but you don't know where). Those Power-Ups are actually a necessity because there are no undo's and no support for detaching merged blocks; you can't move some of them so you could in a sense use them as stop posts but sometimes they just get in the way.There are no ads nor IAP's. It does have Flurry and Chartboost but they seem to have been disabled. In fact, it doesn't even seem to be accessing the Internet; but then again I never clicked on any scoreboard or ""More"" buttons, so it really shouldn't be. Unfortunately, this game does NOT exit cleanly. It will continue to use the CPU in the background. Considering that almost all Android devices run on batteries, this is an unforgivable oversight.You could download and try out this game while it is free, but be warned you might find it boring once the novelty wears off. Noodlecake should've made it free and improve the game based on user feedback before charging for it.

"Yep. Pretty much all you have to do is keep your finger pressed on the 'Accelerate' button, go as far as your vehicle will take you, go back to the garage to buy upgrades, then try again. Undemanding, unapologetic destructive fun. Skills & strategies not required. Contains no malware, no IAP, and exits cleanly. Requires the Internet permission but runs fine offline.-  While the prices for the better vehicles seem steep, don't worry. You will earn more the further you progress. You should be able to ride on the ultimate vehicle with everything maxed out in or before the final part.-  The next-step-up vehicle is always better than your current one. Make upgrades to your current vehicle, but switch to a better one as soon as you have enough money.-  The Fuel & Boost upgrades are the cheapest, but they won't help much by themselves. It's better to distribute your money on different upgrades.-  The only exception is the Gun upgrade which I regard as a waste of money. You can't choose when & where to shoot, and ammunition is limited. You can just skip this upgrade for all the vehicles.-  It's not necessary to fiddle with the 'Head Down' & 'Tail Down' buttons on the left because your vehicle will hardly flip over. In fact, I feel sometimes it breaks the stride. It might help a little in the final part of the route though.-  In the final part of the route - Exodus Drive - when you should have already maxed out every upgrade, if you can't complete it you might want to release your finger from the 'Accelerate' and/or 'Boost' button while your vehicle is in the air to conserve fuel.-  Once you've completed the Story Mode, the Halloween Mode and the Championship Mode will be unlocked. The former requires you to destroy pumpkins along the route, the latter is just trying to better your time in reaching a checkpoint under a limited budget. Interesting variations, but not half as fun as Story Mode.There is quite a bit of self-promotion in this game, not least plugging for their sequel Earn to Die 2, and a pop-up will ask you to rate after reaching the first checkpoint; nevertheless, those minor annoyances are not enough to dissuade me from giving this game a 5.

"This app is designed like your grandpa is building a clubhouse for you, and you will be helping him with certain small chores. There isn't much to 'learn' from this app other than perhaps some of the tools' names, and it's not really a game despite having to help put some broken pieces back together (6 or 7 different broken items at most I think); it's just a simple interactive experience.While this app might be amusing for 2 & 3-year-olds, it lacks challenge for older kids. The activities are too simple: you tap a colour paintbrush to paint a piece of furniture, no brushing with your finger; similarly, tap on the dotted line to cut a board, no swiping required. I'm pretty sure my 6-year-old niece would rather play something else after 10 minutes with this.You needn't worry about unsolicited components with this app though. The only questionable component is Flurry, but it seems to have been deactivated. This app asks for the Internet permission, but probably only uses it if you tap on the 'More' button to see what else Noodlecake has to offer.

"While the words 'matching' 'colour' 'blocks' & the way it looks suggest something similar to Collapse!, Matchblocks is nothing like it. This is just a rather dumb exercise in tapping. You look at the colours on the fallen blocks, then tap the corresponding colours on the colour bar below to eliminate them. There are also bonuses in the form of circles, and you have to tap on them to get them; sometimes tapping the number of times indicated on them. Blocks & bonuses fall from the top & stack on one another to form a messy heap.

"Cryptogram Puzzles is a simple code breaker game in which letters of the alphabet are scrambled. Your task, as an Alan Turing wannabe, is to  find out which letter represents which.On your first run, you will be greeted with a EULA (End User License Agreement), the release notes for the latest version, and then some instructions. It is not often we find apps & games that do this, but I welcome such a move and don't find them intrusive. You will not be bothered by them on subsequent runs. On the main screen, you can set the background theme, the difficulty level, the type of quote/proverb to use, etc., or simply press 'New Puzzle' to play. The games are not timed, but the app does keep score and, not only is it difficult to achieve a perfect score, but it's equally hard to get a positive score!  A negative score will be added every time you entered an incorrect guess, or when you used a hint, so you really have to think before entering anything. (I did get a perfect score for a proverb because it had a lot of 'the's & 'is's but I don't think I can repeat that feat often.)  Unfortunately, there is no way to turn off scoring, so you'll just have to ignore it. If you want to quit during a game but want to save your progress for resuming later on, the game supports saving it. When you have completed a game, however, you will not find a convenient ""New Puzzle"" option; instead, you'll have to go back to the main menu and select 'New Puzzle' from there.The difficulty levels - as far as I could see - differ in the amount of feedback the game gives you. For instance, 'Low Difficulty' will indicate whether your entered letter is correct or not in real time, but 'Expert' difficulty will not - and you would have to press 'Check' manually to see if your answer is correct.In the main screen, you have the option to enter a 'Custom Message' and the game will encrypt it for you. You can then pass your device to a friend or family member for them to solve. Therefore, you are not restricted to the phrases chosen by the developer, and that for me is a nice touch. I just wish the game would allow us to save our own messages for re-use.This game can be considered to be free from malware. There are the usual Amazon stuff, and I believe its Internet Access Permission is primarily used for Amazon Insight, but the game runs fine offline. There is also a Quit button, but which did not perform a clean exit during my testing. It was still using the CPU intermittently although - to be fair - not much. Still, if the developer is reading this, I hope you will fix it in an update. I suspect something to do with saving the game's data on KitKat but don't quote me on that.All in all, despite the minor quibbles that I've mentioned, the game is still good value for a dollar, and deserves 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MCEN45OSSMPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006QCMQBW#wasThisHelpful","R3MCEN45OSSMPA","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have bought & completed Amazing Breaker over two years ago, and I still have fond memories of it. In a nutshell, you slingshot different weapons to destroy the beautiful sculptures in each level, and you are required to destroy a certain percentage of them in order to pass and unlock the next level. You can do bank shots (bounce your weapons off the wall), switch the top two weapons available to you, etc. As you progress, you will soon realize choosing the ideal order of weapons, applying the right force & angle will be the key to success. I can tell you that all levels are solvable, and you should be able to achieve 100% total destruction for the majority of levels!There is no IAP, and no malware to be wary of. It asks for the network access permission, which I believe is for the now-discontinued Scoreloop gaming network, but otherwise runs just fine offline. It exits cleanly too.It has been quite some time since I've played this game and this, the latest Amazon version, seems not as smooth & a bit too easy to misfire. I'm not sure if it's my phone because after all I've gone through two different ones during the period. Moreover, this version doesn't seem to be as new as the one in the Play Store, so there is the odd chance it might not run on the latest exotic device. Please try it yourself, preferably on another device if it doesn't run for you.I highly recommend this game. It's great value for a dollar, and it's like an early Christmas present when free.

Nothing new, nothing exciting, but good for killing some time before you move on to another game.Control is limited to tilting only, so don't expect being able to make sharp reversals of direction. The graphics are blocky, the music noisy. Levels have to be unlocked by completing their previous ones. If you get hit 3 times, or get all your eggs snatched away, you die.

Words can be matched based on a number of criteria, and so it isn't as straightforward as spotting associations between words, but also how to pair them so each word is matched with another with no orphans. For instance, both ""full"" and ""able"" could be matched to ""bodied"" to form a compound word, but one of them needs to be matched with another word. You start by picking a word from EITHER side, then pick one that you believe is its match on the other side. If the words are completely unrelated, usually you won't be able to select the second word; but it sometimes get it wrong as in 'tea' & 'break'. If they have something in common, the game will let you select it *but* they might not be the correct pairing for solving the puzzle. Sometimes, the game will tell you ""the last pair can't be matched"" and you have to try other combinations, but it seems the game isn't always so attentive to your mismatches.The puzzles aren't timed, and you can pick any puzzle to play without having to unlock them in turn. The puzzles you have completed will have a bright yellow star on them, while those in progress a smaller brown star. This Mega Pack contains the basic Smile Pack with 40 puzzles, and the Mega Pack 1 with 400 more for a total of 440 puzzles. There are 5 other Mega Packs, each with 400 puzzles, available for in-app purchase at $1.99 individually, or $4.99 for all 5 (2000 puzzles). There are no hints in each puzzle, but I don't think anyone would need them even with the occasional new slang words like 'pwn' which I believe hasn't made it into all mainstream dictionaries yet. The developer's choice of words & their perceived relationship isn't always perfect, and sometimes debatable. Despite all that, the difficulty of the puzzles is only average (well I checked the ""last"" puzzles in the packs), and I would expect the average player to complete each puzzle in around 30 seconds, give or take 20.WTW is basically free from malware, although it contains Chartboost (could be strictly for analytics only) and will access the Internet. However, it runs fine offline. A 'Please Rate' pop-up appeared after puzzle #8 but, after I pretended to do so (tapped ""Rate It Now"" then simply press the Back button to return to the game), it never reared its head again all through the remaining 32 puzzles & more. It also exits cleanly - something which I believe the developer added in after others complained about its absence in previous versions.440 puzzles might seem a lot but I am sure some of you will be able to breeze through them in an hour or two; thus I think $1.99 might be a *little* bit overpriced. Moreover, although they don't bother me, the self-promo material on the main screen & the rate-me should be tucked out of sight accessible only if the user (parent) allows it. The same goes for Chartboost. As a result, my rating is actually 4.5.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R184CQWSX7KOJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006VW94HQ#wasThisHelpful","R184CQWSX7KOJ9","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing you will notice is that there are NO instructions nor explanations. There are 4 courses, each with 18 holes. The four buttons with clubs above the courses' name are for specifying the number of players, so you can pass the device around for local multiplayer games. For each hole there is a par (naturally), but also a maximum number of strokes; if you exceed the latter, you'll be shuffled along to the next hole. NO NEED to, and NO WAY to, keep trying until you can get the ball into the hole - unless you are okay with replaying the whole course again & again till you make it. Swipe anywhere on the screen to change direction of your shot, then press down on the green Power button on the lower right to adjust the power, and let go to strike it. If your ball goes out of bounds, no additional penalty is added other than the shot you took.I ""finished"" the whole game in less than an hour. I am not saying I ""completed"" it because I didn't. While I was able to achieve below par for the first two courses, I got ""shuffled along"" quite a number of times during the last two courses. There were quite a few holes I didn't actually ""complete"". However, I have no interest to replay the game & better my score, and here's why:-  The first course (Rookie) is dead easy. The second (Journeyman) more challenging. But the third (Masters) & fourth (Jinxed) are simply too contrivedly difficult. There are disappearing & reappearing segments, portals, moving objects, etc., and the way the developer combines them make them more frustrating than challenging.-  You cannot pan, rotate, or zoom in & out to see the course and, more importantly, the hole. Every time you begin a hole, the camera will pan around in a fixed fashion. That's all the view you will get.-  There is no indication of the power you used in your last shot, and I can accept that; after all, not all mini-golf games provide such a feature. However, the direction of your shot is always reset to point to the direction of the hole (even when it's out of sight) and completely unrelated to the obstacle right in front of you. Now the game doesn't support FINE adjustments of direction, so it can be quite frustrating when you got the direction right but not the power in your last shot, then everything got reset.-  Once you pressed down on the Power button, it will just keep on cycling through the power levels, and you CANNOT ABORT the shot. Neither can you further adjust the direction. Timing plays a crucial part in most of the holes in the last two courses and, since Power + Shoot are tied together instead of separate steps, you need as much dumb luck as trial-and-error when a shot calls for both precise power and exact timing.Mini Golf Mundo contains no malware, it contacts the Amazon servers but runs fine offline. and it does exit cleanly. Nevertheless, it is not as enjoyable as it could be, and not worthy of 5 stars even for $0.99. Since its regular price is $1.99, I will only give it a 3.(* The above review is for v1.2.1, and I hope that EnsenaSoft will be making improvements to future versions. I had bought 2 games from them already & I know they should be capable of producing a more decent game than this current version.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V7KP8IPU0HE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWSDNG2#wasThisHelpful","R3V7KP8IPU0HE4","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The graphics are beautiful, but they don't look sharp enough even on a 5.5&#34; 1920x1080 screen, and becomes a slight problem on cluttered hidden objects scenes. The mini-game is too small, not even using half the screen's width.I have come to expect a few good hours of entertainment from each Artifex Mundi game, and this seems no exception. Apart from the self-promo material, it's free from malware, runs fine offline, and exits cleanly.

"There is debate on whether RAM Booster & Task Killer apps are actually useful, but only two things are for sure: (1) ALL of them will tell you they are useful, and (2) they themselves will drain your battery by constantly running in the background. True Booster v1.1.4 wants you to feel they are truthful & honest by telling you what ""other boosters won't tell you"", namely: (1) certain apps will turn themselves back on after boosting, and (2) constant boosting can drain your device. Well, while some boosters do neglect to point out these facts up front, I don't think any of them denies them.True Booster told me, after its initial analysis, that I had 61% battery remaining, 44% RAM (1.3GB!) free, and 42% storage (24GB!) free which it considered to be all ""Normal"", but still it flashes its ""Boost Needed"" button. Really? OK, I'm not going to knock it for that; but then you know what? Killing tasks was NEVER a sophisticated process (you could do it yourself by clearing your recent apps menu), but NOT KILLING crucial tasks is important in order not to ruin your system. You can manually select which running apps to exclude if you use True Booster's ""Boost Now"", but its ""Auto Boost"" will only allow presets of ""All"", ""Top 5 Data Consuming Apps"", and ""Top 5 Battery Consuming Apps"". There are NO WHITELISTS with which you can exclude apps that you know should remain running!! BIG FAIL!!On the other hand, True Booster wants to know your location & read your low-level system logs. Let me tell you there is ABSOLUTELY NO NEED for those permissions to boost your system! They are NOTHING BUT POTENTIAL PRIVACY HAZARDS. I suggest you read True Booster's privacy policy to see what they can collect & disclose.If you have a rooted device, there are many apps that could do what True Booster claims to do - and more. If you don't, no need to despair. Check out CCleaner for storage/cache cleaning, and Greenify for auto-hibernating apps that you feel shouldn't run in the background. The former is free; the latter as good as free. If you want something all-in-one then check out Clean Master* which I believe is the most downloaded app of its kind & is also free. Just for the record, I am NOT affiliated with any of the above. I had used them (otherwise I won't be commenting on them) but, apart from CCleaner which I'm keeping around as an alternative, I am using other PAID apps instead because they suit me better for one reason or another. What I would never do, however, is pay $1.99 for a commonplace booster app with dubious permissions like True Booster.*  The current version of Clean Master in the Amazon Appstore is v5.9.0 and also requires the read low level logs permission. The latest version in the Play Store is v5.9.7 and does NOT require it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IQAY4PO84F4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VU444I4#wasThisHelpful","R3IQAY4PO84F4V","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coffee Mahjong is simply another mahjong solitaire game with a coffee theme. The background and the tiles are all coffee-related pictures; even the somewhat zen-like background music has coffee dripping sound LOL. They might be visually pleasing for coffee addicts, but personally I find them to be so-so.In this game, the blocked tiles just seem to be coated with a layer of chocolate, but you can still make out what they are. There is also a hint button, so together they help to make playing less frustrating I suppose. What I cannot understand is why they designed the game to be 15-minute sessions. Once you start playing, the timer will start counting down (if you switch to another app, the timer will pause), and you try to get as high a score as possible within that time frame. A new game will always start out from Level 1 AGAIN, and you don't get to choose which level to play.This game seems to be free from malware. It asks for the Internet permission, but as long as you don't tap the ""More Games"" button in its main screen, I don't think it will access the Internet. Anyway, it runs fine offline. When you have finished playing the game, be sure to tap the ""Quit"" button in the main screen to exit; pressing your device's Back key won't really quit & this game will continue to run in the background draining your battery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RTVMI1VKSJYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8LDHA4#wasThisHelpful","R3RTVMI1VKSJYG","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rotate It!, as its name implies, requires you to tap and ""ROTATE the pieces until all ends are closed""; in other words, CONNECT the pieces until there are no more ""orphan"" pieces, but only PIPES with CAPPED ENDS. There are usually more than one pipe in a level, and a pipe might have more than 2 capped ends.You can play in the Zen mode, which has a timer but it's only for reference; or you can play the Challenge mode where the timer counts down and you have to finish before time runs out. You also have 3 backgrounds to choose from, and the option to turn the grid on and off. The music is relaxing, but you can turn it off too if it's not your cup of tea. You are not required to complete a level before attempting the next, you can pick ANY level you like; and completed levels will be shown in dark cyan just so you know. This game requires no special permission, has no IAP or self-promo material, and doesn't use the Internet. It also exits cleanly too.All the levels are played on a 13x7 grid, but earlier levels which don't use up the whole grid won't automatically zoom in to show only the playable area; making the pieces seem unnecessarily small especially on phones with small screens. That shouldn't be a problem for most people though, as with the lack of a hint system because I think the average player should be able to solve all the levels given enough patience.I think Rotate It! offers good value for a dollar, and recommend that you try it out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FVYBA91G4O85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZ1HELA#wasThisHelpful","R1FVYBA91G4O85","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"dock it - saga!, like Flappy Bird, is a game that will polarize opinions. Some find its simple gameplay addictive, others might find it monotonous.All you have to do is look for openings & stick the dots to the rotating big circle, like pins to a pin cushion, or spokes to a wheel. As you progress, the big circle will be rotating quicker & already have more dots attached (less room for your dots). Call it brainless if you like, but it might help you to focus & improve your eye-hand coordination.There are two modes: the Classic mode with dots & a big circle, and the Space mode which is just a cosmetic change with you firing modules at a mother ship instead. You have to pass one level before the next is unlocked, but there is the option to skip the current level if you failed it; you can also go back and play an earlier (and presumably easier) level if you wish.This game is free from malware and IAP. It does connect to the Amazon Web Services server behind your back, but you can play the game offline. It also exits cleanly telling Android that it wants to quit, and that in my humble opinion is what every responsible app should do.dock it! is almost identical to the free but ad-supported game aa, minus the questionable permissions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGNETH3ZL76BE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S8HXDKQ#wasThisHelpful","RGNETH3ZL76BE","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Motivated Moms (MoMo), in a word, is another to-do list manager. You have to pay $1.99 for this ""full version"", and $7.99 (currently $4.99 on Mother's Day discount for a limited time) for a one year subscription for ""preplanned tasks and backup of your customizations"".You are requested to register & keep an account with the publisher to enable syncing across devices. You can use the app without registration, but boy it will remind you what you are losing out every time you enter the app. While I am not against subscriptions as a business model (and I have paid for a few active subscriptions myself), it all boils down to whether it is NECESSARY (such as *free* news app that you pay to remove ads) & whether it's WORTH it. I doubt very much MoMo's preplanned tasks will fit everyone's needs, or that such tasks change much over time to warrant a subscription.* What is wrong with or so difficult about entering YOUR tasks YOURSELF? Then too, why can't MoMo use our Google or Amazon account to ""save & sync our task data""? Or make backups to cloud storage? Sorry, but MoMo doesn't even backup locally, so you risk losing all your data if your device crashes & require a factory reset.On the surface MoMo seems to work as described. However, there are many areas that I found strange or inadequate, such as:-  No reminders (pop-ups, alarms, etc.) for individual tasks, or at least no way to customize them.-  No support for postponing a task.-  Option to use color assignments for tasks but no way to change them. In fact, not much you can customize about the interface!-  Puzzling choice in that you can choose a repeat period of every x weeks, but not every x days or months or years.-  Repeat tasks are based on scheduled dates only, and cannot use completed dates as reference.-  If you change your mind after choosing Selected Days/Weeks/Months, tapping 'Cancel' will not direct you back to the 'Pick Due Date' screen; instead you have to select None or Not Weekly/Monthly.-  There seems to be a bug that when you edit an existing task, a duplicate with the modified data will be created instead.-  Bible Reading as a standalone default task!? (At least you could turn it off.)-  No support for task priorities, sub-tasks, etc.MoMo seems to be free from malware but it does contain Flurry, although I'm not sure whether it's still active. It can be run offline, although you might be reminded of that every time as it tries to communicate with its servers. Moreover, it will remain running in the background when you ""exit"" the app; that is actually desirable if it has a functional reminder system to remind you of overdue tasks. *IF*.There are MANY to-do list and task managers in the market. Popular ones such as Any.do & Todoist ask for subscriptions too, but they are more powerful & customizable than MoMo. If you want only simple checklist types, you can use your calendar (and Google Tasks if you use their calendar), or check out the many free alternatives. I strongly advise users to compare alternatives before buying this. I'm not even ruling out the possibility that you *might* find MoMo to be perfect for you but, for me, MoMo simply doesn't justify its price for the casual user nor the demanding one.*  Why is the ""Ability to add unlimited custom tasks"" touted as a feature? Surely the ability to enter tasks relevant only to us, and enter as many as we want, is a BASIC requirement for ALL task managers!!

"As far as I can see, the only strategies involved are:-  capture the nearest islands (because they take less time for your troops to get there);-  capture neutral islands first;-  capture the biggest islands first (because troops will grow faster on a larger island)Other than the above, it's just a matter of tap, tap, tap because the AI (enemy) will pause between successive attacks, but you don't have to; or wait for the enemies to fight it out then capture one of their decimated islands; but if there is more than one enemy & both start out with more troops than you, you better hope they fight each other instead of targeting you because there is no way you're going to survive - strategies or no strategies.Graphics are crude and, while you can turn off the sound through your device's Menu button, there isn't much you can customize.

"This is in essence another room escape game, although sometimes you try to get in rather than get out. There are 15 levels (rooms), but the first level is a tutorial, so there are actually only 14. But there is a Secret Room the access to which I believe depends on you having collected all 15 gems.* In each level there is a gem lying about. If you realize you had missed one later on, you can always go to previously completed levels to find one. I don't think you need to go through the whole level again. For example, I completed Level 5 before I realize I didn't get one in Level 4; so I went back & found it sitting on the window sill. No need to ""replay"" the whole level.The graphics, for me, is a notch better than other prolific room-escape publishers. Early levels are not very difficult but looks like later ones would present more of a challenge. If you are stuck, help is available via walkthroughs which the game will lead you to the relevant one on YouTube. The game contains no malware and, although it does use the Internet, it runs fine offline. This game by itself is quite decent as a matter of fact.Unfortunately, I have to deduct two stars from its rating. First of all, there are too much self-serving info in the game. You see ""More Games"" & ""Rate Me"" almost everywhere (-0.5). A ""Rate Me"" will pop up on entering Level 4 which I got rid of by pretending to rate, only to find out later on that it seems to be hard-coded to pop up whenever you go into Level 4. The other major annoyance being that this game does NOT exit cleanly! It remains running in the background consuming on average around 2% of the CPU!! (-1)  This game will give you an hour or two of entertainment, after which there is very little replay value, so I think $0.99 is a more fitting price than the $1.99 it asks for (-0.5).*  As another reviewer had discovered, you don't really need to collect all the gems to access the Secret Room.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S85YBNHKFLK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PW2MUKO#wasThisHelpful","R2S85YBNHKFLK8","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is just a collection of (public domain?) wallpapers gleaned from the Internet. I counted 39 which actually isn't a lot given the different tastes of millions of users. The collection here is OK; nothing exceptional or exclusive; quite a few I've seen floating around the net for ages. You can set any one as your device's wallpaper, or share it. That's it. Not much in terms of functionality. The wallpapers are NOT high-resolution ones and, since there is no 'tiling' option for Android wallpapers, they have to be 'expanded' to fill a high-resolution screen, and lose some of their sharpness in the process.This 'app' contains Google Ads, but it seems to be disabled. It asks for the Internet permission, but doesn't seem to be using it & runs fine offline. There are no IAP's or self-adverts (nor should there be!), and exits quite cleanly using the Back key.I have to be blunt and say you'd be better off visiting one of those wallpaper websites on the Internet instead of relying on this app. At least they have more choices & have new content added regularly.

"Everything about this game is SIMPLE. Simple game mechanics, simple gameplay, simple graphics. Whip Swing is like a cross between Hanger & Flappy Bird, without the broken limbs of the former, but with the same one-dimensional challenge of the latter.Personally I did not find this game interesting, if not a bit boring. You cannot decide where to attach your whip (always 45° to the right only), and the playing field is not tall enough. Unless you're a die-hard fan of Flappy Bird & its ilk, it's likely you won't like it too.At least this game does not contain any malware, except the usual Amazon components.

"The first thing you'll notice about Deep Under the Sky is its beautiful, high-def graphics. A colourful razzle-dazzle which, by itself, would make an attractive live wallpaper. In the midst of this visual splendour we have a hairy alien jellyfish that is trying to fill the alien land with its progenies. To do that, you will help it launch little jellyfishes and guide them to nests to plant babies. The game is played using just one button, but I found that you can tap anywhere on the screen to represent tapping the button. Each tap will perform different actions depending on what's in store (lower left), like different cartridges in a magazine (think Angry Birds with different birds lined up but in a fixed order). In the most simple sequence, the first tap on the button will launch a mini jellyfish, then the next tap will explode it (to impregnate the nest); Of course, in later levels, we have other actions like jet propel the jellyfish, hold down the button to roll it on the ground or swing it (grapple), etc.The game is played in 'discovery' mode. That is to say you don't get to see the whole playing field, but only parts of it as your little jellyfish moves around. There are little arrows that point out the directions of the nests, but they are only approximates and won't tell you whether there are obstacles in the way; so you'll have to discover the exact locations of the nests yourself.There are 4 Chapters and each has 20 levels, so there are plenty of exploring as well as seeding to do. There are no time limits, and you have an endless supply of little jellyfishes. You are not required to complete one level before you can play the next; you can choose any level of any chapter to play, so there's less frustration & wastage when you can't finish a level. If you collect all the bonus stars (2 in each level & you'll have to discover their locations without hint), you can unlock the ""hardcore DARK MODE"". Apart from a stunningly beautiful dark theme, you now play as an alien squid, and you have to directly hit each seed pod to impregnate them. Challenging yet difficult!The game is free from malware and - although it asks for the network permission - it doesn't seem to be using it & runs fine offline. It also exits cleanly. And, despite its heavy graphics, it didn't make my phone especially hot to the touch.Deep Under the Sky might not be as unique as Sarah's previous game Incredipede, but it's distinctive enough & not just another ""me too"" game. I'm not sure why, but currently it's cheaper in the Appstore ($2.99) than the Play store ($3.99); for $2.99 it's 5 stars from me.[Addendum]Having now completed the game, I must say it's well worth its price. Level design is good, and you won't feel one level is simply the clone of another with minor changes; Perhaps the names they gave to each level reflect its layout design, but I was too busy playing to verify that LOL. Timing (when & where to perform an action) is very important, and you should also take into account the behaviour of each action (releasing your finger while rolling to jump up a bit, or letting it swing 360 degrees until it turns the other way, etc.).I have encountered no bugs when playing this game, although it could do with some changes to the interface. For instance, the game seems to have its own idea which landscape direction to lock itself in, and doesn't respond to device rotation. Also, you can't choose another level when you start the game; you can only play your last-played level but, once inside it, you can back out & choose another level. Having said that, they are not that annoying to negatively affect your enjoyment of the game.Last but not least, I would like to go on record & thank the developer for helping me get that elusive star in Chapter 2, Optio.

"This is a SURVIVAL game. As the night guard of Freddy's Pizza Parlour, you have to survive 5 nights (think of them as increasingly difficult levels) without being scared to death by one of the haunted toys (Animatronics). You don't leave the monitor room; they'll come and get you. Directly in front you is the entrance, and you tap on the square to flash your flashlight at it; on either side are two vents, and you use the light switches to see if anything's there. You will also make use of the CCTV's to monitor movements (the pull-up menu on the bottom right) and, when they do come into the room to face you, put on the mask (the red arrows on the bottom left) to ward them off.I cannot offer any detailed advice right now because I have only played the original. I'm leaving this sequel for the evenings (I feel it's best played in the dark) when I have at least 7-8 minutes (that's approximately how long each night is) of uninterrupted time. This isn't just my preference, it's also a necessity because you can't pause the game during a 'night'; the Back key will quit the game altogether, and tapping 'Continue' will take you to the same night but reset to the beginning.The game is free from malware, and doesn't need any special permissions including network access. Don't worry about the Google Ads code as it's just a leftover from its demo version. The game also exits cleanly.This is a game the appeal of which relies heavily on its immersive experience. While nothing to rave about, the somewhat grainy graphics & the crackling sounds all contribute to the eerie ambience. Some might find the game boring, or not for the faint-hearted; but love it or hate it, you'll just have to download it, try it, then decide for yourself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GE5AIMHHMTBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJ5AUCO#wasThisHelpful","R3GE5AIMHHMTBL","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another plain Hidden Objects game. It doesn't pretend to be an adventure game, nor has any storyline. It has a theme (Irish in this case) with background pictures (scenes) relevant to that theme, and you are to find all the listed objects for each scene within the time limit.The graphics are sharp & crisp, but the scenes require panning up & down to see the whole picture. Apparently the developer didn't think of taking advantage of higher resolution screens, as panning was required even on my 2560 x 1600 tablet. There is a zoom button, but it only supports one level of zoom: zoom in & zoom out, and doesn't support pinch-to-zoom.There are 3 game modes: 'Chill' is simply 'Traditional' with no time or hint limits. It says there are 3 levels per scene, which are 'Find by Picture', 'Find by Word', and 'Collector' in which you are to find multiple instances of an object. It seems the scenes in these two modes are different (16 scenes in all) so it won't feel too repetitive. The third mode 'Adventure' requires you to find objects by word only, but some of the words are scrambled and some have missing letters. The whole game isn't difficult at all and, despite the time limit in 2 of the modes, not very challenging. Why? Because there are NO PENALTIES FOR RANDOM CLICKING. You could just tap, tap, tap to find all the objects. And if you have played through the 'Chill' & 'Traditional' modes first, you'll probably be able to guess what the scrambled words & words with missing letters are.This game is free from malware, although it does communicate with the Amazon servers behind your back. However, it runs just fine offline. There are no In-App Purchases, although there is a game-controller icon on its home screen which would take you to see (and buy) their other games. This game also exits cleanly by pressing the Back button, although I wish when we are playing a scene it would take us back to its home screen instead of terminating the game.As mentioned above, there are certainly areas that could do with some improvement, not least by randomizing the items; for it seems - in this version anyway - the items to find for a scene always remain the SAME, thus reducing the game's overall replay value. I would rate this game 4.5 but, since its regular price is only $0.99, I'll round it up to 5.  Happy St. Patrick's Day!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KD3SYQQ1EA3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC9KQAA#wasThisHelpful","R3KD3SYQQ1EA3B","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The basic criteria with which we measure how good a Hidden Object game is always how well the objects are hidden. They shouldn't be too obvious, while on the other hand not too obscure or tricky; the latter I mean when an object that had eluded you was finally revealed, you would feel it was your own oversight & might even applaud the developer for hiding it so cleverly, rather than curse that it was for instance so fuzzy or placed on a same colour background that made it near impossible to spot. Unfortunately, this game has quite a few of those frustratingly hidden objects. The levels that require you to find objects by their silhouettes especially could do with some improvement.The graphics are in general OK, although the objects have varied degrees of clarity. The storyline... well, just cobbled together to forge some kind of link between the different levels, and not at all interesting. The Match-3 mini game after completing every 5 levels is dull, and not very accurate when recognizing the direction of your swipes.All in all, and I'm writing this only after I have completed all the levels, if you are looking for an inexpensive fix for your Hidden Object addiction, I guess $1.99 is a fair price considering the total number of levels included. If you are after a quality game, however, this game (or these 3 games) isn't it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LZK1UX1QN7AT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NCGV38W#wasThisHelpful","R1LZK1UX1QN7AT","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Please note this review has been edited to reflect my progress, but the game's verdict remains the same]Game mechanism is similar to Little Galaxy & TA: Little Red Riding Hood: Tap to hop from one rotating planet to the next. Game objective, however, is different - you are not trying to reach as many planets as possible, nor is there a ""destination"" planet; instead, you just try to collect all the stars that lie between the planets. There is no time-limit, and you won't ""die"" because it all happens in a wrap-around playing area.While ORBB doesn't have the beautiful graphics found in the other two games, its minimal yet adequate visuals do not detract from its simple yet engrossing gameplay. You might think this is relaxing game, but there is no shortage of challenges such as having to collect certain stars in the right order as introduced in Phase 3, having to contend with anti-gravity as in Phase 4, and purple planets that disappear after one jump in Phase 5. They are just not as frustrating and - having completed the game - I can report that all levels are solvable*.This game contains no malware or anything that you should worry about. It does use the Internet but seems primarily for Amazon services. If you are paranoid, you can always disable your Internet connection; this game runs fine offline. It doesn't have an exit button nor does the Back key work to quit the game; you'll have to press the Home key & swipe it off your Recent Apps menu. Anyway its CPU usage seems minimal while in the background. I saw the ""Rate Me"" prompts only twice through all 60 levels (after completing 2-5 & 4-15) which, to be fair, weren't too frequent but I do wish they would tuck it away in the main menu & let the player decide.In summary, the game itself deserves a 5 for its regular price of $0.99. I would have taken half-a-point away for the lack of a clean exit & the rating reminder, but I am quite happy to round it up rather than down because of its solid play value.* In the later stages where both wormholes & anti-gravity are at play, you might find yourself caught in a loop. I encountered it only once in 5-14. Simply replay the level. If the screen becomes blank on starting a new level, exit the game and restart. No harm done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T15WZ7MB8MB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PRSOG1E#wasThisHelpful","R3T15WZ7MB8MB8","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The version I reviewed was 1.4.0, and it did NOT seek my location. It doesn't even ask for any location permissions. Period. It has Google ads, Flurry, and In-App Purchase code, but none of them are active. I believe they are leftovers from the free version available in the Play Store, and this Amazon paid version should for all intent & purpose be considered as SAFE. It does use the Internet such as for accessing the Leaderboard, but it runs fine offline.The game doesn't perform a truly clean exit, as it still intermittently uses the CPU as a cached process in the background; but the usage is minimal & it'll be cleared out when you run out of memory anyway.The game itself is simple - in both senses of the word. One touch control to gather speed when traveling downhill, or when landing from the air. Your goal is to travel for as far, and as long, as possible beyond the 30-second initial timeframe. The graphics is equally simple too. Kind of like Flappy Bird.The game is quite bland, without variety and short of excitement. It's certainly not something I would pay for.

"This is the third Mobest's Escape games we got as FAOTD in a month. I must confess I'm getting more tired writing reviews about them than playing them LOL.As expected, the usual tap, tap, tap. Find clue to unlock the next clue. Repeat, until you eventually get the room key. This game is, chronologically speaking, released earlier than the previous two FAOTD ones, and it shows. All 15 stages (actually 14 because the first one was a tutorial) has only one main room - no side rooms; and the app will remain ACTIVE in memory when you press the Back key to exit (probably some wise guy's idea so you could always return to where you were in the game). Just remember to swipe it away in your Recent Apps list when finished with it. The game is clean (please don't blindly trust the ""scanner"" apps out there). It uses the Internet, but works fine offline (with the added benefit that its self-promos won't show nor work!)I would say the whole game in general is of medium difficulty, except for Stage 3 which is a walk in the room (I mean park). The usual graphics, neither better nor worse than the other Mobest games. If a more detailed window pop up when you tap an item in your inventory, it means either you have to tweak it in some way (try tap on different parts of the item) or you need to combine another item with it (although sometimes the combination is automatically done for you when you find the 2nd item). If the Rate-Me prompt comes up (after level 4 for me) just press 'Rate Now' instead of 'Skip' then Back key to return to the game.For $0.99 it's another inexpensive entertainment that will help kill an hour or two.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L2LRWM6Q7H93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KABHX4K#wasThisHelpful","R2L2LRWM6Q7H93","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who could forget Missile Command? It was the only game in the arcade that used a trackball when we were kids!  Missile Defender is the modern touchscreen rendition of it.  Personally, I find touching where you want your missiles to go is more fun than using a trackball (and definitely a mouse or joystick). Heck, it even supports multi-touch! (Although only two simultaneous touches as far as I could see.)If you are new to this game, its 3rd screenshot pretty much explains everything.  At the bottom you have your buildings (5 visually but they count as 12) & trees, which you have to protect them from enemy missiles & nukes dropped from the sky. (The UFOs aren't threats in themselves but they drop missiles too.)  Enemy attacks come in rounds (nights) between which you can take a breather and perform repairs & upgrades. You start off with a fixed number of repair points, and you earn more from completing each round, and you use them to repair damaged buildings & trees, or upgrade your missiles.  You can also get 50 repair points by (agreeing to but not necessarily) rating this game. I was prompted once after Night 11, so it was not too annoying.Trust me when I say you should upgrade your missiles as early as your repair points allow. The enemy's weapons will become increasingly faster, so you need all the upgrades.  There are 4 types of upgrades: increase the explosive area, missile capacity, duration of explosion, and missile speed.  Start off by upgrading each & every type, then gradually concentrate on those more suited to your needs.  They cost 15 repair points each initially, increasing with each level, until the maximum level 6 which would cost you 115-120 each.  While you might find yourself running out of missiles (which cannot be replenished during a round) at level 1, it's likely you have more than enough once you reached level 4-5; but I advise maxing out the other 3 upgrade types.The game, or rather the campaign, only ends when everything has been destroyed, although there is the option to start a new game (campaign) from the main menu. This game exits cleanly, and remembers your unfinished campaign.  All the upgrades you've made, and all the repair points you have accumulated during a campaign, however, gets reset when you start a new campaign.  That sucks, and you can see why the developer designed it that way because this game has In-App Purchase for repair points ($0.99 for 200 points & $2.99 for 800 points)! This is the chief reason why I am deducting a star from its rating.This game also asks for the Internet permission, and do uses it behind your back. However, it seems the website it's trying to reach is no longer operational LOL. It also has a slew of analytics, ads, and payment components, but they don't seem to be active and could possibly be just leftovers from the free version.  All in all, I don't see anything to be of major concern here except for the IAP.  To be absolutely safe, just play the game offline & disable IAP in your Appstore settings.[Addendum]After Night 30 the enemy fire comes thick & fast and, even after maxing out your missile upgrades, it's pretty much down to your reflexes & strategy (e.g. spraying a ""shield"" across the top of your buildings) to see how long you last. I've survived 40 Nights & I've only got average reflexes. And of course I didn't buy any repair points. A new game starts from the beginning when enemy fire is tame, so you've got time to accumulate & use points, just like how your ship in a shooter game picks up upgrades which won't carry over to a new game; it would be nice if they did, but not really essential. My advice is: instead of relying on whimsical & partial reviews from certain ""Top Reviewers"", always test out a FAOTD yourself! (Unless it's said to be harmful & you don't know how to protect yourself.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MVBO7N2VTNOE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005XQLBU4#wasThisHelpful","R3MVBO7N2VTNOE","A3ADHH1ZFGJY27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ADHH1ZFGJY27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Kâ€™3 is a great drive thatâ€™s been working well for me to use with my Android phone and tablet.DESIGNThe drive has a nice metallic design and is very slim. Itâ€™s definitely unobtrusive when plugged into a computer. While not as small as the PK Paris Kâ€™1, it isnâ€™t much bigger. It has a brushed metal look to it, and definitely feels durable and of high quality. One one end is the USB 3.0 port, and on the other end is a micro USB connector. There is a cap that covers the micro USB connector, along with a string that goes through both the flash drive and cap, so that the cap wonâ€™t be misplaced when the micro USB connector is used. The USB 3.0 end has a slim profile without a â€œbodyâ€, so it is just the connector that makes up the drive.SPEEDTransfers speeds on this flash drive were quite fast. In my tests, I got an average of 117 MB/s for read, and 35 MB/s for write on USB 3.0 ports in a MacBook Pro. Itâ€™s a very fast drive that lives up to its claims. Note that if you use this with a USB 2.0 port, your speeds will be limited by that port, so you wonâ€™t get these results.USAGEI use the Kâ€™3 mainly to transfer files between my Android tablet and phone from my computer. Itâ€™s especially useful in my school and work where the Internet is spotty, so I cannot always rely on that to transfer my files.

I see these as the best uses and features of this tiny drive, at least for me.If I ever need to unplug this drive, it comes with a small lanyard I can put through a hole on the drive itself and attach to a keychain.

"This Kâ€™lip USB drive is a great drive with a unique design and features that make it one I love to use.DESIGN/USAGEThe Kâ€™lip has a name which matches its function; it has a carabiner clip built in to the drive that makes for easy attachment to a keychain. I sometimes even attach it to my belt buckle. It is indeed waterproof, and in my tests I was able to dunk it in a bowl of water and still use it afterwards. Of course, the practical application of this is if the drive gets wet in the rain, or falls into a puddle, or other similar situations. I find this a very useful feature especially for a drive that you plan to keep on a keychain. Itâ€™s also solidly built - the drive feels very solid during my use, and I donâ€™t feel that it will break or get damaged in any way, even when I toss it on my keychain with all my keys.Keep in mind that because of the carabiner clip, the drive is a little larger and will stick out quite a bit in a computer.

"When it comes to Apple Watch docks, thereâ€™s tons on the market. The bottom line: The Basecamp Dock has a beautiful design and is solidly built, but takes some time to set up.WHATâ€™S IN THE BOX?Basecamp dock3 different sized silicon pads2 white â€œanchorsâ€ - plastic nutsAC wall adapterI received a pre-production unit, and the company informed me that the only differences between my unit and those that will be commercially sold are:silver finish on exterior will be more polishedThe nightlight will be smoother and brighterMy initial impressions of the finish is that it looks like a very high quality product, even in my pre-production unit. I can only guess that it will improve with the final version. The silver matches my silver MacBook and my friendâ€™s silver iPhone, but I do wish that Basecamp was made in multiple colors - maybe a Space Grey, Gold, and Rose Gold to match the latest iPhone colors.INSTALLATION:I recommend following the detailed instructions iNZeyo Labs provided to install the cables in the dock. To install the cables inside the dock, you have to open up the bottom and place the excess cable inside. Unfortunately, this means unscrewing 4 screws on the bottom - sort of a hassle, and it does take time. I wish the bottom was snap-in, or removable without having to unscrew it. While many individuals with iPhones have multiple cables, most people with an Apple Watch have only one charging cable, so installing and removing the cable (if youâ€™re traveling, etc), would take some time and be an annoyance. It would have also been nice to include some extra screws, in case these are lost.The Apple watch magnetic connector stays secure and snug to the adhesive backing on the dock. The groove for the cable running down the dock also fits it quite snugly, which is nice. However, when you reach the poles on the inside of the dock I found that the regular size Apple Watch charging cable - 2 meters - leaves a lot of excess and has to be wrapped many times around the posts inside the dock. I was left with pushing some excess cable around the posts even after wrapping it many times. It did work and I was able to close it, but it just took some time.When installing the iPhone lightning cable, you can use one of two white â€œanchorsâ€ to hold the cable in place on the dock. The difference in the two anchors is the height that the connector protrudes out of the dock - a little higher is better for thicker cases. Any cable that has a lightning connector bigger than the Apple OEM cable will not work with these anchors, so make sure you use one of the original Apple cables that came with your iOS device, or purchase a 3rd party one with connectors this small. Here are two 3rd party cables that are as slim as the original Apple ones: [Apple MFI Certified] iXCC ® Lightning Cable 3ft (Three Feet) Element Series 8 pin to USB SYNC Cable Charger Cord for Apple iPhone 5 / 5s / 5c / 6 / 6 Plus /6s / 6s Plus, iPod 7, iPad Mini / mini 2/ mini 3, iPad 4 / iPad Air / iPad Air 2(Compatible with iOS 9) [White] or [Apple MFi Certified] Kash TechnologyTM (Lifetime Guarantee) 3ft iPhone 5 & 6 Charging Cable [Premier Series] Lightning Cable (Rapid Charge Technology) 8 pin to USB Sync Cable & Charger [Compatible with iOS 7 & 8] for Apple iPhone 5 / 5s / 5c / 6 / 6 Plus / iPod 7 / iPad Mini / Mini 2 / Mini 3 / iPad 4 / iPad Air / iPad Air 2 (4x 1m / 3.2ft Cord) (4 Pack) [Frustration-Free Packaging]The grooves for lighting cable are like a winding path or road on the inside of the dock, and I found it was a little difficult to place it in these grooves. I also found it necessary to pull the cable as tight as possible so that the lightning connector stays snug and does not move around when docking the phone. The posts for wrapping the lightning cable were better spaced than the Apple Watch cable posts, luckily.CONNECTIVITY:Both cables plug into the inside of the dock to two USB connectors. There is a 3rd USB connector on the exterior of the dock so as to have a free USB port to connect other peripherals. I really like that this was included on the Basecamp dock. After plugging in the AC wall adapter, I found that all the USB ports on the dock worked great to charge my iPhone, Apple Watch, and other USB peripherals at decent speeds.STABILITY:The dock stays still and doesnâ€™t slide around due to the rubber feet on the bottom, but when pulling my phone out of the dock, I have to hold down the dock to keep it from lifting up. Iâ€™ve seen this problem solved with microsuction on the bottom of other docks to keep them stuck to the surface. Itâ€™s a slight annoyance on the Basecamp dock, but certainly not a deal breaker.I found the dock can actually hold my iPad as well. While it isnâ€™t as stable as when my phone is docked, it certainly holds it properly. The charging speeds through the dock for my iPad were slower than charging it through the Apple OEM wall charger, but thatâ€™s expected considering this was meant to be an iPhone dock.NIGHT LIGHT:As I mentioned at the beginning, my pre-production unit came with a nightlight that will be slightly different than the final version. Straight from the company:â€œWe modified the nighlight to make it a lot better. It is an even light now rather than the style you see in the unit you have where you can see some of the individual lights underneath.  It looks much nicer and is what the final product will have.â€In addition, the final version is supposed to be brighter. I found it to be decently bright already in my version, and the dimmer function also worked quite well. However, it took a hard press to turn it on initially, which I can see being an issue if you are trying to control it while lying down in bed. Iâ€™m hoping they also fix this in the final version.Overall, I find this to be a well-designed dock, and apart from the annoyances with installation, I do recommend it. Itâ€™s a solidly built product and works great on my nightstand.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest & unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TUP7KO30F1FX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013TOZABW#wasThisHelpful","R1TUP7KO30F1FX","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent case that protects my iPhone 6 quite well.

Plus, it adds to the feel of its slim nature.Cutouts are properly placed for the camera, vibrate switch, and sleep wake button.The look of this case is one of high quality, and it certainly feels that way, too. The genuine leather is nice; just make sure it doesn't get wet.Overall, I really like this case, and I highly recommend it if you are looking for a slim, high quality case for your iPhone.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12O2E1WWNH3WK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZN4OBE#wasThisHelpful","R12O2E1WWNH3WK","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:47 Mins Check out the video for a full rundown on how this tablet has been working for me.Pros:- Decent quality screen- Great battery life - rated at 8 hours, I got 7.5 hours with moderate usage (50% brightness, playing videos, browsing the web, typing documents)- Responsive and snappy, no lag issues- Keyboard easy to connect and works well- WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity strong and reliable- Directly connected keyboard for an instantaneous connection- Android 5.0 Lollipop is one of the latest versions of Android software, so you can run most if not all apps available in the Play Store.Cons:- Screen isn't that viewable from a top angle compared to the other angles (which are fine)- Case is a little bulky, but keeps tablet protected- Some might see the directly connected keyboard as a con - not Bluetooth, so not wirelessIt's a great tablet and I give it 5 stars based on the main strengths - fast and responsive, decent screen, and great battery life.

"I think the battery packs on the market that have the integrated lightning and micro USB cables, like this one, are the best and most convenient by far. This one takes it a step further by also integrating a USB cable into it, so you literally donâ€™t need to pack a single cable when you take this battery pack on the go.Adding to that â€œon the goâ€ theme with this battery pack is the fact that it comes pre-charged. Mine did indeed come pre-charged and was ready to use right away. I thought this was a nice touch by Hama.The battery pack has a metallic color and is overall pretty compact. While it probably wonâ€™t fit in a pocket, it can certainly be carried around in a bag or backpack.It charges my devices at relatively fast speeds, which I found comparable to what I get through charging through the wall.One small concern I had with this battery pack was the length of the integrated lightning cable. it extends only about two inches from the edge of the pack. so it would be tough to use your device (iPad or iPhone) while having the pack plugged in.Apart from this â€œconâ€ of the pack, Iâ€™ve found no other issues with it. Itâ€™s been working great for me and I highly recommend it.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWWVZ63NW8IPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XYXLE28#wasThisHelpful","RWWVZ63NW8IPJ","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very compact wall charger that is different than most on the market because of one feature - the 12 watt/2.4 Amp power ability that makes it ideal for tablets as well as smartphones.If Iâ€™m trying to charge my iPad Air while using it simultaneously, the only charger which will actually increase the battery life while I charge has been the original charging brick that came with the iPad. In the past, other 3rd party wall chargers would simply not have enough power to charge the iPad fast enough. However, this Hama wall charger actually does charge it just as fast as the original charger.The way I see it, thatâ€™s the main reason to get this charger. However, itâ€™s also extremely compact, more so than the iPad Air original wall adapter, so that makes it even better. I take this with me in bag when commuting so I can charge my iPad on the go.It also features smart charging, which Hama calls Universal Device Detect. All this means is that if you plug in a device which optimally charges with less power, like a smartphone, it can sense that and adapt accordingly. This will make sure your devices arenâ€™t overheating nor any damage being done. Indeed, I found my devices stayed relatively cool while using this wall charger.Overall, Iâ€™m very impressed with this wall charger. It is the first one Iâ€™ve used that actually does charge an iPad at the speed it was meant to be charged at. I highly recommend this product.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28EH6QLKZ7HKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QAMOGX4#wasThisHelpful","R28EH6QLKZ7HKZ","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Iâ€™ve been using this lightning cable for the past few weeks, and so far itâ€™s been working great for me.The cable has solidly built connectors that donâ€™t fray even when keeping them forcibly bent for a longer period of time. I canâ€™t speak to Hamaâ€™s claim of Military Grade standards of tensile strength and durability, but I do find it to be durable as an average user. Of course, if this changes over my use of the cable, I will update the review. So far, however, it seems to be much more durable than the original lightning cable that came with my iPhone.I like that the lightning connector is tapered, because the further end of the connector is narrower and allows it to fit better in some cases with smaller cutouts. Note though that itâ€™s not as narrow as the original Apple lightning cable, so if you own a case that has no extra room around the edges of your Apple cable, then this might not work for you.As far as MFi certification, not once did I receive an error message indicating that it was not certified, so I do believe Hamaâ€™s claim that itâ€™s a certified cable. Iâ€™ve tried it in 3 different iOS devices, and havenâ€™t received the error message.The 6ft length is nice for outlets that are further away, and personally, I use it near my bed. The charging speeds through this cable are comparable to what I get with my original Apple cable, and so are the syncing speeds through my computer.Overall, I definitely recommend this lightning cable for those who are looking for a durable cable that is certified and can offer a lot of additional length.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A2GRNTWPU1PD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QVEGWT2#wasThisHelpful","R2A2GRNTWPU1PD","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well-designed charger thatâ€™s been working great for me for the past few weeks.The charger has a small profile and lights up when powered in the car - useful to make sure it is plugged in properly. Itâ€™s durable and feels of high quality - I definitely think this will last me many years. The cable itself is coiled, and even when extended for a long period of time (like on a long car trip), it springs back to its original coiled state.The lightning connector plugs in well into my phone, and also feels durable. I never once received the â€œthis accessory is not certifiedâ€ error message when plugging in my phone, so I definitely believe the claim that it is MFi certified.As far as charging speeds, it charges a little slower than my wall adapter at home, but it still gives me a decent boost in my battery life during my 40 minute commute. For me, this isnâ€™t a concern, and Iâ€™m still happy with its performance.Overall, I like this car charger a lot because it is solidly built, has a useful LED charge indicator light, and charges my phone at a reasonable speed.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OGUL1G1VTX4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QVEH674#wasThisHelpful","R3OGUL1G1VTX4P","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are an excellent set of bluetooth headphones that provide great fit and a sound profile with punchy bass.I found these earphones to fit well in my ear using the default tips. Other size tips are included so you can find a proper fit. I found no issues with comfort when wearing these for hours at a time. I often use them at the gym or while studying in school, and they stay in properly and never once fell out. They also provide a little bit of noise isolation (note: not the same as noise cancellation).Users might find the earpieces a little large; they're bulky and stick out a little too much out of the ears in my opinion. This doesn't affect the comfort or the fit; just the appearance.Bluetooth pairing was quick and easy with these headphones, and I got about 20 feet on the range before the sound started to cut out. In-line controls also work great to control my music.These lasted about 8 hours in my tests before I had to recharge them, and it took about 2 hours to recharge from dead to a full battery. I do like the magnetic feature which keeps them secure around my neck when not in use.I highly recommend these headphones.

"This is by far the thinnest iPhone 6 Battery Case I have used. However, because of the thinness, I found the battery life to be compromised.The case first off has a decent design, and I found it to properly fit my iPhone 6. It provides some protection to the phone, but since there is no lip on the front of the case, the screen has no protection in case it is dropped on its face.The pass-through design is different than most battery cases on the market. Solememo claims you can get an additional 80% of battery life from using this battery case. However, I found it to be on average 70% in my tests when i started from a dead battery.Some users will find this an acceptable tradeoff because of the slim nature of the case.

"Iâ€™ve watched my friends use the fitbit or similar devices for a while, so I was excited to try this product.The design is sleek, and the bracelet can easily be cut to size.  The instructions are written in small print, and do not fully describe the bluetooth pairing process.  It is much easier to follow if you combine both the instruction manual and the instructions in app.  First, I turned my device on.  It was still in the shipping mode, as described in the instruction manual, so I had to press and hold the button for about five seconds.  The display said â€œHello!â€ and showed 0 steps.  Then I downloaded the TransHealth app on my phone.  You can also use another bluetooth enabled device.  I set up an account on the app and entered in my height, weight, etc.  Then I clicked on the person symbol in the top left corner, and clicked on device.  I pressed and held the button on the bracelet for about six seconds, until the pairing symbol came on (shown in instruction manual).  From my phone, I clicked add device, and it detected the bracelet.  That was the most complex part of using the bracelet!After that, I just wear it, and periodically all the data the bracelet has collected transfers automatically to my phone.  To view different measures, you simply press the button to rotate between the views (including time).  I have found the results for my steps, calorie burning, and sleep patterns to be highly accurate.  I especially love tracking my sleep, as I never really realized how much I wake up every night.Each charge lasts about 8 days for me, and I like the usb charging design that is built in to the bracelet (no need for additional cords).  I did have to be careful to not to wear it while baking or brushing my teeth, as it will sometimes falsely judge movements as steps.Overall, the device is really well designed and is a cool addition to my fitness/health regime - set up was slightly complex as the steps were not laid out in the manual,  but after this hurdle Iâ€™ve loved it!I received this product as a sample in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14A1BLACIG9QV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RMAFHLI#wasThisHelpful","R14A1BLACIG9QV","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:02 Mins This is an excellent tablet that I've really been enjoying. Check out my video review for a full rundown on how this has been working for me.Pros:- Extremely fast and snappy; The Intel processor also makes me trust this tablet a lot- Bright and clear HD screen that is viewable from all angles - not always the case with tablets like this- Wifi and Bluetooth work great and offer strong connections- Benchmark results (AnTuTu BenchMark) shows it performs very well- Full size USB port for connecting any peripherals directly, as you would with a laptop- Decent battery life - I got 7.5 hours with moderate usage, and it's advertised to be an average of 8 hours.Cons:- screen and back are glossy and attract a lot of fingerprints - although this can be cleaned pretty easily with a microfiber cloth- Camera quality isn't that great, for both the front and back camerasI mention in my review that the docking connectors at the bottom of the tablet can be used to connect to a keyboard case that American Pumpkins sells - here it is: Keyboard Case for 10.1"" Intel PumpkinX 32GB/64GB Tablet PC - AmericanPumpkinsAlso note that the actual formatted storage on this device is about 54GB (advertised as 64GB).

"Pros:- Physical aspects/ergonomics: the cartridge fits snug into the machine, so no problems with that. I know there are some generics out there that have issues in this area.- Prints have no streaks! the ink is actually black, rather than being a darker shade of grey (also something I've had trouble with for a previous generic toner)- The words and black/white images are clean and crisp. I had no issues with toner blotches in random areas of the paper.- Packaging: neat and careful. The bubble wrap tightly hugs the toner and protects it very well from impact.- There are instructions! This is important because some consumers may not know how to take out the toner from their printers without damaging any part of their printer, or simply be afraid of doing it due to fear of damage. What made these instructions good were that the written portion was concise and simple, and the visual portion was clear enough that I could get an idea of how to properly place the toner in and out of my machine. Combining the visual and written aspects made it a holistic set of instructions.Cons:- So far, I have had no issues.I received a sample in exchange for an honest and unbiased evaluation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZW8FD8VYRER4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GDYC6A#wasThisHelpful","RZW8FD8VYRER4","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:- Physically, the cartridge fits perfectly into the machine- Prints have no streaks and the color (bl) is evenly printed out- Clean and crisp prints; there are no blotches of toner occupying random small regions of the paper (an issue I've had in the past with previous generic cartridges)- Packaging is good, not sloppy (which I've also seen in the past with previous generics). What I mean by this is, there is no toner leaking around. Everything is tightly sealed and packed into the box.Cons:- There are no instructions. Fortunately, I've had this printer for the past couple of years, and I know how to put the cartridges in and out of the machine. However, for someone who is not familiar with doing this properly might be a bit confused. Also, it's important to lightly shake the cartridge from side to side in order for the powder be evenly spread on the inside, prior to inserting it into the machine and printing. Without instructions, some consumers may skip this step.What I cannot evaluate:- One of my concerns for any recycled/generic cartridge is how long it will last (i.e. how many prints before it runs out). Only time would tell, so I can't comment on this aspect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9VZT8U9FHBNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8ZZG52#wasThisHelpful","R9VZT8U9FHBNV","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Often the batteries inside the iPhone 4 and 4S are not at the level that they once were, due to its age. I know this is the case for my 3 year old iPhone 4S. This is a solidly built battery pack that has been working well for me to charge my iPhone 4S on the go, although it does not feature pass-through technology. More to follow below.The case is well made, and all the cutouts fit properly on my phone. The 30-pin connector plugs in well to the phone and stays connected until Iâ€™m ready to disconnect it. As Skiva describes it, it is MFi certified and not once have I gotten a warning or error message.The battery for me lasts about 1 and a half times worth of my iPhoneâ€™s battery, which is impressive for me. It charges at a normal rate and is comparable to what I get when charging my phone through my computerâ€™s USB port.My only gripe with this battery case is that it does not feature pass-through technology. When I connect the battery case to a wall outlet with my phone plugged in, it will not charge both the case and iPhone at the same time. Syncing does not work this way either. In order to charge both, or sync my phone, I have to remove it from the case.

"The bottom line: These In-Ear Earphones by Audiosharp offer great sound thatâ€™s not muddy nor pitchy and provide a great fit.The earphones have a great design, with the casing of the earpieces being metallic and having some heft to them. There is writing on the sides that says â€œED3 perfectionâ€, as well as â€œrightâ€ and â€œleftâ€ in cursive. The cable, which Iâ€™ll detail later, is also unique and interesting.A black and red carrying case is included, which I found to be a nice touch. There is also a cable wrap made of velcro that keeps the headphone cable together when putting it inside the case. I found the case to be of decent quality. Itâ€™s small and thin enough that I can place it in my pocket on the go.Audiosharp includes small, medium and large eartips. I found the medium tips to work best for me. For those who havenâ€™t used in-ear headphones before, try all the tips to ensure youâ€™re finding the best fit for you. A good fit and seal is crucial to get the most out of any in-ear headphones, especially when it comes to bass response.The cable is interesting, as it is see-through to allow visualization of all the copper wires inside. This definitely gives the headphones a unique look. My only gripe with the cable is it does have a tendency to tangle. Thereâ€™s also some feedback from the cable when itâ€™s rubbed against clothing, so thatâ€™s definitely something to keep in mind when considering purchasing this.I really do like the audio quality produced by these headphones. I found highs and mids to be crisp and clear without any distortion or â€œshrillâ€. Bass was decent, although not as strong as Iâ€™ve seen in some other in-ear headphones. For me, a listener who doesnâ€™t like that much bass in my headphones, it was a good amount. I recommend burning in these headphones for 24-48 hours of listening time to get even better audio from them.Iâ€™ve included some pictures of the headphones to hopefully give a good idea of how they look in person.Overall, I definitely recommend these headphones. While the cable has some feedback and tends to tangle, the headphones have a good fit, great sound, and include a useful carrying case.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R320FF07XMN13Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8YV9L0#wasThisHelpful","R320FF07XMN13Z","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This sleeve feels of high quality, and I like that it has a very soft lining to protect the screen, too. I get a lot of compliments on this sleeve, so hats off to Lavievert for a great and luxurious design.The case is very thin, so it probably wonâ€™t protect against drops, but it does at least protect against scratches. I had no qualms with tossing this in my bag when on the go. I personally like that itâ€™s thin so it takes up less space in my bag.It fits my iPad Air very snugly, but itâ€™s still easy to take it out. Itâ€™s the perfect balance between too loose and too tight. Itâ€™s a tight enough hold on it that it doesnâ€™t slip out of the case unintentionally.If you have an iPad Air, and want some protection for it but like the feel and look of using it without a full-fledged case, this sleeve will do the job.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24DOADG4MQ2MP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SYB3R0W#wasThisHelpful","R24DOADG4MQ2MP","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Toner is one of the most expensive items out there for laser printers, and if youâ€™re a student, like me, you can run through it quite quickly. Luckily there are replacement toners out there made by 3rd parties, but how well do they work? In a nutshell, this replacement toner by V4INK that fits my HP Laserjet 3800 works as well as the original.Installing it was relatively simple, and there were detailed instructions provided. Simple instructions were also located on each of the toners. It looks pretty much the same as the original, except of course for the â€œHPâ€ branding label on the front. Iâ€™ve included a picture of how the black toner looks compared to yellow, cyan, and magenta original HP toner.After installing all the cartridges, my printer had no trouble recognizing it, and I was off to printing. The colors reproduced were quite accurate to what I see on my screen, and when comparing it to my older original HP toner, it looked essentially identical.I will update this review if I encounter any issues with the toner, but so far, itâ€™s been working great for me, and I highly recommend it.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR3MX8GIPSGUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXXP12K#wasThisHelpful","RR3MX8GIPSGUM","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:30 Mins I've posted a better quality version of this video review on YouTube, because Amazon limits the size of the videos: http://youtu.be/KPX3ElpdbVwCheck out my video review for a rundown on how these headphones have been working for me. The bottom line: they provide excellent sound with great bass, and although the 3D surround effect sounds strange with music, it works well for movies and TV shows. Also, the battery life is amazing.With premium headphones such as these, you expect the packaging to look great when you first open it, and these headphones are no exception. The headphones are presented very nicely inside the box, and when you first open it, you'll see the instruction booklet in an envelope on the side, and the hard carrying case on the other side.The instructions are extremely detailed, and I highly recommend reading them, especially to understand how to turn on and off the 3D surround effect using the buttons on the headphones (this is what I refer to with the features that aren't too intuitive - more on this to follow).The hard case is well organized and everything easily accessible. Some might not like the fact that the headphones must be placed inside the case in a specific orientation due to the pre-set grooves, I personally like it because it ensures the headphones remain in one position and don't get jostled around while in the case. On the other half of the hard case you will find a mesh pouch that holds the microUSB and 3.5mm audio cables. The microUSB cable charges the headphones, and the 3.5mm audio cable allows the headphones to be used with non-Bluetooth devices and also if the headphones run out of battery.The headphones themselves look quite nice - I really like the red and black look of the model that I am reviewing. The red color pops and has a metallic glossy look to it. On the top is the UFO logo, and on the left ear cup you'll find the Bluedio logo. The right earcup features most of the controls, including a large multifunction button which lights up when the headphones are turned on, volume up/down buttons, and forward/back track buttons. The forward and back track buttons double to control the 3D surround effect, which I'll detail next.The 3D surround effect is an interesting feature. While I didn't have a good way of describing it in the video, I think the best way I can think of to describe it is that the highs and mids become crisp and clearer (think dialogue in movies and tv shows) and the bass appears to go into the background - that is to say, it gives a 3D appearance of a subwoofer present inside the headphones themselves placed behind the listener. Hopefully that gives a good idea of how it sounds, but feel free to ask me questions in the comments for clarification. The 3D surround effect is turned on by holding down the next track button, and is turned off by holding down the previous track button. Whenever this feature is toggled, the sound fades away for a brief second and you will hear a short tone to indicate this.The headphones are quite comfortable, and as a student, i found no issues with using them for 8-10 hours a day while studying in the library. Being wireless headphones, I often found myself leaving them on for long periods and forgetting they were there. They don't look that large on my head either, and fit very well. Note that these are over the ear style, so these surround the ears rather than push directly on them.Bluetooth pairing was quick and simple, and the headphones paired easily with my computer, iPad, and iPhone. I was able to use these at a 30-foot range maximum, which I found useful when I was sitting on my couch and watching TV and using these headphones for audio from the TV.Audio quality - excellent. These headphones sound like the price tag they come with, with clear highs and mids and bass that packs a punch. It is bass heavy, so keep that in mind if that's a specific thing you are or are not looking for. I found no distortion at higher volume levels. I recommend burning in these headphones for 30-40 hours for even better sound.Battery life - these headphones took 2.5 hours to charge, which is quite fast compared to other Bluetooth headphones I have used. As I mention in the video, I can go 2 days or more without charging these headphones. They lasted about 20 hours for me in terms of audio play time. For the average user, you will not be disappointed by the battery life.Overall, these are an excellent pair of headphones and I highly recommend them.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X1R4VZO630UM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZ3LSTE#wasThisHelpful","R1X1R4VZO630UM","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Please note: my review is from the perspective of installing this management panel underneath a desk (which is not the original purpose). If youâ€™re interested in doing this, please read below on how this cable management panel worked for me.Since this panel is meant for a server rack (19â€), it did not come with any mounting screws of any sort. It did come with screws to attach the d-rings to the metal panel, which were quite easy to install and attach. To attach this to my desk, I used wood screws. Installation was relatively simple and easy, partly due to the fact that the panel is very light and easy to handle.The d-rings are very durable, and donâ€™t bend that easily, which is great for when a lot of cables are stuffed inside. Itâ€™s nice also that if bending is necessary, it can be done with oneâ€™s hands and without tools. I found it very easy to put in cables and take them out if needed due to the open design.Itâ€™s a great panel that helps me conceal all my wires, as you will see from my images below. When I look at my desk from standing up, I canâ€™t see a single wire on the ground, which was exactly my goal.I really like this panel because of its solid build quality and easy installation for me underneath my desk. I hope this reviews helps customers who are considering installing the panel in such a manner.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGBV6C26991HQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IXVQSX6#wasThisHelpful","RGBV6C26991HQ","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to laptop stands, there are many options out there. All will raise monitors or laptops to comfortable heights, but some have sleeker designs and offer more functionality than others. The Laptuk Pro is an extremely well-built monitor stand that features two shelves for storing a laptop, keyboard, and other peripherals. In this review Iâ€™ll highlight my experience with it for the past few weeks. The bottom line - itâ€™s my new favorite monitor stand.DESIGN:This stand is quite solid - itâ€™s heavier than you would expect, which I personally like, because it can hold a lot of weight as a result (35 lbs according to Macessity). The aluminum gives it a sleek look that matches Appleâ€™s products decently well. Itâ€™s not a perfect color match to Appleâ€™s aluminum color, but itâ€™s close enough that you wonâ€™t really notice the difference (see the picture comparing it to my MacBook Proâ€™s color). On the front are the two shelves for storing equipment. The sides feature openings to allow for connecting cables, etc, when a laptop is docked there. The left side also features the 4 port USB 3.0 hub on the lower shelf. The back of the stand has a notch thatâ€™s about an inch inside of the extent of the rest of the stand. This notch functions to keep cables coming down from the monitor in an organized fashion. The bottom of the stand has four plastic â€œfeetâ€ which wrap around the edges of the stand and protect the desk surface from metal contact. I do think that Macessity put a lot of thought into designing the Laptuk Pro, and it functions quite well for the goals in mind.USB HUB:The 4 port USB 3.0 hub plugs in via an included USB 3.0 Type A to USB 3.0 Micro B cable. There is also a power adapter for the hub, which helps if the hub is filled with multiple devices that require a lot of power. Speeds were quite good, and matched what I get through my MacBook Pro with USB 3.0 ports. I personally like that the hub is on the side because it keeps my cables and other USB peripherals out of the way, and most importantly, out of sight.OTHER THOUGHTS:Hereâ€™s how I use the stand in my setup. I have my 22â€ Acer monitor on top, my MacBook Pro on the upper shelf, and my Satechi Bluetooth Smart Keyboard on the bottom shelf. The two sides, being open, allows me access to all my ports as well as my CD drive. On the top of the stand, I can also place things like my Logitech Bluetooth Mouse and other accessories or decorative items.I find the stand extremely sturdy and functional. I recommend this if you are looking to elevate your monitor and store your laptop, keyboard, and other peripherals underneath.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UMRBBYTUZE11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047MFXL8#wasThisHelpful","R3UMRBBYTUZE11","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Silicon Power Elite microSD Card (UHS-1 85 MB/s read speed version) has been working great for me for recording videos and taking pictures in my camera. I also use it as extra storage space in my Android tablet and itâ€™s been working well for that too. I find it to be a durable card with as-advertised speeds.In speed tests I did on my Android tablet as well as on my computer, I got an average of 92 MB/s read and 18 MB/s write. For a UHS-1 card, these are great speeds. The card itself is rated at a max of 85 MB/s read, so the 92 was really impressive. Furthermore, it was faster than the 10 MB/s UHS-1 write rating, and I was happy with this result.The card comes with a full size SD card adapter which worked in my MacBook Proâ€™s SD reader, as well as in my Canon Rebel SL1 DSLR camera to record movies and pictures. It also comes with a lifetime warranty.Itâ€™s a great microSD card and I highly recommend it.I received the 32GB version of the card as a sample in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY2UGW7NVR11H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T9QONN6#wasThisHelpful","RY2UGW7NVR11H","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Silicon Power Slim S60 Solid State Drive is a great drive to upgrade any computer. I had the pleasure of upgrading my MacBook Pro with this drive. My goal is to write this review to better inform those who are looking to upgrade their Macs to a faster system with a solid state drive.The driveâ€™s appearance is very sleek, and is one of the slimmer ones out there at 7mm. It is also lighter than other SSD drives out there at  Installing it was relatively simple on my 13â€ MBP. I simply opened up the bottom case of the computer, removed the old hard drive, transferred 4 pegs to the new SSD, and placed it back in. I then installed OS X 10.10.4 Yosemite as a clean install on this drive.In terms of the performance the average consumer will notice with this drive, Iâ€™m extremely impressed. My computer boot time, from cold start to usable, went from around 3 minutes and 30 seconds to less than 30. All my apps and programs load up almost instantaneously. My computer feels brand new. Programs that have typically slowed down my computer, like iMovie or iPhoto run smoothly with no hiccups on this drive. Also, a big plus is that my computer stays relatively cooler with this drive in place.Speed Tests:Silicon Power advertises the read/write speeds of this drive at 550 MB/s and 500 MB/s at its max, respectively. Itâ€™s important to note that real-world tests wonâ€™t typically come close to these maximum values for ANY drive. In my tests, real-world speeds were quite fast, with sequential read coming in at around 465 MB/s and write at 402 MB/s. For the average consumer simply looking to upgrade their computer, these speeds are excellent and will definitely do the job.It also supports TRIM, which is now supported in Mac OS X 10.10.4. It can be enabled through a Terminal command line, and you can find this through a simple google search. I found after enabling TRIM, the drive seemed snappier upon boot up. TRIM will also help in the long term with keeping the drive just as fast - I will update my review if I notice any changes after a few months of use.I highly recommend the S60, and from reading other reviews, Iâ€™m sure you will not be disappointed in the long term, either.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZKD72TVOOEVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GG06F8#wasThisHelpful","R1ZKD72TVOOEVU","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This 10 port USB Hub is perfect for anyone who owns a lot of USB peripherals, wants some stand alone charging ports, and likes Apple-like aesthetics. Iâ€™m someone who falls under all of these categories, and Iâ€™m happy to say the Satechi hub meets all these qualifications.In one hub, you get 7 USB ports (hopefully plenty for plugging in USB devices into your computer), and 3 stand alone USB charging ports that can be used even when the hub isnâ€™t plugged into a computer. This is because the hub is powered. The hub power also ensures that any device plugged into the hub portion has enough power to be connected to the computer.The design of this hub matches the Apple wireless Mac keyboard quite nicely. The aluminum is nicely finished, and the blue LED indicating power to the hub stands out. It has some weight to it, which I personally like because it keeps the hub in place even with cables coming out of it. The ports are nicely spaced, and I had no troubles plugging in regular sized USB cables and normal sized flash drives in all the ports. Users might find some troubles if they have a really thick or big flash drive, but I havenâ€™t had an issue with any of the ones I own.For me, I use the hub to plug in multiple external hard drives with pictures and movies on them. I also use the hub as a quick way to charge my phone and tablet when I have them on my desk. One port is 2.1A, and works well for my iPad Air, charging it from dead to a full battery in about 4 hours. The other two ports are 1A, and charge my iPhone 5S from dead to full in about 2 hours. The ports can of course be used to charge any other devices capable of USB charging, too.Itâ€™s a great hub, and I highly recommend it.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQPXWZ851BW0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KB7IS1K#wasThisHelpful","RQPXWZ851BW0R","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Satechi Aluminum USB 3.0 HDD/SSD Dock looks great alongside Apple products with its aluminum finish and is very useful with the variety of ports it includes.The dock comes with a power cable, short USB cable (2ft), and instructions. I wish the wall power plug wasnâ€™t so large, but it is nice that it has a light on it to signal if there is power coming from the outlet.The aluminum look of this complements my MacBook nicely, and itâ€™s relatively light, too. I like that itâ€™s compact and doesnâ€™t take up a large footprint on my desk. The cover folds down to allow a 3.5â€ drive to be docked, itâ€™s spring loaded so you donâ€™t have to worry about replacing a cover to keep from dust getting in if a 2.5â€ drive is connected.I tested this dock with USB external drives, flash drives, SDHC cards, and both 2.5â€ and 3.5â€ hard drives and 2.5â€ solid state drives. In all cases, speeds seemed to be quite fast. The USB 3.0 and SD speeds were on par with what I get straight from my MacBook Pro. All the hard drives that I docked also had fast speeds, although they were slower than what I get if I were to connect the drives internally in my computer. This is just a limitation of the speed of USB 3.0, vs SATA III connections.Thereâ€™s a convenient on/off button at the back which is pushed in/out, so I can press it without having to turn the dock around to turn it off. A bright blue LED on the front signals when the dock is on and has power.Overall, I really like this dock, and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for such a product.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R293GYA703G5CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S717JH6#wasThisHelpful","R293GYA703G5CI","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great Air mouse combo keyboard thatâ€™s been working great for me.WHATâ€™S IN THE BOX:Air Mouse C120microUSB cable for rechargingnano size 2.4 Ghz adapterI think itâ€™s a little misleading that in the product description, it says that it runs on â€œWiFiâ€. This mouse/keyboard does not connect to WiFi networks; rather, it is wireless in that it uses a nano size 2.4Ghz USB adapter to receive a signal on the computerâ€™s end. This is how most wireless mice and keyboards function nowadays.The misleading description aside, what I really like about this mouse is that itâ€™s plug and play, truly. I plugged this into my Windows 8.1 computer, and without having to download any drivers, I was up and running in a few minutes.The air mouse is quite accurate, and the top button on the mouse side controls when the gyroscope is on or off. By turning the gyroscope off, you can â€œresetâ€ what the mouse considers a center point, and from there, you can move up, down, left and right to move the mouse. Of course, the gyroscope on/off button is also useful when you switch over to the keyboard side.Speaking of the keyboard, it is small (considering the size of the device itself), but I found the keys responsive and easy to press. I do wish there was a windows button, but apart from that, all the buttons are present and work great.The Air Mouse is the size of a small remote, and looks quite sleek. Itâ€™s easy to hold, too. Charging it using the included microUSB cable was very easy, and took about 2 hours to charge to full when I initially received it. I havenâ€™t had to recharge it yet, so suffice to say the battery lasts a long time.Overall, I find this Air Mouse and keyboard a pleasure to use, and I highly recommend it.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EE6K75BZSLNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVVGX90#wasThisHelpful","R1EE6K75BZSLNN","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Trace Pro has been working great for me for the past month. Iâ€™ve been using it whenever Iâ€™m getting ready to leave from a bar to make sure Iâ€™m safely underneath the limit. Iâ€™m male, and the Trace Pro is small enough that it fits well inside my pocket. Itâ€™s smaller than my iPhone.I like that the LED is bright enough to be read both during the day and at night. The mouthpiece was easy to install with the instructions, and I had no issues using it.This has been generally accurate as far as I can tell. To compare its accuracy, I used a BAC calculator website that has you input your gender, weight, number of drinks, and time elapsed, and outputs an estimated BAC level. The results of the Trace Pro were almost always equivalent to the website, and when it was off, it was off by at most 0.004. I can say with certainty that it is very reliable. When I say reliability, I mean how often I can count on it to give a reading, which has been upwards of 9 out of 10 times. Occasionally, I will get an error and will have to retry, but this is rare.I do wish this had a rechargeable battery rather than taking AAA, but it was nice for the company to include batteries. Iâ€™ve yet to replace the batteries, and Iâ€™m still at 3 full bars.Apart from the rechargeable battery, Iâ€™ve found this to be very useful, reliable, and accurate, and I definitely recommend it.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B4QRQBH20KUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R2X59A4#wasThisHelpful","R1B4QRQBH20KUM","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These in-ear headphones offer well-balanced sound and come with lots of useful accessories.WHATâ€™S IN THE BOX:S0 In-Ear headphonesHard carrying caseShirt Clip1 set comply foam tips S-4006 sets regular silicone eartips (2 of each of small, medium, large)1 set silicone bi-flange eartips1 set silicone tri-flange eartipsInstruction ManualWarranty Card (a 12 month warranty is included with this product)IN-EAR FIT:The included Comply premium earphone tips provide the best fit in my experience, so I recommend using those. However, if you donâ€™t find these work best for you, there are 6 different pairs of silicone tips (in Small, Medium, and Large, 2x pairs of each), 1 pair of bi-flange eartips, and 1 pair of tri-flange eartips. I think itâ€™s safe to say that you will be able to find the right fit for you with these headphones, which is crucial when using in-ear headphones.After finding the right fit for me, I found no issues with comfort with these headphones. As a student, I often spend 5-6 hours at a time studying with music, and the Brainwavz S0 did not feel uncomfortable at all.SOUND QUALITY:Brainwavz describes the sound on their packaging as a â€œbalanced sound signature with each part of the sound spectrum represented accurate and clear.â€ I would say this is very much true of these headphones. The bass is not overpowering like I have seen with some other headphones, and highs and mids are crisp and clear. At higher volume levels, there is no distortion. I like using these to listen to rock and pop genres, as well as for movies and TV shows.OTHER NOTES:The headphones have a 51â€ flat-design cable, which is plenty of length for me. The flat design ensures no tangles or curling of the cord. The included carrying hard case is small and compact. Itâ€™s a little thick, but it fits all the tips and the headphones very neatly. Another cool thing Brainwavz included is a velcro cable wrap for the headphones. The cable wrap sticks to the inside of the case, so it stays in place even with the case open. I thought this was a nice touch.Overall, I really like the Brainwavz S0. While some, especially EDM listeners, might find a lack of bass response, I thought it was plenty, and added nicely to the balanced nature of the sound produced by the S0. I highly recommend these in-ear headphones.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X4NVEKKH4N6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PACTGXA#wasThisHelpful","R2X4NVEKKH4N6B","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This humidifier is great on the go (I like using it in hotel rooms), in a smaller bedroom, or in an office or cubicle.The humidifier comes with a USB cable and 2 filters. Installing the filters was pretty easy, and it fit quite snugly over a regular 20 oz water bottle that I had lying around. Most disposable water bottles will work well with this, and in my tests, knocking over the bottle did not result in any water leaking out.It is super quiet; I honestly couldnâ€™t hear it at all unless I listened for it and sat less than a foot away from it. The mist that comes out is light and unobtrusive.It worked well for me in a 10x12 foot room, as well as at some hotel rooms Iâ€™ve stayed at recently. I could notice a difference in humidity levels in these rooms after having the humidifier on for some time, but in a larger room, it didnâ€™t seem to make much of a difference.

"This is a decent battery pack and charger thatâ€™s been working well for me.The battery pack has a rubber texture and features 2 USB ports that are â€œsmartâ€ ports, meaning they adapt to the device that is plugged in. A smartphone requires a different amount of power than a tablet for charging, and Sharkkâ€™s battery pack will adapt to this. What I really like is that the wall prong is built right into the battery pack. This makes recharging the pack, as well as using it as a wall charger extremely convenient.Essentially, all you need to bring along with this battery pack is a charging cable for your device. Re-charging the battery pack itself is built right in, so this pack has maximum portability. There is a single LED that changes colors based on the charge capacity of the pack (red=0-35%, green=35-75%, blue=75-100%). The LED is very unobtrusive and dim, which is good because it wonâ€™t be distracting, but bad because itâ€™s difficult to see, especially during the daytime.Shaking it requires a decent amount of force in practice, which I personally wasnâ€™t a fan of. It is advertised as â€œmotion activatedâ€ which was slightly misleading for me, because I thought this meant you would simply have to wave your hand past it to turn it on. On the contrary, you must move the battery pack itself in order to activate it.Recharging the pack from empty to full took about 2 hours, and with it, I was able to charge my iPad to about 60%, and my iPhone 2 full times. This is what I expect from a 5000 mAh battery pack.Overall, this has been working great for me. I really like that the wall prongs are built right in, and that it has 2 USB ports. Shaking to activate it is nifty, but gets a little annoying in practice. Apart from that, I highly recommend it.A sample was provided in exchanged for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1US4ER8JF87EK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OO3ZD4C#wasThisHelpful","R1US4ER8JF87EK","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well-built coffee grinder thatâ€™s small, easy to use, and most importantly for me, easy to clean.This coffee grinder has got a slim shape, and is small and compact. Thereâ€™s a black top container that holds the whole beans to be grinded, and a bottom glass jar thatâ€™s clear and easy to visualize how much has been grinded already. The handle crank is silver, along with the locking screw.To add coffee beans, you have to unscrew the locking screw and remove the top lid. Itâ€™s slightly annoying to have to unscrew this each time, but Iâ€™ve gotten used to it. The handle crank is very easy to turn, and I also liked that the locking screw made it easy to adjust the coarseness of the coffee grounds.Cleanup is pretty easy with this. All the parts easily separate which makes it more efficient to wash and clean. The ceramic burrs are easy to clean, which Iâ€™ve found to be an issue with some other manual coffee grinders.Interestingly, Iâ€™ve also been using the coffee grinder to grind spices, and it works very well for that, too.Iâ€™ve been using this grinder as a multi-purpose tool, and itâ€™s been working great for me. I definitely recommend it.

"For me, easy to use and install network drives have been hit or miss. Theyâ€™re insanely useful, especially for someone like me who has lots of downloaded movies and tv shows stored on flash drives and hard drives. This Cable Matters wireless hard drive dock manages to do it quite well through the mobile apps and through the computer interface.Setup was relatively straightforward, and I found the directions easy to follow. One thing to note is that the network that pops up is differently named from what it says in the instruction manual (Wi-Fi Dock vs codetek-028e) - luckily I donâ€™t have too many WiFi networks around so it was easy to guess which one to choose from, but this might not be the case for someone who lives elsewhere.Streaming videos and music through my computer worked quite well in my tests. There was a slight loading time, but apart from that, playback was smooth and without stutter. Note: I used a Mac to test this.The mobile app MyAirDisk was easy enough to download and get started using, and I found it to be just as pleasant to use as the computer interface. Accessing files was easy on my iPad, and videos and music streamed very well.I can confirm the dock works for both 2.5 and 3.5 inch drives, as I had spares of both lying around. It also fit a 2.5 inch SSD I had, and that was nice.The direct network connection worked even faster than the wireless connection, as was expected, and the dock worked great as a wired dock through a USB connection. I find this handy to use when reformatting hard disks, which I do a few times a year.Overall, I highly recommend this wireless drive. Itâ€™s been working great for me for my purposes, and Iâ€™m sure it will for you, too.

"This is a nifty product that has been working great for me, and was very easy to set up. A sample was provided in exchange for an honest review.Note, you should check that your house and internet connection match these requirements for the doorbell to work (courtesy of the Carolyn over at the friendly Skybell customer service):-- Do you have at least 1.5 mb per second upload speed at the doorbell site? If you're not sure, you can download the OOKLA Speedtest App (available on Android and iOS).If you donâ€™t have sufficient signal strength, youâ€™ll need to move your router closer to SkyBell or use a Wi-Fi range extender-- Do you have sufficient power at the doorbell site? SkyBell requires 10-36 VAC 10 VA. You can test this by using a volt meter and testing the leads at your front door. (Please note thatSkyBell will not work with a wireless doorbell chime.)-- Is your router compatible with the 2.4ghz wireless standard? SkyBell requires a 2.4 Ghz wireless router connection with its own SSID. SkyBell will not work on a 5 Ghz wireless standard at this time. If you have a dual-band router, you must segregate your wireless channels and connect SkyBell to the 2.4ghz channel.-- SkyBell also requires that N-only routers be set to b/g or b/g/n settings and not â€œN-Onlyâ€-- SkyBell is not compatible with Samsung phones sold by T-Mobile.As long as these requirements are met, you should find it works great.Setup was quite simple, and as outlined in the instruction manual, all I had to do was remove my doorbell and plug in the same wires to the Skybell unit. The included hardware, as other users mentioned, were difficult to use, and I ended up not using it, but your experience may vary.After installing it, syncing it to my existing network was also easy. Iâ€™m lucky that my router is just on the other wall of the doorbell, so the video feed came up very quickly on my device. Of course, loading times were a little quicker over WiFi versus 4G or LTE.While the video feed quality is mediocre, I found it was adequate enough to get a good picture of who or what is outside my front door.The notifications to my phone are quite quick; within 1 second of the doorbell being pressed, I got a notification on my phone. After 2 more seconds, the feed was loaded and I was able to see who was on the other side.I found Skybell particularly useful this past weekend when my family and I were on vacation, and I wanted to check if packages had been delivered to our front door. I simply pulled up the feed every few days, and I was able to see the entire front porch to check on this. As other reviewers have mentioned, the camera angle is decently wide, which is quite nice. I have a porch that is about 7 feet wide, and Iâ€™m able to see my entire porch in the view (my doorbell is approximately centered on the porch).Apart from the video feed quality, Iâ€™ve been having a great experience with this doorbell. I definitely recommend it for anyone looking to try one of the next greatest things that most importantly works great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R264PI5X4P79A6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBS7YIW#wasThisHelpful","R264PI5X4P79A6","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great desk mount clip for holding smartphones. I use it essentially as a ""dock"", and I mount it to my desk that is 1.5"" thick. The mount clip has foam on either side, and doesn't damage my desk as a result. You should be careful, however, that you make sure the foam pieces are contacting any surface that you attach it to, rather than another portion of the clip.The gooseneck takes some force to adjust, which I personally like because it means it stays in place when it needs to. When I use my phone with this, the mount doesn't move around and stays firm. It is very flexible if you need to adjust it, and I was able to use it in many different orientations and positions over my desk.The phone holder portion is another clip which has rubber on either side. It doesn't damage the phone as a result, and it also holds it in place quite well. My iPhone 5S fit well inside here, as well as a 5"" phone that I tried. It seems to hold a lot of different sizes, and should work well for most people's phones. Note that tablets do not fit inside this mount.I do wish the mount clip expanded a little more to be able to acommodate thicker pieces. My bed, which is 5"" thick, was not able to work with this phone holder.Overall, this functions well, and I recommend it.

" 4:47 Mins This is a great 4G enabled unlocked Android smartphone by iRulu. Check out my video review for a full rundown of how this phone works. A sample was provided in exchange for an honest review.DESIGN:This 5"" phone has a gorgeous 1280x720 display, which is astounding for a budget smartphone. It has a gold casing with the lock button and volume rocker buttons located on the right side. It's slim and has a great feel to it, even with it's larger 5"" size. The display runs edge to edge with a slim gold bezel surrounding it. I really like the look of this phone.HARDWARE:Removing the gold cover reveals the insides of the phone, with the removable battery taking up most of the space. This phone will take a micro SIM card along with a microSD card for expanding the space (up to 32 additional GB, according to iRulu).SOFTWARE/USAGE:On board, this Android 4.4.2 smartphone comes with 16GB of space, with 12GB of usable space. It's very snappy due to the Qualcomm quad-core processor inside, and I had no issues with lag or crashes while using this phone.4G speeds on AT&T are great, and call quality was good, too. I get good AT&T service in Chicago, and users' experience might vary depending on their area's cell signal. What I can say for certain, though, is that the iRulu U2S will not be the limiting factor in cell service strength.Callers mentioned that I sounded clear and easy to understand in both speakerphone and regular mode. The speakerphone projects quite loudly, and I found it pleasant to use.As I mentioned before, the display on this device is quite nice. The screen is clear, and texts and colors pop. While it won't compare to a retina display, or a display on a Samsung Galaxy phone, it certainly is tough to beat at this price point for an unlocked smartphone.The camera's decent on this device; The back-facing camera takes pictures at 13MP, and it works really well as a regular smartphone camera. The front facing camera is rated at 5MP, and worked well in my tests for video conferencing, etc.The battery takes about 3 hours to charge fully from dead, and it lasted me on average 11-13 hours a day. In other words, full day battery life! This was with moderate usage and at 50% brightness. When I used it for heavier processing tasks such as playing games or watching videos, I got around 9 hours.I hope you enjoy the review, and I apologize for my terrible skills at Temple Run 2! Hopefully the video gives you a good idea of how this phone works. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an unlocked Android smartphone; it's been working great for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TFDI731D8UTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDKQEEE#wasThisHelpful","R3TFDI731D8UTV","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the 6ft MFI certified cable in black. A sample was provided in exchange for an honest review.In testing lightning cables, I always test 4 things:--MFI certification (does it actually work and not give that annoying error message?)--Durability--Charging Speed--Sync capabilityBut before I get into these categories, Iâ€™d like to highlight a unique feature of this cable; that being the velcro strap. With a 6ft long cable, management is crucial. Luckily, Macally has built this management right into their cable, with a velcro strap that hangs off of the USB connector end. It holds strongly, and makes tidying up this cable a breeze.MFI CERTIFICATIONThis cable is indeed MFI certified. In testing this with both an iPhone 5S and iPad Air, I found no issues or error messages displayed when plugging it in. I tested by plugging it in 20-30 times per device to ensure this wasnâ€™t just a one time thing.DURABILITYI have found this cable is very durable. In my tests, I slightly bent the cable with my hands to test the connector ends durability, especially at the points where the cable cord begins, and I found it held up well. Next, I kept the cable heads bent with some force for about 24 hours with a book to simulate the cable being bent for long periods of time in a bag or purse, and it survived! It didnâ€™t even show any marks to show it was bent, and in a few hours, it was back to its original shape.CHARGING SPEEDI compared this to the OEM lightning cable made by Apple, and I found no differences in charging speed with this one versus Appleâ€™s official one. It charges just as fast in both a computer USB port as well as using the Apple wall charger adapter.SYNC CAPABILITYI synced both my iPad and iPhone on my computer using this cable, and overall, it worked quite well. My computer recognized the devices right away, and transferred content over relatively quickly when compared with the Apple official cable.Overall, this is a great cable that I highly recommend, especially if you are looking for a longer cable that has built-in cable management to keep it neat when not in use. This is a great buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J1WCBK9FFGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7MQQFI#wasThisHelpful","R2J1WCBK9FFGA","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ivation Boomering Bluetooth Speaker is a high fidelity bluetooth speaker with some neat features. A sample was provided in exchange for an honest review.WHATâ€™S IN THE BOX:Boomering speakerAux cablemicroUSB charging cableinstruction bookletThe speaker has a great, rugged design that is â€œsplash proofâ€. I indeed did get some water on the device (to test this), and it continued to work fine. I wouldnâ€™t recommend using this in the shower, as it is not waterproof, but itâ€™s nice that it has some water resistance. The top panel has NFC pairing (which I was not able to test), a play/pause/call button, volume up down, a power button, and a â€œmodeâ€ button, to switch between bluetooth, aux, and microSD mode. On the right side is a hanging loop for going around a backpack, loop, etc. Opening up the right side reveals a silicone panel that houses a USB port (for using the speaker as a battery pack), an aux port, a microUSB port (for charging), and a microSD card slot.Bluetooth pairing was quick and easy, and I got about 20 feet of range in my tests before it began to cut out. The sound quality over bluetooth was great. I found bass to be present and slightly heavy, with mids and highs crisp and clear. Some users might like the extra bass with this speaker, while others might not; it depends on personal preference.The microSD card slot works great for playing MP3 files loaded onto a card. I find this useful if I want a set playlist to play through the speaker while using my phone for other tasks. The Aux connection also worked well to play music with no issues.Charging this device took about 2 hours from a dead battery. Whatâ€™s neat is that this speaker can be used to charge other devices; it can act as a battery pack. It was able to charge my iPhone 5S about 1.5 times before the battery on it died.Overall, this is a well designed speaker with decent sound, and combined with the microSD and power bank features, I definitely recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LFB6DR4NN7YZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNMZIL6#wasThisHelpful","R3LFB6DR4NN7YZ","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ivation IVA400 is a great waterproof shower speaker with awesome sound. A sample was provided in exchange for an honest review.This speaker has a cool design. Thereâ€™s a hook at the top for hanging on the shower head, which makes it very easy to put in the shower. The front two speaker grills give a glimpse at the actual speakers inside, which I found to be a nice touch. There are controls for power, volume up/down, play/pause, previous track, next track, and start/end call.Bluetooth pairing was quick and easy using this speaker. Bluetooth range was about 30 feet in my tests, and quality was clear in both music and phone calls. Callers also mentioned that they could hear me clearly through the speaker, mentioning that the phone call sounded like a normal speakerphone through my iPhone.Sound quality through this speaker was astounding for a waterproof speaker. I was impressed by the bass, treble, and mids, too. The speaker did not distort at higher volume levels, and gets quite loud. I found it was enough to use in the shower with the water running, as well as in a room with about 5 or 10 friends. I am truly impressed by the sound through this speaker, and it makes it a pleasure to use.I also did a waterproof test by putting it in a sink of water while music was playing. While the sound became muffled (through water), the speaker continued to play music. I use it all the time in the shower without fear of water (or soap) getting on or into the speaker. If the front speaker grill becomes filled with water droplets, it can muffle the sound coming through. To fix this, I simply use a towel or washcloth to dab the water out of the grill, and then it is good to go. (Note: the muffled sound is simply due to the water obstructing the sound - it does not affect the speaker itself).Battery life at about 50% volume level was about 8 hours in my test. Charging this speaker can be done through the microUSB port on the back using the included cable. Charging the speaker from a depleted battery to full took about 3 hours. The back port has a silicone covering to prevent water from getting near the ports. Also present is a USB port for charging devices through the back of the speaker - i.e. the speaker can act as a battery pack.Iâ€™ve been using this speaker for the past few weeks, mostly in the shower, and I love it. The sound quality is great, Bluetooth has awesome range, and the speaker is indeed waterproof. I highly recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a waterproof speaker that does not disappoint.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QCTY6H3CPT16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UGBY03G#wasThisHelpful","R2QCTY6H3CPT16","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the Bluetooth Button Series, Satechi has created a set of products that are convenient to use, and in turn, make smartphones more convenient to use.WHATâ€™S IN THE BOX:Bluetooth Button (either media button, home button, or shutter button)CR2016 batterybutton mount (for steering wheel, bike, or selfie stick)audio port keychain attachment3M sticker (for a more permanent placement of the buttons)DESIGN:These buttons have a sleek look, and being black, match the interior of many cars. If you choose to hang them from a keychain, they are small and easy to carry around. The back is a brushed metal, while the front has a flat look and feel to it. The buttons offer great tactile feedback when depressing them. The included steering wheel (or bike) mounts are easy to install, and look almost like rings that have a space for the bluetooth button on top. My car is a Honda Fit (09), and the buttons fit well on my steering wheel. On the side is a hole for looping the keychain attachment, and there is also a depressed reset button for enabling bluetooth pairing.The media button has 5 buttons in one - play/pause in the center, volume up (up), volume down (down), previous track (left), and next track (right). The shutter button and home button each have a single button on their panel.USAGE:The included CR2016 battery is said to have a battery life of 2 years, and while I cannot attest to that, i can say that so far, the battery works great. To save battery life, the buttons do go to sleep after a period of inactivity (10-15 minutes in my tests).Bluetooth pairing is done by resetting the button. There is a small reset button which is depressed, so it requires the use of some pointed object (such as a pen tip). After pressing it in, the buttonâ€™s LED light flashed, indicating it was in pairing mode. Pairing was as simple as finding the listing under my phoneâ€™s bluetooth settings and connecting. After this initial pairing, all I had to do to repair was wake up the button by pressing it once, and it instantly connected to my phone.MEDIA BUTTON:The media button is by far my favorite, and probably will be for many users. It comes in handy for converting my car to have steering wheel-mounted controls, which is something I have always desired. I find that the buttons are easy to depress, but in the winter time, with gloves on, it is difficult to do anything but press the center in, which plays and pauses the music. Hitting up, down, left, or right are difficult with gloves, due to the small size of the button, but are easy to press using just fingers. The bluetooth connection is instantaneous, so changing the track or playing the music happens almost simultaneously to the button press.HOME BUTTON:The home button is useful for activating Siri on an iPhone. It functions exactly as the home button on an iPhone does, so holding it down for a few seconds activates Siri. Overall, it works great for this purpose.SHUTTER BUTTON:The shutter button is useful for taking selfies or other pictures using a smartphone camera. I found I was also able to place it on a selfie stick using the included mount adapter, which made my selfie stick wireless. Another use is for recording videos of oneâ€™s self using the shutter button as a remote. It also works just as well as the other buttons in taking the snapshot instantaneously.Also included was a 3M sticker for making a more permanent placement of each of the buttons. It was easy to apply and stuck quite well to my carâ€™s dash. Note that it is difficult to remove, and should be used as a more permanent option.Overall, I have to say Iâ€™m very impressed with the Bluetooth Button Series by Satechi. They are a series of buttons that work very well when connected to my smartphone, and I definitely recommend them to anyone who might have a use for such a bluetooth device.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GJR0DFUUIXHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RM75NL0#wasThisHelpful","R3GJR0DFUUIXHC","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the Air-Fi Touch, MEElectronics set out to create a wireless headset that was elegant, offered high fidelity sound, and had innovative controls. In this review, Iâ€™ll highlight my experience with this pair of headphones. Overall, I have to say Iâ€™m very impressed.WHATâ€™S IN THE BOX:Air-Fi Stereo Bluetooth Wireless HeadphonesMicro-USB charging cableHard shell protective carrying casestereo audio cable (for wired use of the headphones)User ManualDESIGN:These are a very elegant-looking pair of headphones, and itâ€™s definitely something to highlight. The glossy black finish is accented by a gold color, which gives these headphones a look of sophistication. On the top is the MEElectronics logo, and on the inside of left earcup is the Air-Fi portion of the logo. The left earcup has the main touch panel, a multifunction button, and a stereo input jack for wired use of the headphones. The multifunction button can turn the headphones on/off, play/pause, and answer/end phone calls. Also on the left earcup is the microphone for making calls. The right earcup has the microUSB charging connector, as well as an indicator light.USE:After charging the headphones fully, I used them for the first time. The Multifunction button turns them on. For initial pairing, or for pairing a different device, I kept holding down the multifunction button past the initial â€œonâ€ tone, until I reached a second tone, which indicated it was ready for pairing. After finding the listing on my phone, I was connected in seconds. Bluetooth range was about 30 feet in my tests, which is on par with other headphones in a similar price range.I was initially skeptical of the touch panel, but in practice, it worked quite well. A summary of the functions:Swipe up - Volume UpSwipe down - Volume DownSwipe right/forward - Next TrackSwipe left/backward - Previous TrackIt took some getting used to, but after adapting, I found it very convenient to use. It worked quite well with the bluetooth functionality. A small note: it doesnâ€™t work if the headphones are used in wired mode.Wireless headphones are meant to be worn for long period of times, so comfort is a key feature. The Air-Fi Touch do pretty well; I was able to wear the headphones for about 4 hours before they started to hurt my ears. If you study all day, or wear headphones at work, you might find you need to take these off after a period of 3-5 hours. Apart from that, though, they feel very comfortable. The on-ear design is not too tight and the earcups are made of a very soft material. They are also adjustable on both sides, as is the case with all on-ear headphones.Charging the headphones is done through the included micro USB cable (a universal cable type), and is indicated by a red light which shuts off once fully charged. Charging took about 3 hours in my daily tests with plugging the included microUSB cable into my computer. A huge plus of these headphones is the advertised full day, or 24 hour, battery life. I was blown away in my tests, with a whopping 28 hours, and I can definitely say that MEElectronics made good on their claim. This is more than lots of other bluetooth headphones Iâ€™ve tested, and I was very impressed. If the headphones do happen to die, the included stereo cable can be plugged in to use the headphones in wired mode. Wired mode does have its limitations - you canâ€™t use the microphone or the touch panel.I found phone calls to be more of a novelty feature than anything else with these headphones. Calls sounded clear on my end through the headphones, but callers mentioned that I sounded distant and on speakerphone when using the built-in speaker of these headphones.SOUND:Sound quality on these is very balanced. The bass is a medium level, but is definitely present. Highs and mids are crisp. If anyone is looking for bass-heavy headphones, these probably arenâ€™t the ones. I am a big fan of a balanced sound profile, so I like how these sound, but as with many things, sound quality is often a personal preference. One thing I really like about these headphones is that thereâ€™s very very minimal sound leakage (only present at higher volume levels), and they do a decent job at blocking out noise. While they are not noise-cancelling, the nature of the earcups is such that it blocks out some ambient noise.The sound I perceived from wireless mode vs wired mode was about equal. In other words, you wonâ€™t find a decrease in sound quality if the battery dies and youâ€™re forced to use them in wired mode.ACCESSORIES:These headphones come with a hard shell carrying case, which fits the microUSB and stereo cables, too. The headphones fold up compact and are easy to transport.SUMMARY:Overall, these headphones are well-designed, sound great, and offer amazing battery life. While the sound profile and comfort may not work for all users, I think for most, it will exceed expectations. I give these a very strong recommendation.A sample was provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24WP44OOFC1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S9ZZK7G#wasThisHelpful","R24WP44OOFC1S","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the TT-DL01 model in Piano Black. This is a stylish looking lamp with a sleek glossy black finish. A sample was provided in exchange for an honest review.WHATâ€™S IN THE BOX:- Lamp head plus flexible support beam - the arm of the lamp- Metal base - heavier to keep the lamp weighed down- AC power adapter- user manualThis is one of the slimmest boxes Iâ€™ve seen for LED desk lamps. This is useful if someone needs to transport it later on. Everything is packaged very neatly and in an organized way.The lamp has a nice stylistic design, and looks very sleek when set up. As other reviewers have mentioned, the base is relatively small, and wonâ€™t take up much desk space. In my case, I use it on my nightstand, where space is crucial.Another great addition to the lamp is a USB input port near the base. This is useful if using the lamp at a desk to quickly charge a phone or tablet, or even at the bedside to charge your phone at night. I personally use it for the latter; it works well for me to charge my phone at night.The lamp has four brightness settings, and is touch-controlled. The touch control worked very well, and I found that there was enough of a difference between the three brightness settings for me to use all of them for different tasks. I used the brightest when doing work (Reading Mode), the second brightest for reading (Study Mode), the third brightest for reading at night (Relax Mode), and the least brightest for right before bed (Sleep Mode). Within each of these brightness main settings, you can adjust the individual brightness of each one using the minus and plus buttons. A 1 hour sleep timer is also present on this lamp, which I use in Sleep Mode to shut off automatically while I am trying to fall asleep.In summary, this is a well-designed lamp with features such as a USB input port for quick access to charge a phone, tablet, or other device. I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C2K55J9J51HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APAQSP6#wasThisHelpful","R1C2K55J9J51HA","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Omars 4ft white Lightning Cable is MFI certified and charges well, albeit with larger connectors. A sample was provided in exchange for an honest review.This is a great cable made by the company Omars. Iâ€™d like to highlight the durability, charging capability, syncing capability, and MFI certification in this review.The cable is quite durable. The cable showed no fraying or permanent marks from bending it after a week of use. During my testing, I put the cable through more â€œextremeâ€ measures by bending it with considerable force, and Iâ€™m happy to say this cable held up well. I had no qualms with tossing this in the bottom of my bag; Iâ€™m confident that with time, itâ€™ll continue to hold up to normal wear and tear.This cable charges both my iPad and iPhone quite well, with charging speeds equivalent to what I get with the original Apple cable. Of course, charging speed will vary depending on what you are charging through (wall adapter versus computer USB port, for example). Syncing capability also worked well - I was able to sync music and movies using this cable to both my iPad and iPhone.This cable is MFI certified, and after testing it with 5 iOS devices, I am comfortable with saying that Iâ€™ve verified this. Not once did I get the error messages you typically see with cables that are â€œpretendingâ€ to be MFI certified.My only wish with this cable is that the connector ends were slightly narrower. Theyâ€™re definitely thicker than the original Apple cable, which might make it tough to plug into devices with thicker cases.I do like that this cable is 4ft long, which makes it 1ft longer than the OEM Apple cable. This extra length helps me in a lot of situations, especially when I use it to charge my phone on my desk.Overall, this is a solid cable that charges well and is MFI certified. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an extra lightning cable!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDUVL881X4AYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T73Z6DW#wasThisHelpful","RDUVL881X4AYW","A18EJ44LWWUO11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18EJ44LWWUO11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As YA fare goes, this book's plot lifts it to 5 stars. It was written in 1962, apparently, and the new translation from the Dutch is coming on 25 August of 2015.It's the story of a squire (Tiuri) on the eve of becoming a knight who does NOT become a knight because he makes the fateful decision to answer a call for help. One thing leads to another when you answer calls for help in knightly times, and before long, this 16-year-old kid is on a quest with unseen (and eventually seen) enemies all around him (but with unexpected friends as well).It's sweet, actually. So ""old school"" it will remind you of the type of book about knighthood you could not put down as a kid. You know. Books by Howard Pyle, maybe, illustrated by N. C. Wyeth. It all brings back a simpler world of good and evil, don't you know. An antidote to the gray confusions in our time, it is, and the descriptions aren't bad, either. But the plot's the thing. Honest.Memory Lane, anyone? I suspect young reluctant readers and fans of all things medieval will love this","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SA17WWV441HU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545819784#wasThisHelpful","R2SA17WWV441HU","ADQR7Y6GIKSDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQR7Y6GIKSDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this book, you will learn, in the first 50 pages or so, how your mind works. Specifically, the authors take some familiar learning styles -- visual, auditory, and kinesthetic -- and look for the various patterns they can be placed in to match your style. Thus you could be a VAK Pattern (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic or an AVK Pattern (Auditory, Visual, and Kinesthetic), etc.Once you self-test, there's a description and, if that's you, then you know how you work as a piece in the puzzle of collaboration (at work, at school, or wherever). Yes, the descriptions are a bit like reading your Zodiac or maybe your Briggs and Myers results (remember them?). Now you're ready for the book's sections: Thinking About Thinking (sounds like metacognition to me), developing your thinking talents so that they work together with others', practicing inquiry, working with your own mindset (and others'), and so forth.Of course this book works best if all members of any given group play its game and ""discover"" themselves and how they can get the most of their own style and the styles of those around them. That might be tricky, unless it's one of those ""group"" days businesses run now and again. Lots of quotes from various gurus and like-minded books in this field, so if this is your kind of stuff, you should eat it up. If not, forget the collaboration and know thyself by passing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MVE3OQPIQNVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812994906#wasThisHelpful","R2MVE3OQPIQNVF","ADQR7Y6GIKSDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQR7Y6GIKSDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We live in a new age of weird diseases and symptoms -- many traveling under the ""auto-immune"" banner. People by the droves go to their primary care doctors and complain of stomach and digestive ailments (bloating, food allergies, abdominal pain), light-headedness, fatigue, skin rashes, eczema, rosacea, and worse. Their doctors, in turn, follow the protocols of their training and order up standard tests in search of something physical. The tests come back negative. Now doc is beginning to wonder if he has a hypochondriac on his hands, and the patients either persist or resign themselves to pain and misery, becoming depressed as symptoms continue to plague them. Sometimes more tests are ordered, but seldom is a solution found. It's a bad scene all around. Welcome to the world of microbes, the artful dodgers (at least when it comes to standard medical tests).If you fit the description above, you should be reading Dr. Chutkan's latest book. She talks about ""dysbiosis,"" a widely prevalent but seldom diagnosed condition where the microbial community in your body is way out of whack -- low on good bacteria and high on pathogens (bad bacteria) due to a host of modern-day causes: the accumulated ravages of antibiotic treatments, alcohol consumption, stress, diet (specifically lack of enough fiber, vegetables, fruits, fermented foods and too much sugar, carbs, processed ""food,"" genetically-modified food), antacid use, NSAID use, birth-control pill regimes, chemotherapy, and artificial sweeteners.As patients feel sicker, doctors unknowingly feed the flames by prescribing more pain medication, antibiotics, etc., to try to alleviate symptoms and show their patients that they are ""doing something."" Vicious, meet circle. The misery continues.Well, if all politics are local, all health is in the gut. That's right. We are the microbial profile we feed on a daily basis. And while ""feed"" mostly means the mouth, it also includes the skin. Dr. Chutkan sees it as a twin mission: living dirty and eating clean. That means we do ourselves no favors by constantly cleaning our hands with hand sanitizers, applying skin products and soaps with anti-bacterial elements and good-bacteria killing chemicals (go ahead, read the ingredients, see if you have the slightest idea about what you are slathering to your skin and scalp on a daily basis... didn't think so).The best part: Chutkan offers practical tips on turning it around -- what you should eat and what you should not eat. Watch out for corn, soy products, and sugar especially. They kill the Good Army and arm the Terrorist in your gut flora. They are almost all GMO-made monstrosities by now, thanks to companies like Monsanto, which have their profits (and yes, Big Pharma's, too, because sick people drive profits) to watch after. Certain bacteria (bad) thrive on sugar and artificial sweeteners and will hijack your body's eating preferences. What we call a ""sweet tooth"" is actually a type of bad bacteria clamoring from your gut for more of what they need to survive (that it makes you sick means little to them, they are out for themselves and haven't a clue that they will die with you).Chutkan also offers some basic day-to-day living advice, too. A little dirt is a good thing, as is being outside (or opening windows and letting the outside in). Remember when you were a kid? Always outside, barefoot and dirty, exercising through play and interaction with others? Compare to the present, where we spend so much time in our antiseptic, air-conditioned houses, take showers every day, shellack our skin with mysterious products, clean our homes with even more mysterious, bacteria-killing products. Recipe, meet disaster. Patient, meet doctor (yet again): ""Doc, I feel miserable and I don't know why."" Doc and Conventional Medicine don't know why, either.As to the book itself, yes, it is somewhat repetitive at times and not a narrative wonder or anything, but I 4-star it for its contents and importance. Chutkan even devotes a chapter to the hardcore cases. Here she discusses fecal transplants, the latest frontier for people who cannot turn around their severe conditions through diet and lifestyle changes alone. Feces from healthy patients with the correct microbial profiles are transplanted into the intestines of the sick patient with miraculous results (just look the other way and get over your aversion, I guess). It's been a life-changer for people with relentless conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, infectious diarrhea, etc. Animals don't eat other animals' feces for nothing. Nature is often instructive (and gross). It's squeamish patients who often choose not to heed such lessons.Finally, and not least importantly, the book ends with 95 pages of ""microbiome solution"" recipes, mostly for dishes that will feed the good and suppress the bad bacteria that live within you, but also for homemade household cleaners and skin lotions/shampoos. Food for stomach, skin, and soul.Yep. Brave New World (which looks suspiciously like our grandparents' Brave OLD World, before the corporations and chemicals started to hijack our willingly sheep-like lives). Advice: Buy or check out of the library. Then fight back against bad bacteria and bad businesses that will shed no tears over your slow and protracted demise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RROWXJ1DJFKSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1583335765#wasThisHelpful","RROWXJ1DJFKSX","ADQR7Y6GIKSDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQR7Y6GIKSDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well-written, above run-of-the-mill YA piece. A bit confusing with the number of friends and beboping around (chapter-wise), but overall, a satisfying, character-based read about middle school girls who agree to be friends forever (yeah, right) and give it the old middle-school try.Lots of friend drama, a sexting fiasco (though the book is tame and middle-school safe), and even a mild romantic storyline. Occasionally, even a great line (writing-wise), such as one about pull-down attic stairs being like a tongue extending to the floor.

"Towers above my previous blender, which had an ice setting but seemed to engage in death struggles to break the ice up. Not the case with the Jamba. With this, the Ice is crushed. And fast.Now that THAT'S out of the way, a few particulars. The Jamba has four pre-programmed buttons that each behave in their unique ways. Ice crushing gets you low-to-medium pulses steadily up and down for a minute. Whole juice setting purees fruits and veggies by slowly ramping up from slow to high in 55 seconds. Smoothie setting? It pulses five times like it's thinking about lift-off, then ramps up to high for 45 seconds before stopping on its own. And finally, the Soup setting, which I have not used. According to the manual, not only does the blender run for 5 mins, 45 secs, it actually heats the soup to just below the boiling point. I'm a bit leery of that.Good news: Documentation claims all plastic used is BPA free (though no plastic is good plastic when combined with heat, thus my hesitation with soup mode). The blender is made (where else?) in China. It has a manual mode in addition to the four buttons so you can choose pulse, stop/start, and speed (with the center dial). The top center comes off to pour stuff in, and it even includes a ""tamper"" to tamp down stubborn produce through the top, much like some juicers on the market.All in all, one capable blender. If it has one weakness, it's sound. Honestly. This baby is loud. So if you're thinking of dialing up a smoothie before work at 5 a.m., either forget about it or expect some rise-and-shine company from your grouchy family wandering into the kitchen mumbling: ""What WAS that?""","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19GL7AMO0AG3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WHQV79I#wasThisHelpful","R19GL7AMO0AG3D","ADQR7Y6GIKSDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQR7Y6GIKSDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life is more the subtitle than the title -- that is, a surfing life. To break it down further, it is more life than surfing, as it follows William Finnegan from youngest years to the present day, from continent to continent, from schools to jobs, from here to eternity. Is there a lot of surfing in that life? Yes. Is there a lot of life -- maybe too much life -- in this book? Yes again.Meaning, I felt that 464 pages was a bit much. Surprising, considering Finnegan is a New Yorker writer (that is, if you subscribe to the notion that journalists, more than novelists, are more likely to stay on point and cut to the narrative bone). There are enjoyable descriptions of the ocean and the surfers who like to ride it spread throughout the book. There are also lulls where I kept looking deep for incoming swells.Admittedly, I may not be the best judge. I have never surfed in my  life. Thus, I came to the book with romanticized notion and hoped for lyrical passages you'd expect from a real writer's writer. You know. Hemingway Hangs Ten. But really it was more matter of fact. Well-written, yes. Just overwritten, content-wise. In need of the famous editor Maxwell Perkins, maybe.That said, if you are interested in the autobiography of a New Yorker writer whose greatest love has been surfing -- almost 500 pages worth -- you'll likely enjoy this journalist's tale. At least his life is more exciting than most -- certainly more exciting (and accomplished) than mine.

"I'm old (-ish). Well, I was until this week, anyway, when I read in the news that you're not middle-aged until you hit your head on 60. This new rule (clearly made by a Boomer) means I'm young again. Ponce de LeÃ³n can go pound sand (in a swamp -- a tricky business).All kidding aside -- and despite my newfound youth -- in teaching parlance, I'm still old (-ish). You see, I've read a lot of teacher books by now. And I've been to umpteen professional development seminars where I felt I knew as much as (or, sadly in a few cases, MORE than) the presenter.So, when I stumble upon a book that teaches me something AND teaches me HOW to teach something, I take notice. TEACHING ARGUMENTS is one of those books. It goes beyond logos, pathos, and ethos (Chapter 6 in this book), taking the teaching of argument to another level (the mezzanine, maybe). It's clearly written. And the ethos of the author is impressive. This young lady (Boomer effect strikes anew) knows her stuff.True, the book's target audience is high school teachers, but as an 8th-grade teacher, I always look at 9-12 stuff and say two things: ""I can modify some of this and outright use some of it as is."" Then, a fan of talking, I say a third: ""My kids can do this because some Russian dude whose name I constantly misspell -- Vygotsky, maybe? -- says it's heady but not so heady that the handies can't reach it.""Actually, he didn't say that, but I'm not so good at translations, so there.Back to the book: You can start with the last chapter (I did) because it's all about ""Aristotle's Guide for Being a Good Student."" Useful in September, it stresses ""habits"" over ""abilities"" because good academic habits are the great equalizers. They level the playing field.Then I reversed to Chapter 1: ""Starting with Open-Minded Inquiry"" before moving on to Chapter 2's practical ""From Comprehension to Critique."" Chapters 3, 4, and 5 come in a bundle, as they say of communications these days. They are, in order, ""Fostering a Deeper Understanding of Occasion, of Audience, and of Purpose."" Then it's the EPL chapter you'd expect first (or maybe I would because that's what I know and teach -- poorly, I now see).Yes, I could have waited until September to implement some of Fletcher's ideas, but I figure, why rob these great kids of some of the skills before they go off to high school, so I've been using some of the stuff the past week or so -- with good result, too! We read a NY TIMES opinion column by David Brooks and played ""the believing game."" In a few days, we will revisit the same, only this time we'll be playing ""the doubting game."" My kids are used to the ""one-and-done-as-quickly-as-possible game"" when it comes to reading, so this is a nice change. A good habit, thank you.One mark of a good teacher book is the size of the appendices with all of the handouts and examples. Seeing a long one is like a full stocking on Christmas morning. Unpack it slowly and enjoy! So yes, it's been Christmas In April reading this. (Who says April is the cruelest month? T.S. Eliot can go pound sand with Ponce!)Meaning? The book has a solid theoretical foundation BUT is loaded with practical ideas. Fletcher doesn't stint when it comes to sharing. Now, if I can only get Jennifer Fletcher to run seminars and barnstorm her way East! It's been a while since I went to PD and actually learned something.

"As the subtitle explains, this book is wisely meant for both parents AND teachers -- and not just of youngsters, but of kids all the way through middle and high school. While a lot of the advice on reading is practical, it is also, per Willingham's trademark calling card, based on research. Thus, some of your cherished beliefs may be up for revision (all rewards and praise work -- they don't; all aspects of technology work against reading -- not true). In other words, nothing is cut and dried, and research likes shades of gray, so read up on it.The book is organized by age of the child, with parts dedicated to ""Birth Through Preschool,"" ""Kindergarten Through Second Grade,"" and ""Third Grade and Beyond."" There's information on decoding, comprehension, the all-important background knowledge, fluency, and yes, motivation. At the end of each chapter, Willingham offers a ""Keeping It Simple Summary"" with bullet points of very basic highlights to remember. Notes are inserted at chapters' ends (vs. book's end) as well.The best part? The book is practical. There is advice for both parents and teachers on optimizing odds that Johnny and Suzie will grow to be recreational readers. No, not nerds who read instead do cool stuff like the Internet and gaming, but kids who realize that reading is another pleasure of life to go beside those electronic pastimes -- a different pleasure in life, too. One with its own distinct rewards. At just under 200 pp. with plenty of pictures, it's a fast read. If you care about reading, worth your dime. Or your hold at the library.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TRB4J44RD535/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118769724#wasThisHelpful","R1TRB4J44RD535","ADQR7Y6GIKSDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQR7Y6GIKSDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PIRATE HUNTERS is more than just ""the search for the lost treasure ship of a great buccaneer,"" it's history, biography, and psychology rolled into one page-turning tale. Ostensibly, this is the story of two treasure hunters, John Mattera and John Chatterton, who descend upon the Dominican Republic in search of the pirate Joseph Bannister's ship, THE GOLDEN FLEECE. In a battle against two British war ships, the GOLDEN FLEECE went down in 1687, where it has rested in peace ever since. Author Robert Kurson uses the natural story lines built by hunters racing other hunters for one of the most elusive of prizes, a genuine pirate wreck (records for pirate ships were not kept by pirates and their sympathizers, making finds all the more challenging).In addition to the history propelled by the mystery, the false starts necessary to reach an actual strike, and the underwater (and above) descriptions built for suspense, the author stops the narrative to explore the background of both treasure hunters -- Chatterton's as a medic who risked his life repeatedly in Vietnam, and Mattera's as a boy growing up as part of the New York crime families network in the 60s and 70s. Both are diverting tales, though the reader, appetite whetted, longs to get back to the Dominican and the hunt for a great pirate ship.Also leavening the narratives are historical accounts of Joseph Bannister, the British captain turned rogue (and how often does THAT happen?) who took on his countrymen and fought them to a draw against incredible odds. For readers, the derring will do nicely and the reading is pitched once it comes to Bannister. Kurson also takes time to educate readers on pirates, on their love for democracy far in advance of any Founding Fathers, on their strict system of ""justice"" despite an undeniable love for money, liquor, and women.For instance, neither ""Aarghhh!"" nor ""Shiver me timbers!"" were ever uttered by pirates of the Golden Age of Piracy (1650-1720). Instead, they were the invention of 1950s movie screenwriters. Among invocations the real pirates said: ""Eat what falls from my tail!"" ""Damn your blood!"" ""I'll cleave your skull asunder!"" ""I'll cut you in pound pieces!"" and ""I come from hell and I'll carry you there presently!""There's also an interesting ledger of what pirates were compensated for body parts lost while in brave battle: e.g. 600 pieces of silver or six slaves for a lost right arm, 500 pieces of silver or five slaves for a lost left arm, 100 pieces of silver or one slave for a lost eye or lost finger, etc. There were also set punishments onboard for stealing from a ship's plunder, cheating fellow pirates, sneaking a woman on board (trouble!), cowardice, insolence, disobedience, or anything else impeding the ship's primary purpose -- to steal (and spend as quickly as possible, for as Kurson points out, buried treasure is another myth and would be considered laughable to ""spend it today, if not yesterday"" pirates of the time).So go ahead, indulge the kid (or Capt. Kidd) in yourself. Read a rip-roaring tale about a real pirate who's little known and deserves to be better known. Yes, on small occasion the narrative waters grow choppy and slow, but for the most part the sailing is so smooth that Roger and most everyone else will grow Jolly reading it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27LGPNVC92IKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400063361#wasThisHelpful","R27LGPNVC92IKQ","ADQR7Y6GIKSDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQR7Y6GIKSDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With WEIGHTLESS, Sarah Bannan takes a calculated risk that both pays off and doesn't -- she uses the first-person plural point of view. Thus you have ""We this..."" and ""We that...."" What iss the point in that, you ask? Is she just showing off, you wonder? Not exactly. By using the ""group-think"" of teen tribes (cliques to you) and by emphasizing the modern-day role of social networks (online, cell phones, tablets, etc.), Bannan is out to show us just how impersonal and singular a group of people can become -- often to society's detriment.In this case, a new (and of course good-looking) girl moves to Alabama from New Jersey. Within the first week or two, she is dating the hunkiest (and of course star-jock) guy in the school. All eyes are on the new couple. All tongues are wagging about them. And the online buzz is relentless, right down to a ""Top Girls in Our School"" type list (haven't we seen this before?), to which New Girl zooms to the top (can you say, ""Surprise""?).The down side, as you might have guessed, is how predictable and stereotypical this narrative is once you get used to the ""We"" business. If you've read a lot of YA situated in high schools, you're in for both ""more"" and ""of the same."" The book also gets off to a slow start. As it approaches the 100 mark, the pace picks up a bit. Possibly teen readers will embrace it despite the predictability. They might just get into the pack mentality of swarming jealousies, love interests, pettiness, and hormones. For me, a simple reader of YA fare for classroom library purposes, this was just a bit too much ""not again."" High marks for the creative use of POV to emphasize technology's dark side, but lower ones for the story itself.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S3GH80CXF9UT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250050928#wasThisHelpful","R1S3GH80CXF9UT","ADQR7Y6GIKSDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQR7Y6GIKSDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sometimes star ratings are insufficient things. Sometimes ratings say as much about the reader as they do the book. In this case, I will confess to my own subjective nature as a reader. The BOOK OF SPECULATION is a book of plot. Sheer story. Fun, maybe, if you love books that are escapist in nature. To an extent, I like that, too. But I crave deep characterization and description as well. Here, all the writing seems a prop for the plot -- and a bizarre plot it is.The story involves a line of mothers who are ""mermaids"" in that they work for circuses and can stay underwater for great lengths of time (no fins to speak of, so if you're a Daryl Hannah fan, apologies all around). Trouble is, these ""mermaids"" drown. Always. And on the same day. Always. Sound like a plot waiting for a climax? You don't have to listen carefully to know the answer is yes. Thus does one Simon Watson, librarian by trade, come to a quest to rescue his sister after his mother has drowned in the manner mentioned above. Back and forth the chapters alternately go -- the present with Simon and his race against this mystery, and the circus-situated past which slowly builds the background to the curse Simon is up against. You may never look at a horseshoe crab in the same way again (not that you look at horseshoe crabs all that often, but if you do).A nice ride. A bit hokey. Breadth over depth, but I know that there are many readers, unlike me, who take to storybooks like this like horseshoe crabs take to the sea. So mea culpa for the stars. Ignore them. Look in the mirror. If you don't care about the other stuff and just want a Scheherazade-of-the-Sea tale (mermaids need apply), jump in! The water's fine!

"If you're a hypochondriac, steer clear. Otherwise, steel yourself and have a look-see at surgery from the other side (assuming you're not a neurosurgeon reading this). Henry Marsh is a British brain surgeon and a writer with a clear, straightforward style -- not only his diction, but his personality. With each chapter named after a different (and terrible) thing that can go wrong with these miracle devices we call our brains and our bodies, he delivers anecdote after anecdote of actual cases he's experienced over the years, some ending happily, many not. What's refreshing is his human voice. Being seen as savior or demon (often depending on outcome of surgery) is no easy way to make a living, as readers will see.Still, Marsh is not one to hide behind his vaunted profession and overly-romanticize it. In fact, he admits that errors happen. Things go wrong, even during routine operations. In one frightening case, he let a junior surgeon begin a rather straightforward procedure and an error causing permanent disablement occurred. Rather than falsify records as many doctors do (and easily can, considering the patient is out and you're only surrounded by members of your team, the medical brethren), Marsh owned up to it. In his view, hospitals deserved to be sued in some cases -- a man like this should at least win a settlement to help with the obvious ordeal lying ahead. Still, settlements or not, mistakes don't stop guilt from hounding doctors. At least doctors who care.Despite all of the gloom and doom, there's an education to be had in this book. You can learn a lot about the brain's function and effects on other parts of the body. All pain is signaled by the brain. Hemispheres matter. Location and size of tumors matter. Some tumors are ""sticky"" and become problematic because they adhere too much to the brain. Others, more luckily, almost ""pop"" out with little coaxing -- like Teflon, even. One never knows until one goes into the brain, which on more than one occasion sounds as much the ""last frontier"" as outer space, especially when reading Marsh's graphic descriptions of the ""landscape"" in there.Here's an excerpt showing Marsh's typical tone and overall humanity: ""My outpatient clinic is an odd combination of the trivial and the deadly serious. It is here that I see patients weeks or months after I have operated on them, new referrals or long-term follow-ups. They are wearing their own clothes and I meet them as equals. They are not yet in-patients who have to submit to the depersonalizing rituals of being admitted to the hospital, to be tagged like captive birds or criminals and to be put into bed like children in hospital gowns. I refuse to have anybody else in the room -- no students, no junior doctors or nurses -- only the patients and their families.""The type of doctor you could put your faith in? I should say so. An education not only on the brain but on dying? That, too. The doctors know what's going down, and you will, too, once you read all of these cases. Sometimes no operation is the answer. Sometimes hope is your enemy -- bound only to prolong your suffering when palliative measures would be so much more humane.Overall, a compelling document. Moments of humor, dark and not, rails against bureaucracy and government, and snapshots of people like you and me... always hoping the best from life, sometimes receiving the worst from it. In a word: fate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TK9BXOHS3EBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125006581X#wasThisHelpful","R1TK9BXOHS3EBF","ADQR7Y6GIKSDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQR7Y6GIKSDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Talk about broad! Talk about abstract and literal at once! The subject is ""rain"" and the slant (if you can call it that) is its ""natural and cultural history."" With such a huge topic, Cynthia Barnett has her work cut out for her and, overall, she pulls it off with aplomb. Yes, this could have been an encyclopedic-style book, but Barnett has a way with words and instead steers toward story. Well, stories. Multiple.The problem with such Herculean tasks as this is deciding what to write about. Rain is one big (and leaking) tent. Where to begin? Where to go? It's like herding cats (and dogs, to coin an idiom mentioned in this book). Barnett starts, logically enough, with the earth's beginnings, with comparisons to both Mars and Venus, to water's role in these planets' evolutions. From there she moves to early civilizations, how they dealt with too much and too little rain. Reining in rain, no easy task, has been high on man's to-do list for centuries. Some civilizations (the ancient Assyrians, for one, and then the Romans and the Byzantines) were better at it than others.If there's a small negative to the book, it's the choices that the author is forced to make. What should she include? Leave out? Discuss at length? Mention briefly? With decisions like that, she's bound to please some readers and disappoint others. She dwells on ""rainmakers,"" for one -- the quacks and charlatans who made money by fooling people into thinking they could call on the rain and bring it down for farmers and others -- at a price.. Some used ordnance (explosions in the sky = rain, as was believed by many a Civil War veteran, including Joshua Chamberlain of the 20th Maine). Others used chemical soups that would emit all matter of highly-visible gases floating to the heavens. But all depended on coincidence and ""rainy seasons"" to bail them out. To me, this got a little old fast, but Barnett covered more than one such character.Then, in the ""Writers on the Storm"" section, Barnett gets into writers, composers, artists, who all tapped into rain for their material. To me this was more fascinating, and I could have read another hundred pages on it, but Barnett moves on sooner rather than later. It was not surprising to learn, however, that ""bad"" weather induces higher artistic output -- that is, many famous writers got more work done when living in a rainy climate vs. a sunny one. Being cooped up? Yes, but the mood, too. Rain has its wiles and will not be denied.Among other topics touched on are scents of rain, how the U.S. is enamored with ""rain scents"" in many cleaning products while the Europeans (esp. Irish and English) prefer ""sun-fresh"" products, Thomas Jefferson (who foolishly built Monticello on a hill, far from the river and more easily-tapped water supplies), strange rains (frogs, eels, mud, etc., falling from the skies), and the high electrocution rates of church bell ringers before folks figured out that water plus high places during thunderstorms equaled shocking finishes.Overall, highly entertaining, if jumpy and uneven in spots. Given the task taken on (rain's ""natural and cultural history""), Barnett more than held her own. Holds up to ""front to back"" reading or to leisurely dipping while reading other books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QI6LGC024XS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804137099#wasThisHelpful","R3QI6LGC024XS2","ADQR7Y6GIKSDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQR7Y6GIKSDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At approximately 180 pages, GOD HELP THE CHILD is an exercise in brevity. After a somewhat confusing start, it launches into the story of a black child, Lula Ann, who is unwanted due to her excessive darkness. In fact, her father suspects her mother of having had a darker-skinned lover and leaves her. But the mother is innocent. Horrified, but innocent. What she's not innocent of is loving her child. Lula Ann is left to feel the wrath of a mother who feels singled out by the gods.Lula Ann grows to be statuesque, eventually cashing in on her blue-black loveliness by becoming a model and adopting the name Bride (she wears white clothes only for contrast). She falls for a man named Booker, a man with his own baggage. And, key to everything, Bride gets the living Hades beaten out of her when she tries to help a woman she put behind bars so many years ago.All of this takes exposition at the start, where you'd expect it. What's odd, in so short a book, is how exposition enters the scene again 3/4ths through, only this case to chronicle Booker's past. This ""intermission"" staggers the book's flow a bit. And, stranger still, when it all wraps up, the reader feels as if everything has not been said. Some readers may like this effect, actually, but I felt less invested in the characters because of it.I also feel that Morrison hits her stride when ""showing"" through description, action, and dialogue, and stumbles when telling, such as with the stretches of exposition. In the end, it all feels a bit uneven, unfinished, unconvincing, even. That said, I cared enough to see it through. Thus the 3-stars. It's one of those books that has its 2- and 4-star moments. Thus, the law of averages. If you like experiments -- and 180-page novellas are risky in their way -- give it a try. There's no faulting Morrison for her ambition, anyway.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WFJXC04PHF8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307594173#wasThisHelpful","R2WFJXC04PHF8X","ADQR7Y6GIKSDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQR7Y6GIKSDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some reviewers have been taken aback by the taste of this product, so I'm guessing many of them mix it with water and make it a meal. Me, I use nutritional shakes as the foundation for smoothies where I dictate the taste via add-ins. Nevertheless, for this review, I first tasted Vegan One straight up -- not with water, but with unsweetened almond milk, my go-to base for shakes and smoothies.Did it taste bad? Only if you don't like a strong hint of pureed peas. Sent me back to the feeding-the-kids-baby-food days, it did, and probably ahead to what I'll be eating when I'm in a nursing home and toothless as GUMby (oh happy day). Bad taste? No. Yummy taste? Also no. A draw, then.The deal is, you mix in tastes you like. For my second batch, I put in a cup of frozen organic raspberries and a tablespoon of unsweetened cacao powder for a chocolate raspberry kick. Goodbye peas, hello signature shake. And, as the powder features whole-food ingredients with 20 grams of protein and less than 1 gram of sugar per scoop, who am I to complain? This stuff is good for you, is non-GMO project verified, and is gluten-free -- all things I check for. No dairy. No soy. Check and check.So, no, I cannot join the chorus of negative reviews on taste alone. It's not wonderful tasting, but I don't expect that of any shake and sometimes think shakes known for their ""taste"" have either too high a sugar profile or too high a ""fake"" sugar profile, things I avoid like the plague. To me, a shake's job is to offer real food and nutrients for my body. Period.

"A good road book is 2% starting point, 3% destination, and 95% road. In MOSQUITOLAND, David Arnold pretty much sticks to these numbers. Good thing. As Bilbo Baggins would be happy to tell you, it's all in the journey (you were expecting ""wrist""?). And what a journey! This book is 342 pages, yet I downed it in two days. Maybe that's no big deal, but when you consider this is more a character book than a plot book, it becomes one.So, the protagonist. She's 16-year-old Mary Iris Malone, a.k.a. Mim, and she's different. Unique. Precocious. True, naysayers might rightfully complain, ""No 16-year-old girl talks and thinks like this -- like her 40-something-year-old author, I mean,"" but you need to get over that ipso fasto (Latin for ""in a mosquito moment"") or else. OK. Done. And then there are some other bits that stretch the old suspension bridge of disbelief a bit. For instance, when Mim runs away in search of real mom (leaving behind Dad and unreal stepmom), she's considered a missing child -- one who will eventually see fliers of herself. But wait. She's also carrying her cellphone. Do the letters G, P, and S mean nothing these days?All that said, it's hard to put the book down (literally or figuratively). Mim is funny, witty, full of allusions, quirky as all get-out, and, thanks be, prone to running into all sorts of characters (savory and un-) on the road from Mississippi to Cleveland. Yes, these characters give her quirkiness a run for its money, but what do you expect for a Greyhound full of strange strangers? By the final 3%, Arnold has offered up a little of everything -- happy, sad, pathos, bathos, love interest, scary moment, mishaps, perhaps, etc. Not bad for a day's work, in other words, and one of the better YAs I've read in the past few years.

"Sentry's Fiproguard wants you to compare it to the #1-selling Frontline because it hopes to put a dent in those sales. A look at the ingredients comes up a match: each has 9.8% Fipronil and 8.8% (S)-methoprene. These are the pesticides. Beyond that, the comparisons cannot be made, as both are made up of a whopping 81.4% ""inert ingredients"" (undefined). Given that they are ostensibly the same product, it might boil down to price for most consumers, and that has much to do with WHERE you buy. While available at the vet's, Frontline is not so much a bargain as a convenience when purchased there. As for effectiveness, I find that neither product is 100% effective on ticks, especially after 3 weeks or so, but it certainly cuts down on their presence, which can be robust, given the proliferation of wood ticks in recent years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYUCTN5J5V8DG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QO2CN8A#wasThisHelpful","RYUCTN5J5V8DG","ADQR7Y6GIKSDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQR7Y6GIKSDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Once we wander into ""sports recovery drink"" territory, we are in the land of asterisks. As no recovery claim on this product is vouched for by the FDA (not that it means much, coming from those three letters), I pour my Vega Sport mix as an act of faith in its producer and in the notion that it probably won't hurt (given the ingredients) and very well might help.So what are these asterisked claims? In order, they are 1.) Replenishes energy and electrolytes, 2.) Reduces inflammation, muscles and joint pain, 3.) Supports immune system function and protein synthesis, and 4.) Reduces recovery time between training.The electrolytes I can vouch for, but it's words like ""energy"" that get Claim #1 in trouble. The others, you can see, are tougher to prove. Heck, even I can't say. I ask myself: Do I feel more energetic, have less muscle ache than normal, and feel as though my immune system now wears a super hero cape? Subjectively, I can say yes, but the truth is, my ""aches"" and ""recovery time"" between workouts has always been variable. Sometimes I have quick rebounds and sometimes not. And that's BEFORE I ever sipped a Vega Sport.Why the mostly positive review, then? It doesn't taste bad (I quaffed a box of the tropical flavor). It doesn't taste great, mind you, but it tastes better than most sports drinks. For one, it has far less sugar and that means a lot to me. For each 12 fl. oz. glass, we're talking 14 grams. That's not insignificant, but it sure as heckfire isn't Red Bull or Gatorade, either.Another plus is the plant-based derivation of the drink. A look down the list of ingredients sends up no alarms. And so, for 90 calories and the possibility that drinking my vegetables, spices, roots, and vitamins might asterisk me to good health sooner, I'm willing to go along with things. Time will tell, though. In the long run, I'll get a better sense. Subjectivity, over months (as opposed to days), becomes a little less subjective.In the meantime, if you're drinking a lot of ""energy"" drinks that are really caffeine-sugar drinks, some even with artificial coloring added, you can do better. You can drink this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB1K6VZ0HDS71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005QDXWSI#wasThisHelpful","RB1K6VZ0HDS71","ADQR7Y6GIKSDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQR7Y6GIKSDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jo Knowles ""novel"" is more like a series of connected short stories, each overlapping, some sharing common characters from a typical high school with typical high school ""types."" The trouble with such a strategy lies in the characterization. None of the characters get a chance to gather traction with the reader. What's more, you will often meet a character never to meet him or her again, except perhaps in passing or by mention of another character much later in the book.So if you take a shining to a particular character and his or her background (the exposition of which must be covered in each new section), tough luck. You will be disappointed when Knowles moves on. And move on she does. There are many stories here. The boy whose dad does not love him. The overweight cheerleader. The popular girl looking for something more. The regular guy looking for something more as well. The high school drop-out working at a fast food restaurant. The star quarterback who has a fake girlfriend and a secret love for another boy. The new teacher who gets eaten alive by unruly students every day.Some of these scenarios offer YA staples -- characters with predictable woes and behaviors. Others appear a bit more successful. And the conceit holding them all together? You guessed it, oh cover-glancer. The middle finger. Every episode features either our star of the moment giving the finger or getting it. There are more flipped birds here than Tippi Hendren could imagine in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, THE BIRDS. Alas, the bird-flipping doesn't do much for the book and in many cases looks forced. No need to read between any lines, in that case. Trying too hard becomes obvious.Bottom line? There are some nice stretches of writing, but the center does not hold. I'm tempted to say the design itself is at fault, but then I recall the classic WINESBURG, OHIO, which also stitches stories with common characters together -- and succeeds. Perhaps it is a design that requires refined skills. Or perhaps Sherwood Anderson's ""grotesques"" (as his lovable loser characters are called) are too difficult to emulate, especially with the well-worn stock characters of YA lit set in high schools. Some students may take to these characters, I'm sure, but many others may lose patience without the forward momentum of any true plot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WU8DINQMMWG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763663875#wasThisHelpful","R1WU8DINQMMWG3","ADQR7Y6GIKSDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADQR7Y6GIKSDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In French, this means ""Precious Serum."" Like a lot of cookbooks, it comes from Provence -- fans of Ponce de Leon will be saddened to note that he was WAY off, fishing around the swamps of Florida. Anyway, it's made from a flower called ""Immortelle"" which is French for ""Mediterranean flower with no wrinkles to speak of."" These flowers are grown organically by the manufacturer in Corsica. Can you say ""exotic""?So anyway, the parts are related. You have Immortelle essential oils, Immortelle floral water, and Immortelle cell extracts (don't ask). The promise? Nothing big. Just smoother skin, firmer skin, and younger skin. The reason? It stimulates collagen production. I asked my wife what this means. She says ""wrinkle-filler."" Such a scientist.According to L'Occitane, this stuff is ""proven effectiveness on both the length and the depth of wrinkles."" It's too soon to say because my wife still looks like my wife. She likes that it's not greasy, though, and it has a slight perfumey smell. Like Corsica on a summer morning, maybe.Pricey? I'll say!

"A bit of a lightweight (both literally and figuratively), but good for very small spaces in need of a bit of warm (as opposed to hot) air. So, if it's just your feet you need to warm, this may answer your needs. It's made in China, and the type of plastic is not marked by a recyclable symbol, so there's that mystery. Also, the small knobs on top do not turn easily and simply consist of a fan and two heat settings (warm, a little warmer). Most exacerbating is the indentation in back. It's only around 1/2 inch deep, so when you try to lift the heater you have to use two hands because your fingers do not go in enough to get a firm grip.

"The key here is *wireless* subwoofer. The old get-up that I just took down had about a gazillion wires making snake love behind the television set. In this case, there's only one wire between the sound bar and the cable box. The directions said to hook it into the television set, but the TV did not have a connection for this type of wire, so I looked behind the cable box and EUREKA, there it was, so don't trust the directions on this count. Beyond this single connection, all you do is plug in the sound bar and plug in the subwoofer.Hold on. One more step. You have to get your TV's remote, go to the menu, find the speaker settings and turn the TV speakers OFF. Next, you battery up your Yamaha YAS-203 remote (batteries provided, thank you), and you're ready for prime time. The little remote controls surround sound, stereo, subwoofer level and volume level. Much nicer sound.I'm no audiophile and I'm not the handyman, either, yet I managed -- easily. This is good news. This is better sound. Is it sublime? No. Sublime sound is the realm of people who have all manner of speakers and speak in another language (""audio-talk,"" maybe). But for the layman who just wants to experience the ""up"" in ""upgrade"" when he's watching TV, this certainly does the trick.

It slides onto the base like a slipcover.Unlike the USA-made puff, the stand is made in good-old China. It fits together like Legos and takes about a dozen screws or so. No need to be a rocket scientist to figure this out -- just a screw driver scientist (come on, you know you have a degree). If there's one thing that gives me pause, it's the little plastic disk on the bottom of each chair leg. Just waiting to come off, I figure. At least if you plan on putting this chair on a hard floor. If it's on a rug, I suppose it will be less of an issue, but one never knows.The color -- sand -- is nice and conservative but more likely to show stains. It blends into most any oatmeal-style decor.

"What's this?"" my son asked.""A blue light.""""Feeling blue or something?"" he asked.More prescient than he knows, considering this is a blue light designed to drive away the blues. Whether it does  -- scientific proof in the form of ""independent research"" or not -- will never be substantiated by an amazon reviewer, in my opinion. As is the case with many things of this ilk, those who believe or are willing to believe will experience better results, and those who don't or are extremely skeptical will experience less optimal results. Let's just say I place these sort of things in the ""doesn't hurt and can only help"" department because they are safe and *might* boost one's energy/mood level, especially with Old Man Winter at the door, 5-bags of luggage in his arms.Speaking of winters, it might be best to read reviews from customers who live further north, where the nights are shortest and the winters bleakest. New England might not quite rate in that case, but I can assure you that it's a sleek looking little number about the size of a hand. The directions are so simple even a young punster's father can figure it out -- hit the plus to up the light intensity, the minus to diminish it. And though it's a blue color, directions state you should still not stare at it. Rather, let the indirect, arm's-length brightness wash over you for 20-30 mins a couple of times daily to feel the good times.Mine is near the computer plugged in.

"This Epson replaces an older Hewlett-Packard we had and the upsides are evident. Like many other technological items, the Epson is smaller -- more compact than our other printer. There's also less shake, rattle, and roll. By that I mean the old one used to shimmy a bit while printing, making the somewhat flimsy table it sat on juke and jive a bit. This one holds firm.The noise element is better, though you still know printing is going on. At least no one senses imminent take-off as with the other. (Whisper quiet printers must be a ways away.) Simple insertion of toner and the color is good. Walk-through set-up on printer window was a breeze. Although you get the CD with the new printer, it's not necessary as your computer downloads drivers.

"First, a brief story. Once upon a Christmas, I thought it would be cool to buy my wife some fancy anti-aging cream and drop it in her stocking. We were, after all, suffering the slings and arrows of middle age. Wasn't this thoughtful and creative on my part? Apparently not. My wife was mortified and not a little insulted. In the French Foreign Legiion there's an officer called Major Faux Pas, and I had just met him in a most unceremonious way!Flash forward to today. Seeing this hilariously-named product called, in all self-seriousness, ""Booty Parlor Love Thighself Toning Cellulite Cream,"" I called my wife over to the screen and said, ""Get a load of this. Remember the infamous Goof of Christmas Past when I bought that anti-aging cream?""And so forth, as she asked me to scroll down so she could read more about this product. ""Seriously?"" I said. ""Why not?"" she shrugged. Next thing you know, it's being clicked on for the cart -- not at my behest, but at hers. It's a mysterious world we live in, friends.Anyway, the lowdown. She says it feels too greasy, but she likes the smell (coconut citrus). As an innocent bystander, I must warn you that the smell lingers in whatever room it is applied. A plus for those who worry about what's in this stuff is the claim that the product uses no parabens, sulfates, phthalates, or petrochemicals. The key ingredient, supposedly, is ""isonari,"" a Japanese parsley extract ""that inhibits fat production and improves the look of dimpled, sagging skin."" (Is there an asterisk in the house?)

"Episodic. In fact, to the point where author David Nicholls numbers the episodes for readers (for you number wonks, it comes to 180). This domestic month-in-the-life is about a British family of three -- scientist hubby Douglas Petersen, his Bohemian wife Connie, and their typically-moody teen son, Albie. Connie has announced she's thinking about divorce, and Doug puts all his hopes in the Petersen family's upcoming ""Grand Tour of Europe."" Can you see disaster coming? Of course you can! Sooner rather than later, too.Let's start with the quibbles. The book reads like it was written with the movies in mind. Maybe that's not a negative in many readers' minds, but it always throws me a bit if I'm distracted from the words, the craftsmanship, and the moment by niggling notions like, ""Oh, I could see THAT scene on the big screen"" or, ""I'll bet they'll cast so and so as Connie. She'd be perfect!"" and so on.You see, many of the ""episodes"" are set pieces. And the writing can be, at times, self-consciously clever. Put it together and you get a novel crying for a director. They won't need a screenwriter because Nicholls already has experience -- he wrote the screenplay to his last book, ONE DAY. In 2010, it became a Jim Sturgess/Anne Hathaway vehicle (as they say).To be fair, though, there's a lot to like here. By making Douglas such a square, such a killjoy, and such an annoyed dad, Nicholls is able to mine quite a few funny situations, especially with the more worldly Connie as a foil. Visiting the big cities of Europe (chiefly for the museums) gives it all an ""If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium"" feel, too. Rushing for trains. Discovering disastrous lodgings. Arguing over petty things because... well, because everyone's hot and bothered and too close for comfort.As the plot thickens and the marriage teeters, Nicholls develops alternate narrative lines by mixing flashbacks detailing Connie and Doug's early relationship with the present-day melodrama. And while I found myself a tad impatient with the threads about the past, in the end they added some depth to the drama playing out in the present.Can it get cute at times, too clever for its own good, even over-the-top in a few scenes? Well, yeah. But it's enjoyable. And, dare I admit, heartwarming in its way. Meaning? I just KNOW that Hollywood audiences will love it and that the right actors will milk it for all its worth when the cows come home and the box office opens. Four hundred pages, but a quick read and a fun read.

"This is really convenient, a solar powered string of LED lights - no outlet needed!  22 feet is enough to cover a small bush, perhaps a small window.  It even has different modes of flashing.

"This is really awesome, a solar powered string of LED lights, that is fairly long!  It even has different modes of flashing.

" 1:56 Mins This is a cool little lamp.  Mine arrived with a bit of a charge so it turned on right away without being plugged in.  It has three settings, low - medium - high.  At the highest settings it is 950 lumens.It arrives completely folded down flat, just under 14"" long.  But then you can unfold it and swivel back the end for a standing lamp, or hang it on the wall because it has a notch for hanging.This won't light a whole room but it's great for a desk or piano or something like that. The only flaw I can see is that it is a fairly skinny base and it could get knocked over pretty easily.  Because of that I'd say it needs to be in a place where animals or kids aren't going to be able to knock into it.I got my lamp at no charge for the purposes of this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11VCYZC88JHSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011XZBO4G#wasThisHelpful","R11VCYZC88JHSW","A1VYFEJM12ZP11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VYFEJM12ZP11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:19 Mins I got the red ribbon color.  The description says it is 2 CM wide, which translates to exactly 3/4 inches when I measured it.  I also took the time to unroll it since it did not specify a length and it is about 73-74 feet long.  Give or take depending on if you like using the yucky bits at the back and front.This says in the title it's silk ribbon, and the description says it is actually 100% polyester.  It feels a bit papery to me, but it's very durable.  This is a step below really fancy fabric ribbon that is soft, and about 3 steps above purely paper ribbon with a sheen that is made just for wrapping packages.  So when you cut this ribbon, because it is actually fabric, it will fray a little bit... but not nearly as much as a real satin ribbon would.I got my ribbon at no charge for the purposes of this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIPR21ORWIQXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016AEDPC4#wasThisHelpful","RIPR21ORWIQXF","A1VYFEJM12ZP11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VYFEJM12ZP11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:31 Mins This is a really cute charger. Like the little rubber nubby protector on it. It will charge up to 4 USB devices at one time.  It says ""High speed"" but when I plugged my Note 4 into it, it didn't give me the ""fast charge"" notification that I normally get when I am rapid charging.  So I think high speed is a subjective term here.  Normal speed is probably more accurate.

"These are cute little USB fans.  They need assembly, but it's really easy, just put the fan blade on and you are done.  These little USB powered fans have adjustable necks so you can point the fan anywhere you like and they offer a surprising amount of breeze.  I had these plugged into my wall USB in my kitchen and it occurred to me this would be great for cooling down cookies or other items right out of the oven.The blades are made of plastic and I did stick my finger in it just to see how much it would hurt.  It actually did kind of hurt a little bit, but no broken skin or anything horrible.  If you accidentally touched the blades while they were spinning you'd definitely feel it, but no lasting damage.I can see this being great for my menopausal acquaintances who are complaining of hot flashes.

"My son and I tried these Sentey gaming headsets out for a few days and overall for this price point around $30 we think this is a decent value.  We used them with a regular Dell PC and an ASUS Laptop and it worked the same with both.This set connects with USB only.  Hopefully this won't be a deal breaker for you,  they don't use the 3.5mm plug that some other headsets might, but in our experience it isn't unusual to have a USB powered headset - just something to note if you are short on USB ports.The sound quality was the same or maybe slightly better than some other headsets at this price point.  The bass sounds I thought were better.  My son didn't seem to notice that.  Microphone is just OK.  Nothing to write home about, but it is still en par with other headsets of this price point.  If you require stellar mic sound, maybe you might want to invest in a higher end set than this one.  I'd say this one is entry level, and that's ok.  Most people can get by with this I think.Cord is thick and sturdy.  Microphone swivels up and down.The lights on the side can be switched on or off.  I find it a bit gimmicky and superfluous to have lights on these but my son REALLY thinks it's cool.  So I guess it's a personal opinion.

"Beautiful ring!  Looks way more expensive than it is.  The thing I like best about it is that the stones go around the entire circumference of the band.  The colored stones are an orange-brown color.  They look like the color of autumn leaves.  This isn't my normal color for gemstones, but it's quite stunning when on.It's not a heavy thick ring, it's quite delicate and feminine.  It's very attractive and shiny.  At this price point, my expectation is that it should last a 3-6 months and still be in decent condition with daily wear...  I will plan on wearing mine daily and I will report back if and when it begins to tarnish or look worn.  In some cases with less expensive jewelry, I have been very surprised how well it performs, especially the rhodium stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUE6JOV2T5L2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRJN6MM#wasThisHelpful","RUE6JOV2T5L2L","A1VYFEJM12ZP11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VYFEJM12ZP11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In order to make this charger work with my husband's phone (Note 4) we had to purchase a QI Wireless Charging Receiver Film (for Samsung Galaxy Note 4).  It cost around $10.  If you have a newer phone that step will not be necessary.  Once that was installed using the Kollea Qi Wireless charger was a breeze.  Just plug it in and done.When we tried it without my husband's case on the phone it began charging instantaneously.  He put the case back on and it took a moment but then it began charging... and his case is fairly thick because it is a wallet case.  So we could not be more thrilled.The charger itself is very light weight, and is about the size of a drink coaster.  It does not seem to charge as fast as using our ""rapid charge"" plugs, but nothing seems to charge as fast as those do.

"My earrings have much lighter and slightly pinker amethysts than the product photos currently use.  They are delicate and pretty.  The color such as it is, is ok.  I think I would have preferred a darker stone to make the metal stand out more.The earrings have two tone gold/silver color to them.  This is a little strange to me, but doesn't look bad in practice.  The earrings are small and not too heavy.  Good for every day wear.The earring style with the lever closure (not sure what you call this) is a bit hard to get in the ears because the part that threads through your piercing is on a hinge and makes it less stable.

"I don't usually factor price into reviews, because everyone has a different idea of what is expensive or not - but I am making an exception here because I think this is a good value for as many beans as you get.These vanilla beans are the real deal, they add a lot more pop to your recipes than ordinary vanilla extract would... and you can get so much use out of them.  After you have opened the pod length wise you need to use a sharp knife to scrape out the yummy yummy insides.  This is the part you use in your recipes in place of the extract.  It's very flavorful!BUT WAIT!  Don't throw those pods away!  You can still use them,  by either throwing them in with a few cups of sugar (in two weeks you will have VANILLA sugar!)  you can also put the empty pods (or you can use the whole bean in this instance) in Vodka.  Using empty pods require more pods than you would need using the full bean.  What you get as the mixture sits is the best vanilla extract ever.  The best part?  You can use it then top off with more vodka.

" 1:14 Mins This shower head is best used on a very smooth wall.  This will not work on textured ceramic tile, or on a painted wall - especially if your shower head is very heavy.  I received my shower head arm at no charge for the purposes of this review, but I went into it knowing my shower was not the ideal for this type of application.  I thought maybe it would hold on the wall above my tile but it didn't hold very long on either area.  I can't give it a bad review though, because I knew my application for this was going to be iffy.  But maybe you can glean the information you need to see if it will work for you based on my review.So in summary, It's a cool idea if you have the right application.  You need a smooth tile wall, absolutely smooth... and clean.  And it if your shower head is too heavy this also might not work as well as you'd hope.  But if you have a smooth tile wall, and a light weight shower head, this only costs $5.99 so you could give it a try, you won't be out much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRW1G9BKO1A2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSI8PQK#wasThisHelpful","RRW1G9BKO1A2K","A1VYFEJM12ZP11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VYFEJM12ZP11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:08 Mins The Trudeau glass water bottle with infuser is really awesome.  Here are all the reasons why:1. It's all glass and silicone.  No BPA's.2. It's really cute looking, and has a carry strap.3. All parts, the internal parts, the strap... even the grippy silicone base, come off for easy cleaning.4. Dishwasher safe.  (I'd probably put the silicone parts on the top shelf, that's a personal recommendation)5. Added benefit of the infusing sleeve, makes this extra special.6. It has a heavy feel to it, even when empty.  This makes it appear more substantial, and high end than it's plastic counterparts would.  That's why it would make a great gift too.There aren't many negatives to this.  If I had to try and nit pick one... it would be the decals on the outside.  If you wash this in your dishwasher, like I will... then over time these decals are going to fade and wear off... which looks tacky.  But this is really the only thing I can find wrong with it.

" 1:28 Mins These are your basic small trash bags, 2.6 gallon.  You get 120 per roll and they are perforated.  I use them in a 9 quart/8.5 Liter trash can and they seem OK for that size, I wouldn't go much bigger than that though..  I like having a bit of overhang to work with so I can tie it off when the trash is full, so I'll be using this in a slightly smaller trash can than my 9 quart/8.5 liter.Durability is about what you would expect.  Pretty much the same as a plastic bag at the store.  This is for light duty trash only.  It would puncture easily if you put sharp items in there.I got my trash bags for a discount for the purposes of this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X92SRBIJ19HQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CWCZ44#wasThisHelpful","R2X92SRBIJ19HQ","A1VYFEJM12ZP11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VYFEJM12ZP11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These washcloths before laundering, are actually around 10.5"" x 10.5"" square.  After washing they shrink up a little bit but not too bad, I think the listed size of 9.8"" square is fairly accurate for after you wash them.  I appreciate the honesty of the description that the manufacturer gives.These are softer than regular wash cloths, and they are also a bit thinner construction.  I actually have a set of dishrags that are the same material as these wash cloths, and I love those- so these could also be used for that purpose too if you were so inclined.

"I really love this shirt.  The cut is flattering no matter your size.  The material is very soft and I love that it's 5 button instead of three.  I like to leave them unbuttoned for a more V neck look.  It has seams down the front and back to form to your waist, rather than just a blocky shirt.

"I got these about 1pm, and I put them in the window to charge them, and pushed the lever to on.  Then about 6 when it was getting dark, sure enough they popped on all by themselves.  I checked on them at midnight and they were still going strong, but I don't know when they shut off again because it was morning when I next happened by them.  But even so, 6 hours isn't bad especially after not having the full day to charge, and most people turn off their Christmas lights when they go to bed anyway.These are very bright, every bit as bright as the plug in kind of LED Christmas lights.I love that now I am freed from using the one outlet on the front of my house.

"These are really handy in the garage, or even inside the house, for cleaning up messes.  The ""cloths"" are really durable and absorbent.  It's way better than paper towels where you'd have to use a lot, and it's better (in some cases) than actual cloth rags which would be tossed out after super messy jobs.

"This case easily fit a couple 7"" tablets and cables for those tablets.  It also can fit 4 cables and wall plugs.  I felt though that a lot of the slots are kind of a waste.  There are numerous tiny tight spots, presumably for your collection of SD cards.... but I find that overkill.  Maybe you'd need one or two but the majority of people don't need rows of them.  Also I wouldn't feel comfortable storing both tablets and plugs in here because it is a soft case, so if anyone were to apply pressure there isn't much protection there.  There is a divider in there, but I don't think that offers the kind of protection I'd like if I'm housing tablets.The way this is configured, I find myself just throwing a bunch of cables in every which way and then using the elastic bands to hold 4 wall plugs.... not terribly organized but it is a case.  Previously I was using a pencil box when traveling to house our cords, so this is a slight step up.  We have a family of four, and we each have 1-2 devices... so when we travel on vacation we would need something larger than this to organize our electronics cords and plugs.There is also a bonus zipper pouch accessible from the outside of the case.

"This scarf when it arrived was not exactly sheer, but the fabric was a very feathery weight.  Not an infinity scarf, this is a traditional scarf and there are multiple ways to wear it.  You can google scarf knot tying to see all the options, there are many.This scarf was really pretty and being grey with dark grey print it will go with nearly any outfit except maybe some browns.  But I really liked the softness to it.  There is also a surprisingly large amount of material to this (Width) but because it is such a light weight fabric it scrunches up tightly.It will require hand washing, but I put my hand washables into mesh bags and put them in the washing machine on cold and I have no problems.

"This is a very versatile light weight scarf that can be worn in multiple ways, whether you loop it twice or tie a knot in front or even over the head.  It comes in a mesh cloth bag and you can wear it right away, no ironing.  This scarf requires had washing in cold water, but I find that if I put them in a mesh wash bag I can throw them in the washing machine just fine.  Do not dry them though... lay flat.My scarf had a bit of a weird odor when I got it, which dissipates quickly once you remove it from the packaging (thankfully).  I don't know if that is because it was shipped to close to something else that smelled or if that is just how they naturally smell when new.Overall I really like this scarf, it goes with so many clothes I know I will have lots of occasions to wear it.

"The usable surface on these, not including the groove or handles is as follows:Small Cutting Board, 5'' x 7''Medium Cutting Board, 6'' x 8''Large Cutting Board, 7'' x 10''You can flip these over and use the back in theory, but they really aren't meant for that because the side with the groove for juices is the side they mean you to use, but there is no real reason why you could not use the back.I found these to be quite attractive and small enough that they fit in my cabinet conveniently.  The surface is pretty hard plastic but over time like all cutting boards they are going to get grooved with knife cuts.

"This is a very professional looking portfolio.  Everything you need for your next meeting or client visit.  The portfolio comes with a calculator and a pad of paper included.

It looks like leather, the description says ""PU Leather"" which when I googled that term it says ""Bicast leather (also known as bi-cast leather, bycast leather, or PU leather, sometimes described as split leather) is a material made with a split leather backing covered with a layer of polyurethane (hence the term ""PU leather"") that is applied to the surface and then embossed.""

"This is amazing as a moisturizer for the skin, but I'd advise NOT using it on your hair if you have fine hair or you are prone to oiliness.  This might be ok for dry or coarse hair.  This company makes other Argan Oil products that will work much better on hair than this one...  They make this different Argan Oil that works well on hair (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MNK9R5Y), and a different Argan Oil hair mask (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KD73PBQ) that is more a cream.  So if you are looking at this for hair, you might try those other ones first.But, if you are looking for a product for the skin, look no further.  Just a little bit and my skin was noticeably softer.  This will be great as winter is approaching.  I use it on my upper arms and my neck primarily.  Sometimes legs.

It's very light weight and long enough to wear in many different ways if you are in to knotting your scarves.  The pattern was super cute and I really loved it.  It doesn't add a whole lot of heat because it is light weight fabric but there is also enough fabric that it feels substantial.  Looks great!!

"I was excited to get these because they are shatter proof which is something you want with kids and pets in the home.  However despite that very important feature I didn't like these as much as I thought I would because of the glitter.  Maybe if the glitter had stayed on the ornaments, but I had glitter all over my fingers and the table.Eventually, I suppose, the glitter that is coming off will wear off and then you'd be left with a non messy bulb that is also shatterproof.  I also didn't think these looked any more fancy than the bulbs that I can get at the dollar store.

"The ornament box arrives flat and you have to assemble it, which is pretty easy.  By the time you fold out all the parts and put the reinforcing pieces in, it is actually fairly sturdy.  Not sturdy enough to store with anything stacked on top of it though, but sturdy enough that your ornaments should stay pretty secure.There are three trays and each have 9 compartments.  The compartments are HUGE.  My ornaments are not nearly that big so I will be able to put two or three in one slot, probably wrapped up in tissue paper to keep them from jiggling around too much. (My ornaments are stained glass).  If your ornaments are fragile, and smaller than the provided space it's probably advisable to wrap them up in something to prevent them from moving around too much.I took one star off because when I pulled on one of the handles it broke off and frayed.  I will probably sew it back in place - but kind of an extra hassle since this is brand new.  None of the other handles pulled off and broke like that one did, so perhaps it is just a fluke - I can't be sure.All in all it's an attractive box that neatly houses your ornaments, even your biggest ones, with ease.I got this complimentary ornament box sample  for the purposes of this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32CQP5D9COBA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WISPZX4#wasThisHelpful","R32CQP5D9COBA6","A1VYFEJM12ZP11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VYFEJM12ZP11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"They are not kidding when the box says use ""a drop"".  My first time out I used a drop, and thought - there is no way that is going to do anything so I used about two dime size handfuls.  That really was overdoing it.  My hair looked pretty greasy.  It was soft though.  So next time I used half that amount, maybe two squirts if that.  That was even bordering on too much... but now at least I know how much to use.This bottle will last you a long time.  There is no odor associated with this either.  It's just something that makes your hair smooth and soft, especially if you flat iron your hair like I do.  I felt it was fairly good (not perfect) at holding my frizzies at bay as well.

"I was pleasantly surprised by the Luseta Volume Reviving Dry Shampoo & Conditioner.  I have tried other ""dry shampoos"" before and they didn't seem to do anything.  This one seemed to work, and has the bonus of the conditioner, which I didn't see much of a difference using, just left a pleasant smell.You spray this on your hair, holding the can back a little bit so you don't get too much concentrated in one area.  Then you rub it through your hair.  What I did is I turned my head upside down and sprayed that way so the spray could get all over more easily.  It seemed to take the greasiness out.  I couldn't tell what if anything the conditioner did, besides make my hair a little softer and smell nice.  I could have just as easily went without that step.  The trick here is to spray just enough, but not too much.I received this product at no charge for the purposes of this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG08QUCRSFXGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015IL6YBO#wasThisHelpful","RG08QUCRSFXGX","A1VYFEJM12ZP11","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VYFEJM12ZP11?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The base band also has holes to allow the water to flow through.I didn't even have handles before so this one having solidly mounted handles is so much easier to use.I made a really quick video of me draining noodles for lunch today just so it could be seen ""in action"".Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JOCCQFE42XD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0166P6QNM#wasThisHelpful","R1JOCCQFE42XD0","A2D8L49KEYKAQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8L49KEYKAQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It looks good running through the colors or set on whatever color you like best.The tank holds 100ml, once the water runs out the unit will turn off to protect itself from damage.

" 5:57 Mins So this one is pretty slim as you can see and so it could easily be portable or even used somewhat like a flashlight if needed.Sitting on a desk or wall mounted, nice to have options. 3 levels of brightness and the addition of the nightlight makes it very handy to have around. Love that you can recharge it so it makes a great light when the power is out. With the 2200mAh battery you should get a lot of use between charges but with 3 levels or brightness and the nightlight with various levels the exact runtime is certainly varied. Imagine that your phone makes an entire day doing a lot of work so this with only these low power LED lights should operate for a significant amount of time.

" 9:03 Mins I have and really like the KOTION EACH G2000 headset and I assumed the G9000 would be an upgraded model. Someone told me though that the G9000 was a cheaper version and did not perform as well as the G2000.Figured why not find out for myself.This is how that panned out...The sound is clear and loud, bass is good. The mic works well. The size feels a little smaller around the ears so to me this set isn't as big as the G2000 which is slightly more comfortable. I detailed this in the video.I tested this headset with my Android phone, worked great for both audio playback and recording. For use with the PC I used the included adapter and it worked fine.Nice to see the seller add this information to try to avoid confusion as I see people constantly ask about using the USB and working with consoles (on my YouTube account on a headset review).Note: This headset is NOT USB-Headset, The USB interface is only used for power supply to LED light. No driver needed, Plug and play. This Headset with one 3.5mm combo headphone/microphone connector, Only suitable for PS4, mobile phones ,tablets, laptops(with 3.5mm combo headphone/microphone port).This Headset can be used for universal computer; with 3.5mm combo headphone/microphone connector you can use the mic when you plug it into mic hole OR you can use the headphone when you plug it into headphone hole.Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28VNH7XDT04TE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016QK955S#wasThisHelpful","R28VNH7XDT04TE","A2D8L49KEYKAQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8L49KEYKAQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:57 Mins Lately I have tried a few pairs of these and there is no question these are longer than the other two pairs.I like the liner inside these as the silicone itself is a little thin. I don't think this is an issue as silicone tends to be fairly durable. These are easy to clean and they state heat resistance up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. I generally use an air over and the microwave mostly so there work fine for my own needs.I really like the little mitts...I call them plate grabbers. They do well for snagging my plate from the microwave and the raised surface offers both grip and increased protection from heat.The oven mitts also work well for opening jars as it makes gripping them much easier.

Practitioners believeÂ gua shaÂ releases unhealthy elements from injured areas and stimulates blood flow and healing.I found the image was a little scary really but I like the idea of increased health and massage after so many years of medical issues so I figured why not give it a shot.I personally only use this for my face and I must say it does cause the redness somewhat like a sunburn as it is supposed to and this brings a flushed warmth to the face. Obviously this means blood flow has increased and assuming the healing is also happening I think it is pretty cool.I think this is a review that would have to be updated down the road after a prolonged period of use so I am setting a reminder for several weeks from now. Hopefully sometime in the first week of Dec I can update this review and speak about my thoughts beyond initial impressions.You can actually perform this Gua Sha technique with almost anything but it is nice to have this attractive looking jade piece and it is smooth so you won't accidently cut yourself like you might with some other item. (I've read of people using bottle caps but I'd much rather use this).Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW7PHIICIP96I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0158BE8VW#wasThisHelpful","RW7PHIICIP96I","A2D8L49KEYKAQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8L49KEYKAQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:11 Mins So I have little to say here because the video really shows the operation and the item and since my grandmother continually states how much she loves these lights I must say they are an excellent item that has an attractive look about them.The free gift is actually just as nice if not more attractive then the item itself. Both look great when illuminated and the fee gift lights when it is dark actually illuminate the walkway so they are pretty bright.Grandma is very happy so I am happy with them as well.Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DSEK98DW1ES1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016V4IOOW#wasThisHelpful","R3DSEK98DW1ES1","A2D8L49KEYKAQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8L49KEYKAQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not a lot needs to be said here, this does what I need it to do and does it well. Indicator lights show current status, no drivers, great little tool for times when out in the field.I like to clone drives occasionally or pull data from a drive when needed and this makes that a bit easier. I used to use an adapter that required me to need a power outlet and with this that is no longer a requirement. I now have the same option in a smaller and more portable format.I guess the only improvement would be if it were USB 3 and not 2 but since they are both on the market it is simply a matter of buying the right one, can't count this against the unit. I actually do own a USB 3 adapter as well but it doesn't have dual USB so occasionally it is an issue, my hopes LONG TERM are those problems won't happen anymore with this dual USB design.(I may not know if this is an issue for many months as I don't need these often and it is hit and miss when an issue occurs but I will try my best to remember to return and update if issues arise.

" 4:18 Mins I was actually more pleased than expected with the sound quality and even the amount of bass this headset offered. Almost always smaller in the ear type headsets have a lacking in the bass they offer but this set does really well and maintains clarity even with higher volume levels.They are comfortable in the ear and easy to operate. They are listed as having the option to answer and reject calls with a simple ""Yes"" or ""No"", something that is becoming more common and is a very useful feature.Battery life is average to above average with the claim of 5-6 hours of use and 150-175 hours of standby time. Charge time is around 1 and a half hours.Being designed for the athletic individual sweat and even a little rain should create no problems, personally due to medical reasons sweat isn't an issue but knowing a little rain won't hurt is nice peace of mind. The charging port is exposed though so I wouldn't get them any more wet than you have to just to be on the safe side.Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QDKUEZ77AYLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015N2CKD4#wasThisHelpful","R3QDKUEZ77AYLA","A2D8L49KEYKAQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8L49KEYKAQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:07 Mins I have so many solar lights and I like them all a great deal so when this set became available I hopped on the chance to review them.Normally in my video I show and mention the battery replacement options but this unit sadly does not allow that. Inside this unit there is a 1000mAh AA battery that is soldered in place and is non replaceable. Since I know there are times when the battery could need replacing this does take away from this unit.The lighting is attractive and water should not pose any problems, with 100 LEDs and 39 feet you will have a nice look wherever you decide to use these.

" 4:10 Mins Very quick to become useable and automatic shut off makes use this very simple.Nice that it can be used as a humidifier if you wish but as a facial steamer it is a really nice unit to have. It produces a lot of steam and as stated it does so very quickly.The product page is accurate on the runtime, it lasted nearly 10 minutes and produced a very fine mist of steam. They also speak of the UV lamp...well I saw the blue illumination which was nice but knowing the UV is also taking the water to another level of clean before it reaches my face is great.It is a very relaxing experience and combined with my other new cleaning routine I expect a very refreshing experience in my future.Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M5T25XHRWOB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XOUG2E#wasThisHelpful","R3M5T25XHRWOB7","A2D8L49KEYKAQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8L49KEYKAQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:09 Mins Typically with many scuba diving flashlights you don't really want to run them when out of the water. This light however is a LED equipped light and can be useful in and out of the water.I particularly like that the seller lists it as a 500 Lumen light. I say this because yes it is bright but many sellers list the Lumens WAY beyond what they actually are capable of and mislead customers. I also like that this light comes in a decent plastic case and provides a wrist strap as well. Having this on your wrist when diving is ideal but in other situations like working on things, a car perhaps or riding a bike you don't have a free hand so it is also useful to have it right there on your wrist.Waterproof means rain and mud and dust and such won't pose any issues and you can also dive with it if you like (up to 80ft).It seems the plastic and aluminum will be durable and it is bright in color so it should be easy to keep track of as well.The seller did well with listing information on the light, they mention the depth of 80feet, its composition, that it uses an LED and the power and runtime of the LED. (10W Runtime: high-2hours; Low-5hours ) They also mention the 3 modes if offers, High, Low, and Strobe. Beyond that they even listed the distance of illumination as beyond 650ft and a 50K hour life expectancy of the LED. I am so glad they were so detailed as often times there is so little info provided.Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27R0CQ130LOUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013N1VTXY#wasThisHelpful","R27R0CQ130LOUR","A2D8L49KEYKAQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8L49KEYKAQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:12 Mins Gold plating and stainless steel...should hold up fairly well with proper care. Of course it also has a dial window that is highly scratch resistant and a good automatic movement that should work well for a long time.The gold color is a little more yellow than I normally prefer but I can deal with it as I think overall this is a really nice looking watch.Being automatic it should continue to run for a day or two without movement but beyond that you're going to be setting it, winding it, or need to store it in an automatic winding watch case.It is my understanding that automatic watches will gain/lose time a little more than a normal style watch but I haven't observed any major issues with time loss as of yet so I am very pleased with this watch.The inclusion of a band adjustment tool is great as well as the presentation with the gift bag, envelope and such. Setting the watch is also very easily accomplished and the band operates with no difficulty.Still weird a men's watch includes a hair clip but they do this with every watch so it's apparently just the way it is with Burei.Some specs that make me like this watch in addition to the looks and no need for a battery as well as a nice ""tip"" from the seller:Water resistant to 330 feet (100 M): suitable for snorkeling, as well as swimming, but not diving.Japanese Miyota automatic movementProtective Anti-Reflective Sapphire Crystal dial windowKindly note:Â It needs no battery, but it will stop if you have been physically inactive for an extended period of time. If this happens, wind the crown 40 times clockwise to start the watch and give it some reserve power.Â Personally I no longer scuba dive but I find it odd this watch is rated down to 330 feet yet it is clearly stated it is not for diving. I don't know anyone that is swimming around and hitting 330 feet so it seems weird to specifically state this in the product description. IF this is because it lacks any diving type function I suppose it makes sense but it isn't marketed or designed as a diving watch so I just felt it was odd.Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ASZZOYJZ0HC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFTRS30#wasThisHelpful","R3ASZZOYJZ0HC0","A2D8L49KEYKAQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8L49KEYKAQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always liked coconut smells but this is in my opinion a lot more pleasant than most products with a coconut scent.I got a compliment on the look and feel of my hair while using this product (but to be fair I've always had compliments on my hair over the years). I guess that is a little odd because being a male with somewhat short hair it isn't expected.I like the results after using this in both the smell and the feel. I find it makes my hair very soft and it rinses away cleaner than some cheaper shampoo I have tried. I don't have damaged or brittle hair but it does seem like it adds some moisture and as stated it increased the soft feel.I don't know if it is worth the cost but I really look forward to using it every time...the scent alone is something I really like a great deal with the rest coming in as a bonus.Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CTQY6DY4QOLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HRLI62#wasThisHelpful","R3CTQY6DY4QOLW","A2D8L49KEYKAQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D8L49KEYKAQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 4:27 MinsI am a knitter, I learned about a year ago and picked it up very quickly and love it.  I recently have started doing patterns that require me to crochet a little, so since I'm not an avid crocheter I didn't need an elaborate set but this set is more than enough to get me going.This comes in a nice case with multiple hooks, stitch markers, plastic needles, a row/stitch counter, a stitch holder and yarn snips. Even as a knitter I use all of these things except the hooks so they're all good to have. I will say that I'm not a fan of the plastic needles because they bend easily and I think they're harder to use while weaving in ends. I also am not a fan of this type of stitch counter but if it is all you have it is way better than pen and paper. If you are a beginner these are all things you are going to want when starting out.As far as the hooks go they are comfortable but I had read other reviewers saying that the sizing is wrong so I got out my hook/needle sizer to check them and they do seem off. It is possible that I'm using my sizer wrong because I only know how to check for needle sizes but you will see in the video. I assume that crocheting like knitting has gauges so if you check your gauge (which you should) if the hook is wrong you can account for that.Because of the sizing issue and the plastic needles I would say this might be a kit that is better suited for teen or younger girls who want to learn the basics of crocheting and need a starter set. However, I also think it will suit my needs just fine considering knitting is still my preferred method.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EMK7EK0ZB1F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010LXT83K#wasThisHelpful","R2EMK7EK0ZB1F4","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:16 MinsFirst I have to say that I love the green color of this toilet bowl brush. I'm drawn to that color lately and this is nice and shiny and bright and it is great. (Sorry, I'm a designer, it's the little things.)The base of this has sort of a cat eye shape which fit in the corner of my bathroom very well and it is a unique design which I appreciate. The base comes in two parts, not 100% sure the reasoning for this but I'm inclined to say it is for easier cleaning but I could be wrong. When you put the brush in the base it looks concealed so you can't see the brush at all but there is a slight gap around the edges to keep it from mildewing.I was concerned that the black ring on the brush was going to be an issue while cleaning but it wasn't at all, it actually almost worked as a shield to keep water from splashing towards me which I appreciate. I felt like the handle on the brush could have been a little bit stronger. It had a little bit of give and I have a very old toilet so I tend to push pretty hard when I scrub it.Overall though it is nice. Unique design, great color, if the handle was a little more rigid this would easily have been 5 stars.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30MU9QMEF6SNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I20KK1E#wasThisHelpful","R30MU9QMEF6SNR","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:00 MinsI had higher hopes for this shower curtain. It is pretty and there is a little bit of shimmer in the ""pebble"" pattern so that is a plus. When you first take it out of the package there is no scent at all, usually they have an overpowering vinyl scent which takes a while to air out. It is nice that this comes with plastic shower curtain rings, I already have rings so I won't be using those but it is good to have if you're just starting out. I also am a fan of the metal grommets around the holes, this keeps the curtain from ripping. I've always liked clear shower curtains because I, like most people, do not have a light in my shower and it is quite dark in there which may be a good thing because my shower is old and disgusting. :-)The length and width on this are fantastic, there was coverage on either side of my shower and the length was longer than the curtain I had previously.Here is where the curtain falls short. It is very thin. I've had quite a few different shower curtains over the years and I thought at the price point for this product this one would have been thicker. That being said I don't see where that affects its ability to keep water out, it did a perfectly fine job of that. The biggest problem I have with this is that there are no weights or suction cups at the bottom. I mention this is the video part of this review and sure enough when we used it the shower curtain would slowly gravitate towards us which I find icky. At first it's not a big deal but shower curtains do eventually get gross and then if it touches me, eww. For now I'll probably just add a couple of pennies to the bottom to fix that but please be aware of that. If that sort of thing doesn't both you or you are planning on using this on the outside of your tub (not sure why but to each their own) then you shouldn't have an issue.Otherwise I think it's a pretty shower curtain that isn't girly or masculine and would suit a variety of decors; I just wish it was thicker and/or had something to keep it from moving around.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LY1FUEKJIDA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012A8DUVK#wasThisHelpful","R1LY1FUEKJIDA0","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:11 MinsWow! I already have a set of hiking poles or at least I thought I did because now I'm giving those to my daughter because they are nothing compared to this set.Honestly it is too cold for hiking right now so I haven't had my chance to test these out in the woods but I will update this review if I notice any issues at all with these but I don't anticipate it because these are impressive right out of the gate. For me it is important that the handles are comfortable because I do rely on my hiking poles a lot. I'm a klutz and without my poles I'm guaranteed to fall down on a hike just ask my family. Not only are the handles comfortable but the wrist straps are nice and soft as well, also a requirement.Like my other set the measurements on these are in cm and I am in the states so I'm use to inches, I don't know if that is a standard thing for hiking sticks because I only have this set and my other set to compare them to. These slide very easily and lock very tightly so I don't have to worry about them coming apart on me if they get stuck in the mud, and they will get stuck in the mud. When these are closed up they are a total of 27"" long so they will store nicely in our camper.These are both rigid and anti shock and they impressively made. I can not wait to get out and hike our local stateparks during the next camping season. My kids are getting my old hiking poles because mommy is officially hiking in style.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SPEBQ6KEMQA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016B259HY#wasThisHelpful","R1SPEBQ6KEMQA7","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will say that for the couple of days that I had this on our litter pan it worked great. Unfortunately for us our new kitten has found out how to get these off of her litter pan and destroy them. We have a round litter pan and I've never liked the way the filter fits on top and although these were slightly larger than the ones that came with the pan I could have stood for them to be about an inch longer.As for our crazy cat it doesn't matter what we do she find a way to get them. I had only used one and left the other one in the package in another room up on a cabinet and after destroying the one on her litter pan she proceeded to find the one I hadn't used and try to destroy that as well. Thankfully these are only a couple of dollars because they have essentially become a kitten chew toy that I have to take away from her before she hurts herself.If your cat is not insane like ours is and will leave these alone they do work quite well, we could not smell our stinky little furball's messes when it was on. :-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMQNR7KNC9NNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004N1T3B4#wasThisHelpful","RMQNR7KNC9NNO","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:28 MinsI'm beyond impressed with this cat activity tree. I recently got a rescued ""kitten"" for my birthday after my 16 year old cat passed away. I've had 3 cats before my current one but this one (her name is Helvetica) is by far the most spoiled and she is the first one I've gotten a cat tree for.Part of the reason that I never got one before is because I knew I wanted one in our living room but as a past Interior Designer I knew I didn't want the typical carpet covered monstrosity in my living space. I saw this PetFusion cat tree and knew it was the one for me. First thing I was drawn to was its modern design. I'm a fan of all things modern and not only does this have the clean lines of a modern piece it also has an Asian inspired feel to it and the two styles work perfectly together.When this arrived I was first surprised at how heavy it is, it weighs approximately 30 pounds and it is solid. The wood has a beautiful cherry finish that works great in my space. The fuzzy pieces are so soft that my 10 year old says she wants to live in them. :-)This was very easy to put together and it includes the hardware and the allen wrench. My daughter (again she's 10) helped me and if you're a mother you know how well kids help. The directions say that you should have two people to set this up and it would be quite difficult to do it alone but not completely impossible. Between my daughter and I we had it together in less than 10 minutes. It might have taken less time but my kitten decided to ""help"" us.Not only do you get this beautiful piece of pet furniture the company also sent along a spray bottle of catnip essential oil to spray on it. I put a couple squirts on and my cat loved it.I am absolutely impressed with the quality and design of this product. It is durable, functional and beautiful and there's not a lot of pet products you can say that about.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review but that in no way swayed the above statements, wonderful product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R296YLSOKAGDYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013060HNK#wasThisHelpful","R296YLSOKAGDYO","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:41 MinsWe have tried out quite a few quadcopters now and this one by far is the most unique and according to my husband it is very fun to use.I'm going to try my best to tell you about this product and I have included a video of it in action too. I apologize for the fact that the video isn't very clear in parts but we got this for my daughter for Christmas and she was outside playing when we filmed this. We also weren't able to get very good video from the quadcopter for the same reason but the little bit we did get was nice and clear.OK, disclaimer out of the way here's some information about this Hawkeye Quadcopter.It is smaller than other quadcopters we've tried (I have it packed away for Christmas now but I think it think it was under 5"" square)It is powerful, this is quite fastIt doesn't just fly, it drives too which is super cool.There are multiple set up options including standard quadcopter without blade guards, with blade guards, 4 small wheels or 2 large wheels (my husband said this was the funnest set-up). The large wheels make this better for beginners because the blades can't hit anything and the quadcopter is fairly protected in there. You can fly it with all these setups so even though it has wheels on it you can still fly it or switch it over and drive it.The battery on this seemed to last longer than our other quadcopters but we'll still get extras. Nothing is more frustrating than playing with your quadcopter and the battery dies and you have to wait at least a couple of hours for it charge. There is a USB battery charger cable included that turns red when it is charging.This comes with a 4GB card for filming video and a USB adaptor to get the video on your computerThe controller is (according to my husband) the best one he's used. He says it feels like a video game controller.The controller does require (4) AAA batteries which are not includedI'm sure there's more information I'm forgetting but a lot of it is in the video. Like I said this is stashed away until Christmas but if after that anything else turns up I will update this review.So far I know our daughter will be thrilled to have her own quadcopter until her dad takes it for his own. :-)I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X1BYPWQ8TVVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013F3XMDA#wasThisHelpful","R2X1BYPWQ8TVVL","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:15 MinsI did a video review for these after only quickly opening them to make sure they weren't damaged and you will hear me in the review in disbelief that these are wooden, it's hard to believe, these are soooo cool and they're super light weight.These come in a nice hard case and they also come with a pretty large microfiber cleaning cloth. When I opened up the case I was super impressed with these right off the bat.  I got these for my daughter for Christmas because she is always trying to steal my sunglasses and I'm hoping because these are made of wood they will last her a while and she won't break them.I tried these on to see how well they fit and they are very comfortable, they actually fit me perfectly. Also, because they are so light weight I couldn't barely tell they were on. The lenses on these are not polarized but they are nice and dark.Overall, just the fact that these are wood makes them cool but even if they weren't they're a very nice pair of sunglasses.

" 2:13 MinsThis bracelet is beautiful. Right from the moment it arrived I knew this would make a great gift which is good because I got it for my daughter for Christmas.This has a silver finish and I got the purple stones because I thought they were pretty in the photo and they are indeed pretty in person. This whole bracelet shines and picks up the light beautifully. I think my daughter will like this; there are times when she likes fancy things even though she's 10 but this is probably best suited for an older teen or an adult but that is really up to the person who it is intended for.The clasp on this is a standard clasp that works easily. I like that this comes with a microfiber cleaning cloth to help it keep its shine.

I love the design of the silhouette of the tree with the little bird, it is a style that will go with a lot of different decors.I got this for my daughter for Christmas. She is getting older and not as interested in toys but interested in jewelry and clothes and in an attempt at keeping her room slightly clean I thought she would like this (I have to wait a couple of months to know for sure). I know I would like it if I received this as a gift. This is made of a rigid plastic material that I prefer over metal because I know it will hold up over time. It comes in two pieces that easily snap together. There is tons of room for earrings (I'm counting 30 different pair holes), necklaces, rings, watches etc.  Overall dimensions of this at the widest points are 13.5""H x 9.25""W  and the base is 6.5"".I really hope that my daughter likes this but on the off chance that she doesn't I'm keeping it. :-)I received this discounted product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36N7EGRXTF7LC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HV3U8CY#wasThisHelpful","R36N7EGRXTF7LC","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:30 MinsI have a lot of wind chimes (I think we're close to 20 on our property now). My husband has been collecting them for as long as we have been together so I have a lot to compare this set to. This are quite lovely, I am especially pleased with the amber colored glass diamond detail on the bottom. I had no problems with these being bent or damaged in any way, I took them out of the box and hung them up without issue.I have to admit that I am spoiled because I have very expensive wind chimes that are tuned to specific notes and sound like church bells so by comparison these sound slightly tinny to me but that pretty much means that they sound like a typical wind chime in this price range. In my house the chimes themselves look black but outside they looked almost bronze so I'm not 100% sure what the finish color is on these, black or bronze they'll match everything. The longest tube on these is 14"" and thanks to their clean design they will look great with any style home.I would have no problem giving these as a gift to someone who likes wind chimes.

" 1:42 MinsI love all things vintage and this bath mat shows some of my favorite things. This is quite large 36"" x 23.5"" so you will have plenty of room to stand on when you get done showering but I actually got it to put by my back door. The main reason for this is that we have a hot tub and I wanted something soft and that could get wet for when we come in from the hot tub. We've just been using a towel and it was driving me nuts; this is perfect.The colors on this are very vivid, I'm sure my video of them does not do them justice. The rug itself is very soft to the touch and cushioned when you step on it. The back is slip resistant/water resistant. I'm debating on whether the stereo or the TV are my favorite things on here, of course I am fond of all the items on this mat and even have a few of them.I will have to see how this holds up over time. My animals love it so I'm hoping my new kitten doesn't ruin it. The only thing that I am still debating if it is a bad thing or not is when you rub the mat one way you can see the white on the other side of the print (typical of microfiber), obviously the print looks better solid but when you the white is showing it actually looks a little more vintage so I can go either way on that but I wanted to mention it.Overall, I love the subject matter and the feel of this, it is perfect for what I wanted it for.I received this discounted product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQIATU9BW9ROB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108UQO5Q#wasThisHelpful","RQIATU9BW9ROB","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:31 MinsWhile camping this summer my daughter kept commenting whenever she saw a hammock and would say how cool it would be to have one. When I was a kid I always wanted one in my room so I thought this would be the perfect Christmas present for her. She has a loft bed that we built for her years ago and while she was at school we checked it out and this is going to fit perfectly under her bed, on top of that the colors are the same colors as her bed so, go me.I can't attest to how supportive this is because I can't put this up until Christmas or it will kind of ruin the surprise because I think she would notice this in her room. However, I did take it out of the bag and take a quick video of it so that I could at least show everyone what it looks like up close. The material of this is softer than what I had anticipated by looking at it. The ropes to hold it are installed very well and look very strong. There are ropes included to hang this with and everything comes in a matching bag that I will probably stuff and sew up so that she has a matching pillow for her hammock. Basically the only thing that I am going to need to install this in her room is hooks that will hold it.I can not wait to surprise my daughter with this for Christmas. I can already picture her hanging out in her hammock reading and listening to music, honestly I'm jealous. On top of all that when summer comes we can always take it outside and hook it up or even take it camping with us. I hope she likes it. I plan I updating this review after Christmas with pictures of it installed and I will also note anything else of interest I find once it is in use.

" 2:55 MinsHow cool is this pitcher?! I love all things modern and I saw this pitcher a while ago and loved the design of it. When it arrived I was equally impressed. Even the handle reminds me of the modern hardware you see on kitchen cabinets and I would love to host a dinner party just so I could offer people drinks poured out of this.This pitcher holds approximately 5 cups of fluids (that's a little over 1 Liter). I really like the piece at the spout that keeps your ice from coming out while pouring drinks. I hate when ice plops into a freshly poured glass and makes a mess.The exterior of this pitcher does not show smudges and has a very minimal brushed quality to it. I did not see any rust on the interior like a saw another review mention so that might have been a fluke; as I matter of fact I see no blemishes at all with my pitcher.If you know anyone who loves modern design and clean simple lines this is the perfect drink pitcher for them. This would make a great gift especially for Christmas or for a new homeowner. I know I would have been thrilled to receive this as a gift.

" 2:10 MinsAwesome clock, I love the vivid green color; it in a nice contrast against my sapphire colored bathroom walls. The numbers are easy to read as are the hands since they stand out so well against the green background. The (what seems like) brushed aluminum compliments the clock color perfectly.I am a fan of modern and minimalist design and I am also a big fan of color especially in my bathroom. I'm not a morning person so I like bright colors to greet me first thing in the morning to get me in a good mood. This clock certainly falls in that category.This clock is silent, I can not hear it working at all no matter how hard I try so if you are a fan of the tick-tock of a clock this is not the one for you. It requires (1) AA battery which is not included. So far this keeps very good time and since I'm using it in bathroom that is where I need it to keep good time so I'm not late in the morning.I am curious to see how well the metal holds up in my damp bathroom but it will take years to see if that is an issue so for now I couldn't be happier with this clock; great color and a great look and does its job.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R114V86CGOVN3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01437S3KE#wasThisHelpful","R114V86CGOVN3J","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:30 MinsWhile camping this summer I realized I didn't have a sewing kit in our camper and I really needed one when my son's favorite stuffed animal needed ""surgery"" due to a small hole. Luckily I knit so I had a small needle and thread in my knitting kit but now his favorite monkey has noticeably gray stitches.  Right then I realized I needed a sewing kit in our camper.This kit will do the job. I only have a couple of issues with this but for the main part it is very nice. It is compact which is exactly what I need in our camper. The zipper on the kit is smooth. When you open it there are two needle threaders in there that feel kind of flimsy so I don't see them lasting very long which is a shame because you are going to need them to thread the needles as they have very small eyes on them. Otherwise the rest of the kit is great, there are (3) white buttons, a safety pin, small scissors, (2) pins, a seam ripper, multiple colors of thread and the thread is nice and thick and fairly easy to unwind, a measuring tape and a thimble.Ultimately this will be perfect for any mending I might need to do while camping including stuffed animal surgeries. :-)  Also, if you only do minimal sewing/mending or you know someone who is just starting out in an apartment this is a handy little kit to have or give.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JE23R7338RG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KKP2FS#wasThisHelpful","R2JE23R7338RG9","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:14 MinsThis is the second expansion pack I have been able to try out and this one was far superior to the previous pack I tried and I thought the one I previously tried was great. If you are a fan of Cards Against Humanity you know that there are a few cards that if you play them, no matter what you are going to get the judge's vote, now imagine a pack where almost all of the cards are those types of cards; this is that pack.This Guards Against Insanity set is so bad and I mean that in the best possible way. It is in fact so bad that I barely had any choices of cards to show on my review that would not instantly need to be censored. My neighbors, my husband and I played this Halloween night and could not stop laughing, we were all in a constant state of shock of what we just read and laughing uncontrollably . I also played this with my parents (my dad loves cards against humanity) and I haven't heard my parents laugh that hard in a very long time.If you have a wonderfully horrible sense of humor and you are not easily offended or better yet if you almost never offended you are going to love this expansion pack. Everyone who has played this with me has commented on how great it is. I look forward to future editions from this company.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review but that in no way swayed the above statements, hilarious!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E3XVL9IVODOQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAWF9A0#wasThisHelpful","R3E3XVL9IVODOQ","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:46 MinsThis is a very handy cable case that has a ton of pockets, right when you think there couldn't possibly be any more pockets, boom, there's another pocket.We got this to put in our camper because we noticed we have a lot of electrical devices in our camper and they all have cords and this is compact enough to hold them all and keep us organized. The fact that this is yellow is also great because it is harder to lose in the mess that becomes our camper after a few days. I will say that some of the pockets are kind of tight and I'm not sure what we will be able to put in them but I'm sure we'll find something.I have included a video of this so that you can see all the different pockets in it and get an idea of everything that it can hold. I know personally this organization will last about a week before everyone just starts randomly throwing stuff in it and zipping it up, but hey it's worth a shot. :-)Overall, if you like to be organized you can't get much more organized than putting all of your stuff in this handy, pocket filled case.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I8461K488H43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGGXA7M#wasThisHelpful","R1I8461K488H43","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:42 MinsI loved the look of this credit card/ business card holder right off the bat. This is clean lined and classic and great for any gender, it even has a vintage feel that I am fond of. I got the black case and I got it for my husband. He has always carried around a ridiculously large wallet (it's my fault, I got it for him as a gift one year). He got into the habit of carrying a lot of stuff in it and when it started to fall apart we couldn't find another ridiculously large wallet so he had to down size. Now we keeps a case in his backpack or vehicle and then the most important stuff in his wallet. Go figure. I thought that the double wallets was overkill and he should at least have something nice to keep those cards in other than an old wallet especially since all he needs are the card holders on the oversized wallet.I know that this is sold as a credit card case but this has 24 slots so it could easily be used just for photos or for business cards (which is what I would use it for) or anything else that you would need to carry with you that you don't want to take up a ton of room. This is approximately 4"" x 3"" so it is not much bigger than a business card. There are two snaps on it so that it can extend if you have a lot of stuff in it.Overall this seems very well made and I really like the quality of this. I think it would make a great gift.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33QY2EUERM0B6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XX87GPI#wasThisHelpful","R33QY2EUERM0B6","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:57 MinsThis is a very nice leather portfolio (padfolio) that only has a couple of minor issues.I love the contrasting details on this. it is classy yet the contrast implies a bit of sophistication. As much as I like the metal detail on the front I can see where it will be an issue if you're a perfectionist because it does smudge very easily.The zipper on this is nice and smooth and there are plenty of pockets to hold business cards, ID, brochures, even a tablet. There is also a spot for a pen or two (word of advice, always carry at least 2 pens). There is a built in calculator that can come out but I'm worried that over time this will come out whether you want it to or not but I could be wrong. This also includes a lined note pad to get you started that can easily be replaced once you use all the paper in it.When I was an Interior Designer (before kid number 2) I used my portfolio for every business meeting and if I didn't have it with me I was lost. This would make a great gift for anyone starting their own business or just getting out of college or high school or in my case for my husband who is a graphic/web designer who occasionally needs to meet with clients in person.No matter what this is a professional case that will make you feel proud every time you take it out to use it.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JRP6K878610Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV6C966#wasThisHelpful","R1JRP6K878610Q","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:21 MinsI got these for my mom; she has a small mom and pop shop and she recently got an iPad air 2 to run their credit card purchased on and so she needed a stylus. She was going to buy some of these at the local office supply store for twice the price and I told to wait and I would look online.I tested these on my iPad 2 and had no issues with the stylus working. The stylus itself is a little squishy so I don't know if that is a problem because I honestly don't use them that often but I figured I would mention it just in case.These come in great colors that are perfect for my mom's store because she has a ton of stuff so if it blends in consider it lost.The best thing about these is that they aren't just a stylus, they are a pen too and not just a pen, they're a really nice pen. I took one out and went to test it thinking that I would have to scribble a little before it would work and it worked smoothly right out of the gate. (These are black ink in case you're wondering).I have no complaints with this product but I have yet to get them to my mom to see how she feels. If she feels any differently about them I will update this review.I received this discounted product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2228JSMUPCTT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAH2R9G#wasThisHelpful","R2228JSMUPCTT2","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:52 MinsI really had high hopes for the headphones. My husband recently started going to the gym again and wanted a set of headphones that he could use while working out, these seemed like a good option.First the sound quality is good so that is not an issue. What is an issue is that no matter what we did neither of us could get these to stay in our ears. We changed the earbuds and tried the different sizes (my husband more than me because they are his but since I'm writing the review I tested them as well). As an added perturbation not only would they not stay in in general but because of the volume control being on the cord it weighed them down just enough to make things worse. The company added a clip to try to help keep them up but that made little difference and now you have headphones weirdly clipped to your shirt.It really is a shame these didn't work for what we needed; maybe we aren't earbud people. I know that I personally have very small ears but my husband does not so I thought he had a chance. I will say that they synced easily so that is a plus.If you like earbuds these may be the headphones for you but for us they didn't work out for either of us despite multiple attempts.I received this discounted product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WY0MEOF9JCP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PLMN77K#wasThisHelpful","R2WY0MEOF9JCP1","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:46 MinsWe have an had an Ibaby monitor since my son was born (almost 4 years now) and I have to say that this camera is a million times better than that monitor and I believe it is less expensive as well.I will admit that my husband is the one who wanted this and is the one who set this up so I had him help me with the video part of the review where we explain basic setup information as well as show you the picture on our computer and our phone.When we first got the Ibaby monitor we couldn't use it on Android which is a pain because I use droid and my husband has an Iphone but this one works on both; you just have to download the app and register it. Once registered you can move the camera with your phone (or desktop) and you can even adjust the picture as far as brightness and contrast, etc. The picture on this is fantastic, it is much better than our Ibaby. You can also add multiple cameras to the app so if you have them in different rooms you can look at them all from 1 screen. The best thing about this camera is that it has a two way intercom, I wish that our Ibaby had this. I remember nights when my son would wake up in the middle of the night or was misbehaving before going to sleep and I wish I had had the ability to tell him either it would be ok or to quit being bad and go to sleep and you can do that with this camera.You can take snapshots and video with this. This is where my only complaint comes in, the photos are uploaded to a cloud and from what we can tell those photos are eventually wiped out but we checked the ip address of the cloud and it is somewhere in Florida (we are in NY). May not seem like a big deal at first but this has an option on it to take a picture when it senses motion and let's say that you are walking around in your underwear or less; you're going to want to know where those photos are. :-)Otherwise we are more than thrilled with this camera. This is the perfect gift for any new parent or if you have a pet you want to keep an eye on or whatever else you can think of.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHGR3MJFFVPO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HZTTXI#wasThisHelpful","RHGR3MJFFVPO8","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received 2 different shampoos and conditioners from luseta; the coconut and the argan, I like this set a lot better than the other. I have been using a different coconut shampoo and conditioner for a while now and I didn't realize there would be such a difference.First thing you notice is the smell, if you like the smell of coconut you're going to love this. Also, the smell lasts most of the day unlike my other shampoo.The bottles themselves are easy to pump and make it much easier to wash your hairThey are sulfate free; this is very important to me because I have a sulfate allergy and I know immediately if there is sulfate in my shampoo. The first sign that this is sulfate free is that there is no lather to the shampoo, the second sign for me is that I don't have a reaction to it. :-)This is a lightweight shampoo/conditioner set. I have  a lot of hair and some shampoos/conditioners weigh my hair down; I've noticed a major difference with this set.I thought my hair felt softer with this set than the argan set but that could just be me.Overall, I'm pleased with this product, it smells good, my hair looks good, and it's sulfate free, what's not to love?!I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R952T0X9DR9PY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HRLI62#wasThisHelpful","R952T0X9DR9PY","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:41 MinsUpdate: I just realized in the video part of this review I referred to these as a bracelet, I obviously know these are headbands but if you want to wear them as a bracelet don't let anyone tell you you can't. :-) Sorry, my mommy brain gets the best of me some days. :-)I absolutely love the color way of the orange/yellow/blue headband in this set; I'm also fond of the pink one but I am a huge fan of the other color combination so it is an easy win; besides my daughter went ahead and took the pink one anyway.My daughter and I have been trying out these headbands for a few days now. There is one complaint that we both have that is both a good and a bad thing. When you first put these on they slip up on the back of your head about 1"" or so. After the initial slip they stay put all day long. I both like and dislike this. I have fairly short hair so when I used these while running and while in my hot tub the fact that they slipped and kept my hair off the back of my neck was a good thing but if I wanted to wear them out in public it wouldn't look too hot. If I had long hair it wouldn't be an issue at all.These are woven (obviously) and approximately 1/2"" wide.  There is a grippy finish on the inside to help keep them from slipping. Where the ends meet is finished in black which provides a nice contrast.Overall they will work well for a variety of ages especially if you're a fan of that late 70's early 80's look.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VOMKFJSW36DE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014FCAU2G#wasThisHelpful","R1VOMKFJSW36DE","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Because it is so light weight you could really wear this any time of year and be comfortable. There are so many outfits I can see my daughter wearing this with, I am confident it will be worn a lot.This would be a great gift for anyone who loves music.

" 3:05 MinsThis towel is way nicer than I had expected. When I first read that it was a waffle towel I immediately thought of my dishtowels that are like that and didn't anticipate it being as soft as it is. If you don't have experience with waffle towels they are very absorbent and this one is no exception and that is just the beginning.Whoever thought of the design of this towel was a genius. I admit that I don't get to go to the gym anymore since kid number 2 but I do hit my treadmill at least 3 days a week. I used this today for my run and it was great but then I realized all the benefits of this towel I could have used when I did go to the gym. There is a zippered pouch on this which is perfect if you only bring your keys into the gym with you; no more looking for an empty locker to put your keys in. If you have this towel you can throw your keys in it and keep them with you while you're working out. You can also throw your headphones and phone into it when you're on the way to the gym.The genius doesn't end there though. Thanks to the strap on the front of this you can take one side of the towel and pull it through and you now can keep it around your neck and not worry about it coming off or if you're like me working out at home you can hook it on the arm of your treadmill so that your new kitten doesn't pull it off. :-)This is the perfect gym towel, it is almost the swiss army knife of towels.

"My Dyson DC35 had been acting up, it would stop and start when I would push the button and it was getting very frustrating. After doing some research I found out it could be one of two things, the battery contacts might need to be cleaned or the filter might be having issues.I know that I have been bad about cleaning my filter in my dyson because when I clean it I have to wait at least 2 days before I can use it again and I have 2 dogs, a cat and 2 kids, I can't be without my vacuum for 2 days. So, when I took my filter out I knew that was the reason my vacuum wasn't working right. I tried rinsing it but, again it took 2 days and it smelled really bad. I knew it was time to get a new filter.This filter is obviously less expensive than the replacement from Dyson. It seems to be a little thinner but that might be because my original one is obviously gross.  This fit in my vacuum perfectly and helped a ton. My vacuum does still start and stop but not anywhere near as much as it did before so next I will try to clean the connections.I have not tried to rinse this yet to see if it dries quicker but if there are issues I will update this review. For now I'm very happy with this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YP2IV5S1M8DK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUXP4XC#wasThisHelpful","R2YP2IV5S1M8DK","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:03 MinsAs far as the design goes on this bento box it is adorable. My daughter takes her lunch to school occasionally and between her and my husband we were going through a lot of sandwich bags. She saw this box and really liked it so I figured I would give it a try.This is quite small, I included dimensions on the video review for it. If you're wondering if it can fit a sandwich (I hadn't tested that out yet on the video) it can but with italian bread which is slightly smaller than ranch or king bread but since that is what we buy it works out well. My daughter was able to put her turkey sandwich in the bottom. some popcorn in one of the top compartments and since she packed her own lunch I don't know what she put on the other side; I only know about the popcorn because she left the bag out and opened on the counter.My biggest complaint about this lunch box (other than it could have been slightly bigger) is that there is an elastic strap to hold it shut. This would not be a huge deal but it takes away from the super cute design and as soon as my daughter loses that (it's only a matter of time) we will have to resort to a rubber band.Otherwise this is super cute and my daughter is over the moon about it so I suppose that is what really matters.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12O96J96V6Q5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FXR1PA#wasThisHelpful","R12O96J96V6Q5","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:17 MinsI am by no means a professional when it comes to headphones, I know what I like and what I don't like. I don't use my headphones all the time just when I'm working out or when my son is sleeping and I'm cleaning the house and want to listen to music. These are examples of the few times that I get to listen to the music I like to listen to so I want it to sound good.There are definitely no issues with bass with these headphones.  The volume goes much louder than I would every need it to and the sound quality is fantastic. There is also no issue with comfort, these are cushioned and cushioned some more and then a little more. The graphics are stunning, they are bright and colorful and happy just like me. :-)These adjust so much that they fit my husband's giant head and my little head and my daughter's medium sized head. The earpieces completely cover my ears but my ears are tiny so I don't know if it is like that for everyone. They are 3.5""H x 2.75""W.My one complaint about these is that you can't change tracks in all apps. For example I was listening to Pandora which is my preferred music listening app and you can not skip tracks with these. I tried it with Itunes and it worked fine. This is the reason I went with 4 stars instead of 5 because this is kind of a big deal for me.I have included a video of how to sync these. That is the biggest issue for me with most products, if it is easy to sync or not because once it is synced the rest can be figured out easily enough. Syncing this is super easy. The only thing that confused me a little bit was that the device is called, ""A"". Once I figured that out I was able to sync it to my Ipad and my computer easily.These come with a ton of cords because they do so much. They come with a basic audio cable so you can use them without bluetooth, the charging cable to actually charge the headphones (they come fully charged by the way), an audio cable with a smart remote and mic so you can control the music/phone calls from the cable, and a Y audio cable so you can hook another set of headphones to these headphones.My daughter has decided that these are hers now so at least I got to try them out long enough to review them. If any issues arise I will try my best to update this review but for now as with my other bluedio headphones I'm impressed and these are way better than my previous pair.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MQTJG4J0C566/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FYHJNS#wasThisHelpful","R3MQTJG4J0C566","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this 5 pack of batteries for my Syma X5C Quadcopter that only came with one battery. This was one of those investments you really need to make if you enjoy flying  quadcopter but want to do so more than 5 minutes at a time and having to wait an hour between charges! What I really like about this 5 pack is that it came with a usb charger that allows you to hook up all five batteries to be charged at once. Charging time seems to be about the same as if it were just one, maybe it is slightly longer I did not diligently keep track of the charging time. What I did notice is that these batteries last a few minutes longer than the battery that came with my quadcopter. My only beef with them is that they are slightly thicker than the original battery which makes for a tight fit but they do fit and as far as I can tell work very well! It is nice to get out the quad and fly it around knowing you have a good 25 - 30 minutes of flight before you have to recharge all of the batteries. This is especially important when you are first learning to fly one because minutes of practice and than 1 hour of downtime between your next flight makes practicing suck. These batteries were a good investment for extending my play time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q50J4W7AFB57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X27CVGY#wasThisHelpful","R2Q50J4W7AFB57","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this 4 pound container of chlorine tablets for my hot tub sanitation needs. They work very well and dissolve very slowly, which makes the sanitation maintenance less of a burden than having to through in the granular chlorine several times a week vs once or twice a week. For that reason alone these are a great value. One tip though is to avoid opening the container and taking a whiff as it will not be a pleasant experience for you!Of course it depends on the type of hot tub you have if you can use these tabs without a basket to hold them in so be aware of that. The best thing about using this method is if you are going on vacation for a week you don't have to worry about anyone coming over to take care of your hot tub for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F2G91RFHAHAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HZRF92#wasThisHelpful","R2F2G91RFHAHAQ","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these replacement blades for my callus shaver that only came with one blade. The blades seem to be a better quality blade than the one generic blade that came with the shaver I previously purchased. There are several in each small box and are also wrapped in a safety wrapper so you don't cut yourself when trying to retrieve one out of the box for use. The one blade that came with my shaver became dull very quickly and that is not the case with these replacement blades. They are VERY sharp and shaved the callus on my feet with ease and they did not get dull as quickly. They have a blade on both ends so when one side does get dull you can flip it around and have a nice new sharp blade again. These blades will last me a long time and are a great quality product for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YGUYK45513UM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BL6JM6#wasThisHelpful","R1YGUYK45513UM","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this license plate bracket because I recently purchased my truck in a nearby state that does not require a front license plate so it did not have a bracket on it when I bought it. The Ford F150 has small slits right under the bumper that this bracket clips to and than conforms perfectly to the bumper and snaps right into place nice and solid. It was literally one of the easiest installs I have ever experienced, as it took me less than a minute to install! Although I will mention that this bracket does not come with the screws needed to actually mount the license plate to the bracket so just be aware of that. I personally think the price for this was a bit on the high end, but that is to be expected for genuine ford parts I suppose? Over all this is exactly what you need if you own a Ford F150 and need to mount a license plate on the front of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R284FFCBVJ0Q7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003L7JSY8#wasThisHelpful","R284FFCBVJ0Q7J","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently purchased a new truck and the tow package on it was slightly further away from my trailer hook up than my old truck.This resulted in my old safety chains being too short and not reaching the hook ups on my truck. These were slightly longer and actually have a better weight rating than my old ones. Also, the hooks are very good quality, as are the chains. What I really like is that the hooks are fastened to the chains with pins which means If I ever find myself in this same situation again I will only need to replace the chains and not the hooks. The hooks also have a latch on them which is required in the state I live in and is just a better peace of mind than hooking on a chains that could possibly detach. These safety chains were a good find and well worth the investment!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I81VPTH8QEKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSNW6V4#wasThisHelpful","R1I81VPTH8QEKO","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this filter replacement for our Nordic Hot Tub and am glad I did because I shopped around at my local hot tub and pool shops and they want the exact same filter for twice the cost, so buying this online at half the cost is a no brainer. It was a perfect fit and I really did not realize how badly I needed to replace my filter until I put this one in and my water became crystal clear in less than 24 hours! My old filter was coming up on a year of usage with several cleanings within that time period and it was a PRB25 which means it has 25 foot of filtering material and this one is a PRB50 which means it has 50 foot of filtering material. It will be interesting to see how easy it will be to clean because there are twice as many folds in it, but I don't think it will be a problem because I always let my filters soak for 15 minutes in Muriatic acid which does all the hard work for me and then 15 minutes in a baking soda solution to neutralize the acid. Followed up with a thorough rinse with a hose which works WAY better than any of those milder filter cleaning chemicals out there. So, time will tell on the cleaning of it and I will update this review if there should be any problems in that area. Overall if your on the fence about going with the PRB25 or the PRB50, in my opinion spend a few extra bucks for the extra filtering.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AOBLA54M6ZN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034KBBQ0#wasThisHelpful","R1AOBLA54M6ZN3","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:55 MinsLove this bento box. My husband takes his lunch to work with him regularly and we were going through sandwich bags like crazy so I thought there had to be a better way. That is when I found this bento box. First I have to say that I love the simplicity of the design for this lunch box, it is perfect for any age and any gender. I got the black color because my husband wasn't home when I ordered it and I wasn't sure what he would want so I played it safe but this does come in a bunch of great colors.This is a nice large box too. It will easily fit a sandwich and have multiple compartments for other things. This is great because my husband is not a small guy and so he brings a decent size lunch, he also brings healthy snacks to eat throughout the day so he can but those in here too. This also includes a little spoon and fork that have their own compartments.This bento box seals up tightly and snaps shut, no added straps or hooks needed. There is not leaking either which is great.So far I can see this saving us money in baggies, and anything that makes packing lunch easier saves us money because it has to be quicker and easier than buying lunch to make it worthwhile. Best of all my husband was pretty impressed with this and seemed pleased with the idea so that is a huge plus.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RORE375VP11KC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0132LVW0A#wasThisHelpful","RORE375VP11KC","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:29 MinsThese solar fairy lights are super cool. I got the blue color ones but I had a really hard time deciding on which color I wanted. I like the fact that they kind of remind me of the old vintage bubble lights but with a modern twist.The bulbs have a plastic or acrylic drop shape around them that look like it has bubbles in it. They are 3"" long and really quite beautiful. I also really like the fact that these are solar. My husband and I are one of those families that likes to add to our Christmas lights every year in the hopes that some day we have the house on National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. We even decorate our dog house and these lights are perfect for that because we won't have to run an extension cord out to it and they aren't super huge so the suit the size of a dog house. Of course they might end up on something in the front yard instead because they are almost too cool to hide in the back yard. :-)If I have any issues with these once winter hits I will update my review but so far I'm super impressed and can't wait to decorate with these.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JL5ZWMAEVC0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010SSD7DU#wasThisHelpful","R2JL5ZWMAEVC0Z","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:37 MinsI love these little fairy lights. This is the second set I've received and I remember when I got the first set I thought, ""what am I going to do with these?"". Turns out there are tons of neat things you can do with these. The last set we used on my daughter's bed. She has a loft bed that we built her a few years ago and it has a rock climbing wall on it and a bunch of other cool elements. We wrapped the lights around the foot and hand pegs for the rock climbing wall and they left off a surprising amount of light that is not overly bright so it works great as a night light for her.These lights are very tiny. They almost look like someone dropped bits of hot glue on some wire and somehow lit them up. These are great for little Christmas trees. That is probably what I'm going to use this set for. My kids have little Christmas trees for their rooms and Santa leaves a little present under them and so I'm thinking this set is going to decorate one of those trees; that is unless I come up with something else to use it for before that. :-)My only complaint about these lights (and it could be a good or bad thing depending on what you are using them for) is that the cord to plug them in isn't very long (under 2') but if you are using these for a little Christmas tree that is a great length.The possibilities are endless for these lights, it's just a matter of using your imagination.I received this complimentary product for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I38ZJ2B77Z1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010SDVJD0#wasThisHelpful","R2I38ZJ2B77Z1N","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:58 MinsI got these for my husband because he says if we were rich he would have a different pair of socks to wear every day (it's the little things I suppose). He wears a size 13 shoe and he said they fit him fine but the cut was lower than he likes. Good news is, his loss is my gain because I love these socks.First they come in 3 colors. It's not that you are going to see them when your shoes are on but it's still nice to have different colors. There is a nice attention to detail on these socks. The stitching around the arch area adds a little extra support. I also really like the color details on the bottom.I appreciate the fact that these just follow the line of my sneakers so they're barely visible. I have a tattoo that goes down my leg and onto my foot and most socks cover part of it up but these socks don't. Also these are nice thickness, they're not overly thin where my toe is going to go through them after wearing them a couple of times but they're also not so thick that they're not breathable. I wore them while doing my couch 2 5k the other day and my feet weren't all sweaty and I wore them all day today and they are quite comfortable.If you like a low profile sock and especially one that supports your arch a little I think these are a great option.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NLKC0NKPQ1DK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CKH36Y#wasThisHelpful","R1NLKC0NKPQ1DK","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's not a lot you can say about vegetable/ fruit cleaning brushes. If they work they work and these work. The bristles are soft enough to clean a tomato without damaging the skin but strong enough to clean a sweet potato and get in all the creases. They remind me of the bristles they use on baby brushes.Nothing drives me more nuts that when my potatoes aren't clean and you can taste the little bits of grit, yuk. These solve that problem, no more dirty potatoes for us.The other thing that is nice about these is that they have a plastic cover. When I'm not using items like this they all end up in a bowl next to my sink. This bowl includes my metal scrubbers and other dish cleaning items so having a cover on these makes me feel better.I can see these getting used a lot.

"I play cards against humanity a lot, it is my dad's favorite game, he insists that I bring it to every family function. It has gotten to the point that we needed an expansion pack because we kept getting the same cards over and over, my dad even volunteered to pay for an expansion pack, that's how much he loves it. :-)My version of cards against humanity is the downloaded for free version that we printed. In case you didn't know this you can download the original game for free and then pay for expansion packs. Because we printed ours ourselves I don't know how the texture and feel of these cards compare to to the original game. I also don't know why you would need the original game to play these expansion packs other than needing the basic game instructions.All that being said, some of these cards are way crazier than the original game. I pulled out a few from each deck that I liked the most that I can post here without having to worry about the age of the person reading this review.Pack 1:Black card favorites:  *What gave me unforgiving, ever lasting, flaming diarrhea?  *When listening to a Creed album, I feel like, __________.White card favorites:  *Slamming a live fish on the counter and calling it dinner  *Elton John's wardrobe  *Getting really concerned about global warming for a few seconds.Pack 2:Black Card Favorites:  *The only thing worse than ____________ is _____________.  *The greatest lie ever told was ______________.  *What did I do that caused my parents to beat me as a child?White Card Favorites:  *Walking into the wrong delivery room  *Keeping the pimp hand strongPack 3:Favorite Black Cards:  *I like my coffee like I like my women: strong and ____________.  *Now is my time: I'm young, dumb and full of _____________.  *___________ is the leading cause for blindness in white males.Favorite White Card:  *Ordering dessert after calling off a wedding engagementPack 4:Favorite Black Cards:  *In my day, __________ only cost a nickel.  *What's in the back of my white paneled van?  *Eat your ________ child.Favorite White Cards:  *Ricky Bobby  *Asparagus Urine  *Propane and Propane accessories  *Desperate Tinder DatesObviously these are PG examples of some of the cards, there are a lot of cards in the deck that I could not believe what I was reading but that is why the original game is a, ""game for horrible people"" and I think some of these are that 10 fold.It is hard to say which of these packs is my favorite that is why getting all 4 is probably a good idea so that you can mix and match them and create an awesome deck. Some of the decks had more black cards that I liked and some had more white ones that I liked. I would have to say that if I had to pick two decks that are my favorite it would be packs 1 & 4.I can not wait to go home again and play this with my family.

" 7:25 MinsNot only were these running boards easy to install (partly because the instructions were clear and easy to follow) but after we installed them our truck looks great.Basic tools you need for install:A socket set, (I believe we ended up using 13, 14 and 16mm sockets),a socket extender, a wrench and a headlamp and safety glasses don't hurt. So, since those are the only tools you need you can guess that there isn't a ton to the install of these.I have added step by step instruction to my video review as well as images of the finished product. The first side took us a little while because we were filming and learning what we were doing right and what we are doing wrong (I put a couple tips in the video). Also, there's the fact that we had a neighbor who decided to use his chainsaw while we were filming so we were trying to film in between cutting breaks.  The second side took maybe 1/2 hour to install.These seem very strong. My husband is not a small guy, I'm not a small girl for that matter, and these easily support us. I like that the tops have a tread on them to step on, we live in New York so things get awfully slippery in the winter. I also like that these are pretty low profile, they don't take away from the look of our truck (2007 Ford F150).Overall we are very happy with the install of these running boards and how they turned out. We're also very happy with the fact that we no longer have to get a running start to get into our truck.For some reason videos are not uploading right now so for now you can see the video part of this review on youtube: https://youtu.be/XfYB81f2dgcI received this discounted product for my honest and unbiased review but that in no way swayed the above statements.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R6474ELA7R46/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015K2DK4U#wasThisHelpful","R2R6474ELA7R46","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:35 MinsFirst let me say right off the bat I love the design of this. I'm a fan of modern, clean lined design and that is exactly what this is. This pet feeding station almost looks futuristic. It is raised up just the right amount too. Since I have a Jack Russell who is 17 pounds and a Jack in the Box (jack russell boxer) who is 60# pounds and all legs I need their dishes to be accommodating to both of them.The body of this is plastic but it feels like a very durable plastic, there is no give or bending to it from what I can tell. It is also high gloss, it's so high gloss that you can see my reflection in the video I did for this review.My only complaint is that I could handle the bowls being slightly deeper. Because my one dog is so big she will probably eat both bowls in one sitting but that is actually a good thing because if the food sits out I noticed that some how ants are getting to it and then I have to throw the food out and waste it. Also, if your pet has a weight problem this would work out well for you too.  The other time this would be good is when we are camping, we don't like to put too much food and water out in our camper because inevitably someone is going to knock it over (most likely my 3 year old).  Even though these are all benefits to a smaller bowl I still could have handled them deeper.Overall, I love the design of this and the fact that you can take the bowls out individually and wash them if needed unlike your typical double  bowl feeding stations. Plus, it looks awesome in my kitchen. :-)I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LP2NPQILA60S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015P3T2PA#wasThisHelpful","R3LP2NPQILA60S","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:43 MinsI first heard about pet fountains when I was at the vet's office one day. I have been a cat owner for years and my 16 year old cat recently passed away so when my husband surprised me with a kitten for my birthday I wanted to make sure I kept her as healthy as I could so she would have a nice long life. Part of that is owning a pet fountain.I had heard that your cat will be drawn more to the fountain and be more apt to drink from it because they can see it better, they like the falling water, etc. It is important for your pets to stay hydrated and just like humans they are more likely to do that if their water is fresh. Think about it, would you rather drink fresh from the water cooler water or water that has just been sitting in a glass for who knows how long. Also, because this circulates the water you don't have to fill the water bowl as often which is nice if you're busy like most people are.This was fairly easy to set up; it includes step by step instructions with pictures. Basically you take the top of the unit and flip it upside down, put the pump in and then turn the support bar so that the pump stays put. Next you take the filter (which is included and there are two extra filter pads included as well) and you rinse it off with tap water then slide it in its slot. You put the top on and fill it with water and plug it in with the cord that is included (the cord is quite long).The only thing that was a little confusing to me was the words for the min/max water lines are on the inside bottom of the bowl but the actual lines are on the side so that took me a minute. Otherwise setup for this is pretty cut and dry.This is incredibly quiet. I took a video of it because as soon as we filled it up and put it on the floor our new kitten, Helvetica, (she's 4 months) came running right over to it to check it out and was drinking from it at every possible angle; it was quite cute. I guess that this is so mesmerizing that even my 3 year old son decided he needed to drink from it when no one was looking. :-)Overall my kitten seems to really like this and it seems like she is indeed drinking more. My dogs on the other hand couldn't care less they still seem to drink the same amount but they're older and stubborn. :-)If you're wondering how big this is it is approximately: 11"" x 11"" the tallest part is 6""H but the bowl is 3""H. Those are by no means exact measurements because it was hard to measure this since it is currently full of water.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU1H71L7655EF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M2ST1DU#wasThisHelpful","RU1H71L7655EF","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My kids have little Christmas trees for their rooms and Santa leaves a little present under them and so I'm thinking this set is going to decorate one of those trees; that is unless I come up with something else to use it for before that. :-)My only complaint about these lights (and it could be a good or bad thing depending on what you are using them for) is that the cord to plug them in isn't very long (under 2') but if you are using these for a little Christmas tree that is a great length.The possibilities are endless for these lights, it's just a matter of using your imagination.I received this complimentary product for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R248683PCOQA75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDFMQ8M#wasThisHelpful","R248683PCOQA75","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:56 MinsThis is a very well made, beautiful pillow cover. This is so well made and the zipper is so hidden that when I went to do my video review I couldn't find the zipper at first. :-)I love the colors in this pillow. You wouldn't think it but the blue and the golden color are neutrals so really other than the red (that will go with a ton of different colors) this pillow will go with a lot of different decors. I paired mine with a striped pillow from puredown that I also love.I will say if you have pets keep them away from this pillow, my dog's claw got caught on one spot and it pulled a line out. That being said my dogs have done much worse damage to lesser pillows so one line out is not that big of a deal to me. Keep in mind that this is the case only so you will need an insert or what I have done in the past is put my old pillows in these when they start to look worn and then you can change your pillows up and make your space look new again.Even my video for this pillow does not do it justice, this is gorgeous in person.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30KM8H95ZLBCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDPVHUU#wasThisHelpful","R30KM8H95ZLBCJ","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:58 MinsI got this for my daughter and she loved it so much she decided she had to pack her lunch the next day despite the fact that they were serving one of her favorite lunches. I have to agree with her that as soon as it arrived I loved the pattern on this lunch bag. I thought at first that it was going to be like another lunch bag that we have that do not close properly or just have Velcro to hold them shut but it actually has a zipper to keep it closed which is good because the ones that use Velcro are stupid to me; they're never going to be able to keep anything cold.When this arrives it arrives flat so at first you think, ""there is no way this is going to hold anything"" but then you unfold it and realize that it is actually quite large. My daughter put a sandwich, 2 capri suns, 2 fruit snack (she brings a fruit snack and a capri sun for snack everyday) a yogurt (one of the square ones that you dump the stuff on the side into the yogurt) and 2 stick ice packs. She left around 8:30 and her lunch isn't until after 12:30 and she said everything was still nice and cold. She said she even had friends ask her where she got it.Like I said my daughter (by the way she's 10) really likes this.

"I have pretty large legs and so like most of the reviews I read if you have bigger legs you are going to have one stretched out tardis. I was able to get these on no problem and they stayed up without issue so if they didn't have a tardis on them they would have been perfect for me but then again they wouldn't be doctor who related and would be just striped socks which are not nearly as cool.All that being said as far as socks go these are super comfortable and a perfect medium sock (not too thick not too thin). However, if you are not the proud owner of teeny tiny legs you're going to end up with a tardis that looks big on the outside which all doctor who fans know, it's only supposed to look big on the inside.It's a shame that these stretch the way they do because I really like the colors and the design. Oh well, I'm crafty, I'll find some way to make them work and until I come up with something at least I have doctor who socks stretched out tardis or not. :-)I received this discounted product for my honest and unbiased review","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N3YAF1PS1TE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2UOMDE#wasThisHelpful","R1N3YAF1PS1TE4","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This dog collar is beyond cute!  I ordered the small and I wasn't sure exactly if it would fit my dog but it fit him perfect right out of the package. He is a Jack Russell and I love the way this looks on him. I know Christmas is a ways away but, confession, he's wearing it right now and I have no interest in taking it off of him. :-)The reindeer on the pattern are very small and at first you don't realize they are reindeer but I really like the pattern of this collar, it's possible that I have sweater with a similar pattern but that is neither here nor there and no I am not a crazy dog lady it's mere coincidence.The buckle on this is hard plastic and snaps together tightly and I don't foresee having any problems with it holding my back my tiny little ball of fur covered muscle. If you are familiar with Jack Russells you know that they are very strong for their size so you need a durable collar. This adjusts quite a bit, I think the description says about 4"" and I would say that is dead on. At it's smallest it fits my russell (he's 14 so his neck isn't as big as it used to be) and then goes up 4 more inches so it seems like it would fit a lot of medium sized dogs.I just love to see my little guy with his bow tie. I tried to get some good pictures of it on him but he was being a stinker, then again he's a russell so I expect no less from him.If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment and I'll try my best to answer them but for now if you're considering this collar for the Holidays do it. I can't wait to get a picture of my pup in front of the Christmas tree wearing this.I received this discounted product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I01BFSM8UIBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010ES3GR6#wasThisHelpful","R1I01BFSM8UIBS","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:23 MinsThese tags are great! I'm a knitter and I have started knitting things to sell at craft fairs and I was trying to figure out how I wanted to add price tags. I didn't want just stickers or something that was going to take away from my products. What I love about these tags is that because they are ""paper"" the fit with the handmade products that I make; especially when you add the fact that they come with twine to attach them. They have the holes already scored and you just have to pop them out and add your string and you're all set.Of course these are no good if you can't write on them so I tried them out with a standard ballpoint pen and had no issues, they were nice and smooth to write on.

" 2:53 MinsThis is a very well made vintage designed briefcase. The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel like it could be a little bigger. I suppose it really depends on your profession and what you intend to use this for as to whether or not you think it might be big enough. I got this for my mother who I'm pretty sure carries everything she owns in her briefcase. This is perfect if you're just planning on bringing a tablet or possibly a small laptop and a some basic office products so I could see why it would work for a lot of people. Even when I was working as a designer I know this wouldn't have worked for me because I always needed to bring fan decks (paint samples) and tape measures and notebooks and client folders and I know it would have been a tight fit.All that being said this is very well constructed and I love the simplicity of the design of this product. The brass hardware against the reddish-brown leather is a nice compliment. The leather is smooth and shiny and will hold up well even if you get stuck in the rain with this. The strap is not leather but what feels like nylon so it should hold up well. The handles are leather and a nice thick leather as well that definitely will hold up well over long term use.There is a large pocket on the front of this which would easily hold a tablet and then the big zippered pocket has a divider, two open pockets, two pen holders and a smaller zippered pocket inside.If you don't require a lot of storage space for your work this is going to be a great briefcase for you but if you do require a lot of space you may want to look into something slightly larger.I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31PX8QYX6W6YU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0124V2I1Q#wasThisHelpful","R31PX8QYX6W6YU","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:48 MinsOh, I had high hopes for this product, I really did. As a mom of two I want anything that encourages my children to brush their teeth and I'll take any gimmick I can get. I also can not stand going into the bathroom and seeing where they tried to put their toothpaste on their toothbrushes and it's all over my sink. All that being said I was hoping that this would be the perfect solution.First, there are instructions but they are not that good. The instructions are limited and on the outside on the box; they really don't tell you much other than to take the lid off the top of the toothpaste and make sure you get it in there tight; it does not tell you how to actually operate the product. I started with my kid's toothpaste but that was running a little low so I tried our new tube. When putting the new tube in I made a mess because there was no way to get it in there tight without toothpaste coming out. Once I finally got some toothpaste in there I realized you do not press the silver strip on the top that looks like a button (especially since it says touch me right above it) but rather you put your toothbrush in the bottom and push. You don't just do it once you do it multiple times to sort of ""prime of the pump"". Even after this is primed however very little toothpaste comes out and when it does if your toothbrush is not at the right angle it just falls to the bottom under the button and looks like it would be a complete pain to clean.As for the toothbrush holder this seems like a better idea but I will say that my son's battery operated electric toothbrush just barely fit in this so there is no way he will be able to do that by himself.I'm hoping that maybe I'm doing something wrong here but for now I'm not impressed.I received this discounted product for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPRI5XDS29N4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010B3WAQC#wasThisHelpful","RPRI5XDS29N4J","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:02 MinsRimable does it again! I had reviewed the older model of this scooter a while ago and loved it because both my kids (3 and 10) could ride it. This updated version is even better than the last.First, this is a very cool looking scooter. I got the black color so that both of my kids could use it and I didn't have to worry about them not wanting to ride it because it wasn't their favorite color. When the adjustable handle is all the way down it is perfect for my 3 year old (he is very tall for his age, he has to wear 5T clothes) when the handle is all the way up it is perfect for my 10 year old daughter (also tall for her age).The best thing about this scooter is that it folds up for easy storage and transport. We take ours with us camping so that kids can ride it around and this scooter folds up so much easier than the older model. My daughter demonstrates how to do it in my video review.When you add all of this to the fact that the wheels light up when you ride this it makes it a scooter that any kids would be super excited to get!I received this discounted product for my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z028STX008EI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142K7Z3I#wasThisHelpful","R1Z028STX008EI","A3G0AZUVX89F2J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3G0AZUVX89F2J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My cat (Linksys) needed a good grooming mitt. She's such a pain, but she actually likes a mitt over a brush. She'll run from a brush. She loves when she is laying down and we start brushing her with this grooming mitt. She'll start purring and just lays there. The mitt works great and gets that extra hair off her. I'm happy because she's getting groomed and she's happy because she's getting some serious loving! Overall, this is a great mitt for animals. The wrist band is adjustable and fits on anyone.

Zips up with no problems!As you know, oils are stored in a glass bottle the majority of the time. Having this pad between both sides, keeps the bottles from touch and breaking.

"I got these for my daughter for a costume to run a 10k in. Shes about 5'3"" and wears a size 0. She's very skinny. I would recommend these pants for anyone who is thin.There is no way to tell the difference between the front and back of the pants. That being said, the pants are a bit tight across the rear and a bit baggy in the front. They are also a bit short. If you bend over or squad, be prepared to show your rear as they will slide down. So make sure you have a long shirt on that covers your rear. You cant even sit down without your rear hanging out.These are super cute mermaid pants, but would be better for a child, not a teen or adult. If you get these for a child who is thin, these will be perfect. I dont really recommend them for teens or adults unless you have no junk in the trunk and you're very small.I would have rated these pants higher, but these are not for adults as advertised.I hope the picture helps!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WW7GSH0A13AA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015PMISM4#wasThisHelpful","R1WW7GSH0A13AA","A1ZSRBWBNS4CRB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZSRBWBNS4CRB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Awesome Bags! I love the pink color. First off, I no longer have a dog due to his unforeseen passing recently. He passes on over to the rainbow bridge before the bags arrived. However, I do have a cat. These are fantastic bags for cleaning that kitty litter daily. They are a good size too! I hooked it on to the lid of the kitty litter box, so when we remove the lid, the bags are right there. The bags come out of the little bone very easily and tear off easily too! No problems at all. Very easy to swap out the empty roll for a new roll.The bags are fantastic! They hold the kitty waste and litter very well. No rips or stretching from the weight. I'm impressed!Also, these aren't just for pets. Diaper waste bags are so expensive. I personally never used them because they were so expensive. However, I did buy doggie waste bags at the pet store and use those. Yes, I hung the cute little bone off the side of the diaper bag.

"I really love this cream! I've been using it for a few weeks now and have noticed a big difference in stomach, thighs and booty. I do have stretch marks from having kids, but they are so faded that they are hardly noticeable, so the cream didn't do anything for that. But as far as cellulite, this cream works great! I have noticed that there is less dimpling and less cellulite that is noticeable in my ""problem"" areas. I'm a believe that this works. It really does help.Does it help as a stand alone product? I'm not sure. I'm a runner and eat healthy. So having this cream has helped a lot. I haven't been able to get rid of the cellulite even with my lifestyle, but since I've added this cream as part of my daily routine, it has really helped!

"This is a great clock. I love it really! Clear and easy to read! I am giving this 4 stars simply because batteries can get expensive and it would be since if it came with a plug in so that you don't have to use batteries if you don't want too. There isn't even a spot to put a plug in into it if you wanted to use a plug.I have been very happy with it. I got the blue one for my daughter and it matches her room perfectly and she can have her own alarm clock. It light weight and she can put it anywhere she wants in her room. Great for teens!  She'll be leaving for college in the next year and she'll have a great alarm clock to go with her!Overall, We really have enjoyed this alarm clock and my daughter loves having her own and not having mom and dad wake her up.

"How to describe White Reaper... Well, if you took a punk garage band from the seminal era of the genre, threw them into a time capsule, opened it today and gave them instruments - you would have White Reaper. It's driving, unapologetic, energetic and just rough enough around the edges to be intentional. More than anything it's just fun. Having a bad day, or just feeling a bit down? Throw this on the turntable and crank it, you'll be hopping around in no time.Vocally there's a nice grind to the mid-ranged vocalists sound. Guitars are full on fuzz distortion. Drums are frantic and fevered, beats are frequent and pounding. The Bass line, while driving, is not overpowering - it compliments the rhythm guitar as it should. You'll find keyboards sprinkled throughout adding a nice dynamic, almost moog-like, in its execution and sound.This album specifically, is a debut EP through and through. White Reaper throw everything they have at you. My only complaint is that it's too short. The Clear Pink vinyl is beautiful. It reminds me of what it would look like if you melted down strawberry Jolly Ranchers and made a record out of them.Overall, great stuff if you're looking for a ""fresh"" vintage rock sound and A LOT of energy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW0V8XK660Q2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVBB2B0#wasThisHelpful","RW0V8XK660Q2U","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had several portable battery packs. Everything from the tiny ""sticks"" to the large ""bricks"". I've always preferred the bricks because you get one charge out of the stick and then you have to charge the stick again, essentially negating its purpose other than doubling your battery life. While the bricks are great because you can keep coming back for more, they're hardly portable. Generally, I keep one in my car and check on it now and again.The HP Slim is really the best of both worlds. Not quite a stick, but not far from it. It's light, compact and sleek. It also charges to devices simultaneously which is more than I can say for some of my bricks.It has everything you expect; charging input, two USB charging outputs, an LED indicator and a GO button to start the charge. It's a simple device and that's exactly what it should be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WU1QU7T48995/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8JGTOG#wasThisHelpful","R2WU1QU7T48995","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't sure what to expect with this when it came across my vine. I enjoy going to thrift stores and finding old frames to bring back to life. Typically I use a small foam brush or my airbrush. While my airbrush is top of the line, it's really made for larger jobs of one color. When I saw this come across the vine, I grabbed it.I assumed that I needed to use my air compressor with this unit, but I was wrong. The large back end of the sprayer is a powerful fan that propels the medium. Fill up one of the included reservoirs, plug the sprayer in and pull the trigger. It works flawlessly. The spray head is easy to adjust for the fan or round patterns. Clean up is a breeze as the whole front of the sprayer can be disengaged. No worries about getting motors or electronics wet.It lays down a clean coat. Not sputtering or changes in flow rates that I've noticed so far.

"My wife and I have been wanting to garden for awhile now. Living in Chicago, though, you really only have a 3-4 month window and when spring rolls around, time just seems to get away from us. When I saw this come across the vine, I thought it would be a perfect tool to jump start our gardening aspirations.Setup looks daunting, but it couldn't be further from it. I'd say 10 minutes and you'll be finished. Instructions are very easy to read and everything is put together very well. It's smaller than I imagined, so finding some counter space was a non-issue. Even fully extended, the light doesn't touch the bottom of my lowest cabinets. The noise emitting from the aerator is louder than I had anticipated, but it's not in excess of what you would expect from a fish tank.The included pods types aren't my first choice in gardening, but I planted them anyway just to familiarize myself with the process. They make empty pods if you want to plant your own seeds which I like as I hate using proprietary items as, when they discontinue the product, everything becomes useless. I plan on researching other nutrient mixture recipes to eliminate the reliance on that element as well. The bottle of nutrients included will last quite awhile though.My primary qualm is that this unit doesn't utilize LED lighting. I would think that the target demographic are those who are a little more environmentally conscious, so the inclusion of a bulb you throw out every six months is a little off the mark. I wouldn't think that the cost difference would be that significant, but I'm not a product designer - so what do I know?Overall, it's a great little device - especially if you live in a region that experiences long periods of inclement weather. You can use this to start plants as well, prior to transplanting in your garden, to ensure they get a good head start. I imagine this would also be great for kids in terms of getting them into gardening and teaching them the value of self-sufficiency.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20IA7PE4A3X4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NBJMWW#wasThisHelpful","R20IA7PE4A3X4U","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So many concerns are raised with this watch. First of all Swiss Legend is owned by Evine Live (a home shopping channel, formerly ShopNBC). Which raises concerns about the quality as it was essentially created to make people think they were getting awesome deals on supposedly top quality merchandise. Secondly, they're located in Hollywood, FL (not Switzerland). ""But the watch says Swiss Made!"" you cry out. Yes, it does. The guidelines to claim that a watch is Swiss made is that 50% of the value of its parts must be made in Switzerland. Value meaning the assessed value of the parts comprising the watch, NOT the MSRP. So you have a decent quality movement from Switzerland and a bunch of low value parts from other regions of the world and it's still considered Swiss Made.Secondly, for a woman's watch, this thing is clunky. My mom loves the look of the watch, but says its too heavy to wear daily. She reserves it for when her and my dad go out. There's not much elegant about it aside from the finish. The dial is big, the crown is big, the watch is thick.Third, seemingly every retailer that offers Swiss Legend has them consistently 60-80% off the MSRP. What this tells me is that this is a $200 watch that the manufacturer purposely suggests an outrageous MSRP so that stores can mark it way down and consumers will assume they're getting a super luxury watch for an unbeatable price and make the impulse buy without further research.Ok, so why am I still giving it 3 stars? Because Swiss Legend has done very well at producing a watch that looks far more expensive than it is. If you're wearing a watch as a status symbol, you won't find many who would question the extravagance of this watch. The Rose Gold colored finish (the case and band are actually Stainless Steel) is very pretty and authentic looking. The mother of pearl grey face could have a slightly greater luster, but is still pretty in its own right. It's HEAVY which most will equate to a quality watch.Also, it works and works well. There are no functional flaws that I have found thus far that would cause me to dissuade anyone from purchasing this watch to use as a watch. For the time being it functions just as it's intended and everything feels solid.Overall, my only qualms with this watch are the morally questionable nature of Swiss Legend's claim to Swiss Made, as well as their MSRP and markdown practices. More importantly is that this doesn't really have the hallmarks of a woman's watch. I assumed it was a men's gold watch from afar, prior to closer inspection. It's just too big and heavy to appeal to the majority of its target gender. However, there has been no reason for me to question the quality and functionality of the watch and it's definitely a head-turner.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDI2PGH7QV5M3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WXS6LQ#wasThisHelpful","RDI2PGH7QV5M3","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Was shocked when I saw this come across the Vine. I remember the classic Stanley thermos designs from all the factory workers when I was a kid. A growler though?I love growlers, every time I hit up a new brewery I have to leave with at least one of their growlers full of beer. The glass growlers are great, but by the time you get them home (or to a party or BYOB restaurant) the temp has already risen considerably from the tap. With this growler however, it'll stay ""tap-cold"" for hours. I poured four 12 oz cans in the growler, sealed it and left it on the counter in my kitchen (approx. 68 degrees Fahrenheit via central air) for 15 hours. The temperature before sealing the growler was 43 degrees Fahrenheit, 15 hours later I opened the growler and took a reading of 45 degrees Fahrenheit. 2 degrees isn't too shabby at all considering, in a standard growler, it would have been room temperature long ago.It's like a little beer time-machine. Close the lid and time stops, carbonation stays as well as the cold. I'm thrilled with this growler.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23YMO98SKF6B2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPISPNC#wasThisHelpful","R23YMO98SKF6B2","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Currently we have a Red Devil steam mop and a Black and Decker cordless stick vacuum for the kitchen and hard surfaces. While they work great, it's annoying to go over everything with the vacuum and then go over everything again with the steam mop. The Bissell Symphony Pet seemed to offer the best of both worlds.Fill up the reservoir and give it a minute or two to get the steam going. Then vacuum just as you would with anything else. I was skeptical at first - wouldn't the steam just blow the pet hair around or soak it to a paste? Nope, it picked up all the dirt and pet dander with ease while steaming and disinfecting.Overall, this does the job in half the time I'm used to and I couldn't be happier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CSSXPPQOX65A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UM9N3I#wasThisHelpful","R2CSSXPPQOX65A","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We try to cut back on disposable products in our household. These seemed like a great way to assist in that.I initially thought that these would have some sort of valve to release the seal. In fact, these are actually just rubber circles that you push down in your dish to create a seal that then peal off using the tab on the side. The operation is simple.However, the simplistic operation minimizes the overall application. Because you're not sucking any air out, the pressure when pressing down must remain even and uniform. This eliminates the possibility of non-round containers. It also means that the containers you use must be slightly smaller than the circumference of the lid you're using. This means that some of my larger mixing bowls are going to be too big.Overall; it's a good idea, it's simple, it's enviro-friendly. However, it's simple design ultimately inhibits its overall functionality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C11AIVAE9TC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L291QVK#wasThisHelpful","R3C11AIVAE9TC5","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my new charcoal grill. It'd been about 3 uses since I gave it a good scrub so after I cooked, while it was still hot, I filled this with water and went to town.First thing to note, I assumed that this was a clothes iron style steamer where you pour water into the reservoir and steam shoots out openings in the bottom. This is not the case. You fill the reservoir and then when you're ready to use it, you turn a release knob. Water droplets come out the bottom and as they hit the grating and hot surfaces of the grill it creates an overall steam effect. I was disappointed at first but it does seem to aid in the process and I appreciate not having to plug it in.The brushes work very well and took off the grease and ash very easily. I don't have a neglected grill to try it on, so if you're wondering if it'll strip off years of abuse, I can't say how effective it'd be. I can definitely say that it will continue to maintain a grill that has been previously maintained handily.My only complaint is that without the unit creating steam, it can be a pain for non-gas grill users as you either have to clean the grill immediately after use (while all that delicious food taunts you) or you have to fire up some coals just to clean it. Not a deal breaker, just something to think about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R327024PWJ2UDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVL6UAG#wasThisHelpful","R327024PWJ2UDL","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Poo-Pourri's biggest hurdle is that it has all the  makings of a gag gift. I'd seen it in stores and boutiques before, chuckled to myself and kept walking - never actually taking the ornate little spray bottle seriously.It came across my Vine and so I figured, what do I have to lose? My wife was thrilled when the tiny bottle arrived, she had thought of buying it in the past, but didn't want to be the lady buying the poo-perfume. We have a large house whose fundamental flaw is that it was built over a century ago and has only a single bathroom on the ground floor - right next to the kitchen, no less. So in the morning after I've cleaned out my tank, so to speak, she either has to wait for the odor to dissipate and risk being late for work, or brave the toxic fumes whilst she completes her morning routine.My concern was that this would be a ""masking"" scent. Like fields of vanilla and mint...after a herd of cattle came through and left their best work behind. But no, I have a fairly acute sense of smell and try as I might, post-loaf, I was unable to smell my leavings. It passed the wife's nose-test, her sense of smell is even better than mine. The scent smells clean and natural, not overpowering chemical or floral.Much to my surprise, I believe that Poo-Pourri will become a bathroom staple in our home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ21AK09NOPTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RW25UMC#wasThisHelpful","RJ21AK09NOPTX","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using PNY products in PC builds/upgrades for about 15 years now. I've always had good luck with the hardware, it's affordable and stable. The other virtue is the PNY lifetime warranty. I had a MOBO go rogue and fry a bunch of peripherals about 10 years ago, my RAM and VGU were both PNY. I emailed them about what happened, sent in the dead equipment and before I knew it, replacements were at my door without any hassle.I swapped out the 4GB in my Dell Inspiron 2320 (While it is technically a desktop, it's an all-in-one running off a Notebook mobo). The boot time is noticeably faster and, while it'll never be a serious gaming PC or graphical workhorse, it now has a spring in its step that makes it more of a joy to use.Overall, PNY makes reliable, affordable, well-performing hardware and this RAM set is no exception. Make sure you research whether your motherboard is compatible with these sticks as well as the amount of memory they provide. If you only have a single slot to work with, PNY offers a single stick 8gb for the same price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17PAPYLG8QVIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012TS9UOM#wasThisHelpful","R17PAPYLG8QVIO","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is our go-to toilet paper in our household. I learned sometime in college that the toilet paper is one of those necessities that you should spare no expense on. At around a buck per roll this is super soft and nice and thick. I've never had issues with it tearing or leaving a lint trail (neither are enjoyable experiences).Honestly, my only qualm would be that the Mega Rolls don't fit all that well on the standard holder without an extender which usually means that it sits on the back of the toilet or the sink ledge until the diameter has whittled down a bit. Obviously I could just buy the standard roll or get the extender so that's more my own fault than an issue with the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DPYL4H9AR9PK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XSFLOCC#wasThisHelpful","R2DPYL4H9AR9PK","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I figured I'd test it out with my friend's son (2) when we babysit and see how it goes.He was instantly enthralled with the device. The lights and sounds hypnotized the child immediately. The thing I like about this toy is that it combines touch screen technology (teaching them to operate things that don't give tactile feedback) as well as physical objects to manipulate (teaching them to use object that do give tactile feedback).He liked the ball chute, but beyond that mostly stuck to the touch sensitive bits as they're the ones that provide the light and sound.All in all, it kept his attention, so I'd call that a success.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38R4V5MSZ8S6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKT0QU#wasThisHelpful","R38R4V5MSZ8S6K","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I requested this toy on a whim. I saw Inside Out in theaters and thoroughly enjoyed the film. I figured this would be a fun addition to my various toy/collectible displays.First of all, Sadness was my least favorite character. Mostly because I find that the overly mopey people I've come across throughout my life do not mesh well with my upbeat and laid-back nature (I'm sure many of you can relate.) However, this figure is pretty adorable.It's shockingly well made. The sweater is actual fabric and it is quite soft. It's the little touches like that that really make a great toy in my opinion. She has a button in her stomach that - when pressed - causes her to slouch and play a phrase from the movie. The sound quality is crystal clear and spot on with the audio from the film. Also included is the Long Term Memory Retrieval guide. This is a plastic clam-shell that opens and closes. All the colors and prints are crisp and clear. Her hair in real life (while plastic) is colored much better than the product image would lead you to believe. She stands about 7"" tall and her arms are articulated at the shoulder.Overall, this is a great toy for a Pixar or Inside Out fan! I fully expected a 3 star product, but my expectations were exceeded.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25GKQD9KXJB5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE8YPDW#wasThisHelpful","R25GKQD9KXJB5A","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My nephew is a big fan of Batman (I'm sure there are a lot of others out there who can relate) so I grabbed this so he had something to play with when he visits. You can tell his is aimed at younger fans of Batman. The colors are brighter, the forms are a bit more cartoonish and exaggerated and...well... Batman's riding a T-Rex... The veteran comic book reader in me dies a little bit every time I look at it, but - alas - it isn't for me, so I will steel my resolve and suffer through.Sparing you from a rant involving the use of popular IP to breath life into other IP (i.e. Jurassic World and Batman)... The toy is solidly built. There's a trigger on the underside of the tail that deploys the cannon and seat from the CybeRex's (rly?) tail. Batman can then shoot large discs that look like re-purposed Batmobile hubcaps at his foes, i.e. the Joker. When the cannon is deployed the CybeRex's mouth opens which is kinda cool. There's a rib cage (ha, get it? RIB... CAGE...anyway) that can hold the Joker so Batman and CybeRex can traipse through the Gotham streets to drop him back off at Arkham so that he can break out in time for next weeks wacky adventure.Getting to the point, my nephew loves it. It's easy to use, it's Batman and Dinosaurs (what more could a six year-old boy want?) and it shoots things. My only real complaint (other than my nerd continuity issues) is that it's pictured with the 'roided out, battle-axe wielding, Joker (SMH). I realize that this is probably some attempt at showing size comparison, or how to use the CybeRex, but it makes this look like it's part of the playset. I read the description prior to ordering, so I knew that it didn't actually come with the Joker, but I know not everyone does that, so don't expect the Joker to be included.Overall, for thirty bucks, it's a decent toy. You get the CybeRex and a Batman figure with two discs. My nephew likes it a lot, which is the reason I bought it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQIRGRXO0HJCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T03TANQ#wasThisHelpful","RQIRGRXO0HJCD","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've come across this game a few times in my life at various locations. For as simple as it is, it's extremely addictive and fun. Great for something to do while drinking on your patio with friends.What I like about the Viva Sol version is the quality of the products. When I've come across this game in the past, it's been a rusted hook sticking out of a rotten board in the back of a seedy bar or in an Amish village. The presentation of the Viva Sol version will make it look more like a recreational game and less like a rusty hook and filthy bit of thread randomly sticking out of your patio.Set up is easy. Easier if you have an electric screw driver/drill. Can you drill holes? Yes? Then you will have no issue setting up this game.Overall it's fun, something to do outside during summer get-togethers.

"I used to drive across country a few times a year. I got in the habit of being very prepared an stocking my car with tools, lighters, blankets, etc to ensure that I was prepared for any number of emergencies. I don't drive more than 30 miles nowadays, but I still can't resist a good car gadget. Most of them go in my wife's car (whether she wants them or not) to ensure that she's prepared for any issues during her commute.The Maxic Compass intrigued me instantly. A little white box that can jump-start my car? You've got to be kidding me. I snatched it up eager to test it out. Left my light on overnight to drain my battery (I have a full size Forney battery charger in the garage, so I wasn't worried if the Compass didn't live up to its hype). Plugged the jump adapter into the box (couldn't be simpler) and attached the alligator clips to the battery terminals. The read-out on the digital display said OK and sure enough, started right up.It has several features that protect you, the battery and the unit. The most common you'd probably see is the NG readout on the digital display. This means that the battery is fine and it will not force current to it, which is great if you don't want to deal with a melted car battery. I do think they could've used something other than NG because, if I'm someone who hasn't read the manual, NG means nothing to me. Other than that, it's extremely straightforward, easy to operate and user friendly.It has a nice carrying case that holds all sorts of adapters for cellphones/etc as well as the unit and the jumper cables. It easily fits under your car seat or in your spare tire.The unit has a flashlight built in and USB and cigarette lighter outlet. You can charge your phone, etc. It seems to hold its charge very effectively, I haven't had it for more than a month so I can't say how long it lasts but I would think quite awhile.Overall, this is a phenomenal device to have in any car. Great for kids going off to college, wives and husbands alike. You never know when you're going to be stuck somewhere and it's surprising how few people keep jumper cables in their cars these days.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11KGICRHGE40C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UIEELSU#wasThisHelpful","R11KGICRHGE40C","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using a Fitbit One for awhile now and a Fitbit Zip prior to that. I appreciate the additional functionality and the recharging of the One over the Zip and have been very happy with it. I know that most people's reservations with the Fitbit and other high-end activity trackers is the price. A hundred bucks is a substantial amount of money to take a chance on something. I figured I'd try out the Pivotal Living Tracker 1 to see how much (if any) of a difference there is between them.First thing you'll notice is the price. Fifteen bucks is dirt cheap for an activity tracker (not to be confused with a simple pedometer). The app is included as well as a year subscription to their service (the app, message boards, etc). Each year you'll have the option to renew for twelve dollars and your renewal gets you the newest version of the tracker. Not a bad deal at all.How does it fair against its competition though? Well, pretty well actually. There seemed to be no disparity between the numbers in comparison to my Fitbit and the Pivotal. I prefer that the Fitbit tracks stairs as well. I had no issues with it syncing to my phone. The battery life is about half the Fitbit One, lasting about a week to the Oneâ€™s two. The App UI is clean and easily navigated, very user friendly over all.So, should you buy this? Well, if youâ€™re looking for an activity tracker for your child that wonâ€™t make you homicidal when they lose it, this is a good choice. If youâ€™re interested in an activity tracker, but not sure how much use youâ€™ll get out of it, this is a low-cost/high-gain option as far as trackers go. If you are serious about fitness, there are enough options on here that may work for you, but there are other trackers out there that offer a more robust dataset.Overall, itâ€™s a solid tracker on the cheap thatâ€™s user friendly and doesnâ€™t look like it came out of a cereal box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTSLOQORMMN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VMPVQDC#wasThisHelpful","RTSLOQORMMN8","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a Nerf slingshot about twenty or so years ago. Mine had the little yellow balls that didn't shoot well. This slingshot uses darts and is far more accurate.Assembly is pretty easy.

They're not long and the tension isn't high so I don't think there's opportunity for serious injury.It comes with two darts which isn't very much ammo. There are only clips for two darts so if you have extra ammo, you'll need big pockets or an ammo belt accessory.Having a clip-fed mechanism would've been more beneficial and I'm surprised (with so many clip-fed Nerf weapons) that they didn't implement it in this slingshot.Overall, it's light, accurate and easy to use.

"I had two pens I used for brush work. The first is the Pentel Arts Color Brush (with a black cartridge) which has a large tip and nylon bristles. The other was a Copic Multiliner SP BS (aptly named). The Copic was decent for finer detail work, but the felt tip would rapidly fray, meaning either replacing it (like 3 or 4 bucks) or dealing with it. Finely I was fed up and began looking for other alternatives.I often saw this at the art supply store I shop at, but the lack of detail in the description and the crappy image of a girl on the front always made me pass it up. The image makes it look like its just a pointed felt tip... After researching, I realized that this is just a smaller version of the Color Brush and uses the same nylon bristles. SOLD!After going through two cartridges pretty quickly, I can say that this is easily one of the best pen purchases I've made. The nylon bristles are just the right balance of stiff and soft. It holds its point extremely well (as does the color brush). The amount of control and line variance achieved is just phenomenal. If you do ink work you absolutely need this. Even if you prefer using a standard brush and well, this is invaluable to have on the go for sketching and roughing out your ideas or even quick touch ups if you don't feel like cleaning brushes to just do some quick line work.It's solidly constructed. My single qualm is that the ink cartridges can go pretty quick if you're doing some serious work. They're not outrageously expensive, but I wonder I may just try some Speedball and an eyedropper or needle to refill and see what happens.Overall, this is an amazing brush pen and I cannot recommend it enough!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20FKFR7EWBQYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LJRKN8#wasThisHelpful","R20FKFR7EWBQYC","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted a diaper bag that was a little more unisex than many that I've seen. The SWIFT caught my attention as it has a very unassuming look to it and includes the changing pad.The inclusion of the changing pad and the way it integrates into the bag itself is wonderful. No extra pocket space is lost to it.The construction is great. I love that it uses clips instead of Velcro to hold the flap closed. The changing pad folds up very nicely and zips securely on the inside flap. There are two pockets on the outside perfect for bottles or puff containers. A mesh pocket on the inside of the flap works well for ointments and odds and ends. Two diaper pockets are on the inside compartment with plenty of room in the compartment itself for clothes, jackets, etc.Everything is really well put together and it seems like it will last. It's lightweight and not at all bulky. I  extremely happy with this bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P4DBLH9HMRWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R4PXCZY#wasThisHelpful","R3P4DBLH9HMRWY","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this case for my wife as she upgraded to the Galaxy S6 shortly after it was released. Although three ""bumpers"" are included, the only color she was interested in was the Black Sapphire.First impression out of the box was that the bumpers do not have a metallic finish that they appear to in the product image. They are pretty basic colored plastic. The Black Sapphire probably should've just been called Black. There's no shimmer to it, it doesnâ€™t have any special tinting or anything, it's flat black plastic.The rubber housing has a much cooler design on the interior of the case, but you will never see it again once your phone is secured. Once on the phone, it fits well, seems secure and is flush with the camera.The bumpers look fine on the phone, however my largest gripe is the poor design of the side buttons. The buttons on the bumper are flush with the plastic. When I was trying to increase her volume it would increase and instantly decrease because the pressure was depressing both volume controls simultaneously. The power/screen lock button works sometimes and not really others, because you donâ€™t feel the button presses itâ€™s difficult to know when youâ€™re actually pressing the button.Overall, the original price point of thirty five is ridiculous. If anything they shouldâ€™ve let you choose the case you wanted (instead of three different colors â€“ two you are never likely to use) and charged twenty. Even with the current price of fifteen, the design is flawed. Iâ€™ll be looking for a new case.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19HT03VT48MZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQ5ALA4#wasThisHelpful","R19HT03VT48MZ","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We don't eat a lot of frozen foods in my house, but when we do have them on hand they tend to sit due to the amount of time it takes to preheat an oven and then the amount of time it takes to cook something once it's preheated. I thought the 5-minute pizza oven would be fun to try.Out of the box it is mostly assembled. It's definitely nice looking and if you have a stainless steel kitchen, it will fit right in. However there are some glaring issues. First there is a tray for cooking and a tray for catching crumbs. Neither are labeled and the set up instructions are a blurry picture of the oven with the door open and arrows pointing to parts. The tray for cooking is painted a primer color and has holes drilled in the corners with a raised circle around the diameter which led me to believe it was crumb catching tray. The crumb catching tray is a nice flat piece of metal which led me to believe it was the cooking tray. I was tipped off when the actual cooking tray wouldn't fit right and I scraped some of the finish off of it. It seems they could've just labeled it or provided a better diagram in the pamphlet.The tool that pulls the tray out is supposed to be affixed to the side of the oven. The instructions state to use the included mounting screws to attach it. Once again, no pictures, no idea what I was looking for. I had to go tear through all the packing to find a little pouch with four little black plastic inserts packing taped to the underside of a piece of cardboard. Then most of them didnâ€™t even fit in the hole they were supposed to go in. The holes are too large and the plastic threads on the mounting screws arenâ€™t even all the same size.The tool that pulls the tray out is worthless for two reasons. The first, you have to angle it in such a way that your hand gets very close to the hot surface of the door. Even then it doesnâ€™t do a very good job of latching on. Secondly the pan warps when it gets hot which makes it impossible to actually pull the tray out of the oven. I just gave up on it and started using an oven mitt.In terms of cooking, itâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m not giving it a one star rating. While it doesnâ€™t actually make a pizza in five minutes (Technically it does it in ten because you have to turn it on for 5 minutes to get the pan hot enough) thatâ€™s still better than a 40 minute average for most pizzas (including oven pre-heating). The food is delicious and there really isnâ€™t a difference between the pizzas and frozen snacks that Iâ€™ve cooked with this versus an oven aside from the speed. Itâ€™s really impressive.Overall, the oven is a mixed bag. While it does its job exceptionally well, design flaws mar the overall package and experience. While the sleek design will make it look at home in the nicest of kitchens, at a hundred and fifty bucks, the cheap design flaws just are not acceptable. If frozen foods are a staple of your household menu and you can live with using an oven mitt instead of the included tool and circumvent the flaws in the instruction manual, this may be a great buy after all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LO455ZG718LB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2OZM66#wasThisHelpful","R3LO455ZG718LB","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had an idea for a novel I had been kicking around for a while. My intention was to create a graphic novel, but I figured I had to write the story anyway, so I decided to write it as a straight novel to begin with. I had started it once a year and after tweaking sentences repeatedly I would eventually just give up. I read some online articles, seeking some guidance, but found most of them to be off-putting as they were overtly pretentious. Seemingly written by ""successful"" authors - that I'd never heard of - and read with the undertone of, ""You're not going to be a successful writer, but I'll throw you a few bones for humor sake."" What I was looking for was something simple, digestible and motivational.I found all of this in No Plot? No Problem!Chris Baty isn't writing as a member of some elite novelist club, taking time out of his busy schedule to bestow a few nuggets of wisdom laced with discouragement. He is a man, passionate about writing and â€“ more importantly â€“ writers. His words are empowering, removing the finger-locking intimidation of the blank page.Sit down with the intent to force out a masterpiece in a single go and youâ€™re going to end up with a headache and little more than a blinking cursor. Follow Chrisâ€™ stress-free methods and youâ€™ll be melting your keyboard as your fingers blaze across it. The most surreal part of the experience was when I felt that I was merely watching the story play out in my head, recording what I saw, instead of consciously attempting to figure out what would happen next. This serves as a testament to Batyâ€™s method. Writing my first full-blown novel (53,000 word first draft in 28 days) was an absolute joy! Editing on the other hand, was a little less-so, but it came as no surprise as Baty describes editing as a daunting and time-consuming task in the book.Overall, I canâ€™t say enough good things about this process. I am thankful for this book and Chrisâ€™ guidance through the process. I have finished my novel and begun submitting it. Even if it never sees commercial print, I am filled with the satisfaction achieved in writing my first novel, and I can guarantee that it will not be my last!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VYUYOBECN8Z6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1452124779#wasThisHelpful","R1VYUYOBECN8Z6","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I work long hours and get up early in the morning, so making Breakfast and Lunch as simple as possible is always a pro in my mind. Generally I ""graze"" throughout the day on nutrition bars, sunflower seeds, dried fruit, applesauce etc. My go to bars have been the Bel Vida bars as I find them (fairly) nutritionally sound and filling.As a vegan, I'm familiar with the Vega brand and the only thing that has kept me from trying them in the past is the price tag. I figured I'd give the All-In-One meal bar a shot to see if it's worth adding to my daily grazing routine.The taste is outstanding. It's always a gamble with nutrition bars, but the Vega Chocolate Cherry Almond is fantastic. My wife felt the chocolate was a little ""grainy"". I can see where she'd feel that way, but I didn't mind it.In terms of overall â€œfullnessâ€ after eating the bar, I would say itâ€™s moderate. I feel satisfied, but not full. I think the Bel Vida bars have more fiber which contributes to them filling me to a more acceptable degree. Iâ€™m 6â€™3â€ and 200 lbs, so those with smaller frames may find this meal bar to fill them more sufficiently.The compact size makes it easy to throw into your briefcase or shoulder bag.Overall, Iâ€™m a fan of the Vega All-In-One Meal Bar. At over three dollars a bar (four dollars if you go off the MSRP) I still donâ€™t know that itâ€™s worth the cost. It really just depends what your budget is and how much nutrition you typically get from other sources. If the price doesnâ€™t make you flinch and youâ€™re looking for a great nutritional meal bar (especially if youâ€™re vegan) this is just about as good as it gets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MBM93QORMWJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O956JXO#wasThisHelpful","R3MBM93QORMWJ2","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using a Bissel for years. It started to lose its effectiveness a year or so ago, so I took it apart, cleaned it up and replaced the belts and brush. While my Bissel's performance seemed to improve, the reviews for this Eureka were so full of praise, I had to see what all the fuss was about.Out of the box, my first impression was that the parts seem a little cheap. Everything is plastic for the most part. Then, when I stopped to think about it, I realized that I don't beat the crap out of my vacuum when I use it, so who cares if it's lacking heavy metal parts that make it more difficult to maneuver the vacuum?Assembly was quick and easy.In terms of performance, I was blown away. Or sucked away? Either way, the suction is phenomenal. You can see the carpet lift as you go over it. I had vacuumed the week prior to using this vacuum and was shocked at how much it still picked up. We had a corner where our dog used to pee prior to being housebroken where the carpet had become coarse from overly shampooing and treating with cleaners. A little carpet powder and a few passes with this vacuum and itâ€™s just as soft if it ever was. I cannot recommend the performance of this vacuum enough.In terms of the construction. Itâ€™s a solid unit with mostly plastic parts. Iâ€˜ve rammed a few couch legs and sideswiped an entertainment center or two (I may lack a certain finesse when I clean, Iâ€™ll admit it) and all the parts are still holding strong. Considering thatâ€™s about the extent of the punishment I expect a vacuum to receive, Iâ€™m not concerned with its longevity. The advantage of the plastic parts is that the unit is unbelievably light and a joy to maneuver around your living space.Overall, for the price and performance, youâ€™re not going to find a better vacuum out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKS981RBN39OV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5TM69K#wasThisHelpful","RKS981RBN39OV","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned my share of bluetooth speakers. My chief complaint with those this small in stature has always been that the peak volume leaves much to be desired and the low range is barely existent.I'd never heard of the brand RND, but decided to try this model out anyway.Aesthetically, it's a nice unit. Glossy black finish, the light up touch controls on the top are a nice touch, overall it's small and sleek. My one complaint is that, when charging, there is no indicator light. I'm assuming its being charged because the battery has never run out on me, but I'm not sure when it's charging, or when itâ€™s completed its charge.The batter life is ample. I can get an 8 hour shift out of it, no problem.Sound is impressive for a unit this size. The max volume is much better than similar sized units I have used. You're probably not going to be able to use it to DJ a party or anything, but it's still more than adequate for standard use. The low end is also impressive. There's apparently two speakers in the unit and the enclosure is well designed so that the bass reverberates well and projected clearly.Overall. This is the best unit around the fifty dollar mark that Iâ€™ve used. Aside from the annoyance that is the absence of the charging light, this is a quality product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33172KVERB82Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OUEO4BI#wasThisHelpful","R33172KVERB82Z","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first saw this, I was excited to see if it could fill the need to have a simple, small, portable device that could be used for quick informal sessions to capture the rough ideas without all the hassles of plugging in and dragging a ton of equipment with you. I wanted something for small groups or when Iâ€™m trying to work out ideas quickly.Out of the box, it's a quick set up. There are all of the usual pieces that one would expect. Chord to use USB for power, batteries, and connectors to use the recorder with a microphone stand. Foam muter for the microphones if needed. If you have any familiarity with these types of devices (mine is limited) you'll be recording in no time.After a few hours of use, I found that the device filled the need - it's light and portable. Great for quick recording of ideas or working out song parts (I used it mostly to record guitars).  Keeps the chords and hassle down to a minimum.  To this end, one of the best (and worst) parts of the device is that you can control it (sort of) from your phone.On the surface, it's a great idea - I wanted the device to almost disappear - so as I was recording, I could quickly use it - but when I wasn't, it wasn't in the way or needed elaborate set up/tear down. A quick download from the app store, and you have an app that will control most of the functions on the device. This really increases the usefulness - you can control it from across the room. No need to touch it to switch modes or inputs. This is a great feature.However, there are two major drawbacks to the app. First, it covers MOST functions - not all. I'm sure these are ""buggy"" issues that can be fixed, but simple commands - like deleting or clearing tracks - aren't available on the app. You have to be on the device. In full disclosure, the instructions clearly advise you to learn the device prior to using the app, even though they are supposed to be mirrors. Would have saved me some frustration as I spent a lot of time looking for functionality that wasn't on the app. I would have known that, had I started with the device.  The second (and this is minor), the phone can only be connected to the device. So it removes your ability to connect to the internet when you are controlling the device. It saves you the trouble of hooking in to a router with the device, but, if like me, you are constantly using the internet to find things, answer questions, etc, it's a little bit of an irritant.The only other negative I've found is that it's not as intuitive as it could be. Again, I'm by no means a professional when it comes to recording devices. However, almost anything that I wanted to do, I could do. It just took me a lot of looking and guessing through menus to find them. Not the end of the world, but a little bit of a nuisance issue in the beginning.Overall, the device filled a need for quick recording and portability.  I found myself working more on what I was playing than being focused on the capture process. Seems like the kind of device that you can throw on the table next time friends come over and easily capture the spirit of what was played, to be cleaned up later. Sound quality was good, but not professional - but that's to be expected from a handheld. I was not disappointed. Plenty of inputs - from the built in microphones to 2 quarter inch / xlr's. Gives you a lot of options, though again switching between these input sources requires a little bit of work. I will not use this for everything that I do, but for what I wanted it for, I will use it constantly and am pleased with the results so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y869O8HLB0DY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MIXF296#wasThisHelpful","R2Y869O8HLB0DY","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an iPhone 5 that this obviously will not work with. However, I have a Galaxy S Blaze that I no longer use. I thought it would be nice to repurpose the Blaze as a thermal imager.Wrong. According to the Play Store, the App is not compatible with my older version of Android. My Galaxy Tab doesn't have a micro USB. My advice would be to make sure you can install the app prior to buying this item as the item description makes no mention of compatibility (or incompatibility with Android OS versions.)I downloaded the App on my iPhone 5 to at least give you a review of the ease of use and overall design. My first impression is that they seem to want a lot of information for a thermal imaging camera. The first request is your location (denied), the second is access to my photo library (pretty sure you canâ€™t detect heat in pictures already taken â€“ denied), the last was access to my camera (probably need that â€“ allowed). Next they want you to sign up and login. Why do I need to sign in to a thermal imager? Nope.Regardless of signing up you still need to accept the Terms & Conditions. The bit in the Terms & Conditions that I enjoyed the most is the part where Seek has irrevocable, perpetual, world-wide etc etc etc license to do anything they want with your User Content (photos) include â€œReproduce, fix, adapt, modify, improve, sellâ€¦.etcâ€ So if they want to take your images and Photoshop them to make them look better than the camera is capable of to sell units, they can.The Privacy Policy states â€œWe may also enter into agreements or arrangements with third party good or service providers who agree to receive your personally identifiable information from us for purposes of cross-marketing or making offers to you of Third Party Providersâ€™ products or services.

All Third Party Providers have entered into agreements with us where they agree to not disclose your name and email information to any third partiesâ€ So, weâ€™ll sell your information, but the people weâ€™re selling it to pinky-swore that they wonâ€™t.Good thing no one reads those things, huh?The point is, I never agreed or signed in. Thatâ€™s a lot of red tape for a device that is just supposed to take some heat-map pictures and not worth it for me for the one time Iâ€™ll probably use it.

"Like many people, I was irritated that all of my PS3 bluetooth headsets did not work with the PS4 including a very expensive 7.1 PGL Turtle Beach set. I refused to invest another few hundred dollars into a compatible headset. Up until this point I was using a pair of Turtle Beach earbuds designed for portable gaming as they were relatively comfortable compared to the earpiece included with the PS4. Although, anything that doesn't feel like you jammed a rock in your ear is comfortable in comparison.I saw the PDP Afterglow set and was drawn in by the abundance of cushion, the wireless feature, the ""boomless"" mic and the stand/charger setup. The price was fair and so I took the leap. While this is compatible with both the PS3 and PS4, I will be referencing the PS4. There should be zero difference in performance or setup however.Set up was simple. Plug the included USB cable and Digital Optical cable into the PS4 and into the stand. Turn the headset on, but depressing the button on the left ""can"". Both the stand and headset should glow blue. If you haven't already, go into the sound settings on your PS4 and follow the instructions, changing a few settings. Youâ€™re done. The sound/chat will output through the headset and the sound will also still output through the TV.The headset is very comfortable. The padding is firm and ample and I experienced no discomfort or overheating during hours of play.The sound is rich and full. There is a hint of surround sound, but not nearly as dynamic as my more expensive headsets. I didnâ€™t expect much as these are marked as stereo only. So based on how they are advertised, they perform very well. There are only two sound options, normal and Deep Bass. The Deep Bass through off the balance of the sounds so, unless maybe youâ€™re listening to just music, I would leave it set to normal.The lightshow is pretty, you can select several colors or have them cycle through the colors repeatedly. Iâ€™m not generally one for flashy tech, but you can turn the light off and theyâ€™re not overly gaudy.So why the two star rating? The boomless mic is garbage. I tried multiple times to use it whilst playing Warframe with friends and they were unable to hear me. At one point I heard them discussing that they thought I was â€œAFKâ€ but didnâ€™t say where I was going. Such a letdown! These wouldâ€™ve easily earned a 5 star rating with the price, presentation, sound performance and comfort taken into consideration. But I have zero use for a headset if no one can hear me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XVQGWM2ZBPVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NY5YYT6#wasThisHelpful","R2XVQGWM2ZBPVC","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife has been looking for a food processor for a while. We weren't sure whether to go with a large do-it-all model or something more compact. Ultimately, we decided on this small glass bowl chopper. Mostly that decision was because it reminded me of a motorized version of a manual chopper we have.It was larger than anticipated. Setup is a breeze out of the box. It works wonderfully. My wife was making a casserole and she quartered a whole onion and threw it in the chopper. Almost instantly the onion was obliterated. She was pleased because she has apparently become more sensitive to the hateful onion vapors lately.My concern with getting a smaller unit was the ability to chop efficiently. It had no issues, the motor is very powerful and the blades are very sharp. The other advantage is the sound. Itâ€™s very quiet. I would say it produces less noise than our hand held coffee grinder or our blender. It only takes a couple bursts to achieve the desired result.Two things that I wouldnâ€™t necessarily consider cons, but just observations. Because of the size, the blade armature is mostly blade, so be very cautious when cleaning it. Lastly, I really wanted to be able to toss all the ingredients to make pico de gallo in at once so I could have instant pico (itâ€™s the little things, ya know?) Unfortunately, while the glass bowl is ample, itâ€™s not ample enough for instant pico unless youâ€™re settling for a very small serving.Overall, Iâ€™m very happy with the purchase and I donâ€™t think weâ€™ll be in the market for another food processor for some time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39TG1J3OH5OKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYK13Y#wasThisHelpful","R39TG1J3OH5OKI","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this album via iTunes after watching the film. $10 for 31 tracks was a deal and I loved the sound of the fictional band the Soronprfbs. I went in with the expectation that, because the Soronprfbs were credited on the bulk of the soundtrack, they had recorded full length/studio versions of the songs and mixed them properly for the soundtrack. I was largely mistaken.I don't think this was an unrealistic expectation, mind you. Films like: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Suck, Get Him to the Greek and the TV series - Flight of the Conchords all feature soundtracks will full-length studio recordings by the actors as the band even though they were featured only in bits and pieces in their respective films. All of those soundtracks are great and well worth the purchase.However, the Frank soundtrack is a missed opportunity in this regard. Allow me to break down the tracks into categories to assist in illustrating my point.Tracks that are just random snippets of partial songs or speaking from the movie:1. Jon's Crap Songs2. Ginger Crouton (they try to sort of add an ending to it, but not very well)4. Lay an Egg11. Idiot Shriek13. Again14. Jon's Song Changed by Frank and ClaraTracks that are just instrumental intros/outros/transitional generally less than a minute:3. Welcome to Vetno5. Frank's Dawn Chorus8. Work Begins in Ernest12. The Holiday Makers17. Viking Funeral18. Just Like Paris Texas19. Sxsw22. The Music's Sh!t23. #FindfrankTracks that could be considered full length Soronprfbs songs:7. Lone Standing Tuft9. Creaky Door15. Secure the Galactic Perimeter16. Broken21. Frank's Most Likeable Song...Ever (I'm reaching a little here because it's 34 seconds, but well worth it)25. I Love You All26. I Love You All (Credits)27. All Broken (Credits)28. Tuft (Credits)29. Frank's Cacophony30. Stop Sign31. I Love You All (Radio Mix)Tracks that are full length songs, but not really performed by the full Soronprfbs10. Be Still (Don's Song)20. I'm Just Me (Personally, I really dislike this song)24. Lighthouse KeeperSo, that being said, there are twelve tracks that are actually what I was looking for. Look again though and you will see that I Love You All appears 3 times on the soundtrack, Broken appears twice and Tuft also appears twice. This takes the total unique track count down to 8. As I mentioned, Frank's Most Likeable Song...Ever is 34 seconds and hilarious if you've seen the movie, but hardly a song in its own right. Frank's Cacophony is not nearly as digestible as the other songs and Stop Sign is easily dismissed.In my opinion, if you're looking at this album, you may want to cherry pick the individual tracks:15. Secure the Galactic Perimeter26. I Love You All (Credits)27. All Broken (Credits)28. Tuft (Credits)Let me close by stating that the actors in this film did a phenomenal job creating this music. Michael Fassbender's vocal quality and range blew me away. If he ever fronts an actual band, I'll be first in line for the album. This fact only makes the lackluster presentation of the soundtrack that much more disappointing. If the soundtrack had been in line with the 4 songs I recommended, it'd be five stars all day long. However, there is enough ""filler"" that I'm forced to give it 3 stars as a whole.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12PUQP8O5ABT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N63PC7Y#wasThisHelpful","R12PUQP8O5ABT0","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided that I wanted to get a power washer for odd jobs around the house. I was primarily looking for something that I can clean my siding, clean the garage floor/driveway and wash my car with. I selected the AR Blue Clean because of all the positive reviews and the affordable price tag.I've never owned a pressure washer before, so the thought of setting it up was a little intimidating. I was relieved to see that it is mostly together out of the box and following the clear instructions made it a snap. First impression, this thing is built solid. I'm a big fan of the metal braided hose. I'm a bit of a clutz and notorious for not putting things away properly, so the durability of the hose should definitely add to the longevity.I love the included ""wand"" attachment. This makes washing your car a breeze. Reminds me of the quarter-fed do-it-yourself bays at the carwashes when I first got my license. I'll be saving all sorts of money without having to take both our cars to the carwash.I'm thrilled that it has a detergent tank. This makes washing the cars and windows even better considering I don't have to hassle with the buckets and sponges first. I'm not sure if the detergent tank has been fairly common among pressure washers in the past, so this may not be a major revelation for anyone, but I certainly appreciate it.There's a myriad of nozzles included to handle any job. Although I don't necessarily feel like the holes hold the nozzles very firm. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.The hose reel and cord wrap are great, I have a small(ish) garage so it's nice that I can keep all the necessities with the washer and still use minimal space.Overall, I can't attest to any professionl or industrial applications for this pressure washer. However, as an average homeowner using this for various odd cleaning jobs, I couldn't be happier. The price point is great, and (so far) the quality is very impressive!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLBEF2OERESS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6XBEGC#wasThisHelpful","RLBEF2OERESS","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this album via iTunes after watching the film. $10 for 31 tracks was a deal and I loved the sound of the fictional band the Soronprfbs. I went in with the expectation that, because the Soronprfbs were credited on the bulk of the soundtrack, they had recorded full length/studio versions of the songs and mixed them properly for the soundtrack. I was largely mistaken.I don't think this was an unrealistic expectation, mind you. Films like: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Suck, Get Him to the Greek and the TV series - Flight of the Conchords all feature soundtracks will full-length studio recordings by the actors as the band even though they were featured only in bits and pieces in their respective films. All of those soundtracks are great and well worth the purchase.However, the Frank soundtrack is a missed opportunity in this regard. Allow me to break down the tracks into categories to assist in illustrating my point.Tracks that are just random snippets of partial songs or speaking from the movie:1. Jon's Crap Songs2. Ginger Crouton (they try to sort of add an ending to it, but not very well)4. Lay an Egg11. Idiot Shriek13. Again14. Jon's Song Changed by Frank and ClaraTracks that are just instrumental intros/outros/transitional generally less than a minute:3. Welcome to Vetno5. Frank's Dawn Chorus8. Work Begins in Ernest12. The Holiday Makers17. Viking Funeral18. Just Like Paris Texas19. Sxsw22. The Music's Sh!t23. #FindfrankTracks that could be considered full length Soronprfbs songs:7. Lone Standing Tuft9. Creaky Door15. Secure the Galactic Perimeter16. Broken21. Frank's Most Likeable Song...Ever (I'm reaching a little here because it's 34 seconds, but well worth it)25. I Love You All26. I Love You All (Credits)27. All Broken (Credits)28. Tuft (Credits)29. Frank's Cacophony30. Stop Sign31. I Love You All (Radio Mix)Tracks that are full length songs, but not really performed by the full Soronprfbs10. Be Still (Don's Song)20. I'm Just Me (Personally, I really dislike this song)24. Lighthouse KeeperSo, that being said, there are twelve tracks that are actually what I was looking for. Look again though and you will see that I Love You All appears 3 times on the soundtrack, Broken appears twice and Tuft also appears twice. This takes the total unique track count down to 8. As I mentioned, Frank's Most Likeable Song...Ever is 34 seconds and hilarious if you've seen the movie, but hardly a song in its own right. Frank's Cacophony is not nearly as digestible as the other songs and Stop Sign is easily dismissed. In my opinion, if you're looking at this album, you may want to cherry pick the individual tracks:15. Secure the Galactic Perimeter26. I Love You All (Credits)27. All Broken (Credits)28. Tuft (Credits)Let me close by stating that the actors in this film did a phenomenal job creating this music. Michael Fassbender's vocal quality and range blew me away. If he ever fronts an actual band, I'll be first in line for the album. This fact only makes the lackluster presentation of the soundtrack that much more disappointing. If the soundtrack had been in line with the 4 songs I recommended, it'd be five stars all day long. However, there is enough ""filler"" that I'm forced to give it 3 stars as a whole.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PPF8A0O7QBUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MR4FQIS#wasThisHelpful","R2PPF8A0O7QBUK","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do various art projects throughout the year and so I thought this would be a nice set to use with metal. On first inspection I was very satisfied with the weight and overall construction of these bits. They are smooth, precise and have a nice weight to them. On the inside groove are all the diameters listed so it's very simple to know which bit you require and how far to drill.I was pleased that the 2 smaller bits clicked right in to my Black & Decker VPX screwdriver. The 3 largest bit fit perfectly in my standard hand drill. The largest did not, but I assume that is for more industrial drills. While the bits are weighty, they did not throw off the balance of the screwdriver or the drill.I used these on aluminum, don't usually work with anything more substantial than that and they tore right through. Each time leaving a perfectly round, clean hole. There was some slipping on the surface of aluminum cans, but that's not altogether surprising as they are curved and slicked with the label. Overall, this is a quality drill bit set and I'm anxious to try some tougher metals in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LZ7EE4U8ZCOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004THZ1#wasThisHelpful","R2LZ7EE4U8ZCOI","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to be in a band during my high school years. While that never really panned out, I still like to play the guitar every once and awhile. I thought this would be a cool little device to record myself to see if I look as ridiculous as I think I do and maybe record a few covers.Set up is super easy. You open the box and plug the included lightning cable into your phone and then into the device. Launch the app (Impact by Focusrite, downloaded from the appstore for free) and you're ready to go. You can plug your instrument directly into the audio jack or you can just use the microphone if you're using a piano or acoustic guitar, or would just rather use your own amp/effects pedals/etc.Once you're done you can edit, upload to social networking sites, etc.The sound quality really impressed me. I like the app, it's actually ridiculously user friendly and easy to edit your videos. I was a little concerned at how cumbersome video editing on a phone would be, it's not, the app is great!The other feature I really like is that it runs off your iPhone's battery. While, yes, it does drain your iPhone faster, I appreciate that I don't have to carry around a separate cord or be situated close to an outlet. You can just throw this in your guitar case or bag. It's very small and light.My only qualm is that the slot that your iPhone sits in will not accomodate the extra bulk from a case. So when you want to use this, you need to remove your phone from its case. It's not a deal breaker, but it is annoying.Overall there are two reasons you should be looking at this:1. You're a singer/songwriter who's looking for an easy way to make videos showcasing your talent.2. You're a performer who's looking to critique your performing abillities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A441NJ2XJQD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NB42FTG#wasThisHelpful","R1A441NJ2XJQD4","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been looking for a new vacuum for a while. I replaced all the parts on our trusty old Bissel a little over a year ago, but I felt it was time for something new.The appeal of the B&D Stick Vacuum is that it's light weight, cordless and has the removable hand-vac. I had just vacuumed two days prior with the aforementioned Bissel and the B&D still found debris to pick up. It's noticeably quieter than the Bissel, my cat doesn't instantly take cover when it is turned on. It's lightweight so taking it up and down stairs is no issue whatsoever.There are some drawbacks however. The width of the brush head is smaller than most vacuums which means more passes over the carpet. The upside to this is that it fits between chair legs, etc. The volume of the brush head is also less which means certain things that my old Bissel would pick up, won't fit in the B&D. I will say that it picked up dog kibble, which is a plus if your dog prefers not to chew over the dish like mine. There is no carpet height adjustment and if your carpet is longer (like a shag) the fibers will get wrapped around the brush causing it to stop. The canister is noticeably smaller as well, meaning you can't go as long between emptying the debris.One of my favorite features is the off button for the brush. This means that you can use this on tile and hardwood. No more chasing tumbleweeds of fur around the kitchen floor for me! It works fantastically on hard surfaces, you will never use a broom and dustpan again.The hand-vac option is nice. It's fairly lightweight and powerful. It'd be nice if it came with more than the brush attachment but it still works very well. I used it when I cleaned out my car and I was very pleased.Battery life is impressive. I'm able to complete the entirety of the first floor and 3/4 of the second floor on a single charge. Recharging is rapid as well. When it dies, put it back in its dock and go throw in some laundry/dust/etc and by the time you're done (about an hour or so) it'll be back up and ready to go!There is a feint burning smell from time to time. I'm not sure if that's the brush motor or just the debris being so close to everything. Amazon got my address so B&D could send me a new one, but I didn't hear any more about it nor did I receive a replacement, not sure if that was the issue or what.Overall, it's a great little vacuum and if your flooring is mostly hardwood/tile/linoleum than this is what you're looking for! If you have longer carpet or a lot of rugs with fringe, you may want to buy local so you can return it if it doesn't work out. The small canister means more time emptying, but you may get that time back since you're not fighting with cords. I, personally, am happy with it. I don't imagine I'll be holding on to the Bissel much longer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20G2VSJ4BR6F1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJ0G4HU#wasThisHelpful","R20G2VSJ4BR6F1","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I selected the Belkin Power House Dual Lightning dock for a couple reasons. First, I thought it'd be nice to be able to charge both of our iPhone 5s with a single outlet. Second, I assumed that the dock would look nicer than random lightning cables stickin out from behind our bed.What's in the box? Included is the dock itself and a standard A/C adapter with bulky plug. This surprised me as I thought that this would essentially be a ""pretty"" splitter for a single lightning cable.The bulky plug has its shortcomings. If you're using it on a power strip, it will have to occupy the end in order to not to take up at least two outlets. This essentially defeats the purpose of conserving your outlets depending on your setup. The fact that it isn't a lightning cable means that if you want to travel with this, you'll need to bring an additional cable for any charging that isn't using this (i.e. car).The dock itself is probably twice as big as I anticipated. I assumed it would be about 4 or 5 inches long, just enough to accomodate 2 phones, iPads or a combination thereof. It is actually 8-10 inches long which takes up much more nightstand space than necessary. The added length is due to dials protruding from the base in from of each device cradle. These dials control the height of the lightning adapator. I guess this is taking into consideration that some people may have cases/etc that require the lightning plug to have to be higher than flush with the cradle. I would've prefered there just be a bit of ""play"" with the plug so you could pull it out a little or rest it back flush with the cradle.Overall, I think this is probably going back in the box. It's big to the point where it's almost an eyesore and takes up too much nightstand space. The bulky plug just isn't doing it for me either. I'm usually a fan of Belkin's line of products, but this time around, I'm calling it a miss.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R184UX2E17ZZEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJNGGMG#wasThisHelpful","R184UX2E17ZZEY","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife was excited to use this spray. She'd never tried a setting spray before but enjoys getting dolled up occasionally.Make sure to pull your hair back so you don't set your hair as well as your makeup. And while there is a smell to it, it isn't overwhelming and dissipated relatively quickly.She wasn't a big fan of the aerosol. Something about spraying an aerosol can in her face didn't seem very appealing for some reason. Maybe they can do a spritz bottle?Overall, she says it worked well.

"I've been playing all the AC titles since the original. The fact that an AC title was being developed for the Vita was influential in my decision to buy a Vita. If I could sum up this title in a phrase it would be; ""Thrown together.""I was excited to play this title because the story sounded intriguing. You are the daughter of a wealthy entrepreneur and his slave. When you are born, your father grants you and your mother freedom and raises you as his own. It's a time of turmoil in New Orleans. Your Mother disappears shortly after your father takes a wife. Your new stepmother plays the doting wife, but is actually playing a key role in emancipating local slaves. You use your mixed heritage to your advantage, dressing either as the wealthy debutant, the quiet slave girl or the assassin to deceive and gain access to areas or throw pursuers off your scent. You follow the teachings of an old Assassin, hiding out in the bayou, who adds a dash of voodoo into the mix here and there. All that's left of your mother are journal pages scattered throughout the city and countryside for you to collect. Each page brings you closer to the truth behind her disappearance.Sounds great, right? Wrong. The story is cobbled together and you don't feel a lot of motivation for doing much of anything other than someone told you to do it. I found myself asking several times, ""How did I know this was supposed to be here? How did I know that I was supposed to go over here?"" At one point you go to Mexico to investigate slaves that are disappearing. There's this big show of you leaving New Orleans, you even wonder when/if you'll return, then you do like 4 missions and you're back in New Orleans saying that you found what you were looking for, but you had to wait for the right time to escape. You don't actually have to escape, it's not a mission or anything, and they just say that that's what happened. And that's really the way the story seems to go, things are glossed over and paraphrased to the point that it's difficult to become invested in the world and the characters.The game itself is buggy. Not game-breaking buggy, although my Vita did crash once, but mostly annoying buggy. You'll be doing a mission where you're not supposed to be detected, easing along a path or hallway and, out of nowhere, the guards load in mid-conversation, as if they'd been there the whole time and you're spotted. The red dots that mark the guards on your map are rarely accurate and jump around as the map catches up with them. There's a chest in New Orleans I can't get to because it fell through the other models. I've landed in spots that place me in perpetual fall causing me to have to quit the game and reload from the last checkpoint. Collision detection is hit or miss at times causing your climbing and jumping through the bayou to be frustrating. You receive a whip at one point that allows you to swing, a la Indiana Jones, across large gaps via branches, scaffolding, etc., but it rarely works during free run, you must stop, wait for the game to register that there's a branch there and you have a whip then jump.Vita features are used in gimmicky and tedious fashion. You find letters and instead of picking up the letter and reading it, you have to swipe the front and back touchpads simultaneously (like you're tearing open a real letter!) which it pops up with the tutorial for every time. Even then, it doesn't always work and it doesn't tear along with your swipe. You swipe, it waits a second, then it tears... Really? Not only is this just unnecessary, it's not like it's a puzzle or anything, but it isn't even well executed. There's also clues on light reactive paper. This would be cool if they didn't tell you every time, ""Hey! This is one of those light-reactive clues! Hold your Vita up to a bright light and then spin the dial with your finger until the clue is revealed!"" Again, this isn't a puzzle. You hold it up to the light and then spin a dial on the touchscreen until something happens. Then a couple indiscernible marks appear on the paper and your mission objectives are updated. The problem with this, other than the fact that it's tedious and unnecessary, is that the Vita camera auto adjusts to light. So you may hold it up to a light and the screen with actually dim because the Vita camera says, ""Hey, this picture you're trying to take is blown out, let me adjust the brightness for you!"" which then means that the light isn't bright enough. I've held the camera right up to a light bulb and had it still not work. You just have to mess with different distances from different lights to get it to finally work. Thereâ€™s a marble labyrinth-style puzzle at one point that uses the gyroscopes to have you tilt the Vita to get the marble to the goal. I don't know about you, but I don't play my Vita flat on the table, so the puzzle was all messed up. I had to restart it with the Vita flat on the table to get it to work properly.Additional objectives aren't displayed on the mission. Sometimes they'll appear when you first accept the mission, but they're not continually displayed on your screen. This means that most of the time I don't know that there are additional objectives until I'm notified that I failed them by doing, or not doing, something I didn't know I wasn't supposed to do, or not do. At this point I don't care enough about the game to restart the missions for 100% sync, but for those that do, that's super frustrating.Controls are clunky and so is combat. Maybe it's the short and more sensitive analogue sticks. Maybe it's the limitations on animations due to the hardware. Fighting seems much more button-mashy (yes, I made that up) than other titles. Jumping around and navigating the free-run/free-climb seems much less precise and frustrating. It's not the fluidity I've come to expect from the AC name.Graphically, the game is fantastic. Although, New Orleans seems largely empty and drab. The textures and models are very detailed and look great on the Vita though. Music is repetitive and mediocre, but it's easily tuned out.Weapons are not terribly varied and the game tends to equip the items it thinks you should be using. This is extremely irritating as you don't notice it and when you go to use your item, you'll find it isn't there. Meaning screwing up what should've been a deftly executed kill, or failing a mission because you missed your opportunity. It has also equipped lower quality weapons on me, meaning I had to go back to a weapon shop and re-equip it. All the items you've bought aren't just in your inventory, you need to go back to one of the shops that sells the item if you want to equip it. Assassin outfits are pointless as they are just different color palettes and cost 1000 gold/money/whatever. They do nothing but change the colors of your outfit. The only other option you have is wearing a hood or the tri-corn hat on the cover. Slave and Lady outfits are the same, lots of money for just a color palette change. Good weapons and ammo are fairly expensive in a game where money is not easily accumulated which can be irritating.Money is primarily earned through quests and a shipping company you own/operate. You must buy ships to add to your fleet. You will purchase goods (cotton, fruit, tobacco) from one port and then sail your ship to another port where those goods are worth more money, at which point you will sell all your goods, buy new goods from that port and then sail home or to another port where the goods you bought are worth more and then repeat. The caveat is that there are storms and pirates that can damage and even sink your ship or, at the very least, cause you to lose some of your goods. It's interesting, but a bit more involved and risky than the previous systems of buy and renovate shops and earn income periodically. It's not awful, but it's also not really my cup of tea. I can see how some would get lost in it as it is a bit of a mini-game in and of itself.Overall, I thought the premise was great, but poorly executed. Aveline was the only real redeeming quality in this title and I would like to see her in better executed installments in the future. Unfortunately, there is just too much wrong with this game. The choppy, poorly paced story, the annoying bugs and glitches, the scarce landscape, the clunky controls all add up to a marred experience. I can only recommend this title to the diehard AC fan that has to have all the games and have played through all the stories. Vita owners looking for a fun action/adventure title should look elsewhere.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31P3B0WLWC827/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BJNR6C#wasThisHelpful","R31P3B0WLWC827","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Assassin's Creed Unity had a bit of a launch failure. The game was riddled with bugs, some making the game unplayable. Because this seems to be happening more often, I generally don't buy games like this on launch day. (Bethesda taught me that lesson) Now that several gigs worth of updates and patches have been released, I thought it would be a safe bet. I was right. So, do yourself a favor, ignore the 1 star reviews citing the bugs and glitches, they are now irrelevant.I've been playing AC since the original and have played all releases both console and portable up to this point. I was getting a little worried with the last couple games as they just didn't grab me the way that the Ezio Trilogy (AC II, Brotherhood and Revelations). I contemplated giving up on the series, but I'm glad I didn't. AC: Unity has recaptured the play and feel of the Ezio adventures.The game starts out as most AC titles do. You are an average young person, enjoying your average life. You are quickly impacted by a great tragedy. This tragedy, you will find out, is part of a much larger plot and you are - in reality - descended from a long line of Assassins. You take up sword and hidden blade and focus on training so that you may exact your revenge.Arno reminds me of a slightly less cocky Ezio. The writing and voice acting is all well done. The story is interesting and well paced.The world is HUGE. I think this is the largest yet. Paris is rendered beautifully, historical cathedrals and government buildings have been recreated with painstaking detail. It's stunning.The world is very densely populated. I can see why there were framerate issues initially. There are streets that are shoulder to shoulder people, crowds are everywhere, fire is everywhere. It's pretty insane that the hardware can render everything. I've had no issues with chugging or framerate dropping however, these issues have been resolved.There are two factions who will get in your way; the guards and the revolutionaries. Neither faction will attack you on site like in some of the earlier titles. However, if you make it a habit of frequently killing one or the other or both, they'll start recognizing you outright and attacking you on the spot due to your reputation. There's no tearing down fliers or paying off town criers this time around either. When you're marked, you're marked.The combat is also much more challenging and realistic. I remember taking on dozens of guards in the earlier game and dispatching them with ease. This was because they'd essentially line up and take turns attacking. You'd parry, counter, parry, counter, etc until all were dead. Not in Unity. Guards/Revolutionaries will swarm on you and attack simultaneously often while one of them stands back and shoots at you with a flintlock. You will need to hone your parrying and dodging skills as well as utilize your smoke bombs and other various tricks to survive. Even then, you may make one wrong move and find yourself impaled on a rapier. It's a refreshing improvement even though it's maddening at times.Unity really pushes customization. Unlike the previous titles where you had essentially 3-4 sets of gear and then a ""master set"" of some kind, Unity has several options in each of five tiers and then a legendary tier. Each option has slightly different stats and looks markedly different. There is also a myriad of color palettes to change your outfit. Weapons follow the same system. This is done so that when you play co-op with your friends you don't look like the clone gang running around. It's a cool feature and definitely keeps things unique. Gear can be purchased, but some can only be unlocked by completing certain missions or achievements.Also, your equipment and weapons actually make a difference. In some of the earlier titles I'd find myself upgrading my weapons and equipment just to look cooler and to fill up my weapon room. However, because counter attacking was almost always an instant kill - no matter the caliber of your weapon - there wasn't really a need. In Unity your gear will make a big difference. The damage you do when countering and outright attacking is largely impacted by what you're wearing/wielding and your enemies are different levels (1-5) as well. You may be in the wrong area with subpar equipment and find yourself in a bad situation very quickly. It's nice that equipment has graduated from being mostly cosmetic.Gameplay is largely the same as it has been in the past. You have the primary story missions, side missions, chests/artifact/trinkets littered around to collect, shops to buy and renovate, etc. You are able to do these at your leisure. There are also random muggings and criminal activities for you to thwart. This is done by either tackling, killing or threatening the assailants. Each time you complete one, you get a point towards a total goal of points, once you reach your goal you get a reward (money, special equipment, etc) then it resets with a higher goal. You can no longer harm or kill innocents. I appreciate this as it always irritated me when a civilian got in the way of a fight and I accidently killed them.Co-op is handled by missions. There will be an NPC at various positions around the city and they will offer you a co-op quest when you approach them. This can be done with your friends, or random matchmaking. It makes it easy to knock out a co-op mission and get back to your single player. There are also Clubs you can create or join. This is essentially a guild where you share a common space and can compete via rankings with other guilds. It's a nice addition and makes it easier to play with people you want to play with.Micro transactions are prevalent in Unity. This is a bit off-putting to me. Additional missions were available for purchase on launch. I don't mind DLC when it is a significant amount of content created after the release and it isn't a situation where I'm being forced to pay for the ""good"" ending. Paying for additional missions off the bat seems in poor taste, however, as it probably could've just been included in the game instead of being ransomed after the fact. Also, you can pay real money for gear. It's gear that you can just buy with in-game currency as well, but the ""pay to cheat"" option just feels fickle to me. Lastly, there is a man who stands in your base who will allow you to join a friend's game or invite them to yours. I was notified that I had a friend who was currently online. I didn't realize this friend had bought Unity so I clicked ""Invite to Join Your Game"". I got a text message from the friend saying that he was taken to the purchase page for Unity. He was online but wasn't playing Unity and didn't own it. It seems like a stupid ploy to get your friends to buy the game. While this is all annoying, it's not game breaking and you can easily spend zero extra dollars and play the complete game without feeling like you're missing out.Ubisoft has been offering a service called UPlay for a while now. It's free to join and you can link your profile to your UPlay account. When you accomplish certain things in the game, you get UPlay Points which can be accumulated and spent in any Ubisoft game for additional outfits, gear upgrades, etc. I always thought it was a cool way to reward loyal customers. Now, on top of Uplay, they have Initiates. This tracks your progress in the game and awards you levels. When you attain certain levels you can unlock various golden chests scattered around that have money, additional outfits, etc in them. It will also tell you what kind of assassin you are based on your actions and how you play. ALSO, there's the Unity Companion App on the App store. This is a mini-game which is essentially the abroad missions from Brotherhood and Revelations where you recruit assassins and send them on missions for a period of time and they level up and then you send them on harder missions. Completing missions in the companion app unlock blue chests that contain gear, money, etc. You earn currency that heal assassins and buy new assassins, or you can just outright buy the currency (more microtransactions) and if you pay for the premium version you unlock better assassins etc. Otherwise the app is completely free and enjoyable. Uplay, Initiates and Companion App add a lot of additional content to the game, but can be a bit overwhelming and confusing at first when you're trying to figure out all the mechanics of the actual game. The menus are less user friendly than previous titles in the series.Overall, the bottom line is that the bugs have been fixed and it's time to pick a copy up. I've experience zero bugs since playing. This is the most robust AC to date and for everyone out there who, like myself, misses Ezio, your prayers have been answered. The customization and side content in Unity is astounding and the fighting and battle mechanics are the best they've ever been. If you're an AC fan or looking to get into the series, Unity is definitely worth picking up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QYRO182TLVCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYDEWHA#wasThisHelpful","R1QYRO182TLVCS","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When you accomplish certain things in the game, you get UPlay Points which can be accumulated and spent in any Ubisoft game for additional outfits, gear upgrades, etc. I always thought it was a cool way to reward loyal customers. Now, on top of Uplay, they have Initiates. This tracks your progress in the game and awards you levels. When you attain certain levels you can unlock various golden chests scattered around that have money, additional outfits, etc in them. It will also tell you what kind of assassin you are based on your actions and how you play. ALSO, there's the Unity Companion App on the App store. This is a mini-game which is essentially the abroad missions from Brotherhood and Revelations where you recruit assassins and send them on missions for a period of time and they level up and then you send them on harder missions. Completing missions in the companion app unlock blue chests that contain gear, money, etc. You earn currency that heal assassins and buy new assassins, or you can just outright buy the currency (more microtransactions) and if you pay for the premium version you unlock better assassins etc. Otherwise the app is completely free and enjoyable. Uplay, Initiates and Companion App add a lot of additional content to the game, but can be a bit overwhelming and confusing at first when you're trying to figure out all the mechanics of the actual game. The menus are less user friendly than previous titles in the series.Overall, the bottom line is that the bugs have been fixed and it's time to pick a copy up. I've experience zero bugs since playing. This is the most robust AC to date and for everyone out there who, like myself, misses Ezio, your prayers have been answered. The customization and side content in Unity is astounding and the fighting and battle mechanics are the best they've ever been. If you're an AC fan or looking to get into the series, Unity is definitely worth picking up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2421MW5OGB7WC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J48C36S#wasThisHelpful","R2421MW5OGB7WC","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Belkin products ever since my 2nd generation ipod. They've always been a quality purchase and I've never had any issues with them. When I needed an additional charger for my iPhone 5, this was an easy choice. The price is fair, could be a bit cheaper, but Belkin products have always been right up there with first party devices, so I'd rather pay a little more for a brand I already trust.Included are what you see pictured; the 4ft lightning cable, car charger and wall charger.All work as you would expect. Plug the lightning cable into the charger, plug in the charger, plug in your phone. The car charger has a little green light on it that helps you find the USB port in the dark. It's tiny and easy to throw in your bag or pocket.The wall charger has some opportunity for improvement. Unlike the wall charger included with your phone, this charger is wider and takes up two outlet spots. This means that it must be plugged in on the bottom outlet on the wall otherwise it will block both outlets. If you're using a surge protector/power strip it needs to be on the very end or it will block two outlets. This is frustrating if you alread have something plugged in on the end for the same reason. I'm not really sure why they made it so big other than to slap their logo on it so your friends will see it and say, ""OOOOHHHH! Is that a BELKIN wall adapter?? SWAAAAAANKY! I better run out and buy one too!""Overall, Belkin makes quality products and this little ""kit"" seems to be no different. The price and shortcomings of the wall adapter kept this from a 5 star rating. Other than those concerns, it works perfectly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WB90A5P37ZBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LETJDXQ#wasThisHelpful","R1WB90A5P37ZBT","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always felt that air purifiers are little more than snake-oil, but I do have mild allergies, snore occassionally and wake up a little congested in the morning. I thought that this small and affordable Holmes Air Purifier would be worth a try.Setup is simple. Unbox the unit. Remove the filters, remove the protective bag surrounding them, place them back in the unit. Plug the unit in. Turn it on. Couldn't be simpler. There are two speed settings. They suggest using high, but if the noise is bothersome, turn it to low. On the high setting, the noise is comparable to a desktop PC, and doesn't bother me or my wife. On the low setting it is pretty much silent.There is a UV light on either side of the unit. I don't know how effective two small lights are in terms of the air purification for an entire room, but I'm not the scientist who came up with it, or the engineer that designed it, so what do I know?I've been using the unit for a week now and have actually noticed some improvements. The air in the bedroom does smell clean and fresh. This may be a placebo affect, but either way I feel like there is a difference. The biggest plus is that it removed the dog scent. We share the bedroom (and typically the bed) with a greyhound and despite frequently washing/changing the bedding, there persists a varying degree of dog scent. After keeping the Holmes Air Purifier on consistently, there is no more dog scent.I still wake up a little congested, but I recently replaced our furnace filter as it was at the end of its life so that could very well have something to do with it. My wife hasn't complained about me snoring so maybe there is something to it.Overall, the removal of the pet smell is worth the price alone. It's low maintenance, small enough to stick out of the way and relatively quiet. If you're looking to give an air purifier a try, but don't want to blow a hundred plus on a full size unit, try this guy our in your bedroom first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PWD49P4MCIVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9T8JGS#wasThisHelpful","R1PWD49P4MCIVZ","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an adult male with very large hands. Because of this, I have always shyed away from FPS on portable consoles. I find it precarious attempted to hold the system while precisely manuevering thumbsticks and operating shoulder buttons while contoring my large mitts. I frequently drop the system or hit buttons I don't mean to.Borderlands 2 was released for the Vita and my love of the idea of portable Borderlands outweighed my ire of portable FPS gameplay. Sure enough I was immediately enraged by my inability to play the game without my hands cramping, dropping the Vita and lobbing grenades/popping cooldowns unintentionally. Yet I soldiered on because, c'mon it's portable Borderlands. I started to get the hang of it, trying out different ways of holding the system, but it still wasn't very comfortable.I then saw the PDP Trigger Grips. I'm not usually one for accessories as they typically don't work and they tend to make your 200+ dollar gaming system look like a playskool toy. These grips were actually licensed (always a plus) and look fairly sleek. They give your Vita the look of an expanded DualShock (particularly the 2000 model). I was super stoked to find this.I read reviews and a lot of people complained that the triggers stick. Even a friend of mine who had tried two sets said both kept sticking and warned me to avoid them. Not being in the habit of heeding the warnings of others, I bought them anyway. I found a set used at Gamestop for eight bucks and figured if they didn't work, I'd just return them.I dunno, if it's because they were used and had been broken it, but these work FLAWLESSLY. They have increased my overall FPS experience on the Vita 100 fold. Apparently if the triggers do stick, you can just loosen a couple screws and that generally solves the problem. Either way, I could not be happier with the Trigger grips. It attaches easily and snuggly to the Vita system. The triggers are a bit tight, pull 'em like you mean it, but haven't hampered gameplay at all. The Vita is so comfortable in my hands now and FPS feels natural and (almost) on par with the console experience.If you're having similar issues with using the Vita due to your large hands, buy this. Buy this now!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12ECAL83EUWMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0072A4JVW#wasThisHelpful","R12ECAL83EUWMX","A2NOJVQUPKPTEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NOJVQUPKPTEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In his author's note, James Rollins acknowledges that The 6th Extinction is his tenth novel in the Sigma series. He comments, ""Knowing that milestone was upon us, I thought I'd use this opportunity to tease to the past."" And that he does--the way past. One of the major characters in the book harkens all the way back to Rollins' debut novel. It was a MOST unexpected reappearance!I think with anniversaries and milestones in mind, Mr. Rollins wanted to make this installment a special one. You know how in Spinal Tap they had the amp that went up to eleven? The 6th Extinction goes up to eleven. He basically includes all the stuff his readers show up for--cutting-edge science, history, exotic locales, action, adventure, monsters--and delivers, well... more. BTW, did you catch that reference to monsters? I know he's not the only guy writing this sort of thing, but in The 6th Extinction, Rollins really reminds us why so many of us fell in love with his work, right from the get go, and just how good he is at what he does. Back off, impostors.So, I'm pretty much eschewing the plot summary this time around. It's all too much fun to discover on your own. But I do want to single out one element for special praise. I read so many of these thrillers where there's some sort of mad genius plotting some variation on the end of the world. For instance, the old ""we need to cull the human race due to overpopulation/lack of resources"" storyline. Rollins has done it; everyone has done it. There's an evil genius in this book, too--but what he wants, and how he proposes to achieve it--that, my friends, is nothing I've ever seen before. Now, by my count, this guy has written 29 novels (total, under two different names) and he's still coming up with fresh ideas from a seemingly endless supply. How can you not be impressed?I opened this review referencing Rollins' author's note, and I shall close with another quote: ""Additionally, in this new book, I also wanted to acknowledge what's to come, with some big changes hinted at in these same pages--because Sigma's greatest and boldest adventures are still on the horizon.""

"it seems to have taken Mssrs. Preston and Child a few attempts to find their footing with their character Gideon Crew, but at last they have.  This third novel is far and away the strongest of the series.  Our beloved authors have crafted one of those ""Where do they come up with these ideas!"" plots, so I want to be very circumspect in what I reveal.  In The Lost Island, Gideon again finds himself in the employ of Eli Glinn.  He is tasked with a daring art heist as the first step in a search for a substance with significant medical implications.  And that's all I'm telling you, because...It's not really all that surprising that there are over-the-top elements to the novel's plot.  I mean, we've seen that from these two before.  But the underlying premise this time around was so novel and just so much fun that I wouldn't want to spoil it with hints.  I will say this:  Many novels drag a bit in the middle.  In this case, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  I was just so darn amused by the proceedings.  The novel's opening was also strong, leaping immediately into the action of the tale.  Preston and Child are brilliant when it comes to plotting, and their talents are fully on display here.If I have one complaint--and I do--it's that the motivations and actions of some of the characters truly stretched my credulity as the novel's denouement drew close.  Okay, and one more...  At one point a character proclaims, ""It's so obvious.""  And, d'uh, it REALLY is.But...  The novel's epilogue is truly AWESOME, and will leave long-time fans SALIVATING for the next (Final?) book in the Gideon Crew series.  Count me among their number!

"Building nicely on his debut, Donâ€™t Ever Get Old, but working just fine as a standalone, Daniel Friedman and his 88-year-old protagonist Baruch â€œBuckâ€ Schatz are back.  This time, Elijah, a bank robber that Buck hasnâ€™t seen in decades (and once threatened to kill) has resurfaced asking for Buckâ€™s protection.  Their shared history from 1965 informs the mystery unfolding in the present day.  The author also manages to insert quite a bit of sly social commentary into the proceedings.Again Mr. Friedman has proved himself adept at both plotting and character-driven humor.  I'd have big issues with a cop like this in real life, but somehow on the page he truly is priceless!  Additionally, I continually find myself surprised by the depth of feeling , sensitivity, and substance to be found in this essentially light mystery series.  More of Buckâ€™s history is explored, but some questions from the past are left unresolved.  Iâ€™m not sure how long the old guy can hang on, but it seems clear there will be at least one more book.

"I'd never read Patrick Lee.  I've bought his debut novel, The Breach, in multiple formats, but always balked at reading it because it sounded too ""science fictiony"" to me.  Here's what's extraordinary...  Not only do I read thrillers, I socialize regularly with the folks that write them.  And no less than four of his best-selling peers have recommended Mr. Lee's Breach trilogy to me.  I *will* read these books someday.For now, I've contented myself with Lee's follow-up to the trilogy that made his name.  His latest novel, Runner, is a straight thriller, and therefore more firmly in my comfort zone.  As the novel opens, a sleepless Sam Dryden is jogging on the boardwalk of his sleepy, California town.  Into this middle-of-the-night quiet, a fleeing girl crashes into him, begging for help.  ""I need somewhere to hide.  I'll tell you everything, but please get me out of here first.""  When an offer of police assistance is refused Sam becomes wary, but seeing naked panic in her eyes, he's unable to refuse help.  She is, indeed, being chased by a group of unknown assailants.  But it is that one impulsive act that sucks Sam into Rachel's predicament.  All too soon, these two are on the run together.Now, this dynamic of an older, experienced man (in Sam's case, former special forces) aiding and protecting an innocent--usually precocious--young girl, has been explored before.  David Baldacci's aptly-named The Innocent is a recent example that immediately comes to mind, and I feel sure there are at least a few Dean Koontz novels that have gone there.  We've seen this set-up.  And perhaps Mr. Lee is aware of that.  As things began to feel slightly contrived, the characters themselves began to question the situation:""Which had made her wonder about something.  Was it strange that she'd run into someone--she had literally run into him--who was this good at keeping her safe from Gaul and his people?  Wasn't that a doozy of a coincidence?On the heels of that thought came another, this one from somewhere deep in her mind.  HAD it been a coincidence?""Nothing allays my own suspicions of contrivance better than having the author posit the same questions I am.  Lee is quite good at staying a step or three ahead of readers, and he managed quite a few good shockers in the course of telling his tale.  Chapters end on hooks, making it hard to put the book down.Now, with a title like Runner, you have to imagine the novel moves at a fast clip, and pacing is a real strength.  It's a plot-driven page-turner that will keep readers guessing.  Revelations are mete out, and even once you think you know what's going on, don't be so sure.  Characters are about as well-developed as you would expect from this genre, so don't go into Runner seeking depth.  If you go looking for a little adrenaline jolt and some undemanding entertainment, you'll likely find what you're looking for.  Patrick Lee isn't reinventing the wheel here, but he does a nice job putting his own spin on a familiar convention.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VO6Y7IW8BSJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250030730#wasThisHelpful","R1VO6Y7IW8BSJK","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What's the old clichÃ© about serial killers?  ""He was quiet and he kept to himself""?  Well, not so in the BBC's five-part series, The Fall.  Defying both convention and viewer expectations, Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan) is a husband and father.  This dichotomy of character is deeply, deeply disturbing.  As is much of what is depicted in The Fall.  This is dark stuff.  The police hunting this killer, led by Gillian Anderson as Stella Gibson, are some pretty dark characters themselves, leading to a rather moody and atmospheric production.That said, this is smart television.  British series always seem to be more along the line of what viewers in the US might see on premium cable.  Things are a bit edgier and more graphic.  The writing and performances in The Fall are sharp.  And despite knowing from the start who-done-it, the tone of the series is unrelentingly suspenseful.The Fall won't appeal to everyone.  This is a grim telling of a sad story.  Also, it should be noted, this first series does not come to a neat resolution.  Personally, I'm a fan of these more realistic endings, but the BBC has promised more of The Fall, so we shall all have to see what comes next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGIZMOWUVAFFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DW5IKN4#wasThisHelpful","RGIZMOWUVAFFT","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On Such a Full Sea is the story of Fan. Not just the story... The myth! The legend! It is being narrated--unusually--by the collective, first-person plural voice of the citizens of B-Mor, once Baltimore. (""The nation has collapsed. Once, we had a country of federated states. Now we have charter villages for the rich, and settlements for the not-so-rich. In between are open counties, places of anarchy with no corporate or government protection. We don't know exactly what happened to our planet, but it's easy to imagine.""). The tale is being recounted from an indeterminate point in the mid-future. Not so near and not so far. In the world imagined by master craftsman Chang-rae Lee, things are very different and yet disturbingly familiar, all at once. Speak the narrators:""Whenever we tell the story of Fan, details are apt to change. You don't mean to alter anything, in fact your intention is the very opposite, you want nothing more than to be an echo of the previous speaker, who, you decide, did a perfectly super job. And try as you might to match the very tone of the telling, the bellow of certain episodes and the half-breathed whisper of others, isn't it the truth that despite your fealty to the story, a moment will arise that compels a freelancing, perhaps even rebellious, urge?""Fan, it seems, knows from freelancing, even rebellious, urges. At 16, as a skilled diver and citizen of the protected workers facility of B-Mor, her life is far better than most. In sheltered B-Mor, spitting is among the community's worst crimes. (Though, at one point the narrators ask, ""Don't sanctuaries become prisons and vice versa, foremost in the mind?"") When Fan's boyfriend, Reg, is called to the Directorate and never comes back, Fan impulsively leaves the safety of B-Mor and strikes out in search of him.""If she possessed a genius, and a growing number of us think she did, it was a capacity for understanding and trusting the improvisational nature of her will. This might seem a contradictory state, and for most of us it would be. We have hopes and make plans, and if they are dashed or waylaid, we naturally rationalize and redraw the map to locate ourselves anew. Or else we brood and too firmly root. Very few can step forward again and again in what amounts to veritable leaps into the void, where there are no ready holds, where little is familiar, where you constantly get stuck in the thickets of your uncertainties and fears. Fan was different.""And so Fan embarks on what proves to be a picaresque journey. (""What perverse episode lay ahead for her now?"") Perverse, indeed! What Fan encounters in the open counties is immediately alarming and becomes increasingly shocking along the way. Mr. Lee avails himself of some genre tropes, but his imagination doesn't stop there. My jaw LITERALLY dropped open at least once while reading. There is plenty of plot here for readers to sink their teeth into.Character, on the other hand, it trickier in this novel. Readers never get into the head of Fan. She's a quiet and somewhat opaque individual. And this makes sense because Fan is, essentially, a fiction. Fan is not a real person, but rather the composite that the citizen-narrators have created. (""Why, in the life of a community, does a certain happening or person become the stuff of lore?"") Furthermore, there's no clear way that these interested parties can know the details of what actually occurred to Fan after she left. The entire tale is suspect.In discussing this novel's collective voice, comparisons have been made to works by Jeffrey Eugenides, Joshua, Ferris, and everyone in between. But the book that immediately came to my mind was Hannah Pittard's underrated The Fates Will Find Their Way. It, coincidentally, is also the collectively-voiced imaginings of a community in the wake of a 16-year-old girl's disappearance. You know what they say, there are only so many stories. And while that may be true, there are an infinite number of ideas, and this novel is chock-full of insightful observations not only about Fan's world, but our own. Mr. Lee has not built his world of whole cloth. Rather, he's paid careful attention to the (mis)direction in which we are heading. There is sly commentary on the environment, government, immigration, healthcare, privilege, race, and so much more.Beyond plot, character, and ideas, there is language, and here Mr. Lee is pure genius! The language spans from colloquial to eloquent and reading it was a joy from start to finish. I found myself truly savoring passages. And so it is, I'll leave the final word on this book to Mr. Lee and his narrators:""The funny thing about the tale of Fan is that much of what happened to her happened to her. She showed plenty of her own volition. Really, more than any of us could ever dream up. And yet at the same time, her tale demonstrates how those who met her, often took it upon themselves to help her, without, really, any hesitation. Without always a ready self-interest. Every once in a while there are figures who draw such attention. Even when they aren't especially charismatic, or visionary, or subtly, cleverly aggressive in insinuating an agenda into the larger imagination. For some reason, we want to see them succeed. We want them to flourish. Even if that flourishing is something we'll never personally witness. They draw our energy so steadily and thoroughly, that only toward the finish of events can we recognize the extent of our exertions, and how those exertions, in some, might have taken the form of a movement.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P8NHHQSB3J1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C5R722A#wasThisHelpful","R1P8NHHQSB3J1B","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not too long ago, I reread Christopher Mooreâ€™s novel 2009 Fool, where readers were introduced to Pocket, King Learâ€™s court jester.  As a rule, when rereading books thereâ€™s a law of diminishing returns.  Simply put, things are never quite as good the second, third, or fourth time aroundâ€”for obvious reasons.  You know the story, surprises have been revealed, jokes told, etc.  Christopher Moore seems to defy this rule because, if anything, I enjoyed Fool more upon reread than even my considerable entertainment the first time around.  Iâ€™d found Mooreâ€™s Shakespearean satire to be wildly amusing and clever upon first read.  On second, I appreciated the characters, heart, and depth of the tale further.How very, very glad I am, then, to see Pocket and a handful of cohorts returning in a second Shakespearean romp!  The Serpent of Venice is everything I could have hoped for and more!  As the novelâ€™s title suggests, this time The Merchant of Venice is in the mix, mashed up with a healthy dose of Othello.  There was a third element I couldnâ€™t identify until reading the illuminating authorâ€™s note at the novelâ€™s end.  It wasâ€”of all thingsâ€”a short story by Poe, The Cask of Amontillado.  Having shared the ingredients for this Mooronic gallimaufry, it would be a shame to discuss the details of the plot further.What I can tell you is this: as much as I loved Fool, The Serpent of Venice is even better!  Mooreâ€™s homages to Shakespeare are unbelievably clever.  Not just the borrowing of plot elements and characters, but the manner in which he shapes these familiar elements into a fresh new tale.  The story here is fantastic on its own merits.  I couldnâ€™t turn pages fast enough.  Above I mentioned the â€œheartâ€ of Fool.  That is even more evident here.  Itâ€™s somewhat amazing to me that such an irreverent story-teller can bring genuine emotion to his ridiculous tales.But, of course, the thing that sets Christopher Moore apart from all other writers is his idiosyncratic humor.  Itâ€™s fully on display in The Serpent of Venice.  I canâ€™t honestly say that Moore doesnâ€™t go for the cheap jokeâ€”because if itâ€™s there to be had, hell yes heâ€™ll go for it.  But the majority of the humor in these books is character-driven.  Pocket is a fantastic creation, and entirely Mooreâ€™s own.  Pocket is rude, profane (Warning: Heâ€™s really, really profane, if that sort of thing bothers you.), and utterly irrepressible.  He faces more challenges than any man his size should ever have to bear within the pages of this book, and he faces them in his own inimitable style.  And because the humor is based in character, it holds up remarkably well to repeat readings.As you can tell, Iâ€™m already looking forward to revisiting this tale.  Iâ€™m not sure how much longer Mr. Moore can mine the wealth of Shakespeare for inspiration and material.  It truly *is* inspired lunacy.  And it feels greedy to ask, but I so hope that thereâ€™s more of Pocket in store!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28HXAR8VSUM6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061779768#wasThisHelpful","R28HXAR8VSUM6C","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œA word sprang to his groggy, shivering mind.  It had sounded like a KEEN.  Something was KEENING and it welled him up with entirely unexpected, in fact, frankly ASTONISHING tears.  It tore at his heart like a dream gone wrong, a wordless cry for help that almost instantly made him feel inadequate to the task, helpless to save whatever was in danger, pointless to even try.A sound which, later on, when he remembered this night forever and always, thwarted all sense.  Because when he found the bird, the bird made no sound at all.â€*****The passage above occurs three pages in to Patrick Nessâ€™s second novel for adults (after his debut, The Crash of Hennington), The Crane Wife.  In the years between these two novels, Mr. Ness has achieved far greater acclaim and readership as an author of sophisticated young adult fiction.  That was my introduction to his work, not all that long ago.  I finally got around to reading The Knife of Never Letting Go, the first volume in his Chaos Walking trilogy, and it absolutely knocked my socks off!  Iâ€™ve got no problem reading YA fiction, but when I saw he had an adult novel coming out, I knew Iâ€™d read it as soon as I could get my hands on a copy.  The Crane Wife could not have been more different than the earlier novel Iâ€™d readâ€”and if anything, it was even better.Itâ€™s a book I could quote from all day long; the writing is simply, heart-breakingly beautiful.  Itâ€™s the story of George, an everyman print shop owner with artistic inclinations.  He awakes to the sound described above and goes outside to find a beautiful crane thatâ€™s been shot with an arrow.  He saves the birdâ€™s life.  Later he thinks, â€œBut if it wasnâ€™t a dream, it was one of those special corners of whatâ€™s real, one of those moments, only a handful of which he could recall throughout his lifetime, where the world dwindled down to almost no one, where it seemed to pause just for him, so that he could, for a moment, be seized into life.â€Soon after the hazy events of that night, George meets the beautiful and mysterious Kumiko.  They embark on a relationship of stunning romance and artistry.  And what follows is the stuff of myth, legend, and fairytale.  Iâ€™ll let you uncover the plot on your own.The Crane Wife is a quick read.  It is magical.  And while I think it will find a broad and enthusiastic readership, it may not be the novel for everyone.  The two quotes I shared are indicative of an otherworldly style that is, frankly, not my typical cup of tea.  I was, however, completely captivated in Nessâ€™s tale, and the language in which he told it.  I loved the not-quite-real tone of the tale that kept me guessing as I read.  There was something about this story that was just so delicate and exquisite that I am confident Iâ€™ll be rereading this brief book time and time again in years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BEI62V2X4HZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205477#wasThisHelpful","R1BEI62V2X4HZQ","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was introduced to science journalist Alan Weismanâ€™s work with his wonderful book of speculative science, The World without Us.  When I read that a follow-up was forthcoming, my interest was immediately piqued.  But reading the jacket copy of Countdown didnâ€™t grab me.  Itâ€™s Weismanâ€™s exploration of the world WITH us.  With far too many of us, as population explodes exponentially and this planet faces grave consequences.  Obviously, this is as important a subject as any a science writer could possibly tackle, but, frankly, it sounded like a bummer.  I passed.A while later, Alan Weisman came to speak at the San Francisco Public Library.  I was thrilled for the opportunity to hear him talk.  Truth be told, heâ€™s a surprisingly terrible public speaker, reading his entire speech lifelessly off a lengthy print-out.  Still, the lackluster presentation didnâ€™t disguise just how fascinating the subject matter was.  The statistics quoted, the anecdotes relayed, were simply staggering!  I HAD to read more.  Happily, there was a 500 page book waiting to be devoured.What Iâ€™d forgotten when I passed on this book is what a terrific and accessible writer Weisman is.  Just as with The World without Us, Weisman looks at the issue from a broad and creative number of angles.  The man traveled to every corner of the globe in the process of researching this expansive book.  Iâ€™m not going to quote a bunch of gee whiz statistics at you in this review.  I will simply tell you that the book was as fascinating as it was disquieting.  I feel better educated and informed, and I will not quickly dismiss any future subject matter that Mr. Weisman decides to take on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OT9AX0L9ZIFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316097756#wasThisHelpful","R1OT9AX0L9ZIFH","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not unusual for me: I heard all the buzz on and acclaim for Jamie Fordâ€™s debut novel, Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, and even though it sits on my bookshelfâ€”to this dayâ€”I never got around to reading it.  In these cases, I tend to jump right on the authorâ€™s sophomore novel, to avoid the same procrastination.  This yields mixed results, as sophomore novels are notoriously dicey endeavors.  I suspect that Mr. Fordâ€™s debut is the stronger novel, but Songs of Willow Frost was a readable enough melodrama.Songs is the tale of depression-era orphan William Eng.  William has lived in a Catholic orphanage (where it is no picnic to be Asian, let me tell you) since his single mother overdosed on drugs and he was taken away.  He is led to believe that she is deadâ€”until young William sees a beautiful actress in a movie reel and becomes obsessed with the idea that she is his mother.  So begins the young manâ€™s quest to discover the truth about his own life and that of his mother.As you can imagine, this is a harsh and frequently heartbreaking tale.  It was a tough period in American history, and Ford tackles issues of race and class within the confines of his story.  Itâ€™s clear that heâ€™s done meticulous research on this time period in Seattle, where the novel is set.  An interesting authorâ€™s note at the novelâ€™s end briefly details some of the storyâ€™s inspiration.  Ultimately, the tale is ratherâ€¦ schmaltzy.  Iâ€™m not sure I can say it better than that in English.  Fordâ€™s language is serviceable, but forgettable.  Songs of Willow Frost passed the time and wasnâ€™t painful to read, but neither is it a book that I would feel compelled to recommend.  If, however, youâ€™re especially interested in the themes or period, you could do worse.  Iâ€™ll be curious to see what Mr. Ford tackles next, and hey, Hotel at the Corner of Bitter and Sweet is still waiting on my bookshelf.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15XI11ZHUHOBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345522028#wasThisHelpful","R15XI11ZHUHOBJ","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Iâ€™ve been a fan of dystopian fiction since, well, I was a young adult.  Therefore, it is not surprising that YA fiction has become a haven for that particular literary genre.  Iâ€™ve read and enjoyed quite a lot of YA dystopian fiction in recent years.  Still, it was lovely to stumble upon a dystopian tale being marketed to the adult fiction market.  The novel is Lighthouse Island by Paulette Jiles, and it was my introduction to the authorâ€™s work.What separates Lighthouse Island from the glut of YA dystopias?  Primarily just the age of the protagonistsâ€”in that theyâ€™re not teens, I mean.  Actually, the novel opens in the early childhood of the woman who will come to be called Nadia (after many name changes and adopted identities she uses to survive).  This is how we meet her, â€œOn a hot, dry afternoon, a four-year-old girl was taken out into a crowded street by her parents and abandoned.â€  And itâ€™s a harsh world in which sheâ€™s been left.  The novelâ€™s opening paragraph reads:â€œThe winds carried dust to every part of the great cities; left it on roofs and windowsills and uneven streets.  It scoured glass to an iridescent glaze.  The city covered the entire earth, if people think of the earth as â€˜where I live.â€™  At night, the wind sang through the abandoned upper floors of buildings with a noise like oboes and this erratic music could be heard at street level where people walked in the heat to their work in offices and in the recycling dumps and the cement works, to work on the pumps that kept the water, contaminated with gypsum from Silurian seas, flowing through the pipes.  In the interstadial spaces between the borders of gerrymanders, prisoners painfully attended the cactus fields and soybean fields.â€That first paragraph is evocative and disquieting and hints at the world-building that will take place within Jilesâ€™ tale.  An idea is planted in that four-year-old child that will take seed, and will lead her on a quest that will take decades to realize.  In the course of pursuing a childish dream, Nadia will take readers on a picaresque and frequently nightmarish adventure through the world Jiles has created.  Not all is grim, however, saving the tale from being hopelessly unreadable, and part of Nadiaâ€™s tale is pure romance.Do I think Jiles has reinvented dystopian fiction?  No.  After all these years and all these visions, itâ€™s really hard to come up with something that hasnâ€™t been seen before.  But her dystopia was fresh enough to keep me interested, and her use of language was often interesting.  The world-building was especially well handled, and her depiction of endless city creeped out even this urban animal.  I didnâ€™t love all aspects of this novel, and Iâ€™m not sure what I think of the end, but Jiles kept me turning the pages.  And I would certainly be open to exploring her work further.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IAM04BNKXSTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062232509#wasThisHelpful","R1IAM04BNKXSTJ","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While my computer has always been a PC, when it comes to devices, I've been a faithful Apple devotee.  iPhones, iPads, accessories--it gets expensive!  Lately, I feel that my iPhone, in particular, is a money suck.  (I've had two stolen, had to pay to replace one out of pocket, am now paying steeply for theft insurance, and the speaker on the new phone is currently broken and needs replacement.  Yeesh!)  I have my reasons for sticking with Apple, but the primary one is comfort and familiarity with the Apple operating system.  My level of annoyance with Apple is such that at this point I'm really interested in investigating non-Apple products that may be better and/or less costly.  Therefore, I positively jumped at the chance to test and review this Kyocera Hydro Elite Verizon cell phone.Speaking with a techno-geek pal, he offered some good advice--namely that I separate out the features and qualities that were specific to this Kyocera phone, versus those endemic to the Android environment.  So, let's start with the Kyocera features.  The same techno-geek pal picked this little phone up and said, ""It's thin and light; feels cheap.""  I picked it up and thought, ""Wow, it's thin and light.""  I guess it's all a matter of perspective, but there's nothing about this phone that feels ""cheap"" to me.  It's got a sleek, glossy black look.  In size, it's about the same width as my iPhone, slightly thinner, and less that .5 inch longer--though the screen is a little bit bigger than the size difference would indicate due to usable space.So, I have no problem with the look and feel of the Kyocera Hydro Elite, but I do have a significant problem with one of its features: the sound quality.  Whether using headphones or speaker, there's just not enough volume.  Or perhaps I should say, there's JUST enough volume most of the time.  If I put the phone's volume on its maximum setting, I can hear okay in most reasonably quiet environments, but that doesn't help me in a noisy, crowded room, on a busy city street, or heaven forbid, on public transportation.  I shouldn't have to listen at the phone's highest volume, either.  If I did that on my iPhone, I'd blow my eardrums out.  This goes for phone conversations and for listening to music or audiobooks (which I do a lot).  Out of everything I'll discuss below, as far as I'm concerned, this is the phone's fatal flaw.  What is a phone for, if not to hear conversations?This particular is phone is supposedly hardened against environmental damage, like being immersed briefly in water, getting gritty in dirt and sand, etc.  I declined to test these claims.  However, for a girl who talks in the bathtub regularly, it's not the worst feature to have in a phone.  I've never dunked a phone, but who am I kidding?  It's only a matter of time.  Let's give Kyocera the benefit of the doubt on this one.Now let's talk about my main area of interest:  Android vs. Apple.  I'm truly sorry to report that, for me, Apple continues to be the hands-down winner.  The operating system is  just more intuitive, efficient, and even aesthetically pleasing--despite Apple's annoying and ridiculous redesigns.  Most of the apps I use are available in both environments, and in rare cases they're even better in the Android environment (Audible was one example), but those are the exceptions that prove the  rule.  Perhaps I'm just so indoctrinated to Apple, I can't change, but I'm both willing and anxious to make a switch at this point, and I still think the Apple products are better at most things.Two notable standouts in the Android phone were the voice recognition, which was significantly better than Apple's and typing on the phone's keyboard.  The same techno-geek taught me this, bless his geeky soul.  Rather than peck out each letter, if you sort of trail your finger from key to key without lifting it, the phone guesses what you intend to type.  In my tests, it guessed correctly an astonishing 100% of the time!  Is it faster?  I have no idea.  But it was really cool!Voice recognition comes into play with Siri on my iPhone.  Unlike some people, I consult with Siri constantly.  She's my friend.  I find myself in unfamiliar surroundings frequently, and she tells me where to find food, post offices, dry cleaners, etc., as well as random facts, the score of the Redskins game, and much, much more.  The Android phone has nothing to compare to Siri's AI sophistication.  I was intrigued to see that there's a Google feature that was at least attempting to compete.  From an easily accessed Google screen, if I say, ""Okay Google,"" I can put my query to the machine verbally.  It'll do basic web searches, tell me the weather, and access other data from my phone, but as noted previously, it can't begin to compete with Siri's sophistication and, well, personality.  Google doesn't tell jokes.  Though that does remind me of one more significant benefit of this Android phone--Google, and all that it brings to the party, is far more smoothly integrated into the phone's functionality.  It's really nice.As you can see, it's a mixed bag, and I'm just not won over to Android yet, but I can see benefits.  I think it's worthwhile diversifying away from Apple's over-priced monopoly on my life, so I plan to continue exploring Android devices and keeping as open a mind as possible.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AJGXL8T1U8I8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EP2CAFW#wasThisHelpful","R3AJGXL8T1U8I8","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Jasper Fforde.  Can this review stop right there?  I love Jasper Fforde, and if you're reading book two of the Chronicles of Kazam, it's very likely that you do too--whether you're among the intended audience of young adults or are, like me, an old adult.As noted above, this is book two in a series.  That said, I don't think having read book one is imperative.  I alwas think it's better to have done so, but the plot of Song of the Quarkbeast is no highly dependent on knowing the details of the first novel.  Though one nice thing about an ongoing series is the ability to develop characters over time.  In this second outing, we meet some new characters, but also get to know some returning wizards a bit better.  Characters like the difficult Lady Mawgon get to show off different facets.As previously, the tale is told from the point of view of 16-year-old foundling Jennifer Strange, the acting manager of Kazam Mystical Arts.  After the Big Magic of The Last Dragonslayer, things are more or less back to normal--if that can ever be said of a place like Kazam.  The business is still struggling to survive, and competition from the one other wizarding agency is being keenly felt.  The plot of this novel revolves loosely around an object that doesn't want to and shouldn't be found.  But as with all things Ffordian, plot is incidental to world-building and absurdist humor.  Here, for instance, is how magic works in Fforde's Ununited Kingdom:""After two months at Kazam, Tiger was still trying to get his head around the limiting practicalities of magic.  Most people thought you just waved your hands and sim-sallah-bim, but it was a lot more complex than that.  Sorcery was not so much doing what you wanted to do but what you could do--or ingeniously finding your way around the physical limitations of the craft.""I feel like it is Fforde who is often finding his way ingeniously around the limitations of plot and story.  I've been reading him for nearly two decades now, and he's yet to write a novel that failed to please.  Whether aimed towards young or old, his work is good for what ails me.  He never fails to make me laugh o smile, and his wacky tales are consistently brighten my days.  I might go so far as to suggest Jasper Fforde as a cure for the winter blues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DRDQML6U4AJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054773848X#wasThisHelpful","R1DRDQML6U4AJA","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We all have things that will influence our decision to read this novel over that one.  In my case, there were two highly idiosyncratic things about Ransom Stephens sophomore novel that really captured my attention.  First was the image of whale flukes on the novel's cover.  As a marine biology geek and scuba diver, I'm attracted to any tale involving the ocean and its creatures.  This one, at least tangentially, does.  Also, there was the fact that the author is a physicist by trade.  And everyone who knows me knows I have a thing for physicists--and ones who are novelists even more so.  Yeah, I said these were idiosyncratic criteria, but whatever gets you to pick up the book, right?I'd describe the story as a science thriller or techno-thriller, another big plus.  Finding good novels in that sub-genre is rare indeed, and this one was good enough to place the author firmly on my radar moving forward.  At the heart of the tale are a trio of tech entrepreneurs seeking venture capital for some very next-gen virtual reality simulations.  You. Are. There.  And in the case of their demo, the there you're in is inside the body and, really, the mind of a hunting polar bear.  The simulation is remarkable, and while there is plenty of interest in funding this technology, the money men may not have the same idealistic environmental and educational goals as the technology's designers.That's the jumping off point of a tale that travels in many unexpected directions.  And a few readers may find these dramatic twists to be over the top, but I was more than willing to go along for the ride.  I found Stephens characters to be interesting people with whom to spend time.  They were well-drawn by thriller standards.  (In other words, you can only expect so much character development.)  The novel moved a good pace and kept me turning pages rapidly.  Very much in keeping with the virtual reality theme, one of the Stephens' greatest strengths was in his ability to write evocative settings and scenes.  For example, a large section of the book takes place in and around Somalia.  I read it shortly before seeing the film Captain Philips.  I had to laugh while watching the film.  I think those filmmakers must have used some of the same research sources, so overlapping was some of the material!This novel pushed he boundaries of technology and science, but was clearly well-researched and kept things within the realm of reasonable suspension of disbelief.  While there were some familiar thriller elements, Stephens story felt pretty fresh to me.  It was a great first impression, and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what he comes up with next.  As far as I'm concerned, a writer who knows science, storytelling, and pacing is a treasure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ4S4LPRJ2YAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611099196#wasThisHelpful","RZ4S4LPRJ2YAG","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review should probably start with two confessions:1. I haven't owned an iron in about 20 years, and;2. I hate reading directions for appliances.About the iron thing...  I basically never learned to iron properly.  I blame my mother.  My solution has been banishing linen from my wardrobe and lots of steaming in the shower.  to say that this Rowenta DR6015 Ultrasteam Brush is needed is an understatement.Because I don't like having to resort to reading the directions, my goal is to find products that are completely intuitive out of the box.  On that score, the steamer passed with flying colors.  It was a piece of cake to figure out and use.  I still haven't glanced at the enclosed instructions.My first test was a new polyester blouse I brought home from the store with wrinkles from being folded in a box deeply imbedded.  By the time my steaming was done, seriously, you couldn't tell that it wasn't fresh from the dry cleaners.  The results were excellent.That said, here are a few other observations.  Obviously, the steamer will be more effective on some fabrics than on others.  I've also done well with wool slacks and a fairly wide variety of garments, but I still have no plans to integrate linen into my wardrobe.  I'd also strongly advise testing the steamer on a small, unnoticeable part of your garment if you're not sure about using a steamer on it.  Because this steamer really puts out a significant amount of liquid.  It doesn't spurt or sputter or anything, but it still might be too much for, say, a delicate silk blouse.  Hand in hand with the above, I'll mention that the receptacle that you fill with water isn't that big, and it runs dry fairly quickly.  I was very mildly annoyed by the need for multiple refills.  At least, when you do have to refill, the wait time for producing steam is negligible.You may have noticed that I haven't mentioned the brush capability yet.  Yeah, I'm not entirely sure what that's for.  But I'm sure when I have the right garment, I'll figure it out.  So far I haven't used either optional brush head.  Your mileage may vary.  This steamer is designed to be travel-friendly, and it is reasonably so.  It comes with a nice travel bag.  It's a smidge bulky for carry-on luggage, but that will be your call.  Heck, if everything you pack is going to be wrinkled, it's probably worth the loss of packing space.final verdict on this steamer is a big thumbs up.

"My home is filled with Apple products, and consequently, I have speaker docks in pretty much every room.  I am constantly charging something or other.  I am very well set up for my Apple-friendly lifestyle--or I was, until they changed the frickin' 30-pin connector!  I was understandably resistant to upgrading to an iPhone 5, which would be incompatible with every accessory I already own.  This Honeywell Speaker Dock with Lightning Connector and Bluetooth is basically my move into the future.  Grrrr.So, already at the house I have three Phillips speaker docks, and one Sony.  I've been extremely happy with all four units.  Philips, in particular, makes a nice product for a reasonable price.  When I get a new speaker dock, the first criteria I judge it by is sound quality.  My immediate response in this case was disappointment.  Out of the box, this Honeywell dock was probably the least impressive of the docks I own.  Not terrible, mind you, but not great.  Then, I discovered that the device had some pre-set equalizer settings: rock, jazz, etc.  And once I started playing music on the ""classical"" setting, it was like night and day.  The sound quality was far richer and more dynamic--not just for classical, but for all kinds of music.  This unit still wouldn't be my first recommendation for a serious audiophile, but with a little adjustment you'll find it to be just fine.The bluetooth capability works fine.  Pairing it with my phone was easy-peasy, though the functions, in general, are not super intuitive.  (I hate having to read directions, don't you?)  But the bluetooth connection was strong, and held for some distance and even traveled through a wall or two.  With the bluetooth connection,you play music from any bluetooth compatible device, so it doesn't need to be an Apple product, but you can only charge an iPhone 5 or higher.The speaker dock has several other features worth mentioning:* The unit has a sleek design highly reminiscent of a shiny silver football in size and shape.  It's a bit bachelor pad looking in my opinion, but it works for some.* There's a quite good radio integrated into the unit, as well as a good alarm clock feature.* It comes equipped with a remote control for help with setting features, controlling volume, etc.  Honestly, that too is a little bachelor paddish in my opinion.  It's a tiny little thing, and it's probably easier to just access most controls on the dock itself.All in all, this is a perfectly fine speaker dock.  If I sound like I'm damning it with faint praise it's only because I'm comparing it to some other units that I like a little better.  This may be exactly the right choice for you, but before you make a final decision, you might want to do a bit of comparison shopping.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8NBF9A79GNDZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F0EB50A#wasThisHelpful","R8NBF9A79GNDZ","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Are you like me?  Do you find yourself using certain kitchen implements loooong past the date when they've outlived their utility?  Partly it's because I'm poor, and partly it's because I don't think about it.  But my ""non-stick"" (I use the term loosely) frying pans are a case in point.  They stick.  A lot.  That's just the nature of the beast; Teflon or whatever loses efficacy over time.  It happens gradually and we ignore it and think that of course making an omelet is a big mess.  And so it goes--until suddenly there's a new frypan or sautÃ© pan in the kitchen, and you remember just how easy certain basic tasks can be, and what some perfectly browned chicken looks like, how appealing it is!So, I didn't wise up and treat myself to a new two-pack of frying pans.  Treat myself?  What?  I was offered the opportunity to review these pans.  And it has been revelatory, a real eye-opener.  Because these are not high-end pans.  Nor are they expensive.  And they work so much RADICALLY better than what I've been using that it's like night and day!  Cooking is easier, and clean-up is much easier.  The quality of my food is better.  Ad there's one more thing--with a non-stick pan which actually doesn't stick, I can cook using significantly less fat, so I'm cooking healthier.For the above reasons, I'm making a resolution:  frying pans are now semi-disposable items.  I'm only using one of the two pans that came in this two-pack.  When this one wears out, I'll swap in the second.  And for approximately $20 a piece, I can afford to replace a frypan annually without even thinking twice about it.  It may seem ridiculous, but I feel seriously excited about this resolution.

"At the time I ordered this ION Clipster Ultra-Portable Bluetooth Speaker with Built-In Clip, I just thought it would be a cool and occasionally useful toy to have.  One day later, the speaker on my iPhone died permanently.  What are the odds?  My ION Clipster is now invaluable!The speaker is well-designed.  It's small--about the size of my hand--and very lightweight.  It's light because it's made of plastic.  I saw someone else come t that it would be nice and feel more substantial if the clip were metal, and it's true, but the plastic and hardware all seems to be of excellent quality and up to the task.I listen to a lot of audiobooks, and one of the reasons I wanted this speaker was so that I'd be able to listen to a higher quality or louder speaker than the (formerly functional) one on my phone when I was, say, cooking in the kitchen, or wanting to share a passage with my book group.  Interestingly, the volume and sound quality of this speaker when playing books from my Audible account is not exceptionally good.  However, when playing music (which I also do, of course) the sound quality and volume are both excellent.  The difference is like night and day.  Clearly, the speaker is equalized for optimal music sound, and as that's how most people would use it, they should be very happy with the output of this once ident little device.Recharging the speaker's battery via a mini-USB connection is easy, and in my experience the battery life is significantly better than what is promised.

"I've been baking for decades, and consider myself a somewhat serious baker.  Every time I pick up a baking book, I never know if what I'm holding will be too elementary or too complex.  Not to sound all Goldilocks about it, but Better Homes and Gardens Baking was just right!  First, it's an extensive resource.  As it states on the cover, it contains ""more than 350 recipes plus tips and techniques.""  It is truly written to offer something to every baker, with easy-to-follow instructions for those just starting out, and a good selection of foundational recipes, as well as more complex and sophisticated fare.  Recipes run from the usual and expected to others that were unusual and creative.  Additionally, there's a nice selection of savory baking dishes mixed in with the sweet.I can and will spend hours perusing this book.  There are so many recipes I'm ranking in order to try.  The ones I've tested so far pass with flying colors.  I could not be more delighted with this collection, and would recommend Better Homes and Gardens Baking as a worthwhile reference for any baker!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GLV0KABLGN3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118453263#wasThisHelpful","R1GLV0KABLGN3C","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read a lot of novels.  A LOT.  And after a while, stories tend to blend together.  It's not that they're not good, but how many variations of boy meets girl, boy loses girl can a person read?  It is noteworthy, therefore, when you stumble upon something truly different, truly original.  The People in the Trees is that novel.The novel opened with a bang, in the form of two news articles describing the arrest and conviction of a Nobel Laureate scientist for the rape of one of his 43 adopted children!  Now, that's sensational enough, but the news accounts recounted the work that had brought Norton Perina his acclaim.  It's an extraordinary tale!  Debut novelist Hanya Yanagihara sums things up succinctly just a few pages into the novel:""He once remarked to me that his life did not begin in any meaningful way until he left the country for U'ivu, where he would make discoveries that would transform modern medicine and lead to his receipt of the Nobel Prize.  In 1950, when he was twenty-five, he made his first trip to the then obscure Micronesian country, a trip that would change his life--and revolutionize the scientific community--forever.  While in U'ivu, he lived among a ""lost tribe"" that would come to be called the Opa'ivu'eke people on what was then known (among U'ivuans, at least) as the ""Forbidden Island"" of Ivu'ivu, the largest in the country's small formation.  It was there that he discovered a condition--an undocumented condition, one never before studied--that was effecting the native population.  The U'ivuans were known (and to some extent are still known) for the brevity of their lifespans.  But while on Ivu'ivu, Norton encountered a group of islanders who were living far beyond a normal lifespan: twenty, fifty, even a hundred years longer.  There were two other components that made this discovery even more remarkable: first, that while the effected persons did not physically age, they did mentally deteriorate; and second, that their condition was not congenital but acquired.Never had men gotten closer to eternal life than they did with Norton's discovery.  And yet never had such a wonderful promise slipped away so quickly: a secret found, a secret lost, all within the space of a decade.""Okay, seriously, I get chills just rereading that!  If the two paragraphs above are not enough to pique your interest, cut your losses and move on now.  The passage above is related by one of the two narrative voices in the novel, that of Ronald Kubodera, friend and colleague of Norton Perina.  It is Ronald that convices Norton to write his memoir from prison, and the story of his life is told in Norton's voice, with interjections from Ronald.  This tale is a jaw-dropper!That said, this novel is not for every reader.  The character at the heart of the story is not a likeable person.  That's something of an understatement, a fact readers may get an inkling of early on when he states, ""I rather enjoyed killing the mice.""  Norton Perina is both an odd duck and a cold fish.  But the question that lingers is this: Is he a pedophile?  What exactly happened in Micronesia, and how had events possibly led to his conviction and imprisonment!  There are parts of this novel that will make some readers deeply uncomfortable, and others will simply balk at spending time with an unlikable protagonist.Yanagihara does such an amazing job of selling her tale, there were times that I had to stop and remind myself that it was all make-believe.  All of it.  I was deeply immersed in the story being told.  She invents every detail of this people, culture, and environment.  Well, maybe not the environment.  Yanagihara's background is in travel writing, so she comes by that part honestly enough.  But her prose is gorgeous.  This is a literary novel that defies easy characterization.  All I know is that I read The People in the Trees a few months ago.  Most books quickly fade away, but this one has stayed with me.  It is a truly auspicious debut, and I cannot wait to see what Hanya Yanagihara comes up with next!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K0B2TE82QW4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385536771#wasThisHelpful","R1K0B2TE82QW4Z","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of Barry Lancet's debut novel Japantown grabbed my attention immediately.  I'd lived two blocks from San Francisco's Japantown for more than a decade.  Sure enough, it was my old neighborhood that was the novel's setting.  And I don't know about you, but I love fiction set in areas I'm very familiar with.This can be a double-edged sword, of course.  If they get the setting right, awesome.  If it's all wrong, well, that's a problem.  I'm happy to report that Mr. Lancet has done his homework.  He does a good job portraying the neighborhood and the city of San Francisco evocatively.  This is important, because his tale of murder and mayhem is pure San Francisco noir.The catalyst for the tale is the gruesome murder of an entire family--including young children--of Japanese tourists.  There is no immediate motive for the crime.  There is also little evidence to go on, with the exception of an unusual Japanese character left at the scene like a calling card.  Not sure where to turn in the case, the SF Police call in Jim Brodie as a consultant.  Brodie is an Asian antiques dealer in town, an American raised in Japan.  In Japan, the family business was a detective and security firm that Brodie inherited from his former-cop father.  He keeps his fingers in both worlds.  For him its Asian arts AND martial arts.  Brodie is also the widowed father of a six-year-old girl, and this murder appears to have ties to his own tragedy.So, in this debut we've got a fine atmospheric setting, a complex protagonist with an unusual background and somewhat idiosyncratic interests, and finally, an intriguing mystery that will keep readers guessing til the end.  Along the way, they'll be introduced to an exotic culture by a writer who knows whence he speaks.  I feel confident that we'll be seeing more of Mr. Brodie.  I look forward to seeing what comes next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25EYHGXVMPQBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451691696#wasThisHelpful","R25EYHGXVMPQBQ","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a mom, I'm just the clueless aunt.  Gift-giving time for my two nephews can be panic-inducing.  Firstly, I don't know from boys.  And they already seem to have just about every toy under the sun.  I never know what to get them!My eldest nephew is about five and a half.  The nice thing about that is that he's finally old enough to enjoy some more interesting and complex toys.  Last year my mom (the grandma) told me that Imaginext made really good toys.  My Imaginext gift last Hanukkah was a big hit, so I'm sticking with what works.  Now my nephew already owns every type of car/truck/plane/superhero/etc.  But he doesn't own an awesome walking, roaring, shooting dinosaur.  That is an item to stand out from the pack of everyday vehicles.  (Now I haven't given this to him yet, so I don't know what his response will be.  I'll update the review to let you know if it's a hit or miss.)  The one concern I had was the roaring.  When he was younger, loud noises like that scared him.  But now that he's nearing six, I think it will be okay.I'm a girly aunt.  I don't like vehicles, sports, superheros, etc.  The only area of common interest I have with young boys are things like animals, monsters, and dinosaurs.

My youngest nephew is two and a half now.  He'll soon be transitioning into his ""big boy"" room.  One thing he doesn't have is a projecting lamp for his bedroom.

"When I left home at the age of 20 (this is decades ago now), my mother gifted me her ancient hand-mixer.  And it seemed like I had that thing forever.  It was virtually indestructible.  Now, I no longer remember why I eventually replaced it, but in the years since, I've never had a hand-mixer like it.  These days, things seem to be built with planned obsolescence in mind.  I've gone through at least a half-dozen mixers in the years since.  They're not built to last.Still, there's always pleasure in acquiring a shiny, new tool for the kitchen, and the Oster FPST2574CRBW 6 Speed Hand Mixer with Stainless Steel Mixing Bowl has several nice features.  Now, I haven't exactly been scouring the hand-mixer market, but I've never before owned one that comes with its own bowl.  It's a really useful size (not too big and not too small), has its own lid (perfect for stashing leftover cookie dough in the fridge, etc.), and is ideal for storing the mixer in.  It's nice and neat, no tangled cord snaking through your cupboards.As for the mixer itself, it is perfectly functional.  It does indeed have six speeds, a range that should be appropriate to handle a wide variety of recipes.  It beats smoothly, and while obviously there's noise, it is not excessive.  The stainless steel beaters are of standard design, and are easy to attach and remove.  One disappointment is the lack of a pair of whisking beaters, but you can't have everything.For me, the ultimate test of this machine will be its longevity.  Will it hold up to the thickest doughs?  Years of Thanksgiving mashed potatoes?  Or will I be in the market for a new mixer in two or three years?

"I was introduced to Jincy Willett's work many years ago with her novel Winner of the National Book Award.  It's been a long time, but I remember it being very dark and very funny.  She hasn't been wildly prolific in the years since, but she's a writer who has remained firmly on my radar.  Therefore, when I read the description of her latest, Amy Falls Down, it sounded like absolutely the perfect match for this writer.  To be honest, I was expecting a fairly scathing satire of the publishing industry.  In the end, Willett's bark was worse than her bite.The protagonist of the tale is a novelist named Amy Gallup.  While she was once a well-reviewed and rising literary star, that was years and years ago.  Today she ekes out a living teaching slightly misfit wanna-be writers.  She hasn't done any serious writing or publishing in years.  The catalyst of the story is a nasty fall Amy takes right before an interview with a journalist.  Amy is concussed and somewhat altered.  She says things she would not ordinarily say.  And slowly, and then more quickly, word begins to spread.  Suddenly, Amy is the new voice of TRUTH and ART.  Her very ordered life begins to change in myriad ways.That is actually a terrific premise.  And the book was enjoyable.  But, as I alluded above, it wasn't nearly as dark or as biting as I expected.  It was a fairly gentle satire.  It's not surprising that Willett would have affection for her creation...  I hate conflating authors with their creations, but having visited Willett's website, I can't help but feel that Amy is very much an extension of the author's own sensibility.Amy Falls Down is well written.  It is funny.  But it wasn't a page turner.  I enjoyed the shots she took at various writerly archetypes and all sorts of publishing industry figures.  (Her agent was especially amusing.)  In the end it was good, but not quite the book I'd hoped for.  I'll still be looking forward to see where Jincy Willett goes next.  She's a great comic novelist, and they are rare indeed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF8G0B0JDK1BA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250028272#wasThisHelpful","RF8G0B0JDK1BA","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For better or worse, I have never had a close relationship with anyone with Asperger's syndrome or on the autism spectrum.  As such, it's somewhat hard to understand the differences in their behavior and thought processes.  Fiction is one of the best ways I know to attempt to understand other people.  It allows you to get inside their heads.  And so lately, I've been reading a few novels that are helping me to understand Asperger's syndrome.The latest is Australian writer Graeme Simsion's debut novel, The Rosie Project.  In it, readers are introduced to genetics researcher and professor Don Tilman.  As the novel opens, Don's well-organized schedule has been thrown into turmoil by the necessity to fill-in for his best friend Gene, a psychology professor, in giving a lecture on Asperger's syndrome.  As Don educates his audience, novelist Simsion educates his readers.  One thing becomes clear; Don does not understand that he has a classic Asperger's profile.  Later, Gene's wife asks, ""Did the symptoms remind you of anyone?""  And Don thinks, ""They certainly did.  They were an almost perfect description of Laszlo Hevesi in the Physics Department.""  So, self-awareness is not his strongest suit.  Neither, it seems, is romance.  Don relates:""I am 39-years-old, tall, fit, and intelligent, with a relatively high status and above-average income as an associate professor.  Logically, I should be attractive to a wide range of women.  In the animal kingdom, I would succeed in reproducing.However, there is something about me that women find unappealing.  I have never found it easy to make friends, and it seems that the deficiencies that caused this problem have also affected my attempts at romantic relationships.""Don first christens this issue the Wife Problem, but after inspiration strikes, it morphs into the Wife Project.  Don is good with a project on his hands.  As it happens, he has two going.  In the course of the Wife Project, Don meets Rosie.  He quickly determines that she is NOT what he is looking for, but he does seem to enjoy being around her.  Rosie has a problem of her own--the question of her paternity.  This becomes the Father Project.  And so, throughout the brief comic novel, Don and Rosie have continuing reasons to interact.  Don makes sure of it.Don is a very different romantic lead.  In my ignorance, the best comparison I can come up with is Spock-like.  But, hey, that nurse on the Enterprise had the hots for Spock.  Will Don and Rosie find what they're looking for?  Do they even know what they want and what they need?  These are the questions of this quick, light romantic comedy.And there is definitely humor to be found within these pages (""Fortunately, I am accustomed to creating amusement inadvertently.""); though a little of Don goes a long way.  Simsion was smart not to drag the tale out.  Each of the protagonists is appealing in their own way, and you do want them to find happiness.  The writing was fine, if unremarkable.  I have to confess that I was somewhat annoyed by the completely unrealistic depiction of the genetic testing.  Yes, I get that that's not the focus, but it was his career and a major plot point.  It really should be noted that you can't do DNA testing in a matter of minutes.  More than anything, it was fascinating getting inside this very unusual character's head.  As Don says, ""I was wired differently.""  All in all, an entertaining debut.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPUUWTLEAQ6BZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476729085#wasThisHelpful","RPUUWTLEAQ6BZ","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I heard about this novel's audacious high-concept premise several months before its publication.  Marketing copy said: ""A terrifying debut novel about the evil in each of us: when clones of infamous serial killers escape from a secret government facility, it's up to a former Army Ranger to stop them... with the help of a teenage killer clone.""And I was basically like: You had me at `clones of infamous serial killers.'  I mean, with a premise like that, it was either going to be unbelievably awesome or excruciating bad.  Execution would be everything.  And I am officially declaring Geoffrey Girard's debut thriller UNBELIEVABLY AWESOME.  If Cain's Blood doesn't rocket to the top of the bestseller list in the land of Hannibal Lecter, well, there is no justice in the world of publishing.  And, of course, there isn't, so who knows.Okay, back to the story...  Honestly, beyond the blurb above, there's nothing you really need to know.  Well, I'll mention that teenage helper is an innocent, 15-year-old clone of Jeffrey Dahmer.  Oh yeah, Girard's not playing around.  This novel is a who's who of serial murder, with appearances by Ted Bundy, David Berkowitz, Ed Gein, etc.  The gang's all here.  As I stated above, execution is everything with a premise this bold.  Mr. Girard starts things off provocatively by giving readers a prologue in the form of ""A Brief History of Cloning"" in which he writes, ""Cloning humans, by the way, is still completely legal in the United States, everyone just assumes it's not.""  Uh, I certainly did.  Mr. Girard has done his homework on everything from genetics to the differences between psychopaths and sociopaths:""About one half of one percent of Americans could be diagnosed as sociopaths or psychopaths.  So says the National Institute of Mental Health... There are degrees to everything.  Ninety-eight percent of that two million are only sociopaths, and most sociopaths are little more than flaming a**holes... Guys with no regard for the feelings and rights of others.  Care only about Number One, steal for the hell of it, moody guys who screw over coworkers, start bar fights out of boredom, won't talk to their kids...that kind of thing.  True psychopaths are much, much rarer.  The difference is important, and also horrible.""  [I've condensed the quote above with ellipses.]How is that not fascinating?  When it comes to science thrillers, the science doesn't have to be rock solid, but you have to make me believe it.  Mr. Girard did a laudable job of making his outrageous premise plausible.  And there was neither too much nor too little of the science.  He got the balance just right.Now, obviously a tale like this lives and dies with plotting and pace.  Honestly, there wasn't a whole lot to the plot.  Some bad dudes escaped and a good, if damaged, soldier had to round them up.  But within that simple structure, Girard kept his tale lively, offered up some surprises, and kept things moving at a lightning pace.  Turning pages was not only effortless, it was mandatory.  I can't imagine that any reader will be surprised to learn that this novel is full of the most lurid and graphic kind of violence.  It's definitely not for everyone.  I'm not generally a fan of gratuitous violence, but I'm not even sure it was gratuitous.  All I know is that I couldn't look away.Character development is not what drives this sort of story.  The damaged soldier thing is a bit of a clichÃ©, but Shane Castillo was a likeable enough protagonist.  And Mr. Girard did a fine job with his teen Dahmer, making him sympathic and creepy all at once.  There is much that is black and white in this tale, but the author also makes good fodder of the moral ambiguities inherent in the situation.  Should Cain's Blood be your next book club pick?  Probably not.  But I say give yourself a pass and enjoy the guilty pleasure of this very wild ride.And one more note: Cain's Blood is actually one half of Mr. Girard's debut.  It's a complete novel, but he is simultaneously publishing a young adult novel called Project Cain.  It tells the exact same story as this novel, but from the POV of the teen Dahmer.  I haven't read it yet, and I know it will be somewhat redundant, but I have to admit I'm curious.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16YTBTPM0MFIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A281AJK#wasThisHelpful","R16YTBTPM0MFIX","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Early on in the long-awaited conclusion to her MaddAddam trilogy, Margaret Atwood writes:""There's the story, then there's the real story, then there's the story of how the story came to be told.  Then there's what you leave out of the story.  Which is part of the story too.""And in MaddAddam, at last, Ms. Atwood gives us all of the above.It's been a decade since I first read Oryx and Crake, and four years since I read The Year of the Flood.  I loved both books, loved the way the two intertwined and complemented each other.  So, in preparation for this final volume, I started by rereading the first two novels of the trilogy.  Wow, oh wow, did they hold up well!  I realize that not all readers have the time or inclination to revisit books they've already read, but in this case it was well worth the extra effort, if only to fully appreciate the connections between the three novels.  I don't believe that a trilogy was planned when Ms. Atwood wrote Oryx & Crake, and yet it was almost as if she had salted away loose ends a decade ago as part of some subconscious, brilliant master plan.  For those who aren't inclined to follow my suit, MaddAddam helpfully opens with a four-page summary entitled, ""The Story So Far.""  Personally, I wouldn't consider reading this final volume without having first read the prior two at some point.When last we visited with the God's Gardeners, it was the post-pandemic Year of the Flood.  We'd been on a harrowing journey narrated through the eyes and voices of two Gardeners, Toby and Ren.  In MaddAddam, Toby is back as narrator, and while Ren is a secondary character in the novel, I have to admit that I missed her voice.  This time around, the tale is told by Toby alone until late in the novel a surprising second narrative voice emerges.And it's appropriate that Toby tells the tale, because it is primarily (Finally!) the story of Zeb, a man that Toby has secretly desired for years.  Up until now, Zeb has been an enigmatic character, always hard to pin down.  In MaddAddam, it becomes clear that Zeb's history is inextricably linked to that of Adam One and the God's Gardeners, as well as that of Crake and the Crakers.But in addition to looking backward, the story of Toby, Zeb, Snowman, the God's Gardeners, the Crakers, and the ""MaddAddamites"" who engineered them, moves forward.  The whole bunch of them are joined in an uneasy community.  The Crakers are an alien intelligence.  Says one of the MaddAddamites, ""Their brains are more malleable than Crake intended.  They've been doing several things we didn't anticipate during the construction phase.""  Amen to that!  There are many unexpected complications of joining humans and Crakers together, many of them quite comic.  The comic relief is welcome, because Atwood's post-apocalyptic future is dark.  Of all the Craker characters, there is really only one who stands out, a young boy christened Blackbeard.  He befriends Toby, and is, simply put, adorable.  He is also the entrÃ©e for readers into the Craker mind.  Can it possibly be accurate to say he ""humanizes"" them?There are many dangers facing this little tribe.  Probably the most aggressive threat is that of the Painballers--escaped prisoners who have all but lost their humanity.  The matter of humanity is, I think, central to this tale because if humanity is to be measured among the characters, it's a broad spectrum.  The Gardeners and their allies are a fairly admirable bunch, trying to live in peace, sustainably, and protect the Crakers.  While the Crakers have some extraordinary natural defences and abilities, left to their own devices in this harsh world, these childlike beings would surely perish.  The Painballers are entirely human, but have regressed to an almost animalistic state.  And then there are the pigoons--the enormous, genetically-engineered pigs that have acquired an unknown degree of human intelligence in addition to the transplant organ-compatibility they were designed for.  The pigoons are a threat to all constituencies, and in MaddAddam, we learn a great deal more about these animals.I can only write so much here, and yet it is a testament to Ms. Atwood's epic achievement with this final volume that there is so much substance contained within a mere 416 pages.  I want to discuss the role of mythology and written language within this tale, the allegorical elements, the cyclic nature of the story being told, and the connectedness of all things.  And, I want to quote her at length, for the sheer intelligence of her thoughts, and the beauty of her expression of them.  Truly, I could go on and on.She has given us the story, the real story, and how it came to be told.  Ms. Atwood has looked into our future with this trilogy.  She has extrapolated trends in our culture today and carried them into a worst possible tomorrow.  Her work is disturbing because her vision is undeniable.  Different readers will get different messages from this tale, and will take away different lessons.  Despite the darkness, I am left with a feeling of hope.  And a very strong impulse to start talking with the bees.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31DSO50VH6O9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385528787#wasThisHelpful","R31DSO50VH6O9","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The quote above is one of more than a dozen that wrestle with the nature of truth in this second novel by writer, globe-hopper, and former-Python, Michael Palin.  At the heart of this struggle is Keith Mabbut.  Keith was once a crusading investigative journalist, but the hard realities of life have turned him into more of a paid corporate hack.  Having just wrapped his latest commissioned work, he's finally about to indulge in a passion project, his first novel.  He queries Tess, a lady friend:""'Do you prefer fact or fiction?'`Oh, fiction every time.  I hate facts.'`Why?'`Facts are just facts.'  She shrugged dismissively.  `They don't amount to a row of beans.  If you want the truth, read Jane Austen.'""Tess has a point, but hers is one of many views that are examined in this morality play.  Interrupting Keith's well-laid plans is his agent with the best offer he's received in years.  It's a commission to write a book about the reclusive activist Hamish Melville.  For decades, Melville has been a tireless defender of the environment and a crusader on behalf of indigenous peoples.  And he's ducked the press entirely, creating quite the aura of mystery:""I'm not interested in talking about myself.  I'm interested in what I can do, in the time left to me, to prevent a little of the damage we seem hell bent on inflicting on this long-suffering planet.  I'm not the story.""After some internal wrangling, Keith does accept the assignment, along with the punishing six-month deadline.  Now all he has to do is unearth a man that no one can find.  This leads Keith on a journey far from his comfortable London existence.  Eyes are opened.  Much is learned.  And, indeed, a book is produced.  But when the manuscript is submitted at last, the nature of ""the truth"" again comes into question.  Whose truth?  And how many of the parties involved have their own agendas that have nothing to do with the truth?Palin, himself, is a writer who has delved into both fact and fiction--with fact winning out a majority of the time.  The man has exhaustively documented his travels to the remotest corners of the world, and it's clear that his personal experience has colored the tale he's chosen to tell.  And he tells his tale well in the clear, clean, elegant prose that seems to come so naturally to the British.The Truth is more character-driven than plot-driven, but as the novel moved towards its inevitable conclusion, I found myself turning pages faster.  I had gotten caught up in the story and was hungry for the revelations that finally came.  As the character at the center of this study, Keith Mabbut makes a fine protagonist.  He's likeable, idealistic, kind-hearted, and yet still somewhat foolish and flawed.  His personal life is in a fair amount of disarray.  At the age of 56, he's got a lot to learn and he knows it.I remember reading Palin's debut, Hemingway's Chair, 15 years ago and anticipating some Python-esque comic novel.  That gentle story couldn't have been further from what I was expecting.  This time my expectations were more in line.  The Truth also features a certain gentleness and civility--and yes, of course, some humor--but there's nothing over-the-top or wacky about the tale.  It may not be the novel one would expect from a comic genius, but it looks with clear-eyed affection at the human condition.Says one character of the events depicted:""It would be an interesting cautionary tale.  And I trust you enough to know that you would tell it honestly, but charitably, too.  Everyone, no matter how admirable they appear to be, is simply human.  Prone to all the imperfections, temptations and mendacities that go with the territory.""Ain't it the truth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26Z3L2STMFWEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250028248#wasThisHelpful","R26Z3L2STMFWEN","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""It used to be you were stuck with your own personality, your own identity, and any adjustments to your persona would only be as successful as your acting ability.  That all changed with the introduction of Big Egos.Not everyone wants to alter who they are, to live a life that isn't theirs and pretend to be someone they're not.  There are plenty of men and women who are perfectly content with their lives and their struggles and the comforts of their own identities.  But for those who can afford it, for those who seek the thrill of experimenting with alternate personalities and temporary identities, Big Egos offers a respite from the mundane...On CBS is an advertisement for Big Egos, `Does your lifestyle not fit the person inside of you?  Try someone else on for size!  For $3,000, you can change who you are by purchasing a DNA-encoded cocktail of your favorite dead actor, artist, writer, musician, singer, athlete, politician, talk show host, or television star.  All legally approved by their respective estates, because if there's one thing estate holders love, it's money.  You can even purchase an officially-licensed fictional character like the Luke Skywalker, the Mary Poppins, or the Harry Potter...'""*****The quote above sums up well the premise of S. G. Browne's latest novel, Big Egos, set in the world as we know it with this one notable exception.  Our first-person narrator works in quality control for Big Egos, so he's an insider, an endorser, and a high-volume user of this product.  He's also a man in a less than satisfying relationship, and he's experiencing serious second thoughts about having talked his best friend into his first ego trip:""I never should have introduced Nat to the world of Big Egos.  Not that I haven't enjoyed spending time with him.  We've spent at least one night a week over the past month going to ego parties and bar hopping, pretending to be Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  I'd almost forgotten how much fun we could have together.""That does sound like fun, doesn't it?  But there's a dark side to this technology, and Browne's light tale gradually becomes nefarious, heading in unexpected directions.  Regardless, there are laughs to be mined from start to finish.  First and foremost, Mr. Browne is a social satirist, and this set-up provides rich ground for examining contemporary culture.Additionally, the author has great fun with the personas of the many famous characters that pass through his pages.  It's affectionate satirizing reminiscent of the film Midnight in Paris.  The following snippet even features an eminently imitable character that appeared in that film, but Mr. Browne is playing with a much broader cross-section of popular culture.  Always, however, it's the extensive literary parody that I can't resist:""Give me a boat,"" says Hemingway.  ""And the open sea.  Nothing else matters.""""What about complex sentences?"" says Faulkner.As for his own writing, Browne's use of language is smooth, unobtrusive, and peppered with amusing observations:""Every day, Emily brings a Cinnabon with her to work, and nibbles at it and picks at it, until it's nothing but a corpse of a cinnamon roll.  A pastry victim, gutted and left for dead on her desk like breakfast roadkill.""Character development is a lot trickier.  It's hard to get to know characters that are constantly shifting personas.  His narrator is a slick operator with a distinctive voice.  The rest of the cast is more superficially developed.  It should be clear, by now, that this is not a character study.  Browne keeps his plot moving forward at a steady pace, and Big Egos is a quick and entertaining read.  Consider it required reading for all pop-culture junkies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UUV48DGL0HQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476711674#wasThisHelpful","R1UUV48DGL0HQH","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently read Austin Grossman's sophomore novel, You, and the tale of games and gamers didn't speak to me.  However, even I could see that it was well-written and not a bad book.  Rather than discouraging me from reading more of his work, it inspired me to at last read his debut novel, Soon I Will Be Invincible.  What a good decision!  God, I laughed and laughed and just loved it!  Based on this book alone, I will be sure to read Grossman's next work promptly.The funny thing is, I didn't relate well to the computer gamers of You and I am equally disinterested in the super heroes and super villains of Soon I Will Be Invincible.  I can't stand comic book stories--but I do like making fun of them.  And Austin Grossman is having an absolute hoot playing with well-worn tropes.  It's all done with great affection.Told in alternating chapters from the points-of-view of super villain Doctor Impossible and superhero Fatale (as in femme), the actual plot of the tale is largely irrelevant.  It's all about the comic book tropes.  I recognized them even as the fast and furious plot twists were unfolding.  I'd groan and think, ""Of course!""  For instance, at one point the evil genius narrates:""'You won't be laughing when I move the--' I start to say, the plan I've concocted in prison on the tip of my tongue.  Why do I always tell people my plans? ""But in the addition to the many, many laughs, Grossman infuses some humanity into his larger-than-life characters.  Fatale explains:""I know what it's like.  Your powers are what you always have with you.  It's one piece of knowledge we all share here.  No matter how many dossiers the government keeps on you, no matter what data your enemies have collected, no one knows your powers the way you do.  Everyone has seen them on TV.  For everyone else, it's a momentary fantasy.  They don't have to take them into the kitchen, the bathroom, and the bedroom.  Or wake up in the night in flames, or sweep up shattered glass in their apartment, or show up late for work with a black eye.  No one else knows where they itch or bruise you, or has tried the things you've tried with them when you were bored or desperate.  No one else falls asleep with them and finds them still there in the morning, a dream that won't disperse upon waking.""I think the language above is beautiful.  The man can write.  As you can see, Grossman's work covers quite an emotional spectrum, but rest assured that he keeps things light most of the time.  I found myself wanting to quote passages aloud because they were so funny, even more so in the context of his over-the-top tale.  Soon I Will Be Invincible actually reminded me a lot of another favorite--Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along-Blog.  Both works use humor and pathos to illuminate the lives of their cartoonish characters.  I can only hope that Mr. Grossman takes another page from the comics and one day writes a sequel.  As you know, no prison can hold Doctor Impossible!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XUEL5VVVUW86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307279863#wasThisHelpful","R2XUEL5VVVUW86","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There can be no doubt that 2013 is the year of the short story for me.  I'm reading at least one collection a month, and by and large they've been superlative.  He bar has been set very, very high, is what I'm saying.  I was looking forward to continuing this trend with my introduction to the writing of Sam Lipsyte, a writer I've long been meaning to check out.  And his latest collection, The Fun Parts, is very nice, but it simply can't compare to recent collections by George Saunders, Karen Russell, Jess Walters, etc.I've commented in reviews of other collections that I've never really been a great fan of short stories.  Often they seem unfinished to me.  I'm still waiting for the rest of the tale.  I've been rethinking that position lately, but I have to admit that many of Mr. Lypsyte's stories gave me exactly that feeling.  That said, he's a very fine writer.  The stories were diverse and entertaining.  There was indeed much humor and fun pervading many of the tales, though some of the humor ran a bit dark.  He also has a great feel for character.  Never was this more evident than in the collection's first story, about a dissatisfied pre-school teacher named Tovah.  Within pages, readers get a very real feel for Tovah, and she is sort of hilarious.  She's the center of ""The Climber Room,"" but Lypsyte's tales share a universe.  That isn't the last we see of her.  So while I was left wanting to know more after that introduction--and especially the provocative note the story ends on--in a sense, I got what I asked for.Other stories were more or less successful from that strong opening.  ""The Dungeon Master"" was probably a low point for me.  I just couldn't connect with its teenage, male, gamer characters at all.  But ""Deniers"" was fascinating.  I was about to launch into a plot description, but invariably I lose steam when attempting to describe story after story.  So let me simply write a few more words about the collection as a whole.Mr. Lypsyte's use of language is a pleasure to read.  As noted above, he's pretty fantastic with character development.  His stories were interesting, creative, and highly original.  If there was an over-arching theme to this collection, I'm not sure I got it.  Basically, I have a lot of good to say about his work.  I just think that for this particular author, I would probably enjoy his novels more than his stories.  That's as it's always been with me.  I am merely reverting to form.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25WFR6HZEG22J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374298904#wasThisHelpful","R25WFR6HZEG22J","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is not unusual for me to start reading a novel with little or no idea what it's about.  Oh, something caught my interest at some point, but who knows what it was by the time I open the covers.  Therefore, it's not all that surprising that it took me a while to get a handle on the central plot of Australian novelist St. John Karp's debut, Radium Baby.  It is a quirky tale.  Forgive me; I am likely to use the ""Q"" word a lot.  It is also strange, weird, and very, very funny.I don't even know where to start.  The teenage protagonist of the tale, Sam Ticky, hails from a small town in Oklahoma.  The year is 1927, and Sam has found his calling working at the Radium Baths, where bathers can seek ""a salubrious infusion of radioactive salts.""  Ah, it was an innocent age, 1927 was.  People were still taking mercury for their health, along with products like June Kennedy's Prune Remedy (which is mentioned passingly in the text, and which I repeat here simply because it's fun to say).  Karp's 1927 may bear some similarities to the one in the history books, but there are more than a few discrepancies.  The preeminent scientists of the era had been Valerie and Alexander Pepperpot:""Together Valerie and Alexander invented all kinds of things.  They invented the hamster wheel, the hamster cage, and the hamster feeder, then rounded off their list of achievements by inventing the hamster.  This last one posed some difficulties, but eventually they struck success by breeding a horse and a wheel of Swiss cheese.  They invented the one-armed guitar, the electric dime and the color orange.  There was no problem they couldn't solve, and nothing ever held their interest for more than a couple weeks.Until they found out about radioactivity.""Alas, it is this last area of investigation that spells their doom.  Well, specifically a dinner recipe from Marie Curie.  They've been gone for years when one day, shortly before his death, Sam's adoptive father confesses that he (Sam) was really the lost infant of Valerie and Alexander Pepperpot.  After which, life goes on unchanged for Sam.  Eventually, fate comes calling, however, in the form of a radio network's high-profile quest to uncover the missing ""Radium Baby,"" heir to the couple's fortune.  Sam is one of the three likely candidates that will be competing for the title in what is essentially an old-fashioned relative of reality television.  And so Sam, two additional teenage competitors, and several judges and sponsors embark on a globe-hopping adventure designed to ferret out which of the three is the true heir.Does that sound ridiculous?  It is ridiculous!  And so very quirky.  Karp's Australian humor reflects its British heritage, and the man does have a way with description:""At last, Mrs. Cholmondeley exited the changing room dressed in a circus tent.  It was a huge, flapping muu-muu covering Mrs. Cholmondeley's entire body with enough left over to set sail on a Spanish galleon.  It looked like she was trying to smuggle twelve clowns, two bearded ladies and a troupe of dancing midgets underneath her swimsuit.""Once the competition is underway, the plot takes on some needed forward momentum that was missing in the earlier ""world-building"" portion of the novel.  The exotic locales and the Herculean tasks set before the youngsters are both inventive and entertaining, and Karp throws in more than a few fun twists and turns.  While Sam is the novel's protagonist, he's not always sympathetic, which may be a problem for some readers, as there are few other characters to root for.  They're not the most appealing bunch--although, for better or worse, don't assume you've got a handle on their true colors.You may have guessed by now that Radium Baby is (rightly) being marketed as a young adult novel.  I actually believe the title will be equally enjoyed (or not enjoyed, as the case may be) by readers of all ages.  Simply put, this is not the book for every reader.  It's very different, and while that's a plus in my book, it is sure to put off some.  This is the type of novel that becomes a ""cult"" favorite, never a mainstream one.  The humor is sharp, but highly idiosyncratic.  The plot is fun, clever, and original, and the use of language is--yes, there's that word again--a quirky treat.  My advice is to read a sample on your Kindle or online to see if Radium Baby speaks to you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF07TSDLPPZSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989263002#wasThisHelpful","RF07TSDLPPZSS","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having recently read and greatly enjoyed Max Barry's forthcoming fifth novel, Lexicon, I wanted to revisit the novel that made me his fan.  Especially in light of the fact that Syrup, Barry's debut, was recently adapted as an independent film that will be released in June.Looking back, I can't believe that I first read Syrup way back in 1999.  I was much younger then, a fact that became clear to me as I re-read this very youthful tale.  It makes sense; Barry was only 25 when it was published, so his most mature work it's not.  But it's still a pretty dead-on satire of the marketing, film, and several other industries.  All these years later, the absurdism and language and completely crazy dialogue can still make me laugh out loud.Syrup is the story of Scat.  He was once Michael, but this recent marketing grad knows that you need to create a persona and image to market yourself, and that starts with your name.  In fact, many of the characters of this book have absurd names including: 6, Sneaky Pete, and @.  Carrying the joke even further, Barry's name was printed Maxx on the book's cover, and for years afterwards people misspelled it.  Ah, satire!In any case, young Scat wants to live the American dream.  Having no real skills or talents, extreme youth and extreme wealth will be his chosen path to fame and fortune.  And ""*ukk Cola"" is his million dollar idea.  Doesn't matter how it tastes; image is everything, and Scat's got the important stuff--like the look of the can--all figured out.  The only thing left is to sell the idea to Coke and collect his reward.  Or so he thinks.  What happens next is an astonishing series of back-stabbings, underminings, and reversals.  Marketing (not to mention romance) is a tough business!I've long had very fond memories of this novel.  I'm a bit more middle-aged now, and yeah, some of the hi-jinx seem a little immature, but I still think this is a fairly hysterical novel.  The satire is smart, and years later, rather than seeming dated, it feels truer than ever.  I think Max Barry is a great humorist.  I'd love to see him return to his broad satirical roots someday.  For now, I'll look forward to seeing the film adaptation of Syrup.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ4SPNPH3XL63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140291873#wasThisHelpful","RJ4SPNPH3XL63","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This comic novel out of Sweden has forced me to examine some of my own biases.  If, for example, you asked me to characterize your average centenarian, I might say kind, wise, and most of all harmless.  Of course, that was before I met Allan Karlsson, the protagonist of Jonas Jonasson's international bestseller, The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared.  The lengthy title perfectly describes the opening of the novel, when on the morning of Allan's hundredth birthday he spontaneously decides to make a break for it, with nothing more on his feet than a pair of slippers.  You might not expect this elderly man to get far, but you'd be surprised.I also would not expect this little old man--who's made it as far as the bus station--to immediately steal a suitcase he's asked to watch.  And so an epic road trip begins, with Allan committing crimes and picking up an intriguing cast of compatriots, both human and not, along the way.  There are many adventures and misadventures along the way.If the above story were the only element of the novel, I would find it only so successful.  I actually found Allan to be a rather difficult to fathom character, and not all that sympathetic.  Character development, in general, isn't the novel's strength.  Where it succeeds is with the outlandish humor and with some really delightful plotting.  And nowhere is this more apparent than in the novel's other main storyline, the biographical recounting of Allan's long, colorful, and very historic life.  Much like another well-known fictional character, somehow Allan Karlsson has wandered through or directly impacted many of the major events of the last century.  I could give a list of the events and people, but better to discover them on your own.  His is truly an extraordinary and international life.  And it was this inventive tale that I far preferred over the contemporary goings on.I can't say that this one was a slam dunk, but it was an undeniably fun read.  Mr. Jonasson gets bonus points for the sheer originality and freshness of the tales he tells, and for warning me off from trusting seemingly harmless little old men!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROOLI4QAMUG51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401324649#wasThisHelpful","ROOLI4QAMUG51","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I warn you now, I'm going to gush.The speaker of the above quote is the eponymous Greta Wells, the first-person narrator of Andrew Sean Greer's fourth novel.  We are introduced to her as the story opens.  It's New York City, circa 1985,  the height of the AIDS crisis.  She has just lost her twin brother, Felix--to whom we are introduced in a flashback that occurs not long before his death at the age of thirty-two.  Greta's grief is almost more than she can bear.  When, a few months later, her long-term relationship dissolves, it IS more than she can bear.  A pervading sadness leads her eventually to the door of Dr. Cerletti, who will administer a course of 25 electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatments over a span of 12 weeks.  The doctor warns that she ""might experience some disorientation afterward.""What Greta experiences is more migration than disorientation.  She awakens in a different time, a different life.  A different Greta.  After her first treatment, Greta finds herself in 1918.  World War I is nearly over.  Just as she finds herself inhabiting an altered version of herself there, so too she discovers alternate versions of the most important people in her life: Nathan, the lover who left her; her beloved, bohemian aunt, Ruth; and her brother, Felix.  Alive.After her second ECT treatment, Greta awakens in yet another version of her life.  It is 1941, and America is about to go to war.  Here again are versions of those she loves and a new version of herself and the life she might have lived.  So the months pass, spending a day or a week rotating through these different lives in 1985, 1918, and 1941, each with its own joys and sorrows.  Because, as Greta learns, no life is perfect.That is the set-up of this moving masterpiece of a novel.  Mr. Greer is rather brilliant in his choice of time periods.  The beginning of a war is juxtaposed with the end of a war.  The plague of AIDS is juxtaposed with the Spanish influenza of 1918.  Changing social mores are examined, and our protagonist gets to explore the lives she might have known if some of her fondest wishes and greatest fears came true.  Ultimately, it is up to her to decide the life she will lead, in an eerie echo of her lover's words, ""I leave it to you.""  Greer writes:""A shrew, a wife, a whore.  Those seemed to be my choices.  I ask any man reading this, how could you decide whether to be a villain, a worker, or a plaything?  A man would refuse to choose; a man would have that right.  But I had only three worlds to choose from, and which of them was happiness?  All I wanted was love.  A simple thing, a timeless thing.  When men want love they sing for it, or they smile for it, or pay for it.  And what do women do?  They choose.  And their lives are struck like bronze medallions.  So tell me, gentlemen, tell me the time and place where it was easy to be a woman?""At times, I found it difficult to believe this novel was written by a man, so convincing was the voice of his female protagonist.  I'm not sure how much I related to Greta, but I believed in her--despite a premise that required significant suspension of disbelief.  And I didn't have to love her, because I fell in love with those she loved, none more so than warm and colorful Aunt Ruth, a veritable Mrs. Madrigal of a woman, complete with kimonos.  And I was deeply moved by the relationship of these fraternal twins, so eloquently conveyed by the author, a twin himself.There are many echoes in this brief book.  Echoes of other novels--though Greer's tale is unique.  I found myself reflecting upon stories as diverse as Ken Grimwood's Replay, Jack Finney's Time and Again, and even Baum's Oz!  Greta's life had echoes of other lives, with lines of dialogue recurring like motifs in entirely different circumstances:""When you were a little girl, was this the woman you dreamed of becoming?""""I understood nothing!  But it was a great show!""""If only we just loved who we're supposed to love.""These are brief quotes, but I want to pull long passages from this novel.  Greer's prose is so beautiful it hurts.  Indulge me once more:""They say there are many worlds.  All around our own, packed tight as the cells of your heart.  Each with its own logic, its own physics, moons, and stars.  We cannot go there--we would not survive in most.  But there are some, as I have seen, almost exactly like our own--like the fairy worlds my aunt used to tease us with.  You make a wish, and another world is formed in which that wish comes true, though you may never see it.  And in those other worlds, the places you love are there.  Perhaps in one of them, all rights are wronged and life is as you wish it.  So what if you found the door?  And what if you had the key?  Because everyone knows this:That the impossible happens once to each of us.""I was very fortunate to receive a review copy of this extraordinary novel from the publisher in late 2012.  I held on to it and made it my very first read of 2013.  Will it make my top 10 list for the year?  Absolutely.  Will it be the single best novel I read in 2013?  Very likely.  But more than that, this is the book I will be foisting on friends 20 years from now.  My love of Greta Wells will last a lifetime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F8FOPFK7RP68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062213784#wasThisHelpful","R3F8FOPFK7RP68","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the great things about thrillers is that there are so many different kinds.  There are crime thrillers, medical thrillers, religious thrillers, techno-thrillers, and many more.  Most thrillers tend to fall into one category, but I've just read a notable debut that has elements of all four listed above!Code White is an impressive first effort from medical doctor Scott Britz-Cunningham.  The entire novel takes place in the course of a single day, making for a propulsive plot.  At the heart of the tale is Chicago neurosurgeon Ali O'Day.  She is one of a team of doctors who are attempting to make medical history--and are having it documented live on a national morning television show.  They are using a new technology called SIPNI, short for Self-Integrating Prosthetic Neural Implant, to try to restore the sight of a blind child.  During the operation, there's an overhead announcement, ""Mr. White, please report to security.""  A nurse explains that it's a security code, ""It's a bomb.  A bomb in the hospital.""Readers don't have to wait long to find out who the mastermind of the plot is.  It's not a who-done-it, or even really a why-done-it, but more like a will-they-stop-it?  Isn't that always the way with bombs?  So, in one corner you have your dedicated doctors trying to save an adorable child, in another you have your mad bomber, and then you have law enforcement.  In this novel, that comes in many forms.  The threat is first identified by the hospital's head of security, Harry Lewton, but soon enough both the Chicago PD and the FBI are added to the mix.  They do not help matters.It is the unassuming Lewton who is the novel's most appealing character.  Character development is generally the weakest element of most thrillers, and I was of two minds about it here.  Britz-Cunningham has actually done an excellent job of giving his characters backstories and stressors in the present that influence their actions in the course of the crisis.  In that way, they were well-rounded.  Still, other than Lewton, it's hard to get a real feel for them, and it's hard to work up a lot of sympathy.  The biographical details were in place, but the other details that would have brought them more to life--the quirks, the speech idiosyncrasies, the stuff that really humanizes--were absent.  So, while there's room for improvement, character was at least handled with some forethought and intelligence.  Less head, more heart next time, Scott.The plotting is clever and, as you can imagine, fast-paced, especially as the clock ticks down.  There's a significant amount of science, covering both medicine and technology, interspersed throughout the novel.  It's smart and interesting.  Exposition is handled well.  And then there's the question of why I titled this review the way I did.  You'll see.  Blending so many types of thriller together strikes me as a difficult thing to pull off.  It shouldn't work.  But Britz-Cunningham does manage to pull it off.  This isn't a perfect novel, but it's an impressive debut, and well-worth checking out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBHS2J0NVSGUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765331926#wasThisHelpful","RBHS2J0NVSGUA","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I reviewed Jeremy Robinson's novel SecondWorld, I suggested that he might find broader readership by toning it down just a smidge.  I'd like to report that he did--but I don't think I can honestly say that.  And yet...  Somehow the completely insane over-the-top... everything... of his latest novel, Island 731, works.  It just works.  If you can't have fun reading this novel, you simply aren't trying hard enough.Of course, while I've voiced all sorts of criticism over the years, I've never denied the fun of Robinson's novels.  This one, for instance, opens with a brief, disturbing prologue set during WWII, and then immediate jumps to the present day aboard the research ship Magellan.  Well, OVERboard the research ship Magellan.  They are investigating the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.  A scientist jumps overboard to acquire a valuable research specimen, and a crew member jumps to the rescue.  Add a great white to the mix and we're off to the races!The scientist is Avril Joliet and her rescuer is Mark Hawkins, a former park ranger and expert tracker.  (Yeah, yeah, these fictional characters do tend to come equipped with invaluable skill sets.)  They are merely two of a small ensemble of characters at the heart of the tale.  Possibly the most entertaining among the characters is high school science teacher Bob Bray.  It is Bray who is the vehicle for most of the exposition once the novel's plot kicks into gear, and much of the humor.  This book is all about plot, so I don't want to give much away.  Succinctly, there's a major storm that is merely the beginning of the problems that are about to plague the Magellan.  Cascading failures lead members of the crew to a mysterious island.  (And Jules Verne smiles from heaven.)  There, they encounter astonishing and very frightening creatures.  Bray attempts to explain:""Okay, let's talk science... Chimeras are formed when two fertilized eggs, or embryos, fuse in the womb... The main difference between natural chimerism and laboratory chimerism is that the process can be controlled in a lab... Anyway, instead of randomly merging embryos, scientists can select specific embryonic cells from one organism--say a bird's wings and breast muscles strong enough to use them--and transplant them on to something else.  Like a lion.""(If that sounds choppy, blame me.  The ellipses are due to my condensing of the text.)  Later, clues point to horrors from WWII.  Again Bray is the agent of exposition: ""There have been several nations and individuals who have done horrible things in the name of biological scientific progress throughout history.  But none hold a candle to Unit seven thirty-one.  They were Japan's covert R and D division during World War Two.  They performed sadistic experiments on human beings.""I don't think it's necessary to go into further detail.  Robinson's plot unfolds at a lightning pace, and revelations occur throughout the novel.  Along with those revelations are a goodly number of shocks and surprises along the way.  As noted above, Robinson has written a science thriller, and he makes a good faith effort to dress his outlandish tale in enough facts to make the fiction go down easier.  Me, I'm a Googler.  I stop and check details regularly.  IS there a Great Pacific Garbage Patch?  I'm sad to say it's true.  Japanese cannibalism in WWII?  I'd never heard of it, but-check!  And what the heck is an aye-aye?  Do yourself a favor and look it up.  Robinson is the master of the strange but true.  That will only get you so far.  As always, Robinson really pushes the envelope of what readers will buy.  I've been known to balk.  But this time I just grinned and went along for the ride.  I do love me some monsters!You'll recognize all sorts of classic and contemporary influences to this novel.  Let's just call it an homage to the greats.  Mr. Robinson is walking where others have gone before, but he puts his own spin on this science-run-amok tale.  And I ask you, who doesn't like a good, old-fashioned creature feature?","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9Z02E8EGWQ41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312617879#wasThisHelpful","R9Z02E8EGWQ41","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The house has stood at the end of Hope Street for nearly two hundred years.""  So begins Menna van Praag's debut novel.  In those opening pages, nineteen-year-old Cambridge doctoral student Alba Ashby, reeling from an unnamed ""worst event in [her] life,"" is inexplicably drawn to the house.  Alba is more than an academic over-achiever.  She sees things that others can't: ghosts and auras, but also vibrant and colorful scents and sounds.  She immediately senses that this house is different.Welcomed in by Peggy, the house's elderly caretaker, she's told, ""You can stay here for ninety-nine nights, until the seventh of August, just before midnight.  And then you must go...  No rent, no bills.  Your room will be your own, to do with as you like.  But take care of the house and it'll take care of you.""  This last is an understatement.  The house at the end of Hope Street is a veritable Hogwartsian Room of Requirement.  When you're sad and lean against the wall, it softens to comfort you.  When you want to draw, a notebook materializes.  You get the idea.The tale opens with Alba, but eventually it proves to be an ensemble fantasy, as readers meet the other inhabitants of the house.  There's Peggy, of course, as well as an aspiring singer, Carmen, and actress, Greer.  Each woman gets her ninety-nine days for healing, for reinvention, for whatever it is she needs.  And this has been going on for two centuries.  All over the house are framed photos of illustrious and accomplished ladies: Florence Nightingale, Daphne du Maurier, Vita Sackville West, Beatrix Potter, and dozens of others.  (Don't worry that you won't recognize all the names--such as Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, the first female doctor in England--there's a handy guide to all the ladies at the novel's end.)  These women are more than the house's history; they're a part of its present.  Their photographs speak and frequently advise the house's current tenants.  It's just that kind of place.  Okay, so that's the set up.  I'll leave the actual plot for you to uncover.The reason I actually decided to take a chance on this book is that Ms. Van Praag was compared to so many authors whose work I loved: Jasper Fforde, Sarah Addison Allen, Alice Hoffman.  I'd say that Addison Allen is the most apt comparison, and that fans of her light, magical realism-filled novels are likely to enjoy this.  I don't believe that van Praag's prose is up to par with Ms. Hoffman's lush writing.  And Jasper Fforde was, for me, the strangest and most disappointing comparison.  While it's true that many classic literary figures make an appearance in the novel's pages, this book contains none of the wit and great humor that is such a feature of his work.  Overall, I'd describe this as gentle women's fiction with a fantastic edge.As the paragraph above indicates, I had a mixed response to the novel.  I'm not going to lie...  I had issues with Alba.  ""Every day she went to the library at the same time.  Every day she bought her lunch at the same cafÃ© and ordered the same thing.""  This character is not just boring and repressed; she's painfully shy and incredibly passive.  When confronting a person who has wronged her terribly, she's ""barely audible.""  Again and again I found myself wanting to slap this little mouse.  And this is something I see in fiction all the time.  An author who wants to show growth creates a character that is so damaged and diminished that it's hard to care about her.  (Kinder, gentler readers may well disagree with me on this.)In general, I found the characters of the novel to be fairly one-dimensional.  Alba has siblings, for instance, that are so cold and uncaring that they in no way resemble real human beings.  And another thing--if you use historic figures like Dorothy Parker and Sylvia Plath as characters, write them dialogue that sounds like it might come out of their mouths.  Give Parker a witty line, for God's sake!  Give Plath some poetry!On the other hand, one of the great pleasures of the novel is the bibliophily on display throughout.  Alba is a serious book lover, her one redeeming quality.  I thoroughly enjoyed her ruminations on literature.  And even if they weren't well-characterized, the extensive literary cast and references were great fun.  I've always said that you can't go wrong preaching to the choir.  The story, in general, is entertaining and it all moves quickly.  Also, Ms. van Praag did manage to surprise me with a few fun plot twists I didn't see coming.  And I actually quite enjoyed the theme of female empowerment, as exemplified by the house's past tenants.  The other thing that van Praag handled well was the novel's resolution.  While I felt frustration with certain elements of the tale, I have no complaints about the ending.  It was the feel-good fix I was looking for.So, all in all, a mixed bag.  I'm happy enough to have read the book.  It was quick and not overly challenging.  In other words, not a bad way to pass a day.  And the great thing about debut novels?  The authors are still learning and growing.  Who knows what Menna van Praag may dream up next?","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S6GH6HOD05SL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=067078463X#wasThisHelpful","R2S6GH6HOD05SL","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The tagline for Amy Shearn's sophomore novel, The Mermaid of Brooklyn, reads ""Sometimes all you need in life is a fabulous pair of shoes--and a little help from a mermaid.""  Now, if you ask me, that sounds like some kind of light chick-lit novel--and there's nothing wrong with light chick-lit.  But that's not what you'll find in these pages.  That's selling Amy Shearn's novel way too short.First, it's not chick-lit at all.  If you must classify, put this one down as women's fiction, but with a sharply-observed, Perotta-esque take on the village-within-a-city that is Park Slope, Brooklyn.  It's the story of Jenny Lipkin, the overwhelmed mother of an infant and a toddler.  In the novel's opening pages, her husband Harry calls to tell her he's stopping to pick up cigarettes on his way home.  He never arrives.  Days pass, and no one has heard from Harry, no one can reach him.  This would, of course, be upsetting under any circumstances, but this isn't the first time it's happened.  Harry has issues of his own.  But he's never stayed away this long before...Jenny is an appealing protagonist, appealing in her imperfection.  She's not extraordinarily beautiful, clever, or together.  Quite the contrary, she was barely getting through her days when she had her husband's support.  Now the struggle really begins.  The kids, the bills, the home: ""This was not one of those `Oh, ha, sorry it's such a mess' moments.  It was dangerously messy.  It was call-child-services-doubt-the-mental-health-of-the-mother messy.  It was TLC-reality-programming messy.  We cohabited with dust bunnies I knew by name...""  That's a funny passage, and there is a good amount of humor and some real wit within the text, but there's also a fair amount of darkness and desperation.  I suspect that more than a few women will relate to Jenny's feelings of bone-deep exhaustion and inadequacy.Where, you may be asking, is the mermaid in all this?  Where indeed?  There's no mermaid in sight until more than a quarter of the novel has passed.  And this nameless entity is not, perhaps, the mermaid you're expecting.  She's no fairytale friend.  This mermaid of Brooklyn is a creature of Slavic myth, a rusalka.  I'm a connoisseur of mermaid legends and lore, and this was a new one on me.  Per Wikipedia, ""In Slavic mythology, a rusalka is a female ghost, water nymph, succubus, or mermaid-like demon that dwelt in a waterway.""  I'll leave you to discover how Jenny encounters her, and the exact nature of their relationship.  It's not entirely negative, as the above might lead one to believe, but it's not exactly positive either.  Jenny muses:""I was starting to realize the rusalka wasn't the best person to listen to.  What did I know about her?  Who WAS she, this new self of mine, this recently arrived Siamese twin?  It was beginning to strike me, in moments of sickening dread, that I might be just another sailor coiled in her hair, seduced by her promises of impossible passions, believing I was being buoyed up as she slowly strengthened her squeeze, dragging me down to the ocean floor.""Notwithstanding an amusing tendency to pepper her dialogue with Yiddish, there's an opaqueness to the rusalka that leaves readers a lot of room for conjecture as to her nature.  But despite this supernatural element, this is an unusually realistic look at one woman's struggle to find her way through neighborhood politics, temptation, depression, and family life.  I'm neither married nor a mother, but I related tremendously to Jenny, and I cared about her struggles.The writing in The Mermaid of Brooklyn is terrific.  I don't use phrases like ""chick-lit"" or ""women's fiction"" in a pejorative manner, but rather to describe genres of fiction.  Still, those genres will give certain readers expectations as to literary quality.  Whatever those expectations are, the depth of this book will surpass them.  Shearn uses language in clever and observant ways.  ""We'd been in the park all morning, and I was Pompeiied in a gritty paste of apple juice, dirt, and sandbox.""  Or, as two mothers express their exhaustion: ""It was an exchange we shared about thirty times a day, like songbirds trading musical phrases.""This was my introduction to Ms. Shearn's work.  I came to it with expectations that weren't met at all.  Fortunately, they were significantly exceeded.  The Mermaid of Brooklyn is a whole lot more than a book about a fabulous pair of shoes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AFQ5FI6QSVV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451678282#wasThisHelpful","R2AFQ5FI6QSVV1","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Life is often heavy.  Literature is often heavy.  Sometimes I just want a little light entertainment, and Lauren Graham's debut novel, Someday, Someday Maybe sounded like just what the doctor ordered.  Now there's no reason to believe that a gifted comic actress would be a particularly gifted comic novelist.  Actually, my expectations might lean slightly in the opposite direction.  So let me be the first to proclaim what a fun, funny, clever, and refreshing debut this is.  It was absolutely everything I wanted and more than I expected.Someday, Someday Maybe is the story of aspiring actress Franny Banks.  She'd given herself three years to make it in New York, and as the novel opens in 1995, her deadline is fast approaching.  Currently, she's waiting tables, not for Godot.  The novel details Franny's travails personally and professionally as her deadline looms.  There's no real need to describe the plot further.It seems reasonable to assume that there's at least a smidge of autobiography in the mix.  It can't be a coincidence that Lauren Graham's first professional listings on IMDB showed up right around 1995.  She's writing about a time, a place, and a world that she knows.  The details ring true.  And she does an excellent job of articulating the work of an actor.  It's quite interesting being inside Franny's head, hearing her thought process, as she taps into the emotions she needs to convey.  It's easy to empathize with the likeable Franny and to root for her to succeed.One of the greatest pleasures of the novel is the humor.  Both actors and the industry are satirized.  Additionally, there is rich observational humor.  In discussing a neighbor, Graham writes:  ""We worry about Frank in the way New Yorkers worry about strangers whose apartments they can see into.  Which is to say, we made up a name for him and have theories about his life, and we'd call 911 if we saw something frightening happen while spying on him, but if I ran into him on the subway, I'd look the other way.""Aside from her career, Franny is a twenty-something woman navigating the rocky shoals of romance.  There's a light chick-lit feel to the novel, and the romantic subplot was truly delightful.  Graham has meta-fictional fun with romance tropes:  ""I mean, the whole `love triangle' THING bothers me.  Who even thought of that?  I've never been in a love triangle.  Especially one where the girl is torn between the obviously right guy played by the more famous actor and the obviously hideously wrong guy played by the slightly less famous actor.  And also, why does the heroine always have a sassy best friend?  And why is she always a brunette?""This is not literary fiction.  Graham is writing in the voice of her first-person narrator.  Yes, there are a fair number of run on sentences and sentence fragments, but she brings Franny's voice to life.  I could hear her, and she didn't actually sound very much like Lorelei Gilmore at all.  Franny is a new creation.  The novel's prose is very readable, and occasionally it's more than that.  Also, Franny's tale moves swiftly.  It's a story you'll read in no time, and the odds are good you'll be left wishing for a few chapters more.Graham's characters are appealing.  You want these young people to find their happy ending--whatever that happens to be.  The novel comes to a very satisfying conclusion, and I enjoyed my time in Franny's company enough that I wouldn't mind at all visiting with her in the future.  Given her creator's success, I'm going to gamble that things turn out alright for her.  As for Lauren Graham, I can only hope those long hours on set translate to further forays into fiction.  This was an auspicious and entertaining debut.  I'm waiting for a sequel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R230DA0DC7SP7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345532740#wasThisHelpful","R230DA0DC7SP7A","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Iâ€™m a sucker for novels with high-concept hooks. I can summarize Lionel Shriverâ€™s latest in just a few sentences. Pandora Halfdanarson, a married, mid-western entrepreneur, hasnâ€™t seen her older brother in four years. Edison is a successful jazz pianist out of New York, and this is the longest theyâ€™ve ever been apart. A friend of his calls her, indicating that Edison has fallen on hard times, and she invites him to come stay for a visit. At the airport, she fails to recognize himâ€”in the time theyâ€™ve been separated, her brother has gained well over two hundred pounds!That premise was all I needed to hear. Much like the eponymous brother, I gulped this treat down wholeâ€”and enjoyed it thoroughly! I donâ€™t feel a large need to summarize the plot further. Is there any more you really need to know? Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s awesome about the novel: with a premise like that, there were only a few outcomes to the tale that I could readily envisage. Ms. Shriver managed to truly surprise me.This is, I think, the fourth novel dealing with morbid obesity that Iâ€™ve read in the past year or two. (For those who are interested, the others were The Middlesteins by Jami Attenberg, Bed by David Whitehouse, and Heft by Liz Moore, all of which are different, and all of which are recommended.) Itâ€™s sort of fascinating to see this cultural preoccupation at last seeping into our literature. I only wonder that it took so long.Ms. Shriver first came to my attention years ago with the publication of the uber-intense We Need to Talk about Kevin. In the years since, Iâ€™ve been delighted to see that she likes to change things up. Her last novel, The New Republic, was a satire, for goodness sake! Big Brother also has a satirical edge, but it doesnâ€™t really remind me of any of her earlier works, except that she always seems to be drawn to a certain darkness. That said, this is really not a dark novel. Honestly, Iâ€™m not sure how to describe it as far as tone or genre, other than to say itâ€™s a family drama, not merely about these adult siblings (and their relationship with their father), but also very much about the relationship between each sibling and Pandoraâ€™s husband and teenage stepchildren.With Ms. Shriver, it goes without saying that you can expect lovely prose and exactingly-drawn characters. This tale moved quickly! I read it easily in a day. Itâ€™s a compelling story, and hard to put down. Itâ€™s like an episode of Dr. Phil you know you should turn off, but you just canâ€™t look away. Edison is both sympathetic and deeply repulsive. More than anything, however, I come back to the novelâ€™s ending. I imagine it being polarizing, but I found it inspired. While I have not read them all, this is my favorite of Ms. Shriverâ€™s novels to date.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FBLZFJLCTV0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061458570#wasThisHelpful","R3FBLZFJLCTV0A","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It would be great if we all ate fewer processed foods.  They tend to be high in sugar and sodium, and Knorr Pasta Sides Thai Sweet Chili flavor is no exception.  That said, as a side dish or as the base of a home cooked meal, it's a lot better than some fast food burgers and fries.  All things in moderation.I was inspired to try this flavor because I love Asian food, and just welcome anything that's a little different to the supermarket aisle.  The pasta doesn't taste like anything you'd get in a restaurant, but I thought it was fairly good.  It's not spicy by my standards, but there is a little kick of heat.  The flavor was a good balance between sweet and savory.I will purchase this product in the future, and next time I'd like to use it as the base of a meal by adding some fresh steamed vegetables and maybe some chicken or (more likely) shrimp.

"It's funny how these iconic tales become a part of our consciousness. It's been decades since I've read The Great Gatsby. I couldn't describe it in but the most general terms. But that was exactly the work that came overwhelmingly to mind as I dived into Charles Dubow's enjoyable debut novel, Indiscretion.Having done a little research in the meanwhile, my conscious now sees the comparisons that my unconscious clearly picked up on. Indiscretion takes place in similar New York environs as the earlier work, deals with issues of class, matrimony, infidelity, and like Gatsby, is narrated by the central characters' friend and next-door-neighbor. Filling the role of Nick Carraway is Walter Gervais, life-long friend of Madeleine Winslow, wife of the National Book Award-winning novelist Harry Winslow.  Says Walter:""This is where I come in.  Every story has a narrator.  Someone who writes it down after it's all over.  Why am I the narrator of this story?  I am because it's the story of my life--and of the people I love most.""And the events that Walter is relating begin the summer that a new acquaintance, Claire, is introduced to the Winslows.  ""What would her life have been like if she had never met him on the beach?  If she had never come to that fateful party?""  Much younger and very beautiful, Claire is too great a temptation.  This shouldn't come as too big a shocker in a novel called Indiscretion.  Still, Dubow tells a compelling and easily readable tale.  It's a little salacious at times, but it reads like good gossip.  The characters are well-drawn, and Dubow does an especially good job of representing the pain these people are in.  None of them are villains.The novel moves swiftly, driven by the story.  I saw some of the revelations coming, notably the very last, but there were several surprising twists, the biggest of which was handled very cleverly. The latter part of the novel was especially absorbing.  Indiscretion is set essentially in the present day, but there is something anachronistic about it.  It's that Gatsby vibe.  Every time a cell phone rang it was just the slightest bit jarring.  While I would consider it more popular fiction than literary fiction, Indiscretion is a strong debut from a gifted storyteller.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SNUW7OF0NTLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062201050#wasThisHelpful","R3SNUW7OF0NTLN","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Several years ago, I heard author Chuck Palahniuk read a story so disturbing that a woman in the audience fainted.  She wasn't the first.  Palahniuk summed it up thus: ""The power of words.""I couldn't help but think of the above as I delved into Max Barry's fifth novel, Lexicon.  I've been a fan of his work since Syrup, so I'm old school.  I tend to think of Barry as a satirist first and foremost, so I was surprised when Lexicon opened very much like a thriller.  Readers are thrown straight into a frankly bizarre interrogation in an airport bathroom, leading to abduction and multiple homicides.  The abductee is an everyman named Wil.  He has no idea what's going on, or why this is happening to him.  Eventually one of his kidnappers becomes his protector, but he's not great about answering questions:""You don't need to understand.  You need to sit there and not do anything stupid while I take care of you.  That's what you need.  Look, I get that it's been a confusing night.  And now you're all, But how is that possible, and, Why did he do that.  But I'm not going to answer those questions, Wil, because you don't have the framework to comprehend the answers.  You're like a kid asking how I can see him even though he's closed his eyes.  Just accept that this is happening.""Barry places readers in the same position as Wil.  No framework.  This book has an unusual plot--which is good.  Barry's never guilty of writing the same old thing.  But Lexicon is challenging.  It's strange.  The story is told in an extremely non-linear manner that really forces readers to pay close attention to the timeline.  I'll be honest, there were several times I had to double back and check where and when I was in the tale.Because this is not merely Wil's story.  The other central character is Emily.  We meet her as a teen runaway living on the streets of San Francisco.  She's hustling tourists playing three-card Monte, but Emily may have other untapped gifts.  Someone sees potential.  She's flown first-class across the country to take entrance exams for an elite school outside of Washington, DC.  There, students are taught the art and science of persuasion.  This is an institution VERY interested in the power of words.  In the hands of their top graduates, the ""poets,"" they are, in fact, weapons.  That's the basic set-up, but revelations are hard-won in this tale, and I'll leave the rest of the complex plot for you to uncover.Max Barry is exploring some very interesting ideas, and taking them to extremes.  In his hands, language is almost supernatural.  But he clothes his magic in a patina of science, some of it real.  (It's unsurprising that a writer would choose to delve into this subject matter, and he's not the first.  Taking a very different approach, Ben Marcus also explored the power of words and language in his recent novel, The Flame Alphabet.)  Barry's got a talent for world-building.  The world that Lexicon is set in is like our own, but with this extra layer that you and I have heretofore been unaware of.  Now all is revealed.This novel doesn't have the overt humor that I tend to associate with Mr. Barry's work.  It's funny, but in a dark and subtle way.  Max Barry is just an inherently funny guy, so I think there will always be some humor in his work, but this novel is the furthest from his satirical roots.  The entire premise is sort of absurdist, but there's also something provocative going on there.  For instance, this passage where one secret operative is describing how they collect data on citizens in order to control them:""You are... you need to get into this stuff, Eliot.  It's the future.  Everyone's making pages for themselves.  Imagine a hundred million people clicking polls and typing in their favorite TV shows and products and political leanings, day after day.  It's the biggest data profile ever.  And it's voluntary.  That's the funny part.  People resist a census, but give them a profile page and they'll spend all day telling you who they are.""And with this knowledge, there is power.  Lexicon is a thriller, but an unconventional one.  It moves at a fast pace and contains major action sequences.  But I'd also classify it as speculative fiction.  Truthfully, it's awfully hard to pin down, genre-wise.  I don't think Lexicon will be appreciated by every reader.  It's smart and it's different.  If you're a fan of Max Barry, or if you're intrigued by the premise, I encourage you to give it a try.And I don't mind telling you, I have a new-found appreciation for both Mr. Palahniuk and Mr. Barry.  They are very persuasive men.  They're good with words.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q03R86YZJTQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205388#wasThisHelpful","R3Q03R86YZJTQG","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a notable departure, British novelist Kate Atkinson brings her literary gifts to the world of speculative fiction.  In her new stand alone, Life After Life, heroine Ursula Todd lives and dies over and over.  Beginning on the day of her birth, a snowy February day in 1910, the baby is ""dead before she had a chance to live.""  Except, in the very next chapter, we again witness Ursula's birth and she isn't choked by the umbilical cord.  But she does succumb to another fate at the age of four.And so it goes, living, exploring, experimenting, trying to get it right.  It takes readers a while to actually meet the adult incarnation of Ursula Todd.  There were so many dangers, so many wrong paths along the way.  After a while, I'm afraid, it became just a bit like, ""Oh my God, they killed Kenny!""  I don't mean to be flippant, but this little girl died a lot of different ways.  Any emotional intensity is severely muted through sheer repetition, and the knowledge that there are no real consequences.  It will all begin again.Which is not to say that there are no effects.  Ursula seems to sense echoes of her past lives, sometimes even taking extreme measures to avert past disasters.  Ms. Atkinson was rather brilliant in how she seeded these shadows of lives past throughout the novel and Ursula's consciousness.  Other reviewers have written eloquently on Buddhist philosophy, Jung's Collective Unconscious, and many other sophisticated influences on Ms. Atkinson's story.  But one reader's religion is another reader's science.  I, for instance, might go on about the physics of multiverses.  ""She had felt pleased with herself for resisting a yellow crêpe de Chine tea dress...""  But in another lifetime, ""She tried on the yellow crÃªpe de Chine tea dress she'd bought earlier that day...""Buy the dress, don't buy the dress.  It's one of a million--a billion--details that determine the outcome of our lives.  As we watch Ursula live life after life, sometimes more successfully, sometimes less, we begin to determine the pivotal days, the ones that simply need to be survived.  And we begin to see the cascading effect of small changes.  We become very intimately acquainted with Ursula and the people that surround her.Now, this premise is nothing new.  From Bill Murray in Groundhog Day to Ken Grimwood's cult classic, Replay, this has been done before.  It may be my imagination, but I feel like I'm seeing more of this sort of tale lately.  Variations on the time travel theme.  What Atkinson brings to the table is her skill as a writer, and the deadly seriousness with which she carries out her tale.  For it is unfolding not in contemporary America, but 20th century England.  Intellectually I know the history, but living war after war after war through Ursula's eyes was brutal.  Born in 1910, the girl saw some history, and it's very clear that Atkinson did her research.  The novel lingers longest during WWII, with Ursula experiencing the war from multiple vantages, all of them fairly brutal.  War is hell.  Didn't someone say that once?  As a reader, I began to feel brutalized, trapped in an endless war that went on for (surely) hundreds of pages.  There seemed to be no exit.  What is the point of all these lives?  That is the question.  A big question with major philosophical implications.Atkinson does give answers, of a sort, though there's plenty open for interpretation.  This book is great fodder for those who want to delve into these mysteries, and for those who want to discuss them with others.  It is well written, thought-provoking, and compelling.  I enjoyed it, and am glad to have read it, but while I'm usually the most enthusiastic reader and the loudest in my praise, I can't seem to embrace this one as whole-heartedly as many readers have.  I liked it.  It was good, layered, well-written, brilliantly-plotted, etc. etc.  But it's grim.  Atkinson covers a bloody period of history, and even without the wars, the body count is staggering.  I didn't actually count how many times or different ways that Ursula dies, but it's a lot.  And, frankly, even when she's living, it isn't all that joyful.  This is an undeniably excellent novel, but I'm glad to have finally reached the end of the line.  It's time for me to move on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYNW1R8YSFCPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316176486#wasThisHelpful","RYNW1R8YSFCPZ","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Look, I won't claim there aren't disappointments, but after decades of selecting books for myself, I've gotten pretty good at guessing what I'm going to like.  And from the first time I heard even the briefest description of The Unchangeable Spots of Leopards, it was high on my must-read list.  I mean, seriously, the title alone--somehow it just spoke to me.  And I wasn't disappointed.But the odd thing is, when I read the jacket copy, the part that I really honed in on was about the rivalry between the two writers.  And while certainly that is an element of the novel's plot (such as it is), that's not the part that I should have been paying attention to.  No, it was phrases like ""search for identity,"" ""web of lies,"" and ""exploration of the nature of truth and storytelling"" that are really at the crux of Kristopher Jansma's exciting debut novel.Let's back up...  There have been some fantastic novels that blurred the lines between fact and fiction through a variety of narrative devices.  In Life of Pi, Yann Martel opened the novel in direct address to readers, eventually becoming the character of The Writer.  And when The Bridges of Madison County was published a few decades ago, so many readers wrote to the National Geographic believing the tale was true that they made a museum exhibit of the correspondence.  I digress, but the opening of The Unchangeable Spots of Leopards brought these examples to mind, because the first page after the table of contents says this: ""If you believe that you are the author of this book, please contact Haslett & Grouse Publishers (New York, New York) at your first convenience.""Interesting.  We move on, but that opening note is never quite forgotten.And this tale begins, again, in direct address to readers in the form of an author's note.  It launches, ""I've lost every book I've ever written.""  And the narrator tells the tale of that first loss.  You will learn of others along the way.  The last line, incidentally, of that author's note is this: ""These stories all are true, but only somewhere else.""  And this coming after not one, not two, but three separate epigraphs on the nature of truth.  Interesting.The novel's first-person narrator seems earnest enough, but be prepared for sleight of hand--or whatever the literary equivalent might be.  The storytelling here is unconventional, it's meta-fictional, it's challenging, it's non-linear, it's literary, and, oh yes, it is always interesting.  Jansma's characters are...  Well, to be honest, they're not all that likable when you get right down to it, but they're well-drawn enough for familiarity to breed contempt.  (And in the scheme of unlikable characters, these ones are not so unpleasant as to put you off from following their journey.)  You'll note that I did not describe them as ""believable,"" because there's a heightened quality about the trio at the center of the tale, and the circumstances they find themselves in, as they chase and/or flee each other around the globe.  Jansma isn't trying to replicate reality.  There is artifice throughout, and it's very intentional.His writing is fantastic!  It's read-aloud, eminently quotable, just a pleasure to absorb.  Everything about this novel is stylish, stylized, and sophisticated.  It's also very funny.  It's gonzo, romantic, clever, and the sort of book to remind readers and writers both why they do what they do.  In short, this is an exhilarating debut novel.  My instincts were right on this time.  Score one for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KB3OS6LKHK6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=067002600X#wasThisHelpful","R1KB3OS6LKHK6W","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm nothing so pretentious as a cinephile; I'm a movie-lover.  So, I think, is debut novelist Owen King.  But the young protagonist of Double Feature, Sam Dolan, is very much a cinephile and a freshly-minted graduate of film school.  As the non-linear narrative opens, Sam is about to start filming the script that was his college thesis.  The first third of the novel involves the shooting of this low-budget, indie feature film and the aftermath of that film's creation.  It affects Sam's life in long-lasting and unexpected ways.  Beyond this, Double Feature is about Sam's complicated relationship with his father, Booth, a deeply flawed and aging B-movie actor.  One passage:""The story was undoubtedly an exaggeration if not an outright fabrication.  Booth had been in the business of cheap entertainment for so long that he had gone native.  In his telling, everything was a sensation, a shock, a crisis, a betrayal, amazing bad luck, or an unforeseeable confluence.  When Sam was younger, his father had let him down.  Now that Sam was older, his earlier self's stupidity mortified him: how could he have expected anything else from a man who relished any opportunity to tell strangers that his infant son looked like a leper?  Booth's fallaciousness was right there all the time, as inherent as the nose on his face.""It's bold--Bold I say!--when you're Stephen King's son, to publish a debut about a young artist with major daddy issues.  Readers tend to read into these things.  But I can't honestly say that I believe Mr. King is working through any issues of his own.  Still, he may have some insights into being the child of a celebrity that most of us don't.I mentioned above that the novel is non-linear.  It moves in time from the opening when Sam is in his early-twenties, back to his parents' courtship decades earlier, forward to the altered life of Sam's early thirties, and many points in between.  I'm a big fan of this type of story-telling when it's done right.  It's an interesting way to make revelations, often with answers coming before questions are even asked.  Mr. King did manage this device well, for instance, eventually supplying the additional information on Sam's mother that as a reader I actively craved.As you can see from the quote above, his use of language is sophisticated.  This is not the type of macabre commercial fiction that his father and brother trade in.  This is a satirical dramedy, and yes, it's definitely funny, though not generally in a laugh-out-loud way.  Both the characters and the events of the novel have a heightened quality about them, not exactly mirroring real-life, but intentionally so.  King has created a fantastic and entertaining assortment of supporting characters.  This is one case, however, where I don't feel that the novel's jacket copy does them justice or really describes the story accurately.  What can you say?  No one wants to be guilty of spoilers.Double Feature is an accomplished debut, but I do have a few criticisms.  I felt that both the novel's beginning and ending were especially strong, but things slumped a bit in the tale's middle.  Further, there are plot developments that occur that are so unbelievably obvious to the reader that it's hard to credit that Sam can't see the big picture as easily as we can.  It's true that when you're living in the moment, these things generally aren't as obvious, but it still stretched my credulity.That said, the novel's plotting was especially impressive.  King juggles quite a few literary threads and manages to bring his story full circle in a notably satisfying manner.  It's truly difficult not to develop affection for this loony cast of characters.  And one more treat...  Do you stay to the very end of films' credits like I do?  Sometimes there's an ""Easter egg"" at the very end.  This may be the first time I've seen a literary Easter egg after a novel's acknowledgements, but it's awesome.  It's the perfect way to end this tribute to the magic of movies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B02KI8MNT1AT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451676891#wasThisHelpful","R1B02KI8MNT1AT","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is no secret to anyone in my life that I spend what might be considered by some to be an inordinate amount of time in my bathroom.  What can I say?  I like long, languid baths.  They can last an hour or more.  Sometimes I go the candles and soft music route, but more often I'm in there with a book--usually an audiobook that I play on my iPhone.  It's okay.  Obviously the sound quality isn't great, but I never thought about it much.That is, until I was gifted (by the manufacturer in return for an honest review) the Hipe Waterproof Wireless Bluetooth Shower Speaker & Handsfree Speakerphone.  My god, everything sounds so much better!  These speakers are awesome for my long baths, but I now find myself using the speakers when I'm putting on make-up, doing my hair, and oh yeah, in the shower, which, I guess, is what they're intended for.  I kid you not; I now shop for music in the bathroom because it has the best acoustics in the house.  As for music in the shower, it's better than a cup of coffee to get me going in the morning.Incidentally, my shower is on overdrive.  It's like a high-pressure waterfall.  These speakers get sprayed with, I suspect, way more water than ideally intended.  This has caused no problem whatsoever to date.  The Bluetooth synch up is a piece of cake, both quick and easy.  These speakers don't play as loud as some might, but they're sufficient.  I don't know how much louder I could possibly go.  I have neighbors.Before first use, I was instructed to fully charge the rechargeable battery with the included cable.  It took about four hours.  There was a helpful indicator light that went from red to green when it was ready.  In the nearly two weeks since then, I've been using the shower speakers extensively.  I keep waiting for the charge to die,a nd it hasn't happened yet.  I imagine that recharging once a week should be more than enough for the average user, and quite possibly far less frequently.  After all, how long is the average shower?  A little experimentation will help you figure it out.This is a fairly small, lightweight speaker system, made primarily of plastic.  Honestly, it looks and feels a little like a toddler's toy--including flashing indicator lights.  It's well-suited for its intended purpose.  After all, you can't hang monster speakers off your showerhead.  (I imagine that I will continue to use these speakers as intended, but it is a very small and portable option if someday I need to boost my iPhone's volume for some reason.)As for the speakerphone function, well, if you're waiting on a call, it's an absolute given it will come as soon as you step in the shower.  And I make calls from the tub all the time.  Sorry, it's true.  In order to truly test the speakerphone capabilities, I held a conversation with an automated phone system.  The results weren't bad.  I could hear everything just fine.  The computer didn't understand what I was saying every time, but it got enough of what I said correct that I'm confident that human ears would have no trouble interpreting a conversation.In the end, the Hipe Waterproof Wireless Bluetooth Shower Speaker & Handsfree Speakerphone is a small luxury.  And as you've gathered, I really treasure my bath time.  While this isn't something I strictly needed, it's a real treat at the end of a long, stressful day.  And the product delivers exactly what was promised.  That's a treat, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G7NPOX8NJENM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00629INCK#wasThisHelpful","R3G7NPOX8NJENM","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a certain satisfaction in coming to the end of a long novel, but as the pages dwindled on Helene Wecker's The Golem and the Jinni, all I felt was grief that this magical story had to end.  After 500 pages, I wanted it to go on and on.  And if you stop reading this review right now, that's all you really need to know.You will be shocked to hear that the novel is, in fact, about a golem and a jinni.  For those who are unaware, a golem is a figure of Jewish myth, an automaton made of earth or clay, brought to life to do the bidding of another.  A jinni (or genie) is a figure of Arab myth, a magical creature of fire.  So, before we even get into plot details, look at that fascinating set-up!  Jewish/Arab.  Earth/fire.  Just hearing the premise, I anticipated some sort of culture clash to be central to the tale.  And while the story does primarily unfold amongst the Jewish and Syrian immigrant populations of late 19th century New York, it is not a parable of Mid-East conflict.  This was merely the first of many instances when Ms. Wecker defied expectations and convention, keeping me guessing in what direction her tale would evolve again and again.Talk about defying convention--the titular golem is a woman, and self-aware.  She was originally created (with a laundry list of attributes that included intelligence, curiosity, and propriety) to be a rich merchant's wife.  He, alas, died en route to America, shortly after bringing her to life.  She arrived at Ellis Island without a master or a plan.  The jinni, on the other hand, WAS freed from ia thousand-year mprisonment in a flask--but don't expect him to start granting wishes any time soon.This is the story of two creatures in turn of the century New York who are both Old Worldly and otherworldly.  Separately, they must find their way in circumstances that neither is prepared for, all the while concealing their essential natures.  As the golem says to the jinni, ""We're our natures, you and I.""  Because, yes, eventually their paths do cross and it's the start of a most unexpected friendship.Can I tell you?  This wonderful, literary fantasy left me wanting to slap the next writer who sits down in front of a keyboard and starts typing about a vampire.  Ms. Wecker has created a story unlike anything I've ever seen.  Her central characters, while not human, share a deep humanity (for better or worse) and are beautifully drawn.  Other characters, which at first seem peripheral to the tale, prove to be central, as Wecker's story expands encompassing a larger community.  And at all times the relationships depicted between men, women, creatures, adults, children, friends, lovers, and enemies were complex, unpredictable, and captivating.  The novel's prose is as rich as the period setting is evocative.  And while I really haven't gone into any detail, please know that the plotting is both elegant and assured.Of course, there IS culture clash in this novel, and conflict galore.  But in every instance that her tale could be ordinary, Ms. Wecker makes it extraordinary.  The lush cultures, heritage, and history depicted so beautifully are merely the jumping off point for a dazzlingly inventive fantasy.  Where did this writer come from, and how is it possible that this accomplished work is her debut?  It is sure to be one of the literary highlights of the year!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23R3CB9E9U6Q3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062110837#wasThisHelpful","R23R3CB9E9U6Q3","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Look, I'm as geeky as the next girl.  How can you hear the subject matter of this book and not be fascinated?  David Toomey opens Weird Life exactly where I would expect--with extremophiles.  Extremophiles are some of the most unusual and extraordinary creatures in all of biology.  Which makes sense, because life = biology.  Right?That's what I thought, but clearly that's due to a massive failure of imagination on my part.  One the most impressive things about Toomey's book are the sheer breadth, depth, and scope of what is covered.  Toomey starts with biology--microbiology, exobiology, marine biology, synthetic biology, molecular biology, astrobiology, evolutionary biology.  That, friends, is the mere tip of the iceberg.  Toomey touches on disciplines and theories including: organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, interstellar chemistry, molecular chemistry, biochemistry, nuclear chemistry, geology, genetics, robotics, computer science, mathematics, theoretical physics, particle physics, quantum physics, astrophysics, string theory, nanotechnology, multiverses, astrology, botany, taxonomy, engineering, ecology, epistemology, psychology, and philosophy.  If that's not enough, there's even a chapter on weird life in science fiction!  This book is thorough, that's all I'm saying.  There's a reason for this:""The attentive reader may have noticed that ideas for the weirdest sorts of weird life did not originate with biologists or even, for that matter, with astrobiologists.  They came from scholars and practitioners in other fields.  The hypotheses of life in other universes were formulated by theoretical physicists (Harnik, Kribs, and Perez; and Jaffe, Jenkins, and Kimchi).  Ideas of life in the vicinity of black holes and the atmospheres of white dwarf stars were conceived by astrophysicists (Adams and Laughlin).  Hypotheses of life surviving through eternity were developed by a mathematician and theoretical physicist (Dyson), who also supplied us with what may be the broadest definition of life so far.  Of the many ideas of weird organisms from science fiction, two that are notably well grounded in science are from a physicist turned aerospace engineer (Forward) and from a professional astronomer (Hoyle).  Even the relatively conservative hypothesis of hydrogen-breathing dirigibles was proposed by a physicist (Saltpeter) and a planetary scientist turned astrobiologist (Sagan).""So... there's some smart stuff in this book.  Do not be intimidated!  I'm incredibly uneducated, and I had no difficulty reading Weird Life from cover to cover.  My mind was occasionally blown--but always in a good way.  And if you need a little reminder on the difference between a mesophile and a methanogen, please be aware that there's a glossary at the back of the book between the text and the endnotes, but before the very thorough bibliography.This book covers science that is being done right up to the minute.  At least three times a variation on the phrase ""as we go to press"" was used.  This science is emergent and so very, very fascinating.  Here's a good example, arising from our lack of understanding of what comets are made of:""Being mostly solid bodies, comets resist interferometry.  In 2003, it occurred to Allamandola and his colleague Doug Hudgins that there was another way.  If they could make a comet from scratch, they could study it.  They took a sample chamber called a ""cosmic ice simulation chamber,"" removed most of its atmosphere, and froze what was left to a temperature near absolute zero, thus making the inside of the chamber a fair representation of deep space.  They introduced into the chamber a few simple molecules that might be found in a star's outflow, and turned on a lamp (representing nearby stars) that bathed the molecules in ultraviolet radiation.  Then they waited.  They were not expecting much, and they were certainly not expecting what happened.  The molecules combined, split, and recombined, and before long the chamber contained some very complex molecules, many of which were prebiotic.""Is your mind blown?  Maybe it's just me.  But I couldn't put this book down.  My only minor disappointment is that there weren't more photos and illustrations, but I guess it's hard to fault an author for not including images of hypothetical things that may or may not exist.  Toomey did pretty well, all things considered.Life, in all its colors and flavors, is amazing.  Mr. Toomey has reminded me of that fact.  This was the most enjoyable science book I have read in quite a few years.  My mind and ideas have been expanded, quite painlessly.  So let's, as Mr. Toomey suggests, allow our imaginations free reign.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHR29LR7P1K8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393071588#wasThisHelpful","RHR29LR7P1K8U","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As good as an ice-cold glass of water tastes on a hot day, most of the time I prefer something flavored.  In order to drink as much as I should on a daily basis, I frequently find myself turning to portable, low-calorie beverage mixes like Crystal Light Singles.  So, when I read about Sensa Quench, it seemed like it was worth a try.Purported to be an ""energy-enhancing vitamin drink**, "" the packaging further notes that it:* Increases Metabolism*** Energizes Naturally*** Vitamin Enhanced**These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.  This product is not intended to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent any disease.Basically, this beverage is designed to keep you awake, hydrated, nourished, and slender.  There are several ingredients not contained in Crystal Light to aid in these goals.  I have literally never heard of maqui berry (1mg), but it is ""one of the highest rated antioxidants**.""Green tea ""increases energy and enhances metabolism**.""  Now this one is worthy of further discussion.  Part and parcel of that package is the Energy Enhancing Blend: Green tea leaf standardized extract (180 mg antioxidant polyphenols, 90 mg epigallocatechin gallate), guarana seed extract (90 mg caffeine).  Sensa recommends that you ""drink 2 per day in between meals.""  To put that in perspective, that would be a smidge more caffeine than is found in 60 ounces of Coca-Cola.  I guess that WILL give a person energy.  I also believe that that sort of daily caffeine intake would be contraindicated for any number of medical conditions.  Possibly all of them.But here's some good news...  Each serving of Sensa Quench also contains 100% of the recommended daily allowance of vitamins A, C, D, B6, and B12.  I'm not being sarcastic.  I don't take a multi-vitamin; it can't hurt.  And while I don't necessarily think that it's a good idea to consume that much caffeine every day, I don't drink coffee and I don't always do what's good for me, so we'll move on.One of my more obvious concerns about this beverage was how it tasted.  The reviews here are somewhat divided.  Isn't that the thing about taste; it's individual.  I have tried two flavors of Sensa Quench, the Berry Splash and the Orange Crush.  I expected to like the berry flavor better, but I think orange wins by a nose.  Here are my thoughts on the flavor:  It doesn't taste as good as Crystal Light, or Kool Aid, or name your equivalent low-calorie powder single beverage.  However, it is not undrinkable.  Sensa recommends pouring one packet into 12-16 ounces of water.  That surprised me.  Most of these powders are designed to be used in conjunction with a 16.9 ounce half-liter water bottle.  So, out of curiosity, I tried both flavors at a 12-ounce concentration.  Ugh.  Way too strong!  I'm just fine with the standard 16.9 ounce solution.  The berry flavor is quite tart, and not all that sweet.  The orange flavor is less tart and slightly more sweet.  It's a little counterintuitive.  I would not describe these beverages as gritty--but they're more gritty than Crystal Light, which is not gritty at all.  Also, there is a slight, slight medicinal or bitter taste.  Maqui berry?  So, that probably doesn't sound great--but on the bright side, if you couldn't stop drinking the Sensa Quench, just imagine how high your caffeine intake would be!Next up:  Did it reduce my appetite or change my eating habits?  Honestly, not that I can see.  However, I'm not a big between meal snacker.  If that were the biggest impediment to my weight loss goals, this product might be a viable solution.  Or a step in the right direction.  I've been drinking one or two of these a day for the past week, and my eating habits haven't gotten worse.  Nor have I suffered any noticeable adverse effects to my health, digestion, or sleeping patterns.And finally, let's discuss price.  These little powder packs cost A LOT more than the other brands I've mentioned.  They're a different product, for all the reasons I've detailed above.  My response to this product is fairly mixed.  I don't think it's wonderful, terrible, or the answer to my prayers.  I will continue to drink my Sensa Quench until it's all gone, but I do think I'll cut back to one a day unless I'm really, really sleepy.  And I don't see myself purchasing any more once it's gone.  My first goal is to stay well-hydrated.  The better my beverage tastes, the more I'll drink.  My second goal is to lose/maintain my weight.  The more liquid I drink, the less I'll eat.  As it is, I get plenty of nutrients from the food I eat without unwanted caffeine.  Your mileage, taste, and lifestyle may vary.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQEB9EKAGD28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074KC6UG#wasThisHelpful","RKQEB9EKAGD28","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the past few months, I have been using iHome  Bluetooth Keyboard (IMAC-K111S), and I've been extremely pleased with it--until this keyboard arrived today.  Simply put, this one has better features for less money.  Both keyboards share the list price of $49.99, but this one is currently retailing on Amazon for about $15 less.  Affordability is a consideration for me, and this keyboard is a terrific value.Still, budget is budget, and most every part of this device is made of plastic, despite the brushed-chrome look.  In addition to being economic, it's very light-weight, a big plus for portability.  On the subject of portability, unlike the IMAC-K111S, this keyboard comes with a cover.  That's actually the reason I ordered this second keyboard.  I don't often carry my bulky laptop bag.  More often than not, I just toss a variety of Kindles, iPads, and iPhones into a tote bag--usually one filled with all kinds of other random items.  Yeah, it's a little sloppy.  I didn't like tossing a loose keyboard into the mix with, uh, the other half of the sandwich I ate for lunch.As another reviewer noted, this is a fairly rudimentary cover, but it does the trick.  It's a black, faux-leather-looking, ""2 in 1 protective cover"" according to iHome.  What they mean is that the cover protects the keyboard, and it also folds over to ""elevate keyboard for a better typing experience.""  All true.  I just wish that the magnets that secure the two parts of the cover actually held the cover in the folded over position as they do, for instance, with Apple's iPad Smart Cover.  Still, I had no trouble with keeping the cover in the folded over position, so I guess it's not an issue.  The one other thing to note is that the cover is attached; if you don't like it, you can't remove it.  But it's reasonably good looking and functional--a big improvement in my book.Synching this keyboard with my iPad 2 and my iPhone 4s was a piece of cake.  The enclosed directions were simple and easily followed.  This keyboard is also compatible with Android devices, and rumor has it, even my Kindles, but I haven't attempted that yet.  I am not sure it's worth the effort.There's one more feature I wanted to highlight, the slot into which your iPad or other tablet can be inserted either vertically or horizontally in order to be held upright at an angle for easy viewing while you type.  Some other reviewers have complained that this is not compatible with their thicker covers.  I use the Apple iPad Smart Cover and it doesn't get in the way at all.  If you do use a bulkier cover, that should be a consideration.  Another reviewer complained that he wouldn't trust this design to hold his expensive tablet upright with no back support.  Well, I've tested it in both vertical (as pictured) and horizontal (preferable) orientations, and the iPad is extremely secure.  I have no problem at all with this design.  In fact, this set-up now feels very much like I'm typing on a laptop.  The keyboard is full-sized.  It has function keys and hot keys that ""control music and minimize keyboard.""  The keyboard keys themselves have slightly tight action right now, but I expect them to loosen up a bit with use.  This is a huge improvement over anything I have utilized thus far.In addition to the minimalistic instructions, the iHome Smart Type 13-Inch Bluetooth Keyboard with Smart Cover for All iPads, Silver (IH-IP2120S) also comes with a 24-inch charging cable with a mini USB connector on one end (to fit into keyboard) and a standard USB connector that can be used in conjunction with a computer, an AC wall charger, or an external battery.  This is another difference with the IMAC-K111S, which is powered by two AAA batteries.  Per iHome, the keyboard functions for 60 hours on a single charge.  A good investment in conjunction with the keyboard might be an external charger.  I recently acquired a Yubi Power® YP840A 8400mAh External Battery Charger, and it worked perfectly in conjunction with the keyboard--in fact, I can literally charge both my iPad AND the keyboard at the same time, while using both, with this device.  It's wildly convenient and fully portable.  My iPad weighs a fraction of my laptop, is faster, and has at least three times the battery life.  Now with this keyboard and the external charger, I've got the perfect system for when I'm on the fly.And, I've typed this review on the iHome Smart Type.  I'm delighted with it.  What else is there to say?","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZOTV3OUL37WG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A6HYP1W#wasThisHelpful","RZOTV3OUL37WG","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sophie Littlefield's latest novel, Garden of Stones, opens in San Francisco in 1978.  The first chapter anticipates the murder of an old man.  The second chapter introduces Patty Takeda and her mother Lucy.  Patty, visiting her mother in the days leading up to her (Patty's) wedding, wakes to find Lucy having an early morning chat with a police inspector. Lucy is being questioned because she knew the victim decades prior, and neighborhood residents placed her at the scene.  With her horrible facial scaring, she's hard to miss.  The third chapter is where the novel's structure becomes apparent.  It flashes us back to the Los Angeles of 1941.Having just met the caustic older Lucy, we are now introduced to the stunningly beautiful adolescent version.  This privileged young girl is about to suffer a series of blows leading up to the United States' entry into the war.  Her Japanese heritage is suddenly a huge liability.  From there, the novel moves back and forth in time between the events of 1978 and those in the 1940's--with the bulk of the tale occurring in the past.  Lucy is sent to the Manzanar internment camp, along with her family, friends, and neighbors.  It is events that occurred at Manzanar that directly cultivated the woman Lucy was to become--and perhaps to the murder that has occurred.Now, I have been a fan of Ms. Littlefield's for years, and I love the sheer breadth and depth of what she writes from comic mysteries to zombie apocalypses.  The set-up above seems like another mystery, but truthfully, it's more of a historic drama.  The subject of Japanese internment strikes close to home to me--literally--having spent the past decade living a block from San Francisco's Japantown.  My neighborhood was greatly impacted by this shameful period of California's history.  I think fiction can be a powerful medium for evoking history.  Through fiction, stories live on and are humanized.I also think that a lot of research went into this novel, and yet I felt somewhat frustrated by viewing this history through the eyes of an unsophisticated teenage girl.  Those flashback sections of the novel had something of a YA feel about them.  Now, I have nothing against young adult fiction--I read a ton of it--but here I was hungering for a little more...detail ...maturity ... substance.  That would be my complaint.That said, I found myself very caught up in the story of these characters.  Littlefield writes, ""It was as if her mother had once been an entirely different person, and Patty faulted herself for never having seen far enough into her depths, for not being curious enough to coax out the story until now.""  Lucy Takeda lived an extraordinary life in a period of great historic significance.  As events led up to what felt like a climax, I realized that I was only at the center of the tale.  As Lucy matured, I became more and more invested in her story.  The frustration I'd felt earlier in the novel disappeared.  Character development has always been Ms. Littlefield's strength, and that is again the case here.  Still, by the time I'd reached the novel's end, she managed to truly surprise me with a couple of unexpected plot twists.  One, in particular, was really cleverly done.Ultimately, the murder that opens this novel is little more than a framing device, but as such it works well.  Garden of Stones is a great choice for readers interested in mother-daughter relationships, or who are simply looking for a great story set against a historic backdrop.  While it took me a little while to become fully invested in the tale, the deeper I read, the more I enjoyed this novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14HAAR5A6PPCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778313522#wasThisHelpful","R14HAAR5A6PPCU","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this Epson WorkForce WF-3540 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer for a few months now, and overall I've been pleased with its performance, but lately I've made some annoying discoveries.  Here are a few pros and cons I've discovered:PROS:* The single biggest plus of this printer/copier/scanner/fax/espresso maker/etc. is probably the ease of set-up.  I am not a technically-savvy individual.  At least not when it comes to hardware.  In the past, I've simply ignored my printers' wireless capability, as it was too challenging to set up.  I won't say that the instructions with the WF-3540 were fantastic, but there were good enough for me to fumble my way through the process with a minimum of fuss and trauma.  Not only was I able to set up my own computer to print to the machine wirelessly, but all other computers in the household.  And the wireless capabilities function flawlessly.* The printer/copier/scanner has some pretty sophisticated printing capabilities, ranging from sizing to double-sided printing.  Again, everything works as advertised, and the controls are reasonably logical and intuitive.* Printing and copying jobs reproduce nicely, with good color balance and reasonable sharpness.CONS:The cons I've discovered thus far all have to do with the ink cartridges.* Ink cartridges are very small and expensive, and you really can't print that many copies before they need replacing.* The WF-3540 takes four ink cartridges: black, cyan, yellow, and magenta.  The black cartridge is sold separately, and the three colors are sold as a combo pack for a bit more than twice the cost of the black ink cartridge.  Put them all together, and it adds up.* I'd been using the cartridges that came packaged with the printer, printing my copies in full-color.  Predictably, the black ink ran out first, but I was able to limp along for a while using a computer generated mixture of the other inks to mimic the black ink (a pro).  Then I ran out of magenta ink.  Even though I still had plenty of cyan and yellow ink left, my printer would no longer allow me to do any kind of printing or copying.  I would have to replace all three cartridges, even though I only needed one color at that point.  Seeing how expensive printing in full color would quickly become, I decided to switch to black/white/greyscale printing for the immediate future.  I changed the printer setting in my computer, and only purchased the black ink cartridge for the time being.  I now had black, cyan, and yellow ink available, and an empty magenta cartridge in the machine.  Even though I was printing in black and white, I was unable to get the printer to print a single page because I had not yet purchased the extremely expensive magenta ink--the ink I won't even be using to make black & white copies.  I called Epson customer service to see how I could override this annoyance, and I was told that there was nothing to be done.  So, until I shell out an additional $45 for ink I'm not planning to use at this time, I've currently got the world's largest paperweight sitting on my desk.I must confess that I've not yet tested the faxing capabilities of the WF-3540.  I haven't needed to fax any documents in the past few months, but I have reviewed the functionality of the fax machine and it seems intuitive enough.Overall, this is a good machine with a few dumb drawbacks having to do with the replacement ink cartridges that make it expensive to operate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EBR8ZC23HMHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091DPYDU#wasThisHelpful","R3EBR8ZC23HMHR","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me be clear--I suffer no chemical sensitivities.  Nor do I have anything against fragrances.  In fact, I wear one, a very expensive perfume.  I like to smell like my carefully-selected scent, not ""Baby Fresh"" or whatever the flavor of the month is.  It is for that reason that I have always chosen unscented deodorants.I used Secret faithfully for most of my adult life, but it was increasingly difficult to find the unscented version in stock.  At some point I switched over to Dove, and I've been pleased with the results.  For starters, while this deodorant may not meet the exacting standards of some with various medical concerns, this deodorant is fragrance- and chemical-free enough to meet my needs.The product does what it says it's going to do, namely prevent odor and perspiration.  It works at least as well as any other anti-perspirant/deodorant I've tried, and better than most.  Now this product also touts that it won't rub off on your clothes.  That isn't strictly true.  Any solid anti perspirant will rub off on clothing.  This one, at least, isn't too bad or too terribly visible.  One of the things I like best about the Dove GoSleeveless AntiPerspirant/Deodorant is how easily it goes on.  Remember those old Dove soap ads that promised a quarter cup of cold cream in every bar?  Well, I don't know what's in this deodorant, but it feels very moisturizing, and it glides right on smoothly.  It doesn't cake up under my arms, and it doesn't irritate my skin.The design of the packaging is unobtrusive and convenient.  What I mean is this: The solid deodorant is raised in the plastic applicator by twisting the entire base of the applicator case.  It's a better, easier, neater system than most.Deodorant is not a glamorous product, but it's an important part of my daily hygiene ritual.  The Dove GoSleeveless AntiPerspirant/Deodorant Fragrance Free makes me feel fresh and clean, and it leaves me smelling like me.  I haven't found anything better on the market yet, and I'm very satisfied with this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HV15EK4REV70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ECQ5FW#wasThisHelpful","R3HV15EK4REV70","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My best friend is a little obsessive about reading the novel before seeing the film.  Not so, me.  I'm a bit more laissez faire in these matters.  I saw and thoroughly enjoyed Tim Burton's 2003 adaptation of Big Fish, and didn't think too much more about it.  Fast forward a decade, and I hear that a major, Broadway-bound musical is on the way.  Now I know it's time to return to the source material.In the past, it has occurred to me that I have an overdeveloped sense of whimsy.  I'm a middle-aged woman, for God's sake.  But I love this sort of light, heart-warming, and above all whimsical tale.  Daniel Wallace's debut novel charmed my socks right off!  It is, first and foremost, a tale of paternal and filial love.  The brief novel is told through the eyes of son William as he watches--four separate times--his father Edward dying.  It doesn't sound like an upper, I know, but Edward Bloom is a larger-than-life character.All his life, Edward was a teller of jokes and tall tales.  He's the sort of character who charms everyone around him.  And yet, as much as his father has always made him laugh, William feels that all the jokes and stories have kept him at arm's length, and that he's never really gotten to know his father.  Now in these final hours, he seeks a deeper connection--all while a greatest hits montage of tall tales recounts Edward's extraordinary, eventful, and one might even say mythic, life.  Edward confesses to his son, ""I wanted to be a great man...  Can you believe it?  I thought it was my destiny.  A big fish in a big pond.""  Later William acknowledges, ""He's just being him, something he can't not be.  Beneath one faÃ§ade there's another faÃ§ade, and another.  And beneath that, the aching dark place, his life.""  By the end, however, each man gets what it is he needs:""His illness was his ticket to a better place.  I know this now.  Still, it was the best thing that could have happened to us, this final journey.  Well, maybe not the best thing, but a good thing, all things considered. ""In Wallace's novel, it's the journey, not the destination.  The folksy fables that make up Edward's life are as colorful and imaginative as anything you could wish for, and full of humor.  And Daniel Wallace's narrative voice is distinctive, as well as distinctly Southern.  He has a wonderful, playful way with language, as with this passage: ""This is what is meant by last words.  They are keys to unlock the afterlife.  They're not last words, but passwords, and as soon as they are spoken you can go.""  While Edward is more legend than man, it is William who is the emotional core of the novel.  He's what keeps the story grounded and creates resonance with readers.  Everyone knows what it is to love (and feel frustrated by) a parent, and so the emotion William experiences is universal.This was a fantastic introduction (15 years late) to a new novelist.  I can't wait for a chance to see the musical!  It will be magical on the stage.  It's been years since I've seen the film, but Burton did a lovely adaptation.  Many of the stories from the novel are recreated faithfully.  Others are altered or created from scratch in the same voice.  I was delighted to discover in the book passages that never made it into the film as well.  Commenting on adaptation on his blog, Wallace noted that Big Fish was now a book, a movie, and a musical.  He offered one final adaptation.  Big Fish, the haiku:He hides behind liesand charm.  I do not know him.My father is a fish.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34OJ75ZXVJ5NH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616201649#wasThisHelpful","R34OJ75ZXVJ5NH","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of Mr. Barry's for decades.  He has elicited from me embarrassing snorts of laughter on too many occasions to count.  Therefore, and new novel is always an occasion to be looked forward to.The insane city of the novel's title is Miami, Florida, soon to be the site of the Weinstein-Clark wedding.  At the heart of the tale is groom Seth Weinstein, and the novel's first few chapters could be the opening of The Hangover III.  It's bachelor party night, and while amusing, I did think to myself, ""If this is 300 pages of Boys Behaving Badly, I'm not sure I can take it.""  Happily, that is not the case.  Well, there is a lot of bad behavior from boys, girls, and, uh, various other creatures, but the bachelor hijinks soon pave the way for a far more absurd and entertaining tale.  It's goofy as all get out, but has both substance and heart at its very core.  I could try to summarize the novel's plot, but I think it would be a lot more fun to share a few brief quotes:""This isn't what it looks like.""""So, you're NOT bleeding from the head and hanging out with a BeyoncÃ© look-alike and a Jerry Springer bouncer carrying a large snake?""""He had to stop being an idiot.""""Wait, he SHOT A JET SKI?  Even in Miami, that has to be against the law.""""I know it sounds crazy.""""Eventually these people decided that this was just another one of those strange things that seem to happen in Miami.""""Nothing I hate more than an orangutan shooter.""""If you're just joining us this morning, we're following one of those weird stories that makes you shake your head and say, `Only in Miami.'""""It's complicated.""""Even by Miami standards, this was a weird group making its way through the Bayside crowd.""""Any man fleeing from the police with three women, two children, and an orangutan is a friend of mine.""Oh, yes, it's novels like this that make me wonder why I'm considering relocating to Miami.  Dave Barry can still make me laugh out loud after all these years.  And while no one will ever mistake his work for literary fiction, he did once win a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary.  He knows how to write a proper sentence.  Furthermore, he did a nice job of creating characters who, over the course of the novel, manage to reveal their true natures.Don't come to this one looking for sophistication or subtlety, but if you've had a bad day and are seeking a little screwball comedy, look no further.

"Sure I live in ""sunny California,"" but, people, it's cold in San Francisco in February.  Who am I kidding?  It's cold in San Francisco in June.  Consequently, I wear a lot of cardigan sweaters.  Any San Franciscan will tell you, layers are the key.  Here's the other thing...  Remember when sweaters used to be fun?  (I think it was the 80's.)  These days, they're all boring solids or some dull pattern.  This G2 Fashion Square Multicolored Stripe Open Front Drape Cardigan caught my eye because it had a little style and flair.So, I'll have to take Amazon's word that it's 100% acrylic, because my sweater (which arrived promptly packaged in a heavy-duty poly bag) has no tag with materials or washing instructions.  But acrylic should be okay in my washer's gentle cycle, and laid out to dry, right?  It may not be merino wool, but I'll tell you this, it's super soft and not scratchy at all.  I'd describe the sweater as being medium weight, which for my climate means wearable virtually year round.I was interested to see a previous reviewer complain about the sleeve length.  I'm also 5'6"", and my sleeves fit just right.  Not too long and not too short--definitely not three-quarter length--and I haven't pushed them up once.  To each her own, right?  A bit more on the fit...  Normally I'd be an XL, a size 16, but I thought with this open style that the large would be fine, and I was right.  It's fine, but not generous.  If you actually do wear a large, I would think it would be very true to size.  But again, with a style like this, there's a lot of leeway.  A medium could surely wear it just as well.It was the photograph, of course, that first grabbed my eye.  My sweater looks exactly like the photo, right down to the position of the stripes.  I love the colors of this sweater.  It's very neutral, with prominent beiges and grays, but it's got all those stripes of color adding interest.  You can sort of see that some of the stripes are two different colors blended, like navy blue and beige, but in other cases it's a more subtle blending of colors.  The cardigan looks nice in the photo with the black jeans and white shirt, but I've been wearing it with blue jeans and an ivory turtleneck and think it looks great!  I may also try it with a brown suede skirt.  All I know is that I wore it to book group last night and received all sorts of unsolicited compliments.  Yes indeed, it's all about the layers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25KJ39D6JIN7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADVINOQ#wasThisHelpful","R25KJ39D6JIN7S","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Years ago, I was asked one of those silly questions that readers ask each other: â€œIf you could be any literary character, who would you be?â€  Without hesitation, I replied, â€œPrincess Buttercup.â€  After all, what woman in her right mind wouldnâ€™t crave a life of true love and high adventure?I have no recollection of when I first read William Goldmanâ€™s beloved novel, but I can tell you that in the decades since, Iâ€™ve read the book and seen the film at least a dozen times.  It is very high on my list of all-time favorites.  I never grow tired of it.  I can pick this book up and start reading on any page and get sucked in immediately.  And as soon as Iâ€™ve finished it, I could easily start reading from page one all over again.  It is a case of true love.Now, you have to have been living under a rock for the past few decades not to have an idea of what this tale is about.  Itâ€™s the story of the beautiful milkmaid Buttercup and her love for the dashing farm boy Westley and all they go through in order to be together.  Additionally, the novel uses the authorâ€™s life as a framing device.  In what is purported to be a series of forwards and abridgerâ€™s notes, Goldman reflects on his personal history with â€œS. Morgensternâ€™s Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure.â€  He speaks candidly (and entirely fictitiously) of his family life, and perhaps somewhat less fictitiously of his professional life.  And he tells the story of how his father first read him the tale when he was ten years old.  When he asked if there were any sports in the book, the man replied:â€œFencing.  Fighting.  Torture.  Poison.  True love.  Hate.  Revenge.  Giants.  Hunters.  Bad men.  Good men.  Beautiful ladies.  Snakes.  Spiders.  Beasts of all natures and descriptions.  Pain.  Death.  Brave men.  Coward men.  Strongest men.  Chases.  Escapes.  Lies.  Truths.  Passion.  Miracles.â€I ask you, what more could a reader possibly want?The one thing Goldman forgot to list is humor.  What has made this tale such a classic, in addition to the fact that it contains one of the five greatest kisses of all time, is the novelâ€™s adroit humor.  It ranges from sophisticated to glib to farcical, and it never fails to make me smile.  Because of the brilliant film adaptation (also written by Goldman), many of the novelâ€™s lines and passages have become cultural touchstones.  Have you ever cried, â€œInconceivable!â€ in a Wally Shawn lisp?  Mandy Patinkin doesnâ€™t go a day without someone coming up to him and proclaiming, â€œMy name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!â€  Does the phrase â€œAs you wish.â€ just give you chills?  These characters are indelible, and Mr. Goldmanâ€™s humor has held up for 40 years.  I believe people still be chuckling over this novel a hundred years from now.  Shakespeare, Jane Austen, P.G. Wodehouseâ€”some humor is simply timeless.Clearly, I love a feel-good story, but most suffer from diminishing returns.  Maybe it was awesome the first time you read it, pretty good the second, and less so on successive reads.  Not so, The Princess Bride.  If anything, I think my considerable affection for this novel grows with each successive reading.  And Iâ€™m still spotting new things!  On this read, for the first time, I spotted the fake blurbs at the front of the Kindle edition.  (One was from â€œShog Bongiorno, professor emeritus, Mid-European Literature, Columbia University,â€ LOL.)Twenty-fifth and thirtieth anniversary editions of The Princess Bride have contained new forwards that continue the story that Goldman uses as the novelâ€™s framing device.  And after the novelâ€™s end, there is a lengthy introduction to a substantial sample of the novelâ€™s fictitious sequel, Buttercupâ€™s Baby.  Iâ€™ve read it all except for Buttercupâ€™s Baby.

"Every time a thriller writer is compared to the late, great Michael Crichton, my heart skips a happy beat.  I don't think his large shoes will be filled any time soon, but I am delighted to see other writers trodding the same territory.  Mark Alpert is a natural for these comparisons.  With a degree in astrophysics and more than a decade on the editorial staff of Scientific American magazine, the man knows his science.  Extinction is his third foray into the word of fiction.After a brief prologue, readers are introduced to former soldier Jim Pierce.  Himself an amputee, Jim has turned his engineering know-how to the world of high-tech prosthetics.  In the novel's opening scene, he's having a consultation with a young soldier, explaining to the wounded man just how advanced these devices have become.  The prosthetics Jim builds (and wears) are like something out of a James Bond film, and controlled wirelessly by the user's brain--just like a natural body part.Shortly after he leaves Jim's workroom, an unexpected visitor arrives asking questions about Jim's estranged, 22-year-old daughter, Layla.  The visitor claims to be from the military, but that story quickly breaks down into threats and violence.  Jim is more than an ex-soldier, he's a former intelligence officer, and he knows a Chinese spook when he sees one.  What the hell has his daughter gotten herself into?Alpert's tale is not a simple high-concept plot that can be summarized in a few sentences or even paragraphs.  I suspect I should quit this synopsis while I'm ahead.  Extinction deals with a variety of technologies involving machine-brain interfaces.  Some are as innocuous as bionic limbs and eye glasses that function as eyes for the blind.  Other technologies lead to the threat at the heart of this novel--a dangerous new artificial intelligence, a sort of human-machine hybrid that wants to rid the world of the vast majority of those pesky human components.  It is this borg-like entity that may well pull the trigger on our extinction.  And Jim Pierce and his daughter somehow get sucked into this high-stakes drama.  I'll leave it to you to uncover the details.It is unsurprising that Mr. Alpert is at his best when delving into the science that is integral to the novel's plot.  Says one character: ""Just think of it!  We won't be tied to these fragile bodies anymore!  If we can store a person's memories in a sufficiently powerful processor, we can program it to generate new thoughts based on those memories.  For all intents and purposes, the intelligence inside the processor would be identical to the one inside the person's brain.  And this will become possible very soon, within the next few decades.  There are people alive today who will never die!""An author's note at the novel's end gives readers a better idea of what is fact and what is fiction.  It's surprisingly difficult to figure out in this day-after-tomorrow-set tale.  The science in this book is smart, fascinating, and has a really high gee-whiz quotient.  Alpert delves enthusiastically into several different disciplines.  It's exactly what I want to see in this type of thriller.  Further, Mr. Alpert has fashioned a fun, fast plot in which to imbed all that science.  Yes, it is somewhat formulaic, but aren't they all?Mark Alpert brings a heap of knowledge to his fiction, and he's great at explaining complex ideas and building a plot around them.  However, it's the actual mechanics of writing fiction where he's weakest.  This is most apparent near the novel's opening.  Some of the early exposition was truly graceless.  Nor will he win any awards for the elegance of his prose.  It's serviceable, but nothing more.  And, yes, there were a few plot contrivances.  Alpert does better with his action sequences.  They really propel the narrative in the second half of the novel.  Character development is a mixed bag.  A description of how Layla experiences music, for example, was a great insight into how she experiences the world.  It was a lovely detail.Most readers of techno-thrillers aren't concerned about a little clumsy exposition.  Most are looking for some smart, speculative science buried in a propulsive plot.  They're looking for a glimpse of that old Crichton magic.  And they just might find it in Extinction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YQ0EUD1D42S7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250021340#wasThisHelpful","R2YQ0EUD1D42S7","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It wasn't that long ago that any publisher would have told you that ""story collections don't sell.""  These days, however, they're all the rage.  If asked, I would proclaim, ""I'm not into short-form.""  And yet, I've read three excellent collections within the past month.  I am being forced to reassess my attitudes because there is a lot of exciting short fiction being produced these days!Jess Walter's debut collection, We Live in Water, is literally overflowing with story.  The first several tales in the collection deal with parent/child relationships.  Do I detect a motif?  But then there were tales of male/female relationships, and then tales of crime and punishment.  Eventually some themes did emerge, and if there is one commonality to be found throughout these stories, I believe it to be the question of honor.  Walter explores this concept from a variety of angles and approaches.Most of the tales within this collection are fairly realistic.  The one exception is ""Don't Eat Cat.""  I'm trying to think of how to describe it.  It's speculative and satirical, moving and poignant, all at once.  It was one of my favorite stories in the collection, but as I made my way through the baker's dozen tales, I proclaimed several to be my favorite for a time.  The first was the title story, ""We Live in Water.""  The reader comprehends the significance of the title at the same time as the central character does.  It's a beautiful revelation.A few of these stories seem to reside in the same Walterverse.  The characters and settings of ""Can of Corn"" overlap with those of ""The Brakes.""  Less obviously, is the Mr. McAdam referenced in ""Thief"" (another favorite) he same Mr. McAdam who shows up later in ""The Wolf and the Wild""?  I guess it's not surprising there would be some overlap.  Most of these tales stick pretty close to Walter's home territory of Spokane, Washington.  His characters have challenges and fallibilities.  They are flawed and funny at once.  They are at all times believable.I believe different story writers have different strengths.  Some you read for their beautiful language.  Others offer extraordinary insight into character.  Mr. Walter is more than fine on both counts, but that's not where he really shines.  The greatest satisfaction of this collection is the completeness of the stories that he is telling.  They have a beginning, a middle, and an end.  They were unusually well-structured and well-plotted, regardless of length.  They did not leaving me hungering for the rest of the tale.  Simply put, Mr. Walter knows how to tell one hell of a good yarn.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TVJY5EPTKGA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061926620#wasThisHelpful","R3TVJY5EPTKGA8","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was introduced to Ms. Russell's work through her Pulitzer Prize finalist debut novel, Swamplandia!  I was immediately seduced by her imaginative use of language, as well as the quirky tale and endearing central character.  I came to Vampires in the Lemon Grove, her second story collection, expecting more of the same except, you know, shorter.  I don't know that my expectations were fully met.Ms. Russell writes beautifully--so no complaints there.  She has an idiosyncratic and evocative style, and if you'll indulge me, here are a few quotes:* ""Marcy McFadden was gone.  But Beverly could read the Braille of her mother's curved spine--it was composed in the unspeakable, skeletal language that she had learned at school.""* ""Beverly once read a science magazine article about bioluminescence, the natural glow emitted by organisms like fireflies and jellyfish, but she knows the dead also give off a strange illumination, a phosphor that can permanently damage the eyes of the living.  Necroluminescence--the light of the vanished.  A hindsight produced by the departed's body.  Your failings backlit by the death of your loved ones.""* ""It was a terribly embarrassing voice--a weak white grasshopper species that we would have tried to kill, had it belonged to a fellow child.""Hers is a rare and extraordinary gift.  And, yes, she is still telling quirky tales, some of them extremely so.  The title story is exactly as advertised.  It's about an elderly vampire living in an Italian lemon grove.  Russell has fun exploring the ""reality"" of pop culture vampire tropes.  Even the vampires buy into them, apparently.  That first tale is emblematic of the stories in the collection--almost all of them involve some fantastic element or other.  And then there's this: Ms. Russell's premises can suggest a certain lightness or even humor, but her tales often become dark.It was the collection's second story, ""Reeling for the Empire,"" that--for lack of a better description--completely freaked me out.  I'm not going to describe it at all; it's better for you to just discover it exactly as the author has presented it.  What I will say is that it's deeply, deeply weird and nightmarish.  But also kind of brilliant and... and... What kind of sick mind thinks up this stuff?  That is where I began to feel disquieted and also provoked.  Ms. Russell's stories provoked strong reactions from me.  I'm not sure they were entirely positive reactions, but I could always appreciate the talent, intelligence, and imagination that Ms. Russell displayed.I don't feel like it would be productive to write up summaries of the eight stories that make up this collection.  Ultimately, a plot synopsis wouldn't be very illustrative.  It was interesting for me to read this collection virtually back-to-back with George Saunders' much-vaunted collection, Tenth of December.  There were interesting aspects to their work to compare and contrast, which was not surprising as Mr. Saunders is often listed as influencing Ms. Russell.  Speaking broadly, reading him was a more joyful experience.  But for better or worse, it's her tales that will probably have the greater staying power.  Ms. Russell's stories disturbed me at the same time as they entertained me.  I had confusing emotional responses to her work.  I imagine she would be very pleased to have aroused such reactions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SCYV3QEG492M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307957233#wasThisHelpful","R1SCYV3QEG492M","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bucky Cantor is a mensch--a good man.  During the summer of 1944, when the bulk of this brief novel takes place, 23-year-old Bucky is working as the playground director of the Chancellor Avenue Playground in the Weequahic neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey.  It's the city's Jewish neighborhood, and that summer it's been hit brutally hard by a polio epidemic.  Kids are scared and parents downright are terrified.  Bucky's own grief and fear are balanced by a sense of duty equal to that of any Gilbert & Sullivan protagonist.  Conflict arises when his girlfriend begs him to leave the disease-stricken city and join her as a counselor at a bucolic summer camp in the Poconos.  The situation in Newark is volatile.  Says the girlfriend's father, a doctor:""The anti-Semites are saying that it's because they're Jews that polio spreads there.  Because of all the Jews, that's why Weequahic is the center of the paralysis and why the Jews should be isolated.  Some of them sound as if they think the best way to get rid of the polio epidemic would be to burn down Weequahic with all the Jews in it.  There is a lot of bad feeling because of the crazy things people are saying out of their fear.  Out of their fear and their hatred.  I was born in the city, and I've never known anything like this in my life.  It's as if everything everywhere is collapsing.""Meanwhile, the stress of what was happening in Newark and elsewhere around the country was playing out against the backdrop of a country at war.  It was a terrible, terrible time.My mother contracted polio a few years after the events depicted in this novel.  We've discussed this frightening period of her life many times over the years, but strangely, hearing her personal account couldn't touch the reality of what Mr. Roth has depicted with such immediacy.  Reading Nemesis made me feel like I'd taken a time machine back for a visit.  It gave me fresh insight into my mother's experience.  And it also served as a reminder of just how forgotten this terrible disease is.  In 1944, both scientists and the public were so appallingly ignorant about the cause and transmission of polio it was hard to believe.  And yet...  I don't know anything about polio.  Despite my mother's history, I'm not sure I could have told you it was a virus.  Is transmission airborne?  I have no idea.  Polio has never been a part of my lifetime, and after reading this novel, I pray that it never is.  More than anything, Nemesis is completely evocative of the time and place in which it is set.  As glad as I am to have had a window into the past, I'm even gladder to have moved on from that time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF088Q5B5P2DZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052HKL4G#wasThisHelpful","RF088Q5B5P2DZ","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought James M. Tabor's fiction debut, The Deep Zone, was flawed, but promising.  I'm happy to report that his sophomore novel, Frozen Solid, has lived up to that promise.  While Mr. Tabor still has room to grow, this second novel was just as much fun as the first, and far better executed.Frozen Solid again features his protagonist, Hallie Leland.  The government microbiologist has been routed up to Antarctica of all places, just days before the winter-over begins.  She's there to fill in for a deceased scientist--an old friend of Hallie's, as it happens.  Once more, Hallie's unusual skill set (climbing, diving, laboratory research) is a match for a project's needs.  Unfortunately, her brief visit gets off to a terrible start, as more scientists succumb to an unknown ailment.  Tensions are running high in a powder keg environment.  Meanwhile, Hallie has suspicions about her predecessor's death and is having problems with the research project.  Is someone sabotaging her work?  The entire base?  And will she be able to fly out in four days, or will she be stuck in Antarctica for months?Mr. Tabor gets all of his plot elements into position beautifully.  I had a few qualms early on in the novel.  There was a brief snatch of clichÃ©d and clunky writing.  (""I will find you, she vowed.  If it takes the rest of my life, I will find you.  Wil Bowman will help me.  And you will pay."")  And there were some minor plot contrivances.  (Some of those clues were awfully easy to find--even when she wasn't looking for them.)  But once the story got going, those early issue fell by the wayside as the novel's momentum took over.  The pacing of the novel was excellent.  It moved quickly and was full of excitement.  Sometimes the action in thrillers feels like it's just inserted to keep things moving, but here it all felt organic to the story being told.  Let's face it, Antarctica is an extreme environment, and when you're diving beneath the ice or staging a colleague's rescue, it's exciting stuff.Plus, there's Hallie's area of scientific inquiry.  She studies extremophiles--organisms that survive in extreme environments--like miles below the ice.  Or, an organism that ""survives in sodium concentrations that would kill anything else.""  This isn't a Crichton novel.  It isn't as chock full of science, but I wish that it was, because what was there was fascinating.  Hallie's a girl after my own heart... ""In the end, she found herself asking this question: Who do you trust when you can't trust anybody?  The answer came quickly: Not who.  What.  And the what was science.  You could always trust the science.""  I trusted Mr. Tabor's science here.  Sure, it's speculative as hell, but it has the ring of truth and some research behind it.  Plus, it was super cool!  That's good enough for me.I like Hallie as a character.  I really enjoy seeing a strong, confident, competent, and believable woman at the center of an action/adventure series.  (""She knew this was how disasters began: with a single failure that led to two others, each of which led to more, a cascade of events feeding upon itself."")  This is a lady that doesn't wait to be rescued.  She rescues herself--and frequently others.  There are a couple of other characters from the first novel in supporting roles, but as Hallie is out of her normal environment, most of the cast is new, and they're a fairly intriguing bunch.  I'm quite willing to believe that it's a quirky crew attracted to work in Antarctica.  Obviously, the setting is an important part of the tale, and Tabor's Antarctica is a bit more oppressive and depressive than most depictions.  It is atmospheric, that's for sure.  His settings are evocative and well-drawn--none better than the underwater scenes.  (Yes, that was totally my favorite part.)When all is said and done, I've seen variations on the novel's central plot before, but it was well-handled and getting there was more than half the fun.  I feel that my early faith in Mr. Tabor's growth as a novelist has been well -rewarded, and I shall be looking forward to his next offering with even more anticipation and enthusiasm.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RJLNFUAL4E19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345530632#wasThisHelpful","R2RJLNFUAL4E19","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yasuko Hanaoka is a single mother just trying to get ahead.  She's finally working a more respectable job and raising her teenage daughter, Misato, as best she can.  Her sleazy ex-husband, Togashi, is making that difficult.  As much as she tries to distance herself, he keeps coming around, extorting money in order to go away.  This time, however, the altercation becomes physical when Misato hits him.  He attacks the girl, and both mother and daughter wind up in a life-or-death struggle that finds Togashi strangled on the floor.Panicked, the two are discussing Yasuko turning herself into the police when a knock comes at the door.  It is Ishigami, the smitten teacher who lives next-door.  It seems he *will* do anything for Yasuko--including move bodies.  And so a plot is hatched.  Ishigami is much more than a high school math teacher.  At one time, he was a bona fide mathematical genius and it seems he's still got a talent for logic and strategy.  Will it help them all get away with murder?Enter ""Detective Galileo,"" the nickname of physicist Manabu Yukawa.  Yukawa earned his moniker helping out the police on occasional cases.  He's got Holmesian intellect and observational skills, though considerably better people skills than the famed detective.  And, back in their college days, he and Ishigami were friends and rivals.  While Yukawa is not officially on the case, his personal connection draws him in.  But rather than working with Detective Kusanagi, for the first time he seems to be following his own agenda.  Thus begins a high-stakes chess game between two brilliant men.  Says the physicist:""When an amateur attempts to conceal something, the more complex he makes his camouflage, the deeper the grave he digs for himself.  But not so a genius.  The genius does something far simpler, yet something no normal person would even dream of, the last thing a normal person would think of doing.  And from this simplicity, immense complexity is created.""I'm not generally a huge fan of police procedurals, but this one had a lot going for it.  At the very top of the list is the plotting.  The cat-and-mouse aspect to the investigation kept tension ratcheted--especially as readers knew exactly how the murder went down from the novel's opening pages.  But each of these men had surprises up their sleeves, and the dÃ©nouement was a thing of beauty.  Also, this was largely a crime of self-defense (apparently not a big concept in the Japanese legal system, as it was never brought up once as a mitigating factor), and therefore the perpetrators were quite sympathetic.  As a reader, at times it was hard to know who to root for--and that's just interesting.  This was definitely not a black and white crime novel.Character development is a little trickier.  I always have some trouble getting a feel for Japanese characters simply due to cultural differences.  And whatever the culture, Ishigami is not your average Joe.  I liked Yukawa quite a lot, but can't say that I feel he's a wildly unique creation.  At least not yet.  Author Keigo Higashino has had a second Detective Galileo mystery published in English, Salvation of a Saint.  As I was reading, I thought to myself, This must not be the first novel in the series.  But checking Wikipedia, it appears there were only a series of short stories featuring the character prior to this novel.  Additionally, there's a third novel in the series not yet released in America.  Based on this introduction, I'd be very open to further investigations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MDDQDYHWLT1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009D950BI#wasThisHelpful","R3MDDQDYHWLT1E","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...The openings of his novels are always grabbers.  In The Cloud, protagonist Nat Idle is waiting to catch a late-night train when an enormous drunken man staggers into him.  They both crash to the ground, with Nat very nearly thrown to the tracks in front of an oncoming train.  A near-death experience instead becomes a nasty crack on the head, and a kind passerby rushes to assist.  The drunk takes off, with a paper falling from his pocket as he exits.  Nat's ready to write the incident off, grateful to have gotten off relatively lightly--until he picks up the paper the man dropped.  His name is on it.  This was no accident.That is merely the beginning of another of Idle's investigative adventures.  For a medical journalist and blogger, he does seem to become embroiled in some dark stuff.  This story involves a technology designed to help kids learn to multi-task that may be causing a far more serious side effect.  And yet, as intense of the plots of these novels are, at their heart they are character-driven, and none more so than this latest installment.  Character absolutely drives plot, but in this case, prior knowledge of the character from his debut in Hooked or Devil's Plaything would be helpful.  Nat sustains a head injury in that opening scene.  It affects him.  He's not himself, and I think that will be appreciated more by readers acquainted with the character.  Nat's funny, friendly, flawed, and fallible.  He'll go after a story like no one's business.  But in The Cloud, he's altered.  And he's something of an unreliable narrator, which makes an already convoluted mystery that much more mysterious.Mr. Richtel, incidentally, is also a journalist.  By day, he writes about technology for the New York Times.  He, in fact, won a Pulitzer Prize for doing so a few years ago.  My point is, the man can write.  His prose has an effortless readability, a sense of fun, and frequently rises above what one expects to find in a thriller.  The novel moves swiftly, as events take place over the course of just a few virtually sleepless days.  Furthermore, by the time all is revealed, the elegance and intricacy of the novel's plot will become apparent.  Oh, I had suspicions along the way.  Some were right, many were wrong.  But once I knew the truth, it was all so clear.  The clues were salted everywhere.Richtel didn't learn about character development, pacing, and plot on the day job.  I'm not sure where he learned the tools of his trade, because in this novel especially, he eschews literary convention while at the same time embracing certain genre tropes, for instance a beautiful and mysterious woman straight out of a detective noir.  Tropes are tropes for a reason, and Richtel has his fun.  But it's where he diverges from convention, notably with this novel's conclusion, that things get really interesting.  I can't discuss the choices made without spoilers, so I'll simply say that Mr. Richtel wrapped up his mystery in a way that was unexpected, unconventional, sophisticated, and satisfying.And aside from solving the mystery, Mr. Richtel has taken his protagonist into uncharted territory.  The tale comes to a complete conclusion with no annoying cliff-hangers, but Nat evolves so much (and so believably) in this novel that I'm now consumed with knowing what the next chapter in his life will bring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R388BZKIWPD7ZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061999709#wasThisHelpful","R388BZKIWPD7ZK","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love letters--both writing and receiving them.  It's a lost art, and an intimate form of communication.  Perhaps it is these feelings that make me especially receptive to the epistolary novel.  The obvious has only occurred to me recently, but I flat-out love them.  Where'd You Go, Bernadette?; The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society; and The Lawgiver were all favorite reads within the last few months.  Epistolary novels have an unusual structure.  For me, it's just an exceptionally interesting and non-linear way to tell a story.The other thing is, our voices come alive in our correspondence.  Within the first few pages of Frances and Bernard, I'd fallen in love with both of the titular characters.  I could hear their voices so clearly through the letters they wrote.  They were funny, intellectual, literate--no wonder these two hit it off immediately when they met at a writers' colony in 1957.  Frances is a novelist, not yet published, and Bernard, a poet, with a bit more of a track record.  The book follows their correspondence for just over a decade.According to the novel's jacket copy, these two are loosely based upon Flannery O'Connor and Robert Lowell.  May I be honest?  I don't know a thing about these literary progenitors.  I'm sure an intimate knowledge of O'Connor and Lowell's history and work would have added untold richness to my read.  However, my ignorance detracted nothing as far as I can tell, and made their story feel completely fresh and unexpected to me.Truthfully, I'm rather surprised by just how much I liked this debut.  It should be noted that a significant percentage of Frances and Bernard's correspondence with each other deals with matters of Catholicism and faith--not my favorite subject matter.  For me, this tale was ALL about the two central characters that were so beautifully realized by Carlene Bauer.  What is the nature of their connection, and where will it lead?  Bernard writes to his best friend:""You have posited that she may have, your words, a thing for me, but I don't think she does, and I am fairly sure that I don't have one for her.  I kept looking at her from different angles and examining my response.  Various types of affection flared up in her presence, but not romance.""Don't expect the typical boy-meets-girl tale.  Later he writes to the same friend, ""...she knew me when I was at my most Bernard and I knew her when she was at her most Frances.""  I ask you, who wouldn't want to be known like that?","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FXPH64IPXWKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547858248#wasThisHelpful","R2FXPH64IPXWKO","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert Pobi's second novel, Mannheim Rex, falls firmly within the territory of a literary genre I coined.  I call it ""trashy underwater fiction,"" (TUF) and have ever since I was the editor of a magazine for scuba divers.  There are many subgenres of TUF: killer marine life, mermaids, talking dolphins, undersea city, etc.  Mannheim Rex is of the ""lake monster"" subgenre.  And I ask you, how can you go wrong?  There's a lake, and you have a monster.  It almost writes itself.Well, let's give credit where credit is due.  I think Mr. Pobi had a hand in this.  After the requisite mysterious fishing death, the novel opens in the New York apartment of a hugely successful horror novelist.  If you stretch your imagination, you can probably think of a real-world counterpart.  Not yet forty, Gavin Corlie has realized the kind of success most men only dream about--but that can't bring his wife back.  Unable to move past his grief, he knows something has to change.  Almost on a whim, he buys a house upstate on Lake Caldasac.There, Corlie begins to find some measure of peace, and begins to make friends--first with Finn, a handicapped thirteen-year-old boy, and then with the local doctor treating him.  But Finn also introduces Gavin to the mysterious goings on at the lake.  The two of them join together on a quest to uncover the truth and to hunt a lake monster.Now, this is all pretty familiar territory to aficionados of TUF, but Pobi's having fun with the genre tropes.  He'll win no literary awards, but I've seen writing that's far worse.  The plot was fairly predictable--especially the identity of the mystery monster--but some scenes (like a certain basement sequence) elevated the material briefly.  The characters were a mixed bag.  Corlie was enjoyable enough, but Finn drove me nuts!  I wanted to punch that little handicapped kid!  He was so annoying.  Also, in addition to the threat in the lake, the novel features a second antagonist.  This character was COMPLETELY over-the-top.  It was actually a little hard to believe what I was reading at times.  The novel's pace was okay, a somewhat surprising fact given the book's inflated 540-page length.Mannheim Rex isn't literature, but if you're reading this review, I don't think that's what you're looking for.  You want to know the best thing about lake monsters?  They can turn out to be almost anything.  I'd not encountered this culprit before, and despite some predictability, Mannheim Rex is a welcome addition to my trashy underwater fiction shelves.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3140P1CSUO7RA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612184480#wasThisHelpful","R3140P1CSUO7RA","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have you ever seen an ad or read a description of a new product and thought, ""Yeah, I gotta try that.""  That was the case here.And overall, I was quite impressed with Quaker Real Medleys Cherry Pistachio Oatmeal.  It's a quality product, with generous amounts of fruit and nuts--and not little tiny pieces either.  ""Medleys"" is a good name because these cups are full of both flavor and texture, and it all blends together nicely.  This sure isn't the bland, flavorless instant oatmeal I grew up with!  The portion is generous.  The packaging, while not compact, is convenient for preparing and eating the oatmeal.  I made mine with low-fat milk rather than water, adding a little extra richness.My only criticism--and this is merely a matter of taste--is that I found the cherry pistachio flavor to be somewhat sweeter than I would prefer.  It's quite sweet, and frankly a little more sugary than I'm generally up for for breakfast.  But if you've got a sweet tooth or are looking for a little AM energy boost, I'd recommend giving Quaker Real Medleys Cherry Pistachio Oatmeal a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAW7XB1Y3TFW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007N04BZA#wasThisHelpful","RAW7XB1Y3TFW5","A151OW029XD9JU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A151OW029XD9JU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"MicroMachines were made by a company called Galoob, and they are plastic, about half the size of a Hot Wheel. Kids love them because they can take them anywhere since they are so tiny. The company was bought out and sadly dismantled by their largest competitor in the late 1990's, so to find them in their original packaging is rare, as there is already a booming market in used individual cars. The MicroMachines line of toys were hugely popular in their time, and well known for their tiny scale miniature size. After about 15 years or so, they could not withstand against the competition of cheap import copies that flooded the market trying to exploit the popularity of these toys.Each miniature vehicle car would only be an inch and a half long or so. This set includes a tiny Gas Tanker Truck and 1949 Mercury, a towtruck plus 2 tiny mechanic figures . The company also made playsets to use the cars in.

"I bought this book about 5 days ago for my son who wanted to read it on his Samsung Galaxy 2 Tablet, with the Kindle App. He also reads books on the Kindle app on his phone, and I do the same. We were disappointed to find out that the video extras that are part of the digital copy of the book did not work on any of these devices. Yesterday we bought the same book on Google Play store, and the audio/video function works fine. I have never had any trouble before with a book on Kindle, but then this is the first one with audio and video. Interestingly, there is not a refund or return function for this product on my orders page, so we are stuck with it. Perhaps Amazon will notice and fix the app in a future update.As for the book, he loves it and would recommend to anyone.

"This is a short and small 64 page page mini booklet with black and white photos from 1973, reprinted from the original 1968 edition. It is 7"" x 5"". The series of books among collectors are valued today from $3 on average up to $9 for a perfect mint unread copy. If you see copies for more than that, keep shopping.It is part of a series of 21 titles known as the ""Garcia Outdoor Library"", or Garcia Fishing Books, and they have titles for both fresh and salt water fishing. The books were written by different authors for the series. One of the best books in the series for starting out as a freshwater fisherman is ""Introduction to Freshwater Fishing"" by Milt Rosko. Milt wrote 4 books for the series, and Mark Sosin wrote 5 of the titles. There were about 3 titles in the series specific to freshwater Bass, and some were specific to a type of fish such as trout, or a series of fish such as pan fish. The only difference with the newer editions was a new cover art painting, both the original and reprint art were painted by Ken Rice. Since Garcia made the famous Ambassadeur reels, Mitchell 300 reel, Abu-Matic reel, Fly reels, Pak Rod, Conolon fishing rods, and Garcia lures, every booklet features one of their products on the front and rear endpapers, the rear of the book usually lists about half the books in the series. Garcia also produced the much larger (8.5"" x 11"" and 80 pages), more collectible ""Garcia Fishing Annual"" during this time period.They are nice nostalgic books, pocket size to fit in your vest or tackle bag. Most of the information in each book holds up well today, most changes in fishing are in the modernization of equipment/tackle more than technique. As a collector of vintage fishing equipment that likes to use what he collects, I find even much of the old stuff still works well. For example I use a couple of vintage Garcia Mitchell reels, their 300 and 308 models that were made in France.There was also a series of eight (8) Garcia Shooting Books for hunters, and one (1) Garcia book on backpacking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QCJ6J2M6JRBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ICC50W#wasThisHelpful","R1QCJ6J2M6JRBK","A6GMEO3VRY51S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6GMEO3VRY51S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I get a lot of junk telemarketer calls. My phone allows me to auto-reject numbers, but only 25 of them. I have already had enough of these call me that I needed a way to blacklist some other numbers. This app was very easy to install, and simple to set up. It needed a few permissions, but nothing that was out of bounds with what the app is supposed to do. However, it does force close quite a bit on my phone. In order to add a number to be blocked, you have to open the app, then manually type in the screen to this tiny little box, where you can barely see the numbers.

"I bought this bag in early 2010. I really prefer using a soft sided tackle bag after trying a few different things over the years including hard tackle boxes and boxes with stacks of trays/boxes inside, and this is the first new one I have bought in a long time. My last bag was an old soft duffle bag I had re-purposed, this bag is actually designed for fishing. I looked at many bags at Amazon.com, auction sites and fishing gear sites before choosing this bag. For one thing, tackle boxes and bags have gotten very expensive, so price was one of my considerations in choosing a new tackle bag for fishing. For the price this bag was really affordable compared to other bags I looked at. Once I chose which bag I wanted, the best price was here at Amazon, especially with shipping.I fish with bait, lures, flies, and the fish I seek out are trout, bass, perch, kokanee salmon, catfish and bluegill. I wanted a tackle bag that would hold everything but my rod, net, and lunch. But with this bag I can still strap the net to the outside of the bag, and slip my lunch and thermos inside so it exceeded my expectations, without carrying a big monster bag. If I break my rod down, I can strap it to the top as well. I also looked at the type of bags that come with nice big Plano style tackle boxes for lures inside, but the boxes always fill the entire bag and they are too big for me. I already have plenty of boxes, prefer to handpick my boxes, and I use a variety of smaller Plano type boxes and fly boxes. Each box is dedicated to different varieties of fish or types of fishing that I can switch out before a trip as I need them. Another reason I do not like to use big tackle boxes, is that just one careless bump or kick from me when its open and my gear is dumped everywhere. I planned to buy a bag in a reasonable size because if I have a bigger one, it is too tempting for me to load too much stuff and then its gets heavy. I fish from both the shore and boat, so I needed a bag I could carry back and forth. I found this one to be very comfortable when its full in size and shape, and the padded strap and handles helps.It has a padded shoulder strap, and it still leaves my hands free. It also has 2 short handles for carrying by hand. This one is just the right size for me. It has a waterproof nylon interior, and a hard interior bottom to maintain the shape of the bag. The bag is waterproof, whichj does not mean you can fill it with water, it means if you splash it the inside stays dry and the water does not harm the bag. It seems to resist stains and tears very well. It still looks new after heavy use this year.FEATURES: It came with a bunch of adjustable velcro dividers for the main interior compartment that allow you to lay out the inside any way you like. I used about half of them. It has a clear pocket on the interior lid for papers and electronic devices. The exterior of the same lid has a cable net to hold your coat, gloves, hat, rod tube or a net. The strap D-rings have room to clip items on. It has nice exterior pockets all the way around, the back side is one long mesh pocket that runs down the whole bag. It has a tool pocket one the front that has 3 elastic mini compartments inside, a big area, and another zippered area, exterior bandolier type things, carabiner clips, and a small zippered pocket for your license. One side has a mesh water bottle pocket on the side with a strap, D-rings and a pocket with a velcro lid. The opposite side has a large pocket, that for me fits 8 bottles of bait. It has a comfortable padded shoulder strap that clips onto D-rings, it and the dividers were bundled inside and had to be installed, which takes a few seconds at most.SIZE: Measures 16 inches long x 12.7 inches wide x 16 x 11.2 inches tall. Very light, it weighs just under 1 pound.PICS: I added 4 pictures of my bag to this page in addition to the 1 picture Amazon has, so you can see the top and the back of the bag, interior, pockets, the handles and padded shoulder strap. I almost didn't buy this bag for the previous lack of good pictures here. I posted my pics with the bag empty and also with my gear loaded in it, it was hard to get a realistic feel for the size and capacity with the sellers pic so I hope this helps you figure out if this is the type of bag for you or not.NOTE: I see the seller at this page copied over my pictures from another page at Amazon. Same bag so no problem.Everybody has different tastes in fishing gear, this one works great for me and was affordable compared to similar bags.UPDATE: December 2011. It is now two fishing seasons that I have used this bag. It has proved to be very durable, no problems with zippers, straps, or pockets, no tears. The material still looks new. It has proved very useful, and I am still impressed and glad I bought this bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RAV5ZQSSXZT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTDIKMU#wasThisHelpful","R2RAV5ZQSSXZT4","A6GMEO3VRY51S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6GMEO3VRY51S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is an incredible item for collectors of Walt Disney history books. It was published in 1997 in a small run and has not been republished since, and is now extremely rare. This is a limited edition of only 750 copies, signed by the author. It is a hardback binding that is published without a dust jacket. (There is a more affordable version that came in a plastic slipcase. It is huge and thick, one of the heaviest books I have ever owned. It comes with a laid-in insert reproduction of a inter-office envelope from the Walt Disney animation department and a report to Walt inside. It also has a laid-in insert reproduction of an employee organizational chart of the Walt Disney company at the time.This is one of the few books written by an upper management employee who worked on animation, live-action film and television, and even overseas for Walt. The author dealt with Walt at a very different level than an animator would, so this book is quite different from other insider books about Walt or the studio. Harry Tytle brings a very different perspective to his book. He was a producer for Walt Disney Studios, and worked alongside Walt on many projects over the years. He worked his entire career through to retirement at the company, working on film and television projects. This book has very unique stories I have never read anywhere else. I really enjoyed stories about his trips overseas with Walt, planning meetings, problems with staff and directors, and the studio's interaction with film stars like Annette Funicello. I highly recommend to anyone interested in the history of the behind the scenes decision making process at the studio. Good luck finding a copy now, as this book is now rare as hen teeth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15GJI6XL97M03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GU6HS8#wasThisHelpful","R15GJI6XL97M03","A6GMEO3VRY51S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6GMEO3VRY51S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This listing is a hardcover souvenir book that you could purchase for only 1 year at the Disneyland Park, as it changes slightly each year and is republished with the new year on the cover.  It was only sold in the Disneyland Park and not in any stores. Disneyland has been producing a hardcover book every year for some time, and most years there are only slight changes made from the previous years. But when a big Anniversary date comes, they change the title and cover to reflect the special occasion for that years edition. New attractions and attractions that are under construction are usually shoe-horned into the last few pages each year. There are some brief articles scattered through the book, as well as picture captions. The book is made up of full page and half page color photos of attractions, buildings, and people having fun in the Park. The older ones are getting harder to find. The problem with the listing on this page, which was created by a third party seller, is it does not tell you which year is being offered.  Communicate with the seller before buying to make sure it is the one you you want. There are separate listings here at Amazon.com for the 25th anniversary, and the 30th Anniversary books if you are looking for specific years.These books have the best quality pictures, binding, and page paper available. On another note you will note it lists Marty Sklar as the author. He is currently the Vice-President of ""Imagineering"" for the Disney Company, but he wrote the articles and helped oversee the creation of the earliest versions of this book back when he was a junior employee.IMPORTANT NOTE FOR COLLECTORS: The true first edition of the book is quite rare and collectible as it was published in a small amount. It was printed in 1965 by:""Mondori Printing in Verona, Italy"". You can go to the bottom of the last page and look for their name to confirm if you have this valuable copy. It has the lettering for Disneyland logo in blue on the cover, with the castle under it and the striped umbrella in lower right corner. The first edition version from Italy has better quality reproduction of the images.They sold out of the first edition books much faster than they had planned for and so Disneyland printed a second edition that year.

"I am a big fan of micro toys. Amazing to see these Micro Toys here, they made them in the early 1990's for only about a year. This Tiny Collection Playcase opens like a makeup compact. On the outside it has an image of Aladdin and Jasmine. On the inside is has a miniature city of Agrabah on the bottom half when open, the top half is Jasmine's chambers with tiny furniture, and her balcony. Also a tiny Aladdin figure with an attachable magic carpet. Also a figure of Jasmine. If you connect the carpet to the tower and twist the tower it looks like the carpet is circling the tower. This makes a great toy for plane or car trips, or something to keep kids busy for awhile.

"This is kind of like a Micro Machines set for Disney in a way. The Disney Company released a line of toys through Mattel called the Disney Tiny Collection, a set of very tiny figures with detailed homes. This version has Pocahontas and a Powhatan home. It has a secret lookout in a tree. The home opens up to show neat tiny details including the cookfire, baslet, pottery, wall art and more. Ladders take you to different levels of the house. push the basket and raccoon Meeko pops up. Character figures include Meeko, John Smith, Pocahontas, and Nakoma. There were other toys in the series including Aladdin Marketplace,  Cinderella Stepmother's house, Beauty and the Beast, and more.

The pictorial dust jacket is very classy looking. And it has the illustrations by artist Lucy Kemp-Welch illustrations, 18 full color plates plus the black and white illustrations on almost every page. By far the nicest version of this book ever made. This children's classic by Ann Sewell was first published in 1877, and its popularity has never faded.

"I disagree with the hysterical review from someone that obviously bought this before they bother checking something out before they buy.  First of all, this was created to be a collectors edition, is clearly labeled ""Limited Edition"". It is from a company that made these scale model miniatures, known as Galoob Micro Machines. The set is rare since the company went out of business in 1998, so the toy listed here is already over 20 years old. They are called ""Micro"" because they are small, and are made for people that collect scale miniatures. The listing describes the toys as ""Approximate size of each vehicle is 1.5 inches long. Approximate size of unopened packaging is 8.5 x 7 x 3 inches"". Sounds like Amazon was upfront about the size of the toys to me.For aircraft collectors, even finding a toy pack that includes a blimp, a hot air balloon, and an airplane in the same set is pretty neat. Finding it mint in package is even better. So if she can get it ""anywhere"" for $10, I'd like to see it. In fact it should be posted here with a link to it so we can all buy it. People need to pay more attention before they click ""buy"" on anything. The only review that reviewer has ever written as of this date here is negative, and that is what is wrong with society these days... quick to complain slow to compliment. I applaud Amazon for selling these old toys for people like me that collect miniature collectibles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JGKEY0INQJTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000X451UM#wasThisHelpful","R1JGKEY0INQJTW","A6GMEO3VRY51S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6GMEO3VRY51S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is actually a made for television episode of ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show that played on Sunday nights from 1953 to 1983.  ""Run, Appaloosa, Run"", originally aired on the TV show in 1967 (season 14, episode 7) after serving as a theatrical featurette in July 29, 1966 along with the Main Feature at the time, ""Lt Robin Crusoe"". First release to video was in 1986. It's a story of Mary Blackfeather, a Native American girl of the Nez Pierce tribe who trains horses and performs as a trick rider. The Nez Perce are known for developing the spotted horses. Mary adopts a motherless colt that is rescued from a mountain lion by the family's herd dog ""Silver"", raises her and names her ""Holy Smoke"". Mary is eventually separated from her horse when she is forced to sell it at an auction to help her tribe raise money as horse sales are the basis of the tribe's economy in the film. The horse passes from one unworthy owner to another before he and Mary are reunited. They find each other again at a rodeo, and then land up joining in the historic annual ""Suicide Relay Race"", at Hells Mountain during the Omak Stampede. This is known as the roughest horse race in North America, dreamed up originally by the Nez Perce, consisting of a two horse per team relay of very rough terrain including jumping and swimming elements. Worse yet there are no rules and riders try to knock other riders off their horse. The herd dog ""Silver"" is amazing, and performs very well. This film is unique because it also features the famous rodeo clown Wilbur Plaugher playing himself, and many Native American actors. The movie was credited by Time Magazine at the time for a surge in popularity for Appaloosa horses. The Official Disney Encyclopedia Disney A to Z, on page 478 incorrectly lists the colt as ""Sky Dancer"", and in all fairness it is rare to see mistakes in that book.The terrific cowboy singing and narration is by Rex Allen, and the title song he performs, ""Ballad of Appaloosa"" is written by Bobby Wayne. Fun and exciting adventure film for the whole family. Filmed in Technicolor and directed by Larry Lansburgh, who also wrote the original story, photographed and produced the film. Lansburgh had a long career of making Disney animal featurettes from the 1940's. Later he wrote and produced, a terrific theatrical feature film for Disney, ""the Littlest Outlaw"". I recommend this for horse lovers, and fans of old Disney television.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15C9TPHO4YOJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ZEU2SQ#wasThisHelpful","R15C9TPHO4YOJC","A6GMEO3VRY51S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6GMEO3VRY51S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"MicroMachines were made by a company called Galoob. That company was bough out and dismanteled by their largest competitor in the late 1990's. The MicroMachines line of toys were great, and well known for their tiny scale miniature size. A car would only be an inch long or so. The company produced some wonderful Star Wars toys including this rare model from 1997. A series of busts or heads of different characters was produced, each with a miniature playset hidden inside. This version was Yoda. When open it reveals a scene where Luke Skywalker receives Jedi training from Yoda in the swamps of Dagobah. It includes 6 tiny figure including Yoda, Luke, Darth Vader, R2-D2. Also the X-Wing Starfighter that Luke sunk in the swamp is here.

"Spoiler alert here, and by the way the whole movie is spoiled. I should have pushed the off button on my TV, but I stuck it out. You know, this was one of those movies I really wanted to like. It had some good actors, clean production values, great representation of the 1970's NASA. And it had potential, conspiracy sci-fi and horror rolled into one. But someone forgot to write a script. What do you get when you have a NASA lab, and bad guys. But you never figure out who the bad guys are... First they are NSA, then CIA, then a rogue former NASA official, then aliens; no wait maybe they're angels; no wait they are from another dimension, maybe demons... Aaaarghh. All that is bad enough, but they never do answer the question. And why the heck do they have people make a choice of a gateway, telling them one is the path to salvation and the other is to hell, and then start all over again. Why do they kidnap people and put them in these water transportation gates that simply send people back to their house again? And what is the difference between people they call test subjects and people they call employees?

"This film was made by and for HBO. I had picked it up used at Amazon and then let it sit on shelf for over ayear before I finally watched it. It was more fun that I had expected it would be. This is not a dark and serious drama, oh to be sure it treats the subject of war and death with the reverence it deserves at times, but the movie revels in the character of Pancho Villa. At one moment a dark brutal man, next a fun loving trickster, then he is exceedingly generous and concerned for the welfare of others.  The story is mostly dramatization, quite the opposite of a documentary, but they do not pretend otherwise. We do not have enough source material to draw on to get a better picture of the events, and the real Pancho Villa films have been lost to history.The movie is very loosely based on the story of an American film company reciving an offer, by the Mexican revolutionary general Pancho Villa, to film a real life battle. This would be the first time in history a battle was to be shown on film to the public. The general somehow felt that the theatrical presentation of the Mexican conflict could cause America to consider lifting its embargo on his ability to buy American guns. The battle footage is well enough received that the company determines to return with actors and crew to flesh it out into a movie. Villa needed his side of the story told, as the Rupert Murdoch of the day in the form of WR Hearst and his newspaper empire, was editorializing and spinning the news to affect public policy and demonize the General.The film is very well made, the battle scenes exciting and authentic, costumes, sets, vintage vehicles are all very authentic. The actors take their roles seriously and a great effort is put forth to make this as believable as possible. Antonio Banderas is mesmerizing in the tough role of Villa, one hand gentle and friendly, raging the next moment. Alan Arkin has a role that could have been more developed, but he gives it much more than the role called for. The rest of the cast tries to keep up as best they can, but they are not as bad as some make it sound here, just outclassed.All in all it was a pleasant diversion for the evening.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W5FI1JIMYZW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001FVECM#wasThisHelpful","R2W5FI1JIMYZW3","A6GMEO3VRY51S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6GMEO3VRY51S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are few sequels that stand up to the original novel but City of Blades is just as gripping as the novel that started it all, City of Stairs. You must read the first book before this, however, as it doesn't work as a stand-alone. For those who loved City of Blades, many characters are back here, especially....wait for it.....Sigrud who features prominently here (can I hear a collective hooray?). While our main protagonists shift in this book, the superior world-building and twisty plot remains. The themes were darker in this book, which seemed appropriate given the hard look at war, those who lead us into war (and why), and why people follow them into war and carnage. Frankly, it was these dark questions that made the novel more compelling for me than the first. Philosophically, it made me think while still keeping the plot moving along...it didn't get dry and boring with musings at any point.Highly recommend both books....start with the first please!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35YJIIZ7SNJ74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553419714#wasThisHelpful","R35YJIIZ7SNJ74","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit it: I was suckered into this novel chiefly due to the comparisons to Daphne Du Maurier. When will I ever learn that these comparisons to classic authors rarely, if ever, match the hype. So it was with The Gilded Life of Matilda Duplaine, the story of a small-town-boy-done-good journalist who meets the reclusive, uber-wealthy daughter of a Hollywood scion and falls in love. I'm still not sure why he falls in love....it happened so quickly and without much a foundation so I never made that leap of faith a good plot requires. But because I couldn't really believe in the love-story portion of it, the rest of the protagonist's actions - which are based on this ""deep love"" - never held true for me. Much of this stemmed from my waiting for the Du Maurier-like writing to appear, which of course it never did. I really wish publicists would stop hyping new authors by comparing them to established authors....it does them such a disservice.

"Lauren Oliver is the author of some very popular Young Adult books (the Delirium Trilogy probably being her most popular) so I was interested to see what she could do with the sometimes-difficult Middle Grade genre. Curiosity House (the first of a series) is an almost too-cute ""mystery"" for young readers featuring four child-protagonists each of whom is a part of Dumfrey's Dime Museum of Freaks, Oddities, and Wonders. Orphans, Sam, Philippa, Thomas, and Max each have their own ""talent"" (such as contortionist, etc) that contributes to this circus-like sideshow and each are outsiders. When a shrunken head - one of the Dumfrey's Museums oddities - is stolen, the children are determined to bring it back. Ultimately, the story was less about the shrunken head mystery than the children discovering things about their own unique pasts.The story was competent and engaging throughout....my 7 year old lost interest but my 9 year old enjoyed it so I think that's around the cut-off age. It was easy to follow the plot and to keep the characters straight as well. Ultimately though, nothing stood out about it. When I asked my 9 year old if he was interested in buying the subsequent sequels he said, ""Not really, there's so many other books I want to read instead."" So that's why I gave it 3 stars.....he liked it, but not enough to keep reading the series. This could be because he's more interested in books with a more fantasy-motif (dragons, etc), but I understood his ambivalence with this one. I thought the same as he did: a decent book but not a series to get us hooked.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24H4OFZYB1NAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062270818#wasThisHelpful","R24H4OFZYB1NAM","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm comparing the Nuyu to the Jawbone UP. I've been wearing one on each wrist for two weeks now and feel reasonably competent to offer up some of the differences (keep in mind the UP is about $50 more expensive than the Nuyu). There are some major differences between the two. The first thing that I loved about this Nuyu is the fact that it acts as a watch too. The UP is just a bracelet with no time or other displays on it (you get your display of your stats/activity on the phone app). So I loved the idea of dual functions. Unfortunately, it didn't work so well in practice. You must swipe your finger on the Nuyu to display the time (the screen is normally black to save battery life). Turns out, I'd have to ""sweep"" my finger over it about 5-10 times to get the right spot to bring it to life, gah, what a pain. But once you do bring it to life you can see the time, swipe again to get your calories burned, swipe again to see steps taken, etc. The Nuyu is different also in that you don't have to recharge your device all the time. It has a single battery that lasts months and then you replace it when needed with a simple small battery available at grocery stores.The next thing I noticed a couple of days into wearing both devices is a HUGE discrepancy between devices on how many steps I had taken in any given day. The Nuyu was nearly DOUBLE what the UP was showing.....in my heart of hearts I knew the UP was correct, but the Nuyu made me feel better about myself, lol. The Nuyu, just like the UP, has a downloadable app to set goals, track your progress, etc. Where the UP has an advantage is that it allows you to set various alarms, etc, so that the bracelet vibrates and alerts you. Nuyu has nothing of the kind although it does come with different holders beside the wristbands so you can attach it to your shoe or whatever. Both the Nuyu and the UP phone apps are equally good and user friendly.All in all, I'd say the UP is the better buy for your money. But if you really, REALLY want a fancy pedometer (which is all these things  really are) and are tight on money, I suppose this would be an okay substitute. But my advice would be to save your money and wait until you can afford some of the better fitness trackers out there. The UP is good, but there are even better ones out there that combine all the really useful features.....wristwatch, GPS, alarms, etc.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ICXWAIIGQJUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X1INOU6#wasThisHelpful","R3ICXWAIIGQJUL","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This YA thriller is competently written and tries to incorporate social media to make itself very relevant. The story revolves around a teen girl who is desperate to find a kidney donor for her brother. When she finds herself invited to a private social site called NEED, she's given the opportunity to actually obtain a kidney for her brother....of course, the entire things turns out to be quite nefarious and this is where we get our thriller element to the story. Charbonneau is a competent and veteran author of previous well-received YA novels. This one requires you to *really* stretch your credulity, though, which is why I knocked off a star. Frankly, I just didn't buy the whole premise and think most teenagers are smart enough to think the premise of the social site NEED was silly, but if you can employ your imagination better than I did, you'll likely enjoy it. I just happen to think teenagers are much smarter than the ones in the book.

"My 9 year old son and I read this together and I have to say, The Vanishing Island is about perfect for him. When the main character Bren Owen, eager for adventure and travel in the year 1599, steals away on a ship he gets more adventure than he bargained for. The author uses an alternative history, which I thought was fantastic. We got to stop and talk about the real historical events and how they really played out as opposed to what is happening in the book. The action keeps up throughout the novel and we never reached any boring lull in the story...it also sets up nicely for the next book. If you've heard that this book is a bit violent and gross, YES, that is true....just the kind of thing 9 year old boys eat up and ask for more (some people might have children more sensitive to this kind of thing....read other reviews too before deciding....but my child loved it the same way he loved the Jurassic World movie).

"TRIGGER WARNING: This book is about mental illness and suicide. Just be aware that the subject matter might be upsetting for some.Hamilton's book is her own personal story: her husband's descent into mental illness and his subsequent suicide. It's heartbreaking, but honestly written. Given the honesty and emotional rawness of what she is sharing, it would be difficult to find fault with the book. Every reader is going to approach this book differently: some may not have any experience with what Hamilton relates, while others will be intimately familiar with both the despair of her husband or the despair she encounters. I encourage everyone to approach this with an open heart in order to understand that as horrifying as her experience has been, she is not unusual....millions of people in our country struggle with varying forms of mental illness. By and large, we fail them. Every day. But listening to Hamilton's story may encourage empathy in readers and that makes the book worth it right there. Because what we need most of all in this world is more empathy. I applaud the author for opening such a private and heartbreaking wound for public consumption.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R71MIXXQ808P1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1580055842#wasThisHelpful","R71MIXXQ808P1","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hilton adds to the Elizabeth I canon with a work that strives to view her remarkable reign in the context of how Elizabeth viewed herself: not as a female ruling England, but as ruler who transcended gender. This was no small feat to achieve given the gender bias at the time and various examples of fellow female rulers (ie, Mary, Queen of Scots) who failed spectacularly in this endeavor thereby strengthening gender bias when it came to royalty.It helps to be familiar with the players and their roles (William Cecil, the Earl of Leicester, Duke of Norfolk, etc) because Hilton doesn't hold the reader's hand. She doles out facts and figures quickly and it might be difficult to keep up if you're unfamiliar with the court of Elizabeth I. If you're new to the life of Elizabeth, it might behoove you to do some reading up on her life ahead of time (consults with Dr Google should manage this) to give you the basics.While I'm not convinced this biography brought anything new to the table, it is well written enough and has some fresh interpretations that make it a welcome addition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V1J69PPA56WK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544577841#wasThisHelpful","R2V1J69PPA56WK","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Three points of view, each told in first person narrative, is difficult to pull off but Buckley manages the technique very, very well in The Good Good-Bye. Arden and Rory are cousins, young women just graduating from high school and heading off to college. Their fathers are brothers and the two families have grown up together very close (maybe too close?) and the girls are like sisters to each other. Arden's mother Natalie and Rory's father Vince own their own restaurant together....although Natalie married Vince's brother, she and Vince have a ""past"" that won't seem to go fade away, but their relationship, both as brother and sister in law *and* as friends and former more-than-friends, crumbles when Vince makes a risky, expensive investment that fails and financially dooms both families. Arden and Rory, both just ready to jet off to their respective universities, are told that expensive colleges aren't going to be viable right now....they'll have to attend a lower-tier state university instead. Just until the families get back on their feet (will they?). But a bad situation gets worse when Rory and Arden wind up severely injured after a mysterious dorm fire. Both in comas, both in the ICU, the families are traumatized. Police are wondering whether the fire was really a homicide attempt. Questions are flying and the answers are only slowly revealed as Rory, Arden, and Arden's mother Natalie each tell pieces of the story in the alternating chapters that ensue. Pieces of backstory are thrown around helter-skelter and it's up to the reader to put the puzzle together....it keeps you reading, that's for certain. What could have been a horrible mish-mash is instead a mysterious, compelling novel about the fracture of families and secrets kept. It's quite well done and I do recommend this book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLU0XUSF3MAOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553390589#wasThisHelpful","RLU0XUSF3MAOB","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a general rule of thumb, I prefer Epson printers for an all-around good at-home printer. The XP-830 is up to Epson's good standards with just about every feature the standard, at-home user would need. It copies well, the fax is easy to use, good print quality, etc. Wireless works perfect and is so easy to set up even my completely non-technical husband could do it just a few minutes. I glanced through some of the other reviews here and everyone has pretty much nailed all of the technical specifics for those who want those.But as with all of the Epson printers I've owned over the years (mostly because I want to try the latest and greatest, not because they die on me), I'm taking off a star for one very practical reason: their feeder trays are low quality, flimsy pieces of thin plastic that are awkward (at best) to pull out and put your paper into. For a company that builds very high quality at-home printers, this continual oversight with every model I've tried just irritates the heck out of me. In the case of this XP-830 it's even worse: the feeder trays are located on the front of the machine underneath the output tray and the pop-out LCD touch screen. In order to refill your paper in the feeder tray, you have to maneuver your fingers around the LCD screen that's in the way, UNDER the output tray which automatically pops itself out every time the printer is turned on, and actually lift up on the machine (hoping you're not lifting up on a part that is breakable like the touchscreen or plastic output tray) to try to slide out the flimsy feeder tray where you put your paper. Good grief. The next Epson printer I try is going to be a rear-feeding version to see if that is any easier/better.Anyway, if you can put up with the exercise in frustration over getting the paper in the feeder, the rest of the machine is just excellent. We don't print a lot of photos in our household, but instead rely on our printer for various school projects, work related things, etc. It's a quiet printer that prints relatively quickly with good quality. The ink lasts about average for home printers and I wish the printer would continue to print even when you KNOW you've run out of magenta or whatever (Canon printers keep printing even after you run out of an ink color which helps when you're in a pinch), but I plan around that and always have spare ink tucked away since the printing gods have declared that you will only run out of ink when it's an important, time-critical thing you need printed and it's 11pm at night. So plan ahead.Overall for the price point, you're getting a good printer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A7ZV8557ADJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5XSS#wasThisHelpful","R3A7ZV8557ADJR","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know serious readers aren't supposed to judge a book by it's cover, but wow. LOOK at that cover. It's one of the most beautiful covers I've seen in years and I'm not ashamed to admit that it played a big role in my giving this book a chance. I'm happy to report that the inside is worthy of that cover. For a young adult genre novel, The Emperor of Any Place is a remarkably sophisticated novel with layers upon layers of themes. Ostensibly the story of a young Toronto teenager who has just lost his father, a just-found old book reveals another layer of narrative that takes us on a journey to an island in the Pacific during World War II. It is, in essence, a book within a book that is easy to follow (unlike many others that have attempted this technique) and leads Evan on a voyage of discovery: who he is and where he came from.

"Prior to reading this novel by Melanie Benjamin I thought I knew quite a bit about Truman Capote. Turns out, I was wrong. I've been a fan of Benjamin since her novel ""Alice I Have Been,"" which was a surprisingly intense and compelling novel that once I started, I couldn't stop reading. The Swans of Fifth Avenue proved to be the same: I didn't want to put it down. I was, at first, not near as familiar with Capote's inner circle of New York friends as I thought I would be....there were several names that were unfamiliar to me and I had to look up. I'm glad I did as it helped sweep me into the narrative of Capote's life. This is one novel where googling people/times doesn't ruin the book at all. Capote's decline with alcohol and mental health issues were riveting to me and I felt that Benjamin dealt with these subjects very well....remaining true to the story but still retaining some dignity with her writing. It was a fascinating time period with a very influential group of people who would influence literature and society for years to come.

"As an admirer of Cullen's last historical novel which centered around Edgar Allen Poe, I was eagerly anticipating her newest novel about the quintessential American Mark Twain. I wasn't disappointed. Cullen's novels *are* novels...they are historical fiction. But what makes Cullen's novels better than most of this genre's writers is her exhaustive research that she adeptly works from. It's not too often for an author to have the ability to make this kind of thing fascinating without resorting to gross distortion of the facts, but Cullen is consistently able to do just this. This novel takes us to the latter part of Mark Twain's (or Samuel Clemens, his legal name) life. Using his relationship with his secretary Isabel Lyon, Cullen takes us into Twain's personal life which was much darker than any of us probably imagined it would be and much to the average reader's (like myself) surprise, it turns out that he was not a very good person. But that doesn't make the novel a disappointment....in fact, just the opposite. Cullen brought Twain - and his family - into a very real light for me. Like most historical people, he was neither evil nor truly heroic. He was human. And presented here in all of his frail ""human-ness."" Worth the read if you've never read any of her work before and I also recommend her novel about Poe, as well.

Normally, the concept of two women who as girls spent a brief time as victims of the same kidnapper and how their paths cross again and why would fascinate me. Unfortunately, the way it was written didn't fascinate....it bored me. I wasn't invested in either character and the kidnapper himself was even more boring.

"This is a difficult book to review because Karin Slaughter is clearly a very talented and popular author and has been for years. She is a name that is guaranteed to sell books even outside her popular series (this is a stand alone novel). By writing a stand alone novel like Pretty Girls, it gives her a chance to write outside whatever limitations are imposed by her regular series. So I'm not sure if we should be surprised that given the opportunity, the author might choose to take some chances and write something that pushes the edge. Given the popularity of the Scandinavian writers who push the envelope with their dark mystery/thrillers infused with both physical and psychological violence (usually directed at women), it seems natural that an author like Slaughter might want to give that a shot, which is what she does in this novel. Exceedingly graphic/shocking violence abounds....so often, in fact, that the shock value is greatly diminished by 3/4 through the book. There's no question that Slaughter is a very good writer, it's just the content that might make some readers uncomfortable. There are no problems with the plot line or characters not being developed...as I said, she is a good writer. And if you enjoy the darkest Scandinavian writers and their race to come up with the most twisted/disgusting crimes committed against women, odds are you might enjoy this one, too. So give it a shot.

"This is my first experience with Bose speakers and I now understand what all the fuss is about....I had no idea that sound could be this impressive in your own home. There are four components that come with this system: your speaker bar (goes in front of your TV and is 36 3/4"" long for anyone who wants to measure before purchasing), what they call the Acoustimass module (goes along the wall in any front third of your room), the small console which controls everything, and the smaller SoundTouch wireless adapter. Also included in the box is your remote control (batteries included) and an audio calibration device which you'll use to optimize/personalize the sound to your specific room.Set up took less than 30 minutes, it's that easy. Directions are very clear and simple. You may mount the sound bar on a wall or you can simply place it in front of your TV which is what I did. An HDMI cable is included to connect your TV to the console (there are alternative directions if your TV is older and doesn't have an HDMI connection). You then connect your peripheal entertainment devices such as your Blu-Ray player, Roku, DVR, game box, whatever, to the clearly marked HDMI connections on the rear of the console....presumably you already have HDMI cables for those devices so they aren't included with this system. The SoundTouch wireless adapter is then plugged into the console and turn it all on...just don't nearly blow out your windows with the volume up like I did. The wireless adapter is very cool and everything is Bluetooth ready....I was immediately playing music from my iPhone. There are directions that lead you to download the SoundTouch app which allows you to stream internet radio, Pandora, all sorts of services as well as set up specific playlists, etc.All I can say about the sound is that it is incredible. Even though I've somewhat gotten used to the superior quality over the past few days, I *still* jump occassionally when a door closing on a movie/tv show sounds so dang real that I think it's someone coming through my own front door. There is such a depth of sound that is created between the sound bar and the Acoustimass it is amazing. If you'd asked me whether I thought a good home theater sound system was worth it a month ago, I probably would have said no....because I had no idea what I've been missing out on all this time. You don't have to be a speaker/sound aficionado to realize that this is like the difference between watching a movie in black and white versus Technicolor. I won't deny that it's a vanity purchase...no one *needs* this kind of sound....but it sure is a treat to have it. Bose is all they are cracked up to be.

More than just the events themselves, the book is especially about the larger questions of our government's latest predilection for drone usage. Wherever you fall on the topic Shane provides a very comprehensive look at how this has occurred and why...all framed around the events leading to Anwar al-Awlaki's death. I didn't interpret any of Shane's writing to be telling me what conclusions to draw - something I very much appreciate in my non-fiction - rather, he brings up various points (ethical, historical, and otherwise) that hadn't occurred to me before and certainly made me re-examine my own position on the usage of drones and who we target and why. I didn't see Shane as trying to convince me of anything. He just provided the context I needed to look at it in ways that other people, depending on what interests they are protecting, might see things. The narrative moved along quite well and I never felt bogged down or bored with any details. It is just plain good writing. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12QS4RGS8CIOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140294#wasThisHelpful","R12QS4RGS8CIOR","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first Amy Stewart book I have read but I can see that I'm going to have to order her previous books seeing as I enjoyed this novel, loosely based on an actual event which Stewart tells you all about at the end of the book. Stewart took the few known facts about the incident in which the Kopp sisters' buggy was hit by Henry Kaufman's automobile in 1914 and used her delightful imagination to fill in the blanks. She creates utterly charming characters out of the three sisters, but it's Constance that is our protagonist as she determines to write a wrong done by the not-very-nice Kaufman. This leads to quite a few discoveries and events, not all as benign as a buggy accident. The character development is so charming that this might border on a cozy mystery (or at least a mystery-type book where the characters are eccentric/independent enough to keep the reader coming back). And the story ends on such a note that I could easily see this becoming a longer running series. I enjoyed it as much as any Maisie Dobbs book and indeed will be more interested in a sequel to this than the next Jacqueline Winspear installment. If you enjoy books with a strong, smart female character set in a historical world, you'll like this. Try it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6VZGUXXHNEM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544409914#wasThisHelpful","R6VZGUXXHNEM8","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I dislike writing negative reviews but if you treasure your book-allotment money like I do, you'll want to be warned that this book really isn't worth purchasing. I always try to think of other readers who might like the book before I smack it with less than 3 stars (because usually with books, one person's trash is another's treasure). In the case of Bradstreet Gate, however, I can't think of who might think this was worth it (it's possible, I suppose, but unlikely). It's biggest flaw is that nothing really happens throughout the book, while it's billed as a mystery/low-key thriller ala Tartt's fabulous The Secret History and the opening portion of the book seems to read like that: a handful of old college classmates from Harvard and a murder of a student back in their college days. It seemed to be setting up for a delicious plot of who did what and why and maybe even a tasty twist at the end. But it went nowhere. The plot followed this group of former classmates around the globe in the years after the murder and their graduations, but that's it. What's worse, as the pages turned and the plot really went nowhere, I ceased caring or even maintaining interest in any of the characters. Perhaps the story was just billed erroneously by the publishers, but aimlessly following these characters about wasn't worth my reading time. I'd like to say your mileage may vary, but I doubt it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39PC6OK6Z5ZY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804139318#wasThisHelpful","R39PC6OK6Z5ZY6","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perhaps because I'm not a huge fantasy reader (only the really, really well-known authors such as Rothfuss or Abercrombie), I didn't have as many problems with this novel. A friend who was reading this at the same time as I had a lot more issues with this novel, but he reads hundreds of books in the genre each year. I, on the other hand, don't read enough of the genre for the whole elves, orcs, and ogres to be old-hat for me. The novel contains a lot of extremes: very bad versus very good (it's allegedly based on a game, but I am wholly unfamiliar with it) and has a LOT of characters in it. Because of that, it took me quite a few chapters before I finally was able to tease them apart but once I did that, the story flowed well for me. The story is set in a world called Urth (""What on Urth?"" snicker...), ruled by an not-so-nice Kothite Emperor for the past 3200 years. They are near-immortals. But a dramatic prophecy threatens the Kothite rule over the myriad of other races on the planet (or world, or whatever Urth really is) involving a Sleeping King. There's also a love story thrown in the mix, although it didn't make or break the story for me. Ultimately, I think fans of fantasy are going to find more to be picky about - and well they should! - but for those who aren't very well-versed in the genre it goes a bit smoother for us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q7BAAV8NTZTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076533514X#wasThisHelpful","R3Q7BAAV8NTZTS","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was actually quite surprised with the softness/quality of this shirt, which I got for my husband to wear this fall/winter. The initial washing didn't seem to shrink it much (if at all) and it fit perfectly. The flannel is extremely soft after washing and this has only increased with each subsequent was (at least 10 so far). No iron, just pull it out of the dryer and hang. My husband doesn't usually care for the shirts I get him, but he's been wearing this a lot so Wrangler has a winner here. I'll be buying one or two more for him in different colors.

"Larson has synthesized a tremendous amount of research into a compelling narrative of Rosemary, the Kennedy daughter who was hidden away by the family as a result of her mental deficiencies. The Kennedy's were clearly a product of their times. Reading this fascinating book, it's difficult to indict them for what we now know were tragic mistakes. From Rosemary's horrifying birth (I had no idea that what happened when she was born was commonplace at the time!) to her later unfortunate lobotomy, medical personnel honestly thought they were doing the best they could by her. Author Kate Larson writes Rosemary's story very well....I enjoy biographies that, while well-researched, don't bog the reader down with minute details or try to slant the information presented. She tells a story here providing the facts, not editorial, allowing the reader to come to their own conclusions about the decisions made. The book includes photographs as well and is a quick read at 320 pages. I probably read it even faster than I normally would because the narrative was so well done and interesting. If you have any interest in the Kennedy family, who was probably as close to American ""royalty"" as one can get, I'd highly recommend picking this one up. I think it's especially relevant today given that we are becoming more and more aware of our societal failings with mental health.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDBQNEQEBA9C9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547250258#wasThisHelpful","RDBQNEQEBA9C9","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The dreaded 3 star review....ugh. I really expected to love this book when I heard through the bookish-grapevine that it is told using one of my absolute favorite devices: via letters, notes, diary entries, police reports, psychologist sessions, etc and so on. It's nice to see something different rather than a straight narrative. I was also anticipating loving the main character: Carly/Kaitlyn are multiple personalities. Carly is in control during the day, but at dusk Kaitlyn emerges. Both are fully aware of the other's existence and communicate via notes left for the other to find. This was just such a great premise I couldn't wait to start reading! And then......nothing. That's not to say nothing happens, but rather that I felt utterly nothing for Carly/Kaitlyn. The author wasn't interested in really exploring their condition (it was just a means to forward a plot), instead focusing on bringing in supernatural elements....well, what is this going to be? A mystery crime story or a Stephen King? An expose of multiple personalities or a creepy love story? Honestly, it's difficult to put into words because I'm not quite sure why this sure-fire format and subject matter became uninteresting and boring other than to say that the book was trying to be too many things and failed in all of them. Ultimately neither character/personality was interesting to me. By the mid-point of the book I was having to force myself to pick it up again in order to finish.Maybe others will get better mileage out of this. It just fell flat for me.

"A good cozy mystery evokes a sense of place and presents memorable characters. As I turned the last page in this fabulous debut to a new series, there was no doubt that the author provided both of these in spades. Set deep in Louisiana the story centers around Crozat House, an old Southern plantation house that has been turned into a B&B by the Crozat family. Maggie, their daughter, finds the house filled with an eccentric cast of guests....this eccentricity of the characters makes the novel utterly funny and charming, despite the fact that two guests turn up dead. Local law enforcement is no help whatsoever due to old family feuds, so it's up to Maggie to snoop her way to the culprit. When you have a cozy mystery this good, the murders (and their solving) are just a vehicle for a good cast. Not only are the guests comical, but Maggie's own family: her grandmother utterly upstages them all here. It really is a delightful read....I don't read too many ""cozies"" as they are called, but I will continue to be a fan of Ellen Byron and this series. I hope the series enjoys the success it richly deserves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YJTTD9VD840K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629532509#wasThisHelpful","R2YJTTD9VD840K","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think the family saga subgenre is making a comeback and I, for one, am grateful. The Dust That Falls from Dreams is very much a family saga. It's a historical fiction saga set in England presenting the story of two intertwined families, the Pendennis's and the Pitt's, neighbors whose lives intersect throughout a period of vast social change. We begin with the death of Queen Victoria and sweep forward though the Great War....love, tragedy, death, marriage, war; all of the elements required for a good family saga page-turner. I rather enjoyed the characters, none of whom particularly took center stage....I'm not sure any were meant to. The characters are merely a vehicle for showcasing the period and social upheaval occurring at the time. Overall, I enjoyed the story. It wasn't on par with a saga like The Thorn Birds (where you really connected and became invested in the two main characters), but it was a good solid story. I'd recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H43WAW2C8WKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101946482#wasThisHelpful","R3H43WAW2C8WKI","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm giving this product three stars because while it did utterly nothing for me, it clearly has for other users and I'm taking into account the possibility that I'm just not the consumer the product is targeting. By that I mean that my workouts are not hard and intense....I'm simply a fast walker who hits the road every other day for 5 miles. I don't run, I don't life weights, I don't hit the elliptical machine. So I'm wondering if perhaps I experienced no results (nothing bad, nothing good) simply because I'm not an intense workout person. Additionally, I showed the product to my best friend who happens to be a doctor and she made fun of me for even trying it. Take that for what it's worth (just an opinion).

"I'm writing this review as a consumer who had zero experience with photo editing software, so if you're already very familiar with how to use this kind of program my review probably won't help you. But for anyone out there who is also a newbie at this kind of thing, I'll tell you how my foray went as I finally sucked it up and decided to learn how to use this kind of program.Like a lot of people I know, I'm one of those folks who takes tons of snapshots with my phone and then never does anything with them. As a result, I have hundreds of pictures of my kids, family, vacations, etc just stored there in my phone/cloud and the most ""editing"" of them I ever do is with the chintzy editor that comes in my phone (you know, crop it and add a cheap filter...not exactly professional stuff here). Trying to do something with all of these photos has been on my ""to-do"" list forever and I thought Corel's program might be just the thing I needed to get on that. Not as expensive as Photoshop, but I was pretty sure I didn't need all of the professional features. I was definitely right about that....this program was nearly overwhelming when I first installed it. (Install is fast and easy, by the way, with just a CD and then you register your product....takes less than 5 minutes.) When I first opened up the program, I had really not a clue how to apply any feature. Playing around with it yielded little results so I sucked it up and went to Corel's website where I found a bunch of easy tutorials (they are short videos on how to use various features). Now I was on the right track. I imported several photos to start (scanned one just for practice and the rest from my phone). By practicing with the tutorials on their website, I was able to start using some of the features....there are hundreds. While things like cropping or applying filters are easy to do, other features such as touching up a photo using things like Burn Brushes took a tutorial to figure out. I'd venture to say that 90% of the features I wouldn't have known were even there without the tutorials.One feature I was really looking forward to using was their ""Magic Fill"" tool and I thought I'd talk about that specifically because I would venture to guess that most people would be interested in using it for their photos. It allows you to remove things from photos and then the program automatically ""fills in"" the now-blank spot with background from the rest of the photo. (A handy alternative to the old-fashioned, time-honored tradition of cutting people out of photos, lol.) Alas, it didn't work as well as I'd hoped which is just a limitation of the program. It works when the background to fill in is some repetitive pattern (ie, the sky or grass or concrete), but not if you're cutting out, say, a person in a crowd. It fills in what the program sees to be the background, but it doesn't always visually work....in other words, there are a lot of times where it just looks fake.Aside from that, I've been learning all about creating different layers and applying them. Some of the other features like skin-smoothing, and the ability to auto-wrap text within a selected area work nicely (especially for making your own images like cards, graphics for social media, website graphics, etc), others I'm still learning. So if you are just now getting into the whole photo-editing thing, this is a decent program. I'm sure there are still more features I haven't even discovered yet. Just be aware there is nothing to hand-hold you through the process of learning to use the program, you'll have to be pro-active and get the tutorials, there are some You-Tube videos out there....just do a Google search and plenty of things come up. Take the time to learn to use the features and you'll probably get a lot out of this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L75DNQ7208CS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C60EW#wasThisHelpful","R1L75DNQ7208CS","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those who had a problem with the ball being too small to fit the chair, I had that issue at first too. Then I figured out that the ball will keep inflating bigger until it does fit. Problem solved there. As others have said, it's quick and easy to put together and nice that it comes with all the necessary tools to do it (a small wrench to secure the metal part) and the ball air pump. I can only award it 3 stars though because once it's all put together, the chair is too darned short (close to the ground) to sit at anything except maybe a low coffee table? I thought it would be great for my 2nd grader's desk but when she sits on it her small desk is level with her forehead, hahaha.

"While I enjoyed Kubica's debut novel The Good Girl, it wasn't a huge stand-out for me (although many readers absolutely loved it). But it was a decent debut and I'm always looking to see new authors get better and better with each turnout. So I didn't hesitate to read her new novel here, Pretty Baby, and hoped it would surpass The Good Girl. I can't really say that it did, although it was an entertaining read. Kubica uses multiple points-of-view to tell her stories, leaving blanks that keep you guessing until the end. In Pretty Baby, she uses three main characters - Heidi, her husband Chris, and Willow - to weave the story of a wife who altruistically brings a young homeless teen mother and her child into her family's home. Who is the ""bad guy"" here? Hints dropped all over the place as things unravel and it all comes down to character motivations....think you have it figured out? Maybe or maybe not. I whipped through this in a day and although it isn't the perfect novel or high literature, it does keep you reading just to figure out if your guesses about the characters are correct. All in all, I'd rate this the same as The Good Girl....I was hoping for more depth, but it felt rushed to me and like some things were glossed over. I'm okay with that overall. And I'll read her next book as well hoping that eventually she really digs deep (less commercial) and hits a home-run.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KDCEXYCOY7BK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317706#wasThisHelpful","R2KDCEXYCOY7BK","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know I shouldn't be reading a series out of order, but I couldn't resist the premise of this book. Although I dearly love the psychologically twisted plots of the Scandinavian thrillers that seem to have become so popular in the wake of Steig Larsson's hit series some years back, I hadn't yet read a Karin Fossum novel. The Drowned Boy immediately drew me in with a fairly simple premise: did the young parents of a child with Down's Syndrome drown their own son? Fossum focuses more on the psychological than action which was not only appropriate for this novel, but is a feature I prefer in my crime books (less gruesome action and more focus on the scariness of some people's minds). The plot, therefore, might seem to move more slow than you are used to if you normally read more action-packed novels. But it is no less intense and frightening. I'm officially now a Fossum fan and am returning to the beginning of the series to read them all. Very recommended if you enjoy novels that have more emphasis on characterization than shoot-em-up action.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BL1T678BZUPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544483960#wasThisHelpful","R1BL1T678BZUPS","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I consider myself something of a vacuum expert. With two children (three, if count my husband which I frequently do) who seem to suffer from memory loss when it comes to TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES INSIDE!!!, I live with a never ending barrage of dirt, pine needles, and heaven knows what other awful outside stuff being tracked inside constantly. Every day. You can only fight it with a vacuum. So as you can probably imagine, I've been through countless vacuums. And I'm here to tell you, most all of them are meh at best. Most of the vacuums I've gone through have been mid-price ranged Dirt Devils and the like, although I do have one 5 year old Dyson here that was supposed to be the be-all-end-all of vacuums that turned out to be no better than the Dirt Devils (and a pain in the heinie to clean the canister, to boot, so it doesn't get used much at all).Enter Electrolux. I've had it for 15 days now so I can only give a preliminary report, but holy moly guacamole: THIS is a vacuum. I went into this with a fair amount of skepticism....oh sure, put a fancy brand name on it and charge 5x as much....but in this case, you get what you pay for. This vacuum cleans like you would not believe. So did we get that part out of the way? It cleans like crazy....wow.Okay, so it has features. Normally, I couldn't care less about extra features because I don't tend to use many of them. But Electrolux had someone just like me designing this darned thing. First of all....a handy switch *on the handle* to switch from hardwoods to carpet. Thank you. Couldn't be easier or make more sense. Next, the attachments (slim nozzle for getting into places like your sliding glass door casement where it gets so yukky and the duster for your baseboards) are in the darned handle. Takes two seconds to switch to them. And the suction on the Electrolux is so good that the attachments WORK. (Did I mention that this vacuum works?) There are two other attachments that come with the vacuum that don't store on it - another hardwood floor attachment which is optional and an upholstery one - although because they aren't stored on the vacuum I probably will lose them, ha.Now for one of my biggest litmus tests: cleaning it out. The canister couldn't be easier to clean. Quick and easy to dump in the garbage can plus you can see from the outside of the vacuum when it's getting full and needs to be emptied.Add to all of this how quiet this thing is (especially on hardwood floor setting) and you'll love it so much. I'll update the review to let you know how it's holding up over time because that is the failing of most vacuums in my opinion, but this thing is amazing.

"As a huge fan of Jane Smiley it was inevitable that I would follow this trilogy through to the end with this final installment, Golden Age. If you haven't read the previous two novels, I highly suggest you start there and not treat this as a stand-alone novel (although I suppose it *could* be read as such, I just don't see the point). Covering the final years of the Langdon family from 1987 to 2020, Golden Age wasn't as fulfilling as I'd hoped but I should note here that I didn't find the previous two novels as fulfilling as I'd like, either. I just kept reading and hoping that this final novel would bring me that love that I've found in Smiley's previous work. Alas, it was not to be.Competently written, I simply never connected with any of the characters enough to fully engage with the saga. This is probably more my problem than the author's. As we enter this last novel, the Langdon family has grown quite a bit with descendants so there are quite a few more characters than in previous novels. While I didn't have a problem with that per se, again I didn't really connect with any one of them. I think I enjoyed the second novel the best of the three, to be completely honest.If you've read any of Smiley's work, you're probably familiar with her style of writing (one that won her a Pulitzer). If not, I'd suggest reading her prize-winning A Thousand Acres first and if you enjoy it, then perhaps give this trilogy a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OT3RTCTJVVG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307700348#wasThisHelpful","R1OT3RTCTJVVG0","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't say enough wonderful things about Scholastic's Branches books. They are just the perfect transition from children's picture-type books to reading chapter books. My seven year old daughter is utterly horse crazy so she was smitten with this story of a girl who visits her grandmother's ranch to find a ""wild"" pony named Jewel. Both of them get to do a lot of growing up together. The chapters were just short enough to keep her attention, the vocabulary challenging yet not so difficult to make her give up. It's lovely to see a first grader reading chapter books on her own....infuses such reading confidence! Highly recommended (I recommend nearly all the Branches books....just find one to suit your child's interests and buy them, you won't regret it!).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XQWP0HNP4ZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545797659#wasThisHelpful","R1XQWP0HNP4ZW","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From a parent's perspective, I enjoyed Moore's novel about a San Francisco family with three daughters, the eldest preparing - and expected to attend - her father's alma mater, Harvard. The incredible pressure and decisions this leads to is presented in a humorous/serious light, if you've ever experienced that in a novel before. Although there are witty moments, the seriousness of what may be lost in terms of family and true happiness in the never-ending quest for perfection and high goals is an always-present theme.Recommended for parents everywhere (and teens, too, as they start entering the world's competitive rat-race), this is an enjoyable novel that has a lesson to teach and is worth the read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E8OQDWCH3EHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385540043#wasThisHelpful","R1E8OQDWCH3EHG","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are just the perfect size....large enough to be noticed but small enough to fit snugly right on my earlobe. The blues compliment each other very nicely. They can be worn with a dressy/work outfit or just to dress up a casual bluejeans outfit.

"I might be writing this review from a different perspective in that I have little to no biblical knowledge to compare David - the subject of Brooks' new novel - to. Aside from a vague familiarity with the whole David and Goliath reference, my knowledge of this apparently well-known biblical figure was pretty much zero going into this book. And I am perfectly fine with that because it meant I wasn't going to be persnickety about the details in this work of fiction.So from that perspective, I have to tell you that I very much enjoyed the book (despite a slightly slow beginning). Despite a soap-opera quality, which I'm going to assume wasn't of Brooks' doing but taken from her source material (ha), she still manages to give *some* dignity to this lurid tale of a very flawed man trying, and often failing, in his roles as father, husband, ruler. Ultimately I would say that it is Brooks' writing that saves this novel from being just another lascivious historical fiction novel which it probably would have been in anyone else's hands. Brooks handles lurid scenes with a deft touch - enough to keep you on the edge of your seat without letting it all get tacky.As noted, I can't speak from a religious person's point of view or imagine how they'd view this novel. But as a non-Christian with little knowledge of the religion, I found it highly entertaining. Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12C7UI06TS084/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025771#wasThisHelpful","R12C7UI06TS084","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This turned out to be an excellent wireless dog fence if you use it as it's intended and follow the instructions properly. The instructions say that it takes about an hour to set up and that was true for me (1 hr 20 minutes). The fence works in a radius (circle). There are no wires to bury or anything like that. You simply set up the main controller on an exterior wall - it plugs into an outlet - which will be the center of your radius of your fence area. You can set up the radius to extend anywhere from 40-400 feet out from controller. It's important to note that the signal from the controller cannot go through metal objects, other outbuildings, clumps of trees/landscaping or thick thinks like that. So you need to be aware of this when setting up your radius or the fence won't work properly for you.Once you've got the radius set up correctly, there will be a ""trigger zone"" for your dog that your dog will encounter first which beeps their collar before they run into the boundary. The kit comes with a plethora of small little flags to put around your trigger zone....these are for training your dog. There are explicit training instructions for your dog in the manual and it is important to use it!!!! It's not fair to just set up the fence and let your poor dog try to figure it out on his/her own...crikey. The training, the manual will tell you, should take about a month. Please, please, PLEASE follow through on this is you want the fence to be successful. We are over half way through the process and it's working wonderfully. I'm not giving up even though we're successful now because we need to solidify this training.Please read the product description carefully before buying. Know your property to know if this will work for you. Check out their website where you can see the product manual online....by reading the manual you will know right then and there if this will work on your property. If it will (ie, line of sight issues from the controller), then ask yourself if you are 100% committed to doing the month's worth of training. If you are, make the investment and you'll like this product. But if you are looking for a ""quick fix"" to your dog's roaming issues that you want stopped yesterday, go buy an fence you bury instead.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CRC52TH80KZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MU368KQ#wasThisHelpful","R1CRC52TH80KZJ","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Contigo makes a good (read: non-leaking) product as a general rule of thumb....I've bought at least a dozen for my kids over the years to replace those that have gotten lost, smashed, one run over by the car in the driveway (oh yes, stop laughing), etc and so on. This one showed up on the doorstep and has the good autoseal top that requires the child to push a button when they drink to unseal the opening allowing the liquid to flow through. Once they understand that part, they're in business. There's no straw so no sucking on it, they have to tip it up to drink just like a regular cup. In that sense, it's a ""big kid"" cup. And it's not a thermos in that it isn't designed to keep drinks cold or anything like that.But all of that aside, I've used these for years. My daughter, who is 7, still loves them. She takes them to school because they won't leak in the backpack. We take them camping, in the car, etc etc. I love them. Contigo is the best for NOT LEAKING. I think we've tried every design they have by now, lol. Dishwasher safe (I don't know if they say they are or not, but I've always tossed them in the dishwasher and they are no worse for wear), they don't get moldy, hold up well to just about any abuse (except being run over by the car, see above).

"It's really, really rare that a hair care product earns 5 stars from me....I mean, it really has to work. I tried a sample size of this stuff recently, never expecting anything really great out of it. Like most of you, I've spent probably hundreds of dollars over the years on stinking hair products looking for something that really does stop frizz or make dried/damaged hair better. Some products might work a bit, but nothing is really a ""miracle"" cure. My stylist and I have a deal: if either of us ever find something that really works, we'll call each other immediately. Well, I called her today about this product. I used the sample over the course of a week just to be sure it wasn't a fluke, but this stuff is AMAZING. I have colored/processed hair that even my stylist says ""I'm sorry, this is the best I can so until the ends grow out."" It is typically coarse or brittle due to damage on the bottom 4 inches or so from the bleaching/coloring. It's not horrid, but I miss my normally soft hair! This brought it back...not kidding. And I don't even have to use it every day. I use it after washing my hair (which I do every 3-4 days because my hair is very thick), let it air dry and then use a flat iron or curlers or whatever to take out frizz and that's it. Don't have to use any kind of curlers/irons/whatever again until I wash my hair again. Hair is silky, smooth, soft for the duration. Can't believe this stuff does what it says. And I really couldn't believe the price when I came over here to Amazon....wow. Totally worth this price!

"4.5 Stars. Ancient Appetites, although marketed as a Young Adult genre novel, turned out to be more heavily slanted towards the ""adult"" than the ""young."" Personally, I loved the book but I'm always mindful of the target marketing group when I'm reading these books and it's heavy violence reminded me of Pierce Brown's Red Rising Trilogy in the sense that those excellent books are also sold as Young Adult and I see them as very much adult books. But what do I know?Anyway...someone called this Steampunk Ireland and I liked that description very much. The filthy rich Wildenstern family is a violent bunch who don't seem to have problems bumping each other off for control of the family wealth and power. When young Nate finds himself the heir following his brother's ""accidental"" (yeah, right) death he's likely now in danger himself even as he sets about finding who was responsible for his brother's death. Because this is steampunk-ish, there's a lot of interesting world building going on and I loved that part of it. McGann gives us a fascinating other-world Ireland with mechanical animals and a Victorian time period. It's a great set-up that fires the imagination.As I said, a lot of violence. I'm a mom and personally, I don't really limit what my kids read as long as they are talking to me about what they are reading. So I would be okay with my younger teen reading this, but I can understand if other parents might feel otherwise. If you think you might not, maybe you should give it a read first. Otherwise, older teens....high-school age or so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C6NNWUOGEPHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497665701#wasThisHelpful","R1C6NNWUOGEPHE","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I rated this book at 3 stars, which by Amazon's standards means ""It's okay."" That about sums it up. There is nothing spectacular about this story of a family disintegrating in the wake of a father's affair. I'm certain we are meant to feel something here....a connection or sympathy or something (anything) for one of the characters. Perhaps for the children who stumble upon the evidence of their father's infidelity at such a tender age. Perhaps for the wronged wife. Perhaps even for the faithless husband himself....he must have had reasons, right? But nothing ever happens that bridges that gap for the reader. We read about a family falling apart, but nothing is there to make us connect with any of the characters. It's downright frustrating because the author can NOT have meant for this to happen.I don't often say this but if you're determined to read this you *must* get this from your local library.

"The Cartel was a lengthy, but riveting, saga of the Mexican drug trade and one DEA agent's obsession with bringing down a Mexican drug cartel and it's leader. I really quite enjoyed it and was hooked (pardon the oblique pun) from the very beginning. While the story line of DEA agent Art Keller and his nearly personal vendetta against the El Federacion cartel leader Adan Barerra kept the plot moving, it was the history of the drug cartels in Mexico that fascinated me more than anything else. This was the first novel by Winslow I've read and since I've finished it I've received quite a few recommendations to read his previous work, The Power of the Dog. I was impressed enough by this novel to order his previous book and look forward to reading that, too.

"There aren't too many stellar YA series these days not specifically geared towards teen girls. The Shattered Sea trilogy, however, is an exception to the rule these days and I highly recommend these books. If you're not familiar with this author, he normally writes adult fantasy novels (and darned good ones, I might add). This trilogy was his first foray into the Young Adult world and I'll admit I was skeptical at first given that his adult books are heavy on the violence - although I must say that it is always integral to the plot. I wasn't sure if he could pull off the plot of a Young Adult novel without all of that explicit violence and still keep a riveting story. Result: he can. In spades.It's difficult to give a specific plot review to this finale of the trilogy without giving away spoilers (for this and the two previous novels). What I can say without spoiling anything is to tell you that new protagonists are introduced - just like the second book of the series - while familiar characters still reappear and are important to the plot even if they aren't necessarily center stage anymore. It's a neat trick. The author continues his fantastic world-building in this novel and admittedly, I'm sad to see this trilogy come to an end....I don't want to leave this world. Frankly, I'm torn between wanting the author to write more about this world or return to his adult fiction worlds and write more there...it's a tough call and I wish we could clone him. He really is one of my favorites.I mentioned earlier that one of the best parts of the Shattered Sea trilogy is that it isn't YA targeted at teen girls....I'd like to clarify that this doesn't mean teen girls won't love his work. As a female, I certainly did. I simply meant that this is a series of books that both genders can appreciate and enjoy. Abercrombie does a remarkable job creating strong male *and* female protagonists....I'm impressed with both.For anyone who appreciates a good fantasy novel with some clear good versus bad and some not-so-clear good versus bad (moral dilemmas abound)....these are books for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PMXFEBONYHNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178453#wasThisHelpful","R3PMXFEBONYHNM","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just in time for the next academic year (2015-2016), this is a nice academic planner for students or for parents with kids in school. It runs from July 2015 through June of 2016 so you can get a head start or keep track through summer school this year if you need to. It's divided by months and each month starts with a ""At a Glance"" double page (facing pages) with a monthly overview with the monthly calendar. There are 6 lines for each day of the month here so you can note important reminders and holidays are pre-filled in. The following pages are larger spaces for each day of that month where you can fill in detailed schedules...there are AM and PM columns (8 lines per column).In the back of the planner there are several pages for Contacts, more for Notes, and then one full page divided into months labeled Event Calendar so you can jot down big important events like graduations, recitals, plays, whatever. There is also a laminated Holiday List with dates for 2015-2018 in the back of the planner.The pages are NOT replaceable, but I prefer these kind of planners as the spiral binding is easier for this left-hander to write in. ;) It's light, fits in my purse, yet is still big enough to fit all the stuff I have to write in there (I've got two kids in elementary school....I've got a LOT of stuff to keep track of).

"If you're looking at this product, you probably have purchased one of the seemingly hundreds of varieties of the ubiquitous Nerf Guns for one of your kids and are looking for something along those lines. All kids love those Nerf Guns, ha, I know mine have and own several. I thought this might be a good addition to their disturbing ""arsenal."" As it turns out, although I rarely pay attention farther than yelling to ""KEEP IT OUTSIDE DARNIT!!!"", in this case I actually noticed that the Nerf Slingshot is far, far inferior to any of their little Nerf guns.To begin with, the slingshot only comes with 2 darts. Come on, Nerf....what a blatant and cruddy bait-n-switch scheme. Anyone who has any experience with Nerf guns knows what I'm talking about here. How many darts do your kids lose? How many do your dogs eat? Even if the slingshot came with 10 darts, we'd still buy their dang extra packages of darts so to come with a mere 2 darts is cheap and cheesy. Lessens my opinion on the company in general. I don't like being manipulated that way.Next up...the accuracy is joke. I don't expect anything quality here out of a toy, but it would be nice to be able to hit the broad side of a barn. Which is apparently not possible with these.Last, there is no handhold or grip over the plastic part that you hold while pulling back on the sling shot. OUCH. After about 2 pulls, your hand hurts from the plastic digging into your hand. Did anyone over there at Hasbro even test these things out before releasing it?Save your money and get one of the many, many models of Nerf guns instead. Or if you really want a slingshot, find a different manufacturer because Nerf/Hasbro missed the mark here.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4Q04XPOJHZ5G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQ7M89I#wasThisHelpful","R4Q04XPOJHZ5G","AEV9CT81N33CR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEV9CT81N33CR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have unfortunately had the sad privilege of observing several church plants not survive. I also have seen two churches have to close their doors and sell their buildings. None of these were churches that I served at, but they were within our district when I served on the District Board. The two churches that had to close their doors and sell their buildings feel under my responsibility. It was heart wrenching.Just recently I met with the board and congregation of a small church that was seeking to try and find a pastor. They courted our church plant as a possible merger, but then decided it wasn't for them. The differences in church style were to much. This church has plenty of cash on hand, a building in very good repair and paid for but no full-time or part-time pastor. They are now down to less than twenty people. It is only a matter of time before they close their doors and sell.So, this book was one of interest for me. I wanted to read what Thom Rainer thought about churches that had died. This is a very short read but probably one of the most fact filled and direct little books that I have ever read.Thom looks at 14 churches that died. He found twelve similarities in the churches and he dissects those similarities in this book. I found his points correct and almost uncannily familiar to what I had experienced. His most direct observation was that all of these dying churches did not think they had a problem and did not think that they would die. They were in denial of their illness.Probably the main point I found was that each of these churches had become inward focused. They stopped looking outside their walls to see their communities and to meet those communities needs. Instead they were more concerned with staying warm and comfortable in their own little world, well fed and satisfied with life. They forgot the Great Commission. They forgot the marching orders that Jesus gave His church after His death.May we never forget those orders. At the end of this booklet after he has dissected what caused the death of these churches Thom gives several suggestions for diagnosis of your church and then remedies to help your church regain it's health and not find that they have a fatal disease.May you find the truths of what you need to help your church not succumb to a fatal illness","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5CU5QJR30N9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPOY9H2#wasThisHelpful","R5CU5QJR30N9S","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mark DeVine writes a very intriguing account of how a dying Baptist Church in the Kansas City area turned to the Lord for direction in how to keep this 150 year old church alive and start it growing again. Was it to bring in a new pastor? Was it to merge with another church in the area? Or maybe was it time to call it quits and close the doors?Mark was teaching Theology at a local Seminary when he became the part-time preaching pastor at this church. His first thought was that the church had the viability to continue and to start growing again, but that it would take a God thing to make that happen. So he started to pray.After a couple of years he approached the church leadership about merging with another church. They agreed and sought out a partner. Four different churches were interested. But after a long process and a vote to merge the other church selected in the process ran aground with some problems of their own and the merger did not happen.Demoralized the church basically hunkered down again but kept praying for God to bring a good solution. They didn't want the history or ministry of the church to die. That is when Mark started conversations with Darrin Patrick about The Journey in St. Louis taking over a church in Kansas City. With some prayer and direction from God that happened. A small dying church of 80 people within a year had grown into a growing church of 600 people. How does that happen without killing off the old congregation? Well, that is the topic of the book.Read and see what God can do when a people of God are willing to let go and let God do His thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HXPDU2ISGCJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0781410320#wasThisHelpful","R2HXPDU2ISGCJE","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simple installation. First you put the battery (CR 232) in the transmitter (Doorbell) and then two double ""A"" batteries in the receiver, the batteries are supplied with the product. Once you have the batteries in the devices you then follow the instructions to synchronize the doorbell with the chime unit. This is simple and takes maybe three or four seconds.You will want to install the doorbell on the outside by your door. There are screws included to attached the bracket, or there is double sided tape that is also included. I used the screws to attach the bracket. It took less than 30 seconds to install the bracket and clip the doorbell into the bracket.The receiver has two options for your installation. You can either hang it on a wall using a screw and securing the mounting section, much like a picture, or you can use the stand that is supplied with the unit and stand the door chime up on a table or shelf. We chose to use the stand and have it on a shelf unit near the front door in the living room. We liked the idea of being able to move it around.Then you select the chime that you want. There are ten different chimes. Two Christmas ones, the birthday song, regular chime and then a couple of songs. You thus can change the chime to suit the season or your own desire. It is very easy to do, you just push the chime button until the selection you want plays, then let the button up and it is set.There is a volume control that gives you three volume settings to suit your desire.All in all from unpacking to inserting the batteries and installing the doorbell it took me maybe five minutes to complete everything.I'm very satisfied with the device and like the different ring tones.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L87SN7BH2H3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011AWM6OO#wasThisHelpful","R3L87SN7BH2H3S","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Or is it other politicians that they are after?Along the way to finding these answers Jordan will also uncover someone she feels is an counter agent within the Israeli Secret Service.

"Ruchti gives us a booklet that tells stories, it tells stories of how Jesus mended the broken people that he met while on the earth. It gives evidence that Jesus was all about mending the hurt, the pain, the illness and the crippling injuries that people had, but he also was about healing them emotionally and spiritually as well as physically.She tells the stories of people today and how they appear tattered by the effects of abuse, neglect, poor self-esteem, etc. Then she compares them to the Biblical stories and explains how they can be mended. She also takes into her discussion comments about art, everyday objects and how they also appear to give credence to the thought of how things can be tattered but then mended.I found the book a quick easy read. There is no major deep theological discussion. There is no exegetical breakdown of the scripture that she brings to bear on the topic of the Wounded Soul. There are stories. Now, while there are no deep theological debates lets understand that stories are things that bring healing. Jesus dealt with a culture that was basically a story telling culture. Thus people that were healed will be people whose stories can be told around the evening fire, household table or at bedtime. They would bring peace, understanding and healing to those who heard the stories and took comfort from knowing that God understands us and desires to mend us.So, simple, direct, comforting, caring and filled with hope for those who feel that life has tattered their lives and they might not be able to go on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NWPPSCUTKV04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426787693#wasThisHelpful","R3NWPPSCUTKV04","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I appreciated this book by C. Stephen Evans, a Professor from Baylor University. As a Philosopher I at first was apprehensive to read his book. I have not appreciated the work of Philosophers in the past and have often found their work hard to digest and understand, they tend to be a bit lofty and wordy.But C. Stephen Evans does a great job of writing in words that every layman will understand and be able to digest. He makes very good logical conclusions based on the evidence that he has studied and gathered together for his work.His main task in writing this book is to talk about â€œThe New Atheism,â€ as it is being developed in our culture today. Here are the main tenants of his book in his own words; â€œI take it that the major complaint (though not the only one) of the New Atheists about religion is that faith is intellectually baseless. In this book I try to give a clear case that belief in Christian faith still makes sense and thus answer that criticism.â€ He further states, â€œSo the book answers a major charge of the New Atheists make not by responding to their specific complaints but by showing how a thoughtful Christian might â€˜give a reason for the hopeâ€™ that faith embodies.â€I believe that he develops his topic well, he addresses many things that we as Christians are facing in our world today and helps develop answers that we can use in talking with friends who doubt Christianity. I took a long time to work through the book, not because it was difficult, but because I was outlining each chapter and framing my own conclusions and arguments (arguments in the good sense) that I could use with those who are living in this modern world of the New Atheism.I recommend this book to Pastors and lay people alike. I believe that it will become a major book to help us work through how to talk and build relationships with those who are out in the culture today stating that Christianity is archaic and thus dying.This book makes me almost want to go back to school and study Philosophy, but alas I am a bit to old for that, but not to old to learn something new from a great writer such as C. Stephen Evans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY1POEN6HSS5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMSCOEO#wasThisHelpful","RY1POEN6HSS5A","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is truly interesting to see the disparity in reviews of W.E.B. Griffin's new book. Either you love it or you hate it. Frankly, I enjoyed the book very much, so why only 4 stars? Well, because I don't think it is his best work. But it is worthy of your reading if you are a W.E.B. Griffin fan.Homicide Sergeant Matthew Payne takes us on a wild ride of several days through the labyrinth of murders going on in Philadelphia. It provides the reality of a city out of control in regards to gun control, criminal activity, drugs, gangs and crooked politicians. Some of the police are not the best either. But Payne is one of a kind, diligent, thorough, competent and not corrupted by any of the enticements that crooked cops can fall to.He is trying his best to bring about a change to the city. But he is basically the ""Dirty Harry"" of the Philadelphia Police Department, although they like to call him Wyatt Earp. While he has been taken to task for his willingness to shoot bad guys it is not because he shoots first and asks questions later, it's because he identifies himself and then if necessary pulls the trigger. All of his Office Involved Shootings have been declared appropriate by Internal Affairs. But the crooks would like the public to think otherwise.The book starts with Payne in trouble, then it backtracks a couple of days to give the build up to the story, then comes back to the beginning at the end of the book. I think it draws you in, gives you many facts and details and keeps you interested throughout. I'm not quite sure what the one and two star reviewers were looking for, this is truly a W.E.B. Griffin Police Drama.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PU8WDNS7I3VX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3L1130#wasThisHelpful","R3PU8WDNS7I3VX","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alex Hawke has a problem, someone wants him dead. That someone is Russian, but is it Putin's men or a break off group that Alex made angry by destroying their coup? Whatever the case they are not just trying to kill Alex but the are also after his son. This makes things complicated as you try to figure out how to protect a six year old boy. But with Nell by the boys side he is safe. Nell being a special operative that has training and brains and just happens to be the woman that Alex loves.Alex also gets a call from Putin wanting him to make a visit. During that visit Putin gives a demonstration to Alex about a new military weapon that will revolutionize the world of warfare. It is a colorless, tasteless liquid that packs a powerful punch, more than that of a nuclear explosion.What is Putin doing with that? Probably preparing to start WWIII and bring Russia back to the status of superpower and not just any superpower but the number 1 superpower.Can Alex keep his son alive? Can he defeat the overly megalomanic Putin from doing his worse? Can he save the world?That seems a bit overly dramatic, but it is most likely the full course of the story.Ted Bell does a great job of building the story, building the characters, keeping you guessing about certain subjects and riveted to your seat as he takes you on a wild ride of politics, warfare, terrorist and assassins.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKF9D3MC5X6DS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062279416#wasThisHelpful","RKF9D3MC5X6DS","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this true life adventure. This young lady became a ""hiker"" early in life taking several major trails and enjoying the wilderness. Then after a harrowing beginning to her life away from home at college she set out on the walk of a lifetime. Not many people are willing to attempt this journey, an especially to attempt it alone.Aspen sets out to conquer the continental trail of the West Coast from Mexico to Canada. She will hike through the desert, through mountains, across snow covered fields, ice fields, etc. She will hike in extreme heat and then in below freezing weather.Her journey was a cleansing of her soul. It was an adventure that she needed to regain her confidence and trust in herself and her abilities. I enjoyed reading about her adventures and the encounters that she had on the trail. I don't think I could ever imagine a life of hiking like this. Her story is riveting in so many ways and you will cheer her on and wish you could encounter some of her adventure and be glad that you didn't have to face some of the struggles that she did.The only other nature book that I enjoyed this much was a book on the life of a Forrest Fire Watcher who manned a Fire Tower in the mountains that kept him and his dog away from civilization for six months of the year. Both stories filled me awe for the accomplishments that someone can make when they set their minds to it.I hope you enjoy the story as much as I did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTMDFVXWISLGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062291068#wasThisHelpful","RTMDFVXWISLGK","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have often fought with screen protection films to get them on my iPad, iPhone or other devices and get all of the bubbles out. I just don't seem to have good luck with those.So, I wondered about these privacy protectors when I order them.I was very pleasantly surprised. They are actually a thicker item than film, they do not bend or flex, they are sturdy. Yet they are very thin.You use the cleaning wipes that they send with the screen protector, then peel the backing off the protector and place it on top of your iPhone 5s screen. It adheres to the clean surface and you rub it a couple of times to make sure the fit is good and there you have it, you are done.Being sturdy and a bit thicker than the films I have used in the past I wondered about the sensitivity of the touch screen after you have applied the protector. The sensitivity is perfect. It still sense your finger or a stylus without any wait in time or without any missing beat at times.This particular ""glass"" screen protector is tinted so that it is Anti-spy Privacy. The tinting of the screen dimmed the brightness a bit but it was not too restricting. Now, people looking from across the table or near you can't see your screen well at all because of the tinting, but you see it just fine. So, it does its job if you wanted a product that protectors your view from others.I am completely satisfied and happy with the product.Enjoy","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CI56NPT8E2VZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W3IM3VG#wasThisHelpful","R1CI56NPT8E2VZ","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want to add a little bit of bling to your iPhone 5 this is a nice item. It is a metal cast frame that goes around the edges of your iPhone 5 or iPhone 5s. There is a bit of bling on the facing of the frame to ad some bling to your phone. In my case it is a 'gold' fleck type of coating that ads a bit of class to the phone.There are openings for the headphone jack, the charging cable and the speakers, as well as the sound on/off/vibrate button on the side of your iPhone. For the top Power button and the side volume buttons they have a nice flex touch on the frame work that is sensitive to your pressure and thus depresses those buttons on the iPhone 5 for you.The top clasp seemed a bit flimsy to me at first because when the frame is not on your phone it didn't click together. But once the frame is on your phone when you clasp the top part of the frame together it clicks into place and holds very snugly.All in all to add bling to your phone this is a nice item. It would not appear to me to add much in the way of protection from damage if you drop the iPhone, although the metal frame would add some cushion if your phone hit on it's corner or edge.Enjoy","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NTMS187VUR6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RZDIY6W#wasThisHelpful","R3NTMS187VUR6M","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We enjoyed the movie tremendously. It seemed like a cross between Men in Black and James Bond. The Kingsman are a secret order of men and women dedicated to the protection of the Kingdom of England and her sovereignty.In this particular movie we have the standard Evil Villein who is wanting to take over the world, mainly by brining the population under control by designing a weapon of mass destruction that is neither Nuclear Weapons nor Biological Weapons. Instead it is a system of weapon that will bring people to a boiling point of loosing control of their ability to reason and instead respond to everything with anger.Our Hero is one of the men of The Kingsman who is doing his best to unwrap the truth about this evil plot while at the same time trying to recruit the next Kingsman to replace another who has died in the line of duty.The story line is very plausible given today's technology. The men and women in the service of their country is also plausible and the way they go about their work is very gifted and unique just as the Men in Black and James Bond would do.The only frustration I had with the movie was the use of vulgarity as a standard way of daily dialogue. Really? Can't people talk without so much vulgarity?Well, other than that we enjoyed watching the movie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FEL7N5Q488CH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9NZBN4#wasThisHelpful","R1FEL7N5Q488CH","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have been having quite a few deer come to our backyard area where I have bird feeders, so I decided to purchase this feeder to put out corn for the deer. We have a mother and two fawns coming.The feeder is a Plastic design that is light weight. It has holes in the bottom portion to allow moisture to drain if any gets in and to allow some airflow so that there won't be any mold build up. There is a top that clips down over two plastic holders to keep out the moisture when it rains and keep some critters out. BUT, this is a poor design on the top feature, the clips don't provide a good hold. I eventually drilled a small hole through the brackets to allow the cotter pin to go through the lid as well as the brackets. This has kept the raccoon from opening the top.My only other dislike was the fact that the unit did not come with any straps to attach the feeder to a tree or post. I had to provide my own. Luckily I have some good straps in the barn so that wasn't a problem, but I would have thought they should have provided those as part of the product.Still, I like the unit and it is serving it's purpose quite well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P33YRNKE851O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJ429OW#wasThisHelpful","R3P33YRNKE851O","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoyed this novel very much. As a Christian novel I was interested to see how the author would handle the subject of a young woman of 37 years of age who had never been married now being faced with maybe finding the love of her life, but in a man 17 years her senior. That is quite an age difference and even more interesting since Mitchell Sanderson's children would be contemporaries of Suzanne Bloomer. How would they take their fathers interest in a younger woman.So there are several topics the novel covers that I think are handled very well and they are:1. How does a single adult survive in a church of married couples with lots of children, where the pastor seems to forget when he preaches that he has single adults as part of the mix?2. How does a young woman contend with the memories of being bullied by other teenagers because she was a bit outside the realm of the popular group?3. How does a young woman set behind her the non-loving environment of her home upbringing?4. What about Christian School Teachers at Private Christian Schools and the paltry salaries they are paid. How does a gifted single adult woman teacher survive on that salary and what about retirement?5. What about eating disorders? Suzanne is very petite and some would call her skinny, that drives her nuts, does she or does she not have an eating disorder?6. What about the fact that Christian couples take advantage of a single woman in her thirties when it comes to baby sitting, assuming that the ""old maid school teacher"" should do it for no pay?7. What about re-marriage for a man who has lost his wife to cancer? But more than that, what should he do when he is attracted to a woman 17 years his younger?8. How will grown adult children of Mitch Sanderson deal with their fathers growing attraction to Suzanne Bloomer?These and many other subjects are really at the heart of the book. Suzanne has always wanted to be married, she has always wanted to have children of her own, but at no time in her life, so far, has the opportunity come about that she could marry.It hurts her very much that her best friend takes great joy in telling her all about her children and all about her desire to have more and how being pregnant is so great. Then comes mother's day and Suzanne is beat up by the sermon and the desire of others to have her babysit so that husbands can take their wives out to dinner.I thought the book handle all these situations really well, taught good Biblical lessons and wove a good romantic story into the mix.I'm sure you will enjoy reading about a rich older farmer who comes into the life of a thirty something (almost 40) old maid teacher who is poorer than dirt.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33ZFMWL5K6DWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426770286#wasThisHelpful","R33ZFMWL5K6DWQ","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this is Volume 2 in a three volume set it must be noted that this is the last volume being published. Volumes 1 and 3 have been out for a while. This project was taken on by professor's from Dallas Theological Seminary, thus the views are Protestant Conservative Evangelical. Most pastors will know that for decades the major Systematic Theology work from Dallas Seminary has been Lewis Sperry Chafer's 8 volume work. So, why a new three volume series?Well, the answer is found in the introduction for the series, the writers are wanting you to Know God and to do that you must Know About Him. So that means that as a Christian layperson or professional you need to study Theology. But the study of Theology can seem like a daunting task for the layperson. Here is what the introduction states as to why this series of texts;  ""Exploring Christian Theology differs from other mini-theologies in that it strives to present a broad consensus, not a condensed systematic model of one evangelical teacher or protestant tradition.......Treat each volume as a simple primer that supplements (not supplants) more detailed treatments of theology--that complements (not competes with) intermediate and advanced works.""So, what we have is an attempt to give a more readable version of a Theological Text for the layperson. This is not meant to take the place of a more systematic approach to theology, as it states it is to supplement and complement other works that your denomination might use.So, with that in mind I took up the task of reading through Volume two with the understanding that it was not a comprehensive look at the theological topics that it was going to tackle. I also liked what the author's had to say in that, ""since this is not a systematic study you can pick and choose the topic you want to read without working through the text from beginning to end."" That is good because most laypeople will have certain topics that they want to delve into without having to build upon them from one to the next.Volume two deals with ""The Christian Story in Four Acts:""  Act I -- Creation  Act II -- Fall  Act III -- Redemption  Act IV -- RestorationEach of these topics are broken up into bite size studies that the reader can tackle and accomplish fairly easily. I particularly like their style of how they break down the four acts. The breakdown is:  High - Altitude Survey  Passages to Master  Facts to Never Forget  Dangers to Avoid  Principles to Put into Practice  Voices from the Past and PresentThey also give you some recommendations for further books and studies you might do from things that have been discussed in their text.Reading through this text I felt that they did an excellent job of breaking down the theological jargon in a way that a lay person will be able to understand. They have gone to great lengths to make the book readable.I would highly recommend this material for any person who wants to get to know God better and put that knowledge and relationship into more practical use in their lives.NOW, for one last bit of advice, for my Evangelical Free Church of America lay people this is a good set of books to read, but you also should purchase a copy of ""Evangelical Convictions, A Theological Exposition of the Statement of Faith of the Evangelical Free Church of America."" It is the official book to explain the complete Statement of Faith of our denomination. It is also well written and also written in a way that any layperson, pastor or theologian can understand.Enjoy learning more about God as you read through these books, and don't forget to spend time in your Bible as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XHZ42X8E64XU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBTYGG2#wasThisHelpful","R2XHZ42X8E64XU","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have loved the Jack Ryan, Jr. and The Campus novels. They have been excellent works in the Tom Clancy fashion. I have felt that Grant Blackwood has been a great asset to the Clancy stable of writers, as I have noted in my other reviews of his work.BUT, this novel didn't really work for me. My first problem is that it really only had Jack Jr. in the story until about 70% of the way through, then finally Dom Caruso shows up in the field. That misses the mark of what The Campus is about. It is not about lone wolf characters acting on their own and not giving The Campus the full story. So, either Jack Jr. has fallen far from the family tree or he is thinking that he can be the lone wolf hero of political events and spy activities.Jack Jr. meets with an old friend and finds that he has stepped into a problem in a country that is going to be facing a Coup in the next couple of weeks. Jack Jr. has to figure out what is happening and who the bad guys are and who the good guys are. His friend Seth appears to be having a bit of a break with reality, or is he?Bottom line, The CIA, British Intelligence and Russian Elite Forces are going to be playing a game of political chicken as the country of Dagestan goes through the upheaval of a political coup as the Minster of Interior takes steps to wrestle control of the country from the President of Dagestan.Jack Jr. will find himself on the side of the Minister of Interior and will not be sure that this is truly a wise move. Jack Jr. comes off looking tentative at times and not as decisive as his old man would have been in a similar situation.Jack Jr. will use The Campus assets but not in the way that they should have been used or were used in previous works.I liked the story, I liked the complex situation with many different intelligence agencies involved, I just didn't like Blackwood taking Jack Jr. and making him a lone wolf on this case.Next time lets stick with the whole team and get them back involved as they should be.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1948I47IM7MB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY3ZOBY#wasThisHelpful","R1948I47IM7MB4","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Trident Code is the second book in the Lana Elkins series. Last years book, Lethal Code, was a thrill ride that seemed so fast paced that it might never stop. Well, the Trident Code starts much the same way. Lana Elkins our Cyber Guru is called by the NSA because of a crisis that they are facing. That crisis is a Chinese group of hackers that they want to weed out and make impotent. So, Lana is going to help.But before they can even start their meetings on this issue a new one comes front and center. Someone has hijacked a U.S. Navy Nuclear Missile Submarine. They have released a gas into the air system that kills the entire crew, with the exception of one man who was able to get an oxygen mask on and vent the gas out of the sub and restore the normal oxygen. Is that providence or is it design?Well, soon it seems design because this sub will be front and center for a cyber attack not just on the United States but on the world. The Cyber terrorist claim they can launch the nuclear missiles unless the world caves to their demands. When the world doesn't cave quickly enough they do launch a missile, but it is not headed towards any major city of the world, instead it is headed towards the Antarctic and the polar ice cap and glaciers. Why?Well, here is where the story might be taking a political / Global Warming / environmental shift to do a bit of preaching while still in the thriller realm. The nuclear missile melts a major portion of a Glacier plus breaks off the ice in such a degree that it causes the oceans of the world to start rising. This is what environmentalist have said will happen with Global warming, but it would happen over a very long period of time. But with this nuclear strike it happens overnight. The coastlines of the continents are inundated with a four foot rise in sea level (with the threat that another missile will make it an eleven foot rise). To think of this makes you realize what that could actually mean to the world.Most of New Orleans would again be under water, but it would never recede. The Netherlands would be 60% under water at 4 feet and totally under water at 11 feet. Thousands will drown, economies will be devastated, thousands more will either die of thirst or starvation because of the disruption of food deliveries and water purification.This is huge.The charge to Lana and her team, find out who did this, find out how to wrestle back control of the nuclear sub and prevent the launch of another missile, or for that matter the remaining twenty two missiles.The book is fast paced and excellent reading. So, why only four stars? Well, I thought the ending was a bit to quick, to cut off. While we have had a wild ride it just abruptly is over. Maybe that is real life, but it seemed a bit to quick. I wanted a bit more closure on some topics. But all in all it is a good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNA7Z4MESEUAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PR32G52#wasThisHelpful","RNA7Z4MESEUAM","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave a five star review not because I necessarily think ""A God in Ruins"" is a great book, frankly I haven't read that book yet.But this CLIFF NOTES style summary and anaylsis of the book is really a nice thing to have. This is my first Instaread summary that I have downloaded to my Kindle and thus I was curious as to what it would give me.First of all, the Instaread Summaries are very short, this one was about 21 pages long. But they are full of information.They start by giving you a summary of the book. The summary hits the high points and basically outlines the book for you. The only problem that I see from reading this is that at times they can contain ""Spoilers."" In this case it did give some of the plot thread away that many would say is a spoiler.The next section is the Character's section. They take each character and give you an overview of that character, i.e. are they good, bad, conflicted, narciscistic, etc. I found this very helpful because it helps you get up to speed very quickly on the characters of the Novel. So, if you decide to buy the novel you will have a firm grip on the characters as you start. BUT, that does take some of the thrill out of the read as character development is one way you can tell if an author is good or bad.Finally is the anaylsis of the book. They give you their thoughts on the book, they are not prejudice one way or another, they just state the facts as they see them.In the case of this book, the anaylsis points out that the author jumps back and forth from present to past to future. The author also has some times when you find it hard to follow because of all the movement through time periods and peoples lives.For me this gave me a good idea of whether I would like to buy the novel. I don't particularly like writing that goes back and forth, present, to past to future. I usually find that they are cumbersome and cause some frustration in reading.So, with that in mind it gives me a better handle on the novel, I can now read reviews of the real book and decide with a more informed background whether I want to spend the money to buy the book or not.This summary seems a bit pricey at $2.99 for a Kindle Cliff Notes type of book. But I'm not sure how much they should charge, I would think maybe $1.50, but again, I'm not disappointed that I spent $3.00 to help determine if I might like this novel and author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1013GBZ9QZ8NP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZDNHX86#wasThisHelpful","R1013GBZ9QZ8NP","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cooper Lindsey returns to Justice, Mississippi, in the early 1960's to set up a law practice in the small town where he grew up. His father had been the pastor of the local community church. Coop had been a local sports star and academic star of the community. He went away to college, married a wonderful woman and returned to Justice to settle down.But what happens will alter the course of his and his families life. One morning a black woman, Hattie Ross, comes to his law office and asks him to defend her surrogate son, Calvin, who has been accused of killing a local girl, Becky Booth. She claims that he is innocent and being railroaded by the ""white"" establishment to get a quick verdict and end to this grizzly crime.Coop has to decide whether he will take the case. If he does it will mean that the whole town (at least the white population) will turn against him because he is defending a young black man. When Coop goes to the jail to meet with Calvin you get your first hint of the deep racial divide that was embedded in the deep South during this time. Calvin doesn't trust Coop and can't believe that a ""white man"" would be interested in representing him, unless he has an ulterior motive. Coop leaves a bit unsatisfied and not sure what he will do.Bottom line, Coop decides to defend Calvin because he is convinced that Calvin is innocent. The first two thirds of the novel deals with Coop investigating and doing his best to not only prove that Calvin is innocent but also prove who the true killer is. Coop will find only a few people who will help him. One happens to be the Sheriff, which is unusual but very helpful. The other is the Millionaire White Man who owns half of the town and whom both the white and black people seem to hate. Coop can't understand why John David Maltose wants to see Calvin found innocent.What makes this novel so interesting is that the author grabs the civil rights unrest and unravels the deep seated prejudice that was part of the South. He also brings into play the fact that the ""Church"" didn't really do much to help. The pastor of the White Church will show his color's as a bigot, and the Black Church will show it's color as a place of Biblical Preaching.But to be honest and maybe spoil a tiny bit of the story, the White Preacher comes to understand more about the truth of the Bible as the story unfolds and will have to face his prejudices head on.About two thirds of the way through the story the trial ends. But the story is just getting started. In an unusual way of writing the author takes us from the hour after the trial to 50 years in the future.In 2014 the grandson of Cooper Lindsey comes to Justice, he too is a lawyer, but he comes for a different reason than his grandfather. He comes to find out the truth of what really happened in 1964 and 1965. But he gets caught up in a new trial, this one is a young white teenager (the son of the millionaires) who is accused of killing a Black teenager. The town has now shifted a bit, the new Sheriff is a Black Man, the new Judge is a Black Woman and the Mayor of the town is a Black man. It seems like the racial tides have turned.Now it appears that maybe the Black township people want to put a white boy on trial as a way of getting revenge on the boys family. What will Grandson Clark Cooper Lindsey do? The answer will surprise you and the solution will also be surprising.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W3CMY8CZDUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426770030#wasThisHelpful","R7W3CMY8CZDUB","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a fun children's story book. The story is simple and straight forward and your kids or grandkids will love it when you read it to them, or it is simple enough that young readers just learning to read should have fun trying their hand at reading this story.The illustrations are very colorful and well drawn. There are illustrations on every page, there is text (the story) on the left page and an illustration on the right page. So, these should hold the childs attention as you read to them.BUT, here is the fun part. DOWNLOAD the AR app from either Google Play or the Apple App store (it's free). You can then use your Smartphone or tablet to add some fun to the reading. The app uses your camera on the smartphone or tablet and when you point the camera at the illustrated page the drawing comes to life! The page will show up in 3D on your app, and the characters will become animated. The Knight will climb a wall, the Dragon will fly around the sky, the Cat and Dog helping the Knight will also move their pages. The views will be from high above, but what is interesting is that new items will appear on the picture that you didn't see before. I have no idea how this actually works, but it is really cool.The gist of the story is that a happy village is living in peace until a fire breathing dragon comes along and decides to live in a cave above their village. He sees their happiness and becomes jealous and decides he wants to destroy them.The villagers go the ARBI, the Knight living in a Castle near the village and ask him to rid them of the Dragon. He enlists the help of some friends and they set off to deal with the dragon.There are some good lessons for the kids to learn while having a fun story. The app makes it even more fun as your child can spend lots of time watching the pictures come to life.This is a very interesting concept and thus it explains the cost of the booklet.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLEYN7HCHRSR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1505266211#wasThisHelpful","RLEYN7HCHRSR9","A1C74SFQ5UMHLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C74SFQ5UMHLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our cats have loved the Bergan Turbo toy, they play with it all the time. The major attraction for me was the scratching pad that is in the center of the toy. The cardboard pad is perfect for the cats to dig their claws into (better than my furniture) and if you pour the catnip into the pad then the cats love it even more.We have several cats so we discovered after about three months that the pad was starting to come apart, it is not because they are poorly made, it is because we have too many cats using it. If you have one cat you probably won't have to buy a pad that often.But the fact to get two pads in one package cuts the cost and gives you a back up pad for when the first replacement finally gives up the ghost.I couldn't be happier with these pads and with the Turbo Track toy for the cats.

"This product has serious quality control issues.  I ordered these in 3 colors for my 16-year-old son.  2 in size 30"" and 1 in 29"", because it wasn't available in 30"".  Well, he decided to keep the 2, 30"" pairs and return the 29"" pair.  Why?  Because, even though he LOVED the color most, it was WAY too big!  Bigger than the 30"" pairs!  Huh?!?  Well, at least that explains the previous reviews, some of which say these shorts fit large, others which say they fit small, and still others that say they fit fine.Overall, he likes the style of these shorts:  flat front, straight/slim cut, fun colors.I am glad that Amazon offers free returns on them.  At least to Prime members.  My recommendation:  order the color(s) you want in 2-3 sizes and return the ones that don't fit right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3584MJZ27RA5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLWBLKA#wasThisHelpful","R3584MJZ27RA5V","A2PXVMF9DH8NDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PXVMF9DH8NDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This item has ""quality control"" issues.  I purchased 2 packs so I could make 48 cupcakes.  Well, the first package I opened only contained 23 liners.  Both my son (13) and I checked all the liners very carefully, multiple times, to make sure none were sticking to each other.  When the cupcakes were done baking, we checked again, and there was only 1 liner per cupcake.  Definitely only 23 liners.Luckily the 2nd pack I purchased had 27 liners in it.  So everything turned out OK.  But I was thinking what if I had needed 24 cupcakes and only purchased 1 pack?

"I ordered these for my 16-year-old son because I know he loves all kinds of pockets, snaps, etc.  And, he likes slim cut pants.  These seemed to fit the bill on both accounts.  These pants were very low priced, so I was a bit wary.  Indeed, you get what you pay for.  Generally, these pants are fine.  My son LOVES them.  However, the first time he put them on, one of the snaps on the front left leg (1 of the 2 small pockets pictured on the pants, right side on the photo, left leg on the wearer) broke.  When he tried to open the pocket, top half of the bottom part of the snap stayed stuck to the top part of the snap.  It completely separated from its back half, and thus the fabric.  I don't know if I can find a similar snap to fix this.  Since the top part of the snap (the part on the flap) is still intact, this doesn't look bad.  But, the snap doesn't work and this is disappointing.  Still, I'm giving this 4-stars because the broken snap is a very minor issue and the pants are still wearable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WCNZRK4R31D5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFO3FZ6#wasThisHelpful","R2WCNZRK4R31D5","A2PXVMF9DH8NDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PXVMF9DH8NDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow!  This little bird is SO beautiful! It's styrofoam body is completely covered in sparkly or pearlescent glitter, beads and sequins (more on it's back and less on the belly/underside.

These beads capture and reflect light and color.  Cute little bead eyes and a pearlescent plastic beak.  The overall effect is a sparkly little bird.  I am using this on a wreath of olive leaves/branches for my son's Confirmation, but this would be a beautiful Christmas ornament, peace dove, or whatever you need it for.Note, The plastic ""wires"" used in the tail and wings are not really wire.

This is VERY difficult to find.  The best I usually do is 29""X32"".  So, I took a chance on these in a 30""X32"" and they seemed OK.  Not too baggy as some 30"" waist pants I have tried.  He will need to wear a belt, but he always wears one anyway.  And these aren't baggy in his butt.  I am very happy to have found these.  Wish they were a little less expensive, as he will outgrow them within the year, but happy wit the free shipping for Prime members.  My son was really happy to get a pair of purple jeans.

"I ordered this in the ""purples"" color for my 16.5 year old son.  He was bummed because a black and purple plaid shirt he had got to small (the sleeves were too short) and he loved that shirt.  So, I tried to find something similar.  Purple seems to be the thing for the boys at his high school right now.  Anyway, his original shirt was more shades of black with a few lines of purple, whereas this On my way! is pretty much just purple.  Still, it is REALLY nice.  The colors are a lot more subtle than I thought they might be based on the photo.  They are actually quite like in the photo, but you never know.  Something like this could arrive a lot brighter (or pinker) than it looks on the screen.  I also love that the inside of the cuffs, neckband and button hole strip is a contrasting fabric, in the sense that it is a different pattern, but stll purple.  This makes it fun to leave the top button open and/or the sleeves turned up now and then.  The fabric is a nice dress shirt fabric, too.  Soft and smooth.  If I can find the right toe, he might wear this with a dark slim-cut suit to his confirmation in May.

"This roll on really worksâ€¦.the solid, not so much.  I don't have an excessive perspiration issue.  In the last 5 years, though, I've started perspiring at night (night sweats).  I like to take showers in the evening, and I was waking up with armpits that really stunk!  I hate taking showers in the morning, especially in the winter.  I also like to let my hair air dry, and leaving the house with wet hair when it's 32*F outside is quite unpleasant.  I really didn't want to turn into one of the elderly women that smells funny.I tried different anti-persperents from the supermarket, and none did any better.  Then I found this.  I ordered this brand in both the roll-on and the stick.  I tried the stick first.  After 3 months (the directions and reviewers say to give it a few months), I wasn't seeing any difference.  So I started the roll-on.  It started working within a week!  Woo hoo!  I am SO glad to have found this.  I still sweat at night, but not under my arms.The only issue I have with this is that it makes my armpits itch.  But you put this on at night and the itching is not so unbearable that I can't sleep.  Then, in the morning I put some soothing lotion on and the itching stops for the day.  Also, after many months of use, I don't need to put this on every night.

"Bought this for my sons to attach to their wallets so they can clip it to their pants in case it falls out of their pockets (a common problem both my boys, ages 13 and 16, seem to have).  It's perfect for the job!  Our only wish is that it would be shorter.  If you don't like the chain hanging out of your pocket (down past the end of their t-shirts), as my boys don't, then you need to stuff the entire chain into the pocket which is a bit bulky.  I will go to the hardware store and have them cut the chains.  Then we'll just re-attach the split ring to the shorter length and it will be perfect.  It would be nice if this came in several lengths though, because I can see how this longer length would be good if you were using this item to clip keys to your pants, purse, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LTK8L4XHEN86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RI4USU#wasThisHelpful","R2LTK8L4XHEN86","A2PXVMF9DH8NDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PXVMF9DH8NDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought this for my 16-year-old son.  He really likes the scorpion!  He added a grommet and chain so it won't fall out of his pocket (something that apparently happens often to him).  This wallet is a bit thicker than the nylon/velcro one he had before, but I couldn't find a nylon wallet with a coin pocket (which he wants) that he liked.  So, I go this.  It is very difficult to find a men's wallet with a coin pocket.  This wallet has a small pocket that snaps closed.  He puts his coins in there.  It also has a zippered area along the back inside of the wallet.  It runs the length of the entire wallet.  Good for putting things you want to be more secure, but not really good for coins as getting them out is difficult.  Another thing he likes about this wallet is that it has 2 clear slots, 1 for his driver's license and 1 for his school I.D., rather than just 1 like most wallets.  The only negative is that this is a bit thick, but I think, since it is leather, that it will ""smash"" down and conform to how he uses it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N6JLGC6ZJD8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTRXHZQ#wasThisHelpful","R1N6JLGC6ZJD8X","A2PXVMF9DH8NDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PXVMF9DH8NDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are NOT Grommets!  They are Eyelets.  The word ""grommets"" should not be in the title.  It is misleading.  Grommets are installed with 2 pieces, a front and a back, and you ""hammer"" the top piece down around the back piece.  Eyelets are one piece, you just ""hammer"" the back side down.

"I wanted a fire pit because both of my sons, ages 13 and 15, will be having parties on consecutive weekends in a few weeks. I wasn't sure exactly how this worked, compared to more expensive, fancy, above ground fire pits, with lids, etc. Well, this is just fine. It isn't fancy, but you can make it nice. It comes in 4, ¼-circle pieces, that you put together using black hardware (screws, etc) that it also comes with. We dug a hole down into the ground and put this in. We then put some river rocks that we have as landscaping in the bottom and layered some extra flagstone that we had left over from when she had a patio put in, around the top. We infilled the flagstone with sand. It looks great! I covered some square cushions with cool outdoor fabric to set around it. Voila! Instant awesome fire pit! The kids will be roasting marshmallows and having fun listening to music. I bought some packets that you sprinkle on the fire to make it change colors, for added fun, too, though you are not allowed to cook food over the chemicals. I think the kids will enjoy this. I am very pleased with this affordable fire pit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I2Y4YD2SFOA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4LKWBK#wasThisHelpful","R2I2Y4YD2SFOA2","A2PXVMF9DH8NDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PXVMF9DH8NDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought 3 of these (which is less expensive than buying the 3-pack) and LOVE them.  They are very well made.  The sticks are nice and straight and it's a nice standard popsicle shape.  I only have one issue and that is that these forms did not come with any directions or explanations.  Are they dish washer safe?  Well, I took a risk and washed them on the top rack of my dishwasher and apparently, they are dishwasher safe.  Also, I found it extremely difficult to remove the blue plastic and metal lid after freezing.  I was hesitant to run hot water over it, because I didn't want too much of the popsicle to melt.  But after trying pretty much everything I could think of and not being able to get the lid off, I ran it quickly under hot water.  That made the difference.  the lid popped right off with the popsicles and sticks still in it.  Then I had to jiggle each pop a bit to get if off the lid.I am making a bunch for an end-of-summer party, and I took a previous reviewers advice and wrapped them in wax paper and put them in a zip lock bag to store.  This is perfect, as the ""re-""frozen pops ('cause they melt a bit while you're taking them out of the form) don't stick to the wax paper.

"After reading previous reviews, I did follow the directions and put down a nice black bottom coat of polish.  I then applied 2 layers of this polish.  I did not get the results I was hoping for.  In the picture, this looks like a black polish with burghandy/plum sparkles.  Well, the photographer must have shone a red light on it when taking the picture, or enhanced it.  Because, what I got was a mostly black polish with a few sparkles that sometimes (rarely) look plum, burghandy, or reddish.  I am very disappointed.  I am in my 40's and wanted something that looks like the picture, with plum sparkles and highlights.  When I was on my 20's, I would have been OK with this for going clubbing at night.On the other hand, this is a nice quality polish that goes on fairly smoothly, when compared to other glitter/sparkle-comtaining polishes which are often rough or bumpy to the touch.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15ZE5BGHATSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FOAN1GG#wasThisHelpful","R15ZE5BGHATSF","A2PXVMF9DH8NDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PXVMF9DH8NDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very timely book given the current discussions of race going on in the country right now. It opens in the years before the Civil War on a small plantation in Alabama. It is owned by Katherine Winthrop but she defers to her husband in its running. He is not a very nice man for many a reason but it is time when women were not considered smart enough to do anything but look pretty.Katherine has a daughter, Evie, and is friendly with her house slave Delly. Delly cares for Essie a child of the plantation. These four female voices tell the story in alternating chapters. Usually this aggravates me but Ms. Muriel writes in four such distinct voices I felt like I was in the space with each one.Essie and Evie are born on the same night but into very different lives. That doesnâ€™t stop them from finding each other and becoming friends. Life becomes complicated and dangerous as the South secedes and war enters their world. Soon the girls find themselves fleeing the plantation they have always known for Richmond and life changes for them in ways they never could have imagined.I was pulled into this book from the very first chapter where Essie introduced herself. She is an unforgettable character who is far ahead of her time. In fact all of the characters are very well drawn and uniquely interesting. Itâ€™s not always an easy story to read but it is exceptionally well written and it was very hard to put down.

"I love stories that take place in Ancient Rome. This is a little bit later in Romeâ€™s history than I usually read but it was still fascinating to look at the period through different eyes; those of female gladiators. Apparently there were indeed such fighters as Rome fell into its decline. As the Emperors looked for more exotic entertainments for the arena.Two women from opposite ends of the Roman Empire end up as slaves of the same man; Afra from Kush and Cinnia from Britain. Their stories are similar in that they were warriors in their home countries until disaster befalls them and now they find themselves owned by a man who wants to use them as entertainment. In their common circumstance they find comfort, friendship and love.It was truly interesting to visit this time period through the eyes of these characters. They are both strong, unique and well drawn. Itâ€™s great to have a book centering around female characters in Ancient times. Yes, it is also their love story but it is not overly graphic. I was fascinated to learn in the authorâ€™s note that female gladiators were a part of this time.

"I am generally not a big reader of murder mysteries but once in a blue moon one will tickle my fancy. When offered Farmed and Dangerous I was intrigued by the setting of this novel â€“ a farm! Of course I would enjoy a tale such as this, right? This is part of a series of cozy mysteries â€“ no blood, no gore â€“ involving Cam Flaherty and the denizens of her small town.In this volume Cam is again caught up in a murder mystery when someone at the local Assisted Living Facility is found dead after eating a meal made with vegetables and other products from her farm. This woman, Bev Montgomery, was an unpleasant woman and she and Cam had a difficult relationship. To cap things off Camâ€™s boyfriend is the state police officer investigating and since she is â€œperson of interestâ€ they canâ€™t see each other until the case is solved.I really enjoyed the farm discussions and the sections about the different vegetables and how to grow things organically. It almost felt like I was in the middle of a conversation with my husband. Books like this are not meant to be deep and thoughtful but rather to be fluffy and entertaining and this one succeeds on that point.

"This was a departure for me â€“ Iâ€™ve been writing that a fair bit lately in my book reviews. Itâ€™s been the summer of stretching my reading muscles.  I wanted to read it because I find wolves fascinating; Iâ€™m in the minority in my corner of the world. Most of the people here want to eliminate them but a pack has moved in across the river and listening to them howl at night is awesome.Sadly, The Wolf Border is more about people than wolves. In that I was disappointed as the synopsis led me to believe I was getting a wolf story. While the wolves are central to the story they are not really the focus â€“ Rachel and a very unexpected change in her life are. Itâ€™s going to be hard to write this without giving too much away but Rachel is a well educated zoologist working on a reservation in Idaho studying wolf behavior when she is presented with the opportunity to return home to England to help a rich Earl reintroduce wolves to that country. At first she is resistant but as life throws her a curve ball she takes him up on the offer and returns home .The book is written without quotation marks and this drove me a little bit bonkers as you sometimes could not tell where conversations started and ended. Beyond this the writing was very compelling. I read the book in one day because I really didnâ€™t want to put it down. Despite the story being more about people than wolves I really enjoyed it. I would have liked more about the animals but it was still a very good story.I received a free copy for my honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1201LB3WO8WUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062208470#wasThisHelpful","R1201LB3WO8WUI","A3FI4OAOQYQWHH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FI4OAOQYQWHH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book takes place in an era and area you donâ€™t often see represented in books; the time of the Rus in the era of the Mongol (13th century/Ukraine, Belarus, Russia). It is narrated by a young princess of the Rus, Sofia and she is a vibrant and very likable character. Her life is all a young woman of privilege could ask. But there is danger on the horizon as her father is facing the advancement of the Mongols into his kingdom.He sends Sofia away to be safe but she is capture by the men he fears the most and her life is turned upside down. Suddenly she is a slave to the Mongol leader â€“ her innocence taken and finding herself living in a camp where she doesnâ€™t understand the language or the way of life. But instead of letting her circumstances get the best of her Sofia instead sets out to make the best of her situation. She learns all she can about her captor and the others in the camp and she tries to instill a bit of humanity into a very inhumane group of raiders.This novel is based in history and I found it to be rather fascinating. It took me a bit to become engaged but once I did I found it hard to put down. Ms. Hazell has a way of bringing the 13th century to life and I did feel immersed in that world. The historical detail is well woven into the story and it really brings the Mongol camp alive. Where it falls a little bit short is in the interactions between people â€“ dialog is not the strong suit here but donâ€™t let it deter you from a really wonderful novel. Itâ€™s the first in a trilogy and Iâ€™m going to enjoy following Sofia on her adventures.I received a free ecopy for my honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBF5BUXBWH5LW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1475213085#wasThisHelpful","RBF5BUXBWH5LW","A3FI4OAOQYQWHH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FI4OAOQYQWHH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a richly illustrated novella (I will note that I did have a hardback that I won several years ago) about Filomena, a young woman growing up in 16th century Venice. She is living with her sister, one of the cities most famous courtesans. Her sister Tullia keeps her very isolated â€“ she doesnâ€™t want her to suffer as she has.  But Filomena is growing up, she is getting curious. She wants to get out of the gilded cage she feels confined in. Of course every 16 year old girl knows everything and so Filomena seeks to find a way out.She thinks that perhaps her voice is her saviour but then she meets a handsome young man and he makes her a different kind of offer but his family has other ideas for his future that donâ€™t include the sister of a courtesan. But he is not deterred he asks Filomena to follow him down The Loverâ€™s Path.This was a sweet story full of love and loss and the passion of youth. Tullia is not at first a very sympathetic character but as her story comes to light. The novella is written in Filomenaâ€™s voice as as a memoir of sorts. It is  part of a museum dedicated to her â€“ all part of a delightful fiction created by the author to place the book in its time.

"This was a book that really pulled at my emotions â€“ on many levels. The history of the potato famine and what it did to the people of Ireland is well known. The British raped that country for what it could produce and let the citizens starve. The rich took what they wanted and damn the poor â€“ it must be their fault somehow. Sound familiar? But Iâ€™m not ranting on todayâ€™s politics but rather reviewing a very well written book that delivers the history and the humanity with equal aplomb.Kathleen awaits the return home of her fiance but he fails to come back on the ship with her brother. As the potato crop continues to fail itâ€™s Kathleen that is sent to find work to send money home. She figures at the same time she can try and find what happened to her love but all does not turn out as she plans. She ends up shipwrecked and rescued by of all things, an Englishman. A man of the country she hates to the bottom of her soul. But he does her many a kindness and alters her thinking that all Englishmen are bad. She ends up in Boston where the Irish are not appreciated and finds her new life very difficult.This was a book that drew me in from the very first page. I had the worst time putting it down. Ms. Ford just drew me into the world she created and her characters truly came to life. It was a horrible time in history for the Irish (confession â€“ Iâ€™m half Irish) and they suffered at home and abroad when they tried to find new lives. This is all represented in the book with a very well defined plot and strong character development.4,5I received a free copy for my honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18WA5Q2RZG1DL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990594211#wasThisHelpful","R18WA5Q2RZG1DL","A3FI4OAOQYQWHH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FI4OAOQYQWHH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had no knowledge of the whole YouTube thing that goes along with this YA novel. I am certainly not the demographic that this book is targeting but Iâ€™ll be honest â€“ I really enjoyed it. Itâ€™s far out of my usual reading world but sometimes when I take a chance like this Iâ€™m richly rewarded. Itâ€™s funny, as a rule I tend to really not like paranormal stories but some of my favorite books fall into that realm. Goes to show that you should pigeonhole your reading.Sunshine is a 16 year old girl who moves with her mother from sunny Austin, Texas, to wet and dreary Ridgemont, Washington. The house her mother finds is, as Sunshine calls it, creepy. Soon after moving in she hears things; laughter, giggling and soon starts seeing other manifestations of a ghost. Her mother doesnâ€™t believe her and thinks that Sunshine is just trying to whine her way back to Texas. She sets out to prove to her mother that the ghost exists by taking photos but her mother is experiencing some other issues about which Sunshine has no idea.I was drawn into this story immediately. The character of Sunshine is so realistically drawn and just such a teenager â€“ a little precocious, a little ahead of her time, a little stubborn and a little unsure of her place in the world. She is trying to figure out what is wrong in her house and ultimately what is wrong with her mother while not really understanding why it is all happening to her. She has a friend to help her along the way but even when presented with (her) reality she canâ€™t believe it.The book is written for a teenage audience but it did keep me interested. The other characters are as well developed and interesting as Sunshine and I am looking forward to the next installment.4.5I received a free copy for my honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB5VCE8H76E1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1602862729#wasThisHelpful","RB5VCE8H76E1","A3FI4OAOQYQWHH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FI4OAOQYQWHH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a hard weekâ€™s reading for me â€“ I had somehow ended up with two books dealing with domestic violence in quick succession. Itâ€™s odd how that happens sometimes. When I accept books for review itâ€™s often months in advance and I have no idea how they really land in my schedule. Itâ€™s not an easy subject to read about.Heavy Weather tells the story of Annie Mac, a woman who has made some mistakes in her life but the greatest is marrying Roy, a very violent man. He lives in a world all of his own and he is king of that world.Annie Mac is living in Beaufort, trying to make a life for herself and her two children when Roy comes barging in with fists flying. He wants his daughter and he is not going to let anyone get in his way. He leaves Annie in a bloody, broken pile but canâ€™t find Katie â€“ her older brother has hidden her well. With her last conscious words Annie asks Hannah, a neighbor, to care for the kids until sheâ€™s better. This leads to a a circle of comfort that Annie could never have imagined.The book is told in alternating chapters â€“ this conceit is getting very old. It seems most of the books I have read lately are doing this. â€“ in the voices of different characters including Royâ€™s. In this manner the reader learns about the circle of people who are helping Annie Mac survive her attack and find Roy to make him face justice.She has trouble accepting and trusting at first but soon realizes that there is kindness in the world. But Roy still lurks. Will law enforcement get to him before he hurts Annie again?This was a book full of friendship, love, suspense and relationships. I am not usually drawn to this type of book but I found myself really enjoying this tale (other than the alternating chapter thing.) It moved right along and the characters were well developed. Iâ€™d go back to Beaufort to revisit these characters again.*I received a free copy for my honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YSLXRB6JUP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TTB3DTG#wasThisHelpful","R1YSLXRB6JUP0","A3FI4OAOQYQWHH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FI4OAOQYQWHH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am so very torn with this book; itâ€™s really two stories in one as the author ties the present to the past by way of the town in which the novel takes place. The book alternates chapters between the story of Sarah Brown, daughter of the abolitionist John Brown and Eden, a woman living in the current era who likes to whine.I loved the chapters that shared the story of Sarah Brown. This brilliant young woman was unknown to me and Iâ€™m glad that Iâ€™ve now learned about her. Iâ€™m going to try and find something else to read about her. She was strong in her convictions at a time when it was very dangerous to hold them. Ms. McCoy really brings her to life as she grows from a child to a woman.On the other hand Eden, a fictional character doesnâ€™t come across as well. She is selfish and only concerned with how the world has wronged her. Her way of dealing with life just doesnâ€™t ring true to me. I really didnâ€™t care about the chapters that took place in the present. I couldnâ€™t connect to any of the characters in this half of the book.  They all seemed a little one note where the historical characters were far more developed.I appreciate the intent to tie the past to the present but for me it just didnâ€™t work. I would have been happier reading a fictionalized tale of Sarah Brown and her life without all of the bits of this and that brought in from the future.I received a free copy for my honest reviewRating:  Sections in the past 5, sections in the present 2.

"I have a raging fascination with the history of religions so when presented with books, fiction or non fiction, I dive right in. The historical fiction tomes send me off to the google to figure out the reality from the story but when it comes to a sect like the Cathars who tried to co-exist with the might and power of the Catholic Church at the height of its reign well â€“ we all know that history is written by the victors and what they write is often skewed.  So what do we really know about this band of religious rebels? Not nearly enough to truly understand them but certainly enough to create a novel worth reading.The author admits in his note that he extrapolates from history and from what I could learn he does play a little fast and loose with timelines and real people but that is the purview of â€œpoetic licenseâ€ I suppose. The book is part love story part war story as Pope Innocent III embarks on the destruction of a sect he feels is a danger to his power base.The book is well written with engaging characters. Thereâ€™s a lot of war and the subsequent description thereof but you canâ€™t have war without it now can you?

"If you follow my book reviews you know that â€œfamily dramasâ€ set in the modern era are generally not what I tend to read. There was just something about this bookâ€™s synopsis that piqued my interest; I think that it was the setting in Nicaragua. I donâ€™t know much about the culture of any of the countries south of us and Iâ€™m always looking to be educated a bit when I read a book. This one was very enjoyable â€“ I read it on my flights from Missoula to Nashville and it made the time pass very quickly. Even when my butt was flying out of the seat due to turbulence.It is the story (stories?) of three women in one family â€“ grandmother, daughter and granddaughter and itâ€™s told in alternating voices. The grandmother, Isabela cared for her granddaughter, Maria in Miami after fleeing Nicaragua during the revolution. Mariaâ€™s mother, Ninexin was a revolutionary who lost her husband when Maria was only 4 months old. They tell their tales in alternating chapters and while there is not much change in writing style between the three you can get a definite sense of their personalities from how they present their aspect of the ongoing story.Of the three women I have to admit that it was Isabela I liked the most. Maria did not resonate with me at all. I seem to read a fair number of books with characters like her; wishy-washy, unsure of her lifeâ€™s path, unsure of what to do about the man in her life. A still trying to figure it all out at 33 kind of girl. (Her boyfriend was a bit of a tough character for me as well.) I just donâ€™t understand these characters but they must be popular if I keep running into them. Itâ€™s probably because I am not old enough to be a grandmother (did I just type that?!) and of a completely different generation than these kids today.Despite not being able to relate to Maria her third of the book was integral to the tale and I did enjoy the book. It held  a couple of good surprises that were revealed as the book reached its conclusion. The descriptions of the cities and towns in Nicaragua were very well written and I did enjoy learning a little bit about the culture of the country and its history.*I received a free copy for my honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KLJ0NAP1TI1P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250058643#wasThisHelpful","R3KLJ0NAP1TI1P","A3FI4OAOQYQWHH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FI4OAOQYQWHH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hadnâ€™t realized when I accepted this book for review that it was a young adult novel â€“ I do read them I just didnâ€™t take particular note when reading the synopsis. This tale of mystery, murder, song and romance takes place in Venice. Our heroine, Isabella, has a remarkable singing voice and longs to sing in public. Her singing teacher, Margherita, has a magical voice and a history. Not to mention a very handsome son, Rafaele. Margherita has never told her son who his father is. She gives him a special gift and promises to tell him his parentage but the next night she is found murdered.Secrets abound in this story and for an adult reader most of them are easy to discern but a younger reader would be intrigued by the breadcrumbs left by the author as Isabella tries to help Rafaele find who killed his mother and then help him get out of serious trouble.It is a sweet tale with a few twists and turns along the way to keep the young reader very engaged. The time period was complicated for political and religious reasons and Ms. McMahan weaves the necessary information into her story well. The ugly aspects of history are handled discretely enough so that they wonâ€™t offend sensitive readers.

"This was not a happy book. That does not mean it wasnâ€™t a good book because it was â€“ at least I thought so. It covers a very dark topic and it is never easy to read about domestic abuse. The story follows three sisters and their mother as they come together to deal with the father who is in a coma. The youngest, Sonya left home many years ago and has refused to come back home but the call from her mother that her father is dying brings her back. Her elder sister Marin is in an arranged marriage with a daughter and seems to be living a perfect life, the middle daughter Trisha seems to have the perfect marriage but all is not as it seems. The three girls disagree on how to deal with their past and all of them donâ€™t know everything.The book unfolds in alternating chapters â€“ the three girls and their mother all share different pieces and it goes back and forth between the present and the past. It was sometimes difficult to remember who was narrating as there was not much difference in voice. Marinâ€™s daughter does play a pivotal role in the story but she does not become a narrator.I cannot say that I enjoyed the book due to its subject matter but it was a book that held my interest and it truly pulled at my emotions.

"This book intrigued for its mix of science, religion, mystery and what might be. It started with a trip to Israel to fulfill the final wishes of Rose Strongin, a scientist, a marine biologist, who was working at the Sea of Galilee in 1974 when she was late back and it caused her to miss her flight which turned out to be fortuitous as that plane explodes and all are killed. Rose never explains why she was late and it causes issues in her life and her marriage.The family that comes together in the present to lay Rose to rest are a mixed bunch; Nathan, the baby is resentful of his father feeling that he knows all that there is to know about his parents marriage and his father is wrong. The two girls have their roles and are more aware of the frailties of both of their parents. All of these feelings come to the fore as they all are together for the first time in quite a while to put their mother to rest.The reader gets to know Rose through a serious of flashbacks in and out of different periods of her past. She is a fascinating well developed character and I loved her struggle with science and otherworldliness (is that a word?) The other characters in the book are equally as well developed. Mr. Kitsakos is also very good at bringing a place to life and setting a mood. This is not a simple book; it will leave you thinking for days after you finish it.

"I readily admit to an appalling ignorance of American history.  My fascination has always been European history and I do most of my pleasure reading in stories that take place long in the past in England, France or Italy. Iâ€™ve gone on jags of reading on topics of American History â€“ just ask me about the Civil War or the Mormons â€“ but for the most part it just doesnâ€™t interest me but once in a blue moon a book will pique my interest. For whatever reason this tale of the taking of iron ore out of Minnesota called to me. There is no understanding what I readâ€¦.That being written â€“ this book was really fascinating. I believe because it was all so new to me and so very well written I found myself completely lost in the story. Itâ€™s really not at all as dry as it sounds. The characters are well developed and darn interesting. The conflict between the white immigrants and the Native Americans was very real and it caused issues all over the country as we well know from history.It was a time for dreamers and for making money. It was a time when if you worked hard you really could achieve the American Dream. At least as it was manifesting in this time period. These men who brought their ideas to fruition were thought to be crazy but they believed.

"I found the premise of this non-fiction book to be rather compelling. I have to be honest â€“ I never really gave much thought to the personnel that keep the White House running. These maids, florists, chefs, electricians and others are not paid extravagantly yet they are privy to the personal side of the First Family occupying the house.I did find parts of the book very interesting and I donâ€™t want to give too much away. The people who agree to these jobs are a rare breed; loyal, discreet and very hard working. Many of them stay in their jobs for decades despite long hours and erratic schedules. They all serve at the pleasure of the President as the saying goes. Many of them maintain their loyalties to all of the families they served and didnâ€™t want to talk to the author.  We learn that early on in the book and it is reiterated â€“ a lot. This was my biggest problem with the book, there was  a lot of repetition. One story would appear in several different chapters woven into different narratives but how many times can you read the same facts? It was almost as if the book were a compilation of essays with minimal editing. I did read an advanced reader copy so I donâ€™t know if perhaps changes were made before final printing.The writing style is easy to read and there were many interesting stories in the book and I did learn a bit about what it takes to keep the White House running.

He discovered the two different types and was anxious to try the ceremonial matcha as he had heard it to be superior to the culinary. He tried the Midori Spring Organic and was very impressed. He said he loved the light, bright true green tea flavor of this product. It was a vibrant, spring green color and powdery as a good quality ceremonial grade matcha is supposed to be.

"I have read several of Mr. Krakauerâ€™s books and have found all of them to be page turners. In fact after reading Under the Banner of Heaven I went on a year long reading spree about the Mormons and their history. He just has such an easy writing style. I went into this latest book with a bit of trepidation due to the subject matter but I wanted to see how he covered the material, after all this is my home now. All of the stories of which he writes blew up shortly after we settled here. I read the stories in the news with shock and disgust and who wouldnâ€™t? But what really shocked me was some of the comments in response to the stories that immediately assumed the young ladies were lying because why would these football players need to behave that way â€“ they were Griz and the Griz could do no wrong. Missoula loves its athletes and its football players in particular.The book details several different incidents and details them in all of their horror; nothing sensational in the telling, just the facts but those facts are at times very hard to read. Then the young women go to the justice system for help and find  themselves suffering another type of assault. From police officers not offering support to prosecutors that just donâ€™t seem to care they are left with nowhere to turn while their alleged attackers go on as if nothing is wrong. And that I think was the scariest thing I took from the book â€“ in many cases these young men who perpetrate these acts honestly do not think they have done anything wrong. They think it is perfectly acceptable to have sex with an unconscious woman.There are many more facts and studies woven through the narrative as the chosen stories come to their conclusions. I think itâ€™s an important book for everyone to read. Many people from this area are upset at the title but these stories, sadly happen all over the country and Iâ€™m sure Mr. Krakauer could have written a similar book for every college town. He just happened to land here in Montana and follow some of the rape cases here. The Department of Justice did come into to Missoula for an investigation so there was definitely a problem.  The police department and the university worked with them to create a better environment for assault victims. The county attorneyâ€™s office was not as cooperative with the DOJ at the beginning but ultimately came to an agreement. Itâ€™s all outlined in the book and it makes for a good read.Of course it would have been better if there had not been a need to write this book but there was. Itâ€™s not a perfect book but itâ€™s a good book. It will make you angry and it will make you think.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIQXT0YBZMHS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538731#wasThisHelpful","RIQXT0YBZMHS2","A3FI4OAOQYQWHH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FI4OAOQYQWHH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am having a hard time writing this review. I loved the writing in this book. I enjoyed the story of young Aurore and her life in Nohant. I also enjoyed the time in Paris when Aurore had left her husband to try and find herself as a writer. What I didnâ€™t like and it really impacted my overall enjoyment of the book was the way the author went back and forth in time with little logic. I would just be settling in to enjoy the story and BOOM the chapter would end and Iâ€™d find myself either backward or forward in time and in a totally different location. It was very distracting and a lot confusing. It completely took away from the book to the point that at times I just put it down and read something else because I was so frustrated.That being written there was a good story here. I didnâ€™t know that much about George Sand before I went into this novel and I have come out of reading it wanting to know more. I figure that I is always a good thing. She was a woman in a time that expected its women to stay home and have children. Aurore had a passion for more. She felt that there had to be more to life than the one she was living in the country and she took a huge leap to leave her family to pursue that passion. She lived a wild life â€“ that is for sure.Ms. Berg has written an interesting book about a fascinating woman. I just didnâ€™t enjoy the way she chose to put it together. Others may feel differently. I just didnâ€™t like the way the book moved through time.3.5I received a free copy for my honest review","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R7JDHK78TSDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812993152#wasThisHelpful","R2R7JDHK78TSDI","A3FI4OAOQYQWHH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FI4OAOQYQWHH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a delightful escape from the heavier books I have been reading â€“ I really needed it. Our young vicar wants more from his life than being assigned to a small community in England but that is where he is sent. He figures heâ€™ll do his job in hopes of transfer and then heâ€™ll get his life of adventure. He didnâ€™t count on Cecelia. Nor did she figure on young William.Ceceliaâ€™s mother has grand plans for her daughter that do not include her marrying some vicar that has just turned up in the village no matter how attractive her daughter might find him. She wants her to marry into the ruling family of Amberly â€“ even if Cecelia finds the match boring at best. To her William is the only man who has understood her spirit. But does she want the life he has to offer? And does he want to give up his dreams of adventure to settle down in this little town?This was a fast and engaging read full of all of the quirky characters you would expect to find in a small village in Regency England. And we all love a will she/wonâ€™t she type of romance now and again. There must, of course, be a requisite bad guy and he is the only character that doesnâ€™t fully develop but itâ€™s a small complaint in an otherwise wonderful read. I really enjoyed Cecelia and William â€“ they are a delightful pair and they gave me a respite I needed.

"I have to state that I enjoy books that tell the stories of lesser known women in history. A Pledge of Better Times does exactly that by weaving the story of Diana de Vere from snippets of her left in correspondence and other written sources. We meet her when she is still a child and she encounters King Charles II and he introduces her to his three sons by different mistresses. She is the daughter of the Earl of Oxford, a close friend of the king but a noble without a fortune. Soon Charles dies and the kingdom is thrown into disarray as his brother James takes the thrown and the religious issues that all thought were settled soon rear their ugly head. Within in the framework of history young Diana de Vere comes of age and marries one of Charlesâ€™ bastards, Charles Beauclerk, Duke of St. Albans.Complicated history leads to compelling story possibilities and this book was a really good read. It is based solidly in reality as these two characters existed and followed the paths laid down in the book. Ms. Porter brings them to life with with rich detail and a relationship that stood the tests thrown in its way. I was quite taken with both Diana and Charles and found myself rooting for both of them as I read the book. Charles II is always an entertaining monarch so any story with him even as an ancillary character is going to be a fun book.I found that I really didnâ€™t want the story to end. I wanted to continue on with their story and to go on in their lives and the lives of their children. It is written beautifully and full of historical detail. This is not a period I wander into that often so it was nice to visit this period of English history again.4.5I received a free copy for my honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP0A1LXUX8SO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990742040#wasThisHelpful","RP0A1LXUX8SO3","A3FI4OAOQYQWHH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FI4OAOQYQWHH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very sorry to see this excellent series reach its end. I suppose it had to happen sometime but I have to admit to being sad to see these characters find the end of their literary lives. Although there is a bit of a teaser at the end of the book indicating the possibility of short stories to come so cross your fingers fans! Iâ€™ve read all of the books in the series but the first â€“ although I do have it on my tablet. I just havenâ€™t had the time to read it!In this book Alex and Matthew head back to where it all began â€“ Scotland. Matthewâ€™s brother Luke is grateful for the saving of his son so he has sent Matthew a letter giving him back the family home. Since Matthew was forced to leave a country he loved he wants to go back to what he considers home. Alex does not want to go. She doesnâ€™t completely trust Luke, she knows the political situation in Scotland is not good and she doesnâ€™t want to spend all of that time on a ship. Of course all does not go as planned while they are there and they soon receive word that danger lurks back in Maryland so they start the journey back to Maryland.At the heart of all of these tales is family â€“ for good or for bad. Alex has tumbled through time because of her motherâ€™s artwork and that questionable talent has been passed to Alexâ€™s son. He finds himself painting his way to Alexâ€™s time and trying to get back to his own but she has a real disconnect to this first son of time to which she does not belong. Itâ€™s an oddity to a character that loves her children so fiercely. For she does love and love strongly â€“ it is what drives her; love for her husband and her children. Without that there really would be no stories.As with the other books in the series I found myself turning page after page until suddenly there were no more to turn which led to a real letdown. Especially as there will be no more adventures for this couple. Ms. Belfrage can really bring a time period and a world to life and as a reader you find yourself lost in time, much like her protagonist. Itâ€™s not a bad thing at all â€“ especially since you can still take a hot shower at the end of the day.4.5I received a free copy for my honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYBCP1TYR8ZIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781322430#wasThisHelpful","RYBCP1TYR8ZIF","A3FI4OAOQYQWHH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FI4OAOQYQWHH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do love early English history. Many of the books Iâ€™ve read from that time period focus more on the kings and many have told the tale of Harold, Godwineâ€™s son and the last Anglo Saxon king of England but this is the first book Iâ€™ve read that has told the story of Godwine. And told that story for the sake of Godwine not as a back drop to Haroldâ€™s tale.It starts when Godwine is just a young boy and finds a warrior lost in his woods. Even at such a young age he figures out how to take the best advantage of a situation which shows off the sharp wit and intelligence that would carry him through his life as he befriends and becomes important to the Danish King Canute and ultimately becomes the first Earl of Wessex. He walks a fine line throughout his life making decisions that sometimes seem questionable.I dove right in to Godwineâ€™s tale â€“ in fact I read this book in a day. Ms. Rochelle does an excellent job of bringing the reader into Godwineâ€™s world whether he is in that forest with a lamb or on a ship at sea. A great man has been create and brought to life from the scraps left to history.

"Dark, gritty and inventive, I was drawn to this book by itâ€™s premise--robots and humans living together uneasily under Antarctic domes. Throw in a ruined amusement park, exploitation by â€œmainlandersâ€ back in South America, and the fact that the robots are evolving and there was no way I could resist. The world-building is fantastic, but what kept me from loving this story more is the writing style. The author is known for her YA books, but for my taste she tried too hard to make this an â€œadultâ€ book--though it may be that I just donâ€™t enjoy noir fiction.Thereâ€™s not a scrap of humor--no ironic self-reflection by any of the characters and no moments of comic relief--which for me gave it a sort of wooden melodramatic tone that kept me more disengaged from the characters than I would have liked.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PMB4EJIDBNYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481444263#wasThisHelpful","R3PMB4EJIDBNYH","A32EOHLFZYXJEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EOHLFZYXJEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you wanted to create a character for your novel or play, youâ€™d be hard-pressed to come up with someone as interesting and story-worthy as Englandâ€™s Elizabeth I. After her mother, Anne Boleyn, was beheaded Elizabeth was declared a bastard, but she continued with her rigorous education and the hardships she experienced as a result of her demotion helped make her politically savvy, a trait that saved her neck more than once and ultimately put her on the throne. Iâ€™ve enjoyed several biographies about Elizabeth I, but this one has extras that make it stand out.Lisa Hiltonâ€™s premise is that Elizabeth saw herself as a Renaissance prince, and while Elizabeth was happy to invoke the conventions of courtly females when it suited her, she lived in an age when royal gender was more fluid than we might think now. Hilton spends some time describing the Renaissance era and what being a Renaissance prince would mean, which leads her to a discussion of contemporary literature, period attitudes, and Machiavelli. Elizabethâ€™s relatively long life is covered thoroughly, but more space is given to art analysis, cultural philosophies, and intellectual history than Iâ€™ve read elsewhere, which I found fascinating. Iâ€™ve read other books by Hilton, my favorite being Horror of Love about Nancy Mitford, and I appreciate the broad scope and thoughtful scrutiny she brings to her subjects, this book about Elizabeth being no exception.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3WNEOOP6V5ML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544577841#wasThisHelpful","R3WNEOOP6V5ML","A32EOHLFZYXJEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EOHLFZYXJEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Of all of Queen Victoriaâ€™s nine children, Princess Louise was perhaps the most un-Victorian, making her a very interesting royal to read about. Louise painted and sculpted, hung around with pre-Raphaelites, and was a member of the Aesthetic movement. She also embraced exercise, admired unconventional women like novelist George Eliot, supported womenâ€™s rights when even her libertine brother Bertie believed females should be compliant and submissive, refused to marry a foreign prince, almost certainly had love affairs, and  may have had a child out of wedlock--which is perhaps why more than 75 years after her death the files on Princess Louise at the Royal Archives remain closed and unavailable for researchers, as if there is something about her that is so shocking it still must be hidden. Even with that source restriction, Lucinda Hawksley has put together a fascinating and intriguing account of Princess Louise, and  through her a picture of Britain and its extended royal family from the Victorian age, when her mother was queen, to the dawn of WWI, when her nephew Kaiser Wilhelm was causing trouble in Germany.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BHQDEEBFJ7WP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250059321#wasThisHelpful","R2BHQDEEBFJ7WP","A32EOHLFZYXJEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EOHLFZYXJEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I donâ€™t often become completely engrossed in a book of straight history, usually I read historical biographies to get a sense of the past, but this book was hard to put down. With its detailed and in-depth account of events in the year following WWII, focusing on the causes and early stages of the Cold War, 1946: The Making of the Modern World has the most fascinating account of the mid to late twentieth century that Iâ€™ve read anywhere. Developments are presented chronologically, starting with an early dispute between the US and the Soviets over oil fields in Iran, but because the background and future impact of each event is included this book is much more than a glorified timeline of how WWII allies very quickly became enemies once the war was over.Thoroughly researched, the book is highly readable and written with insight and clarity. Its scope goes well beyond Europe and Japan, also including Indiaâ€™s struggles toward independence, Franceâ€™s attempts to reassert itself in Indochina, the contentious and difficult formations of Israel and Pakistan, colonialismâ€™s dying gasps, and Chinaâ€™s simultaneously occurring communist revolution and war with Japan--one of the many things I learned is that 25% of WWIIâ€™s fatalities were in China, more than any other country except the USSR. Some of the most interesting, even eye-opening, parts are revelations about the thoughts, words, and deeds of political leaders, including Roosevelt, Truman, Churchill, Clement Attlee, Stalin, MacArthur, Hirohito, Mao, Chiang Kai-shek, Mei-Ling Soong, Nehru, Gandhi, Mohammed Ali Jinnah,  David Ben Gurion, and Menachem Begin.If I had any doubts about the difficulties of occupation or the massive extent of devastation, suffering and displacement that continued well after WWII fighting was over, those uncertainties would have been dispelled forever by this book. Because it was years in the making the author was able to interview many people with personal experiences of the time, giving events a human face and adding poignancy and impact to the history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHMQU5DTQGXBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101870427#wasThisHelpful","RHMQU5DTQGXBA","A32EOHLFZYXJEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EOHLFZYXJEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didnâ€™t know much about the 1804 duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr before I read this double biography, but that (of course) didnâ€™t stop me from having an opinion: Hamilton, good; Burr (the â€œvictorâ€), bad. Learning more about them was revelatory and provided some well needed nuance. John Sedgwick takes readers back to the beginnings of each man's life, revealing surprising similarities and stark contrasts. Both men fought in the Revolutionary War, practiced law in New York City, and held political office--Hamilton worked closely with George Washington and was the first Treasury Secretary, while Burr was Vice President during Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s initial term as President. But their contrasts started at birth.Alexander Hamilton was born out of wedlock on a Caribbean island, and then orphaned early and put to work. At twelve he had charge of the Beekman and Cruger shipping business, a job that would have been daunting for most men twice his age. When he was sixteen a ferocious hurricane ravaged the island, but instead of hiding inside Hamilton ventured out to see the storm and then wrote a dramatic account of it for the islandâ€™s newspaper. His literary skills brought him to the attention of Hugh Knox, a local minister, who arranged for Hamilton to be educated in America. Hamilton never returned to the island.Aaron Burr initially led a more privileged life than Hamilton because he was born into a kind of religious dynasty. His father was a minister and the second president of a prestigious New Jersey college that later became Princeton University, and his grandfather was Jonathan Edwards, a Calvinist minister and a leader of the Great Awakening religious revival of the 1730â€™s-40â€™s. Maybe because of his background Burr was driven to accelerate and excel in his studies, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree when he was just sixteen. Burr was a great admirer of early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, and he made sure that his beloved daughter Theodosia was as well educated as any boy.Sedgwickâ€™s penetrating account of the eventually fatal rivalry between the two men provides fascinating insights into the personalities involved and the history of their time. The love lives of several Founding Fathers are laid bare and I was intrigued by deportment differences between Federalists and Republicans. Those supporting the Federalist party made formal bows upon meeting and considered the handshake a vulgar Republican custom. George Washington in particular couldnâ€™t bare to be touched. One man who patted Washington on the shoulder to win a bet deeply regretted it afterwards, being almost undone by Washingtonâ€™s cold stare.Federalists and Republicans even admired different doctors--Republicans preferred old fashioned bleeding and purging styles of medicine while Federalists like Hamilton favored gentler cures with doctors who allowed the body time to heal itself. Americaâ€™s polarized politics have a long history.While I couldnâ€™t understand how he did it, I enjoyed reading about reactions to Hamiltonâ€™s financial alchemy. He somehow managed to turn the countryâ€™s prodigious debt into money that could be invested in things that would help the young nation grow economically, like canals and roads, but Republicans like Thomas Jefferson, who envisioned a society made up of gentlemen farmers, considered the whole business unseemly.Moving, informative, and entertaining, the book takes the story forward many years after the Hamilton/Burr duel, including Burrâ€™s audacious attempt to hijack some Louisiana Purchase lands to found his own republic and ending with Burrâ€™s death in 1836.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R178XRG645COZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592408524#wasThisHelpful","R178XRG645COZO","A32EOHLFZYXJEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EOHLFZYXJEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Annabella Milbanke was still a very young women when she met Lord Byron, but she wasnâ€™t going to throw herself at him the way many others in her set did. Independent, highly intelligent, and well educated, she actually felt a little sorry for the poet. After hearing him complain once about loneliness, she wrote him a letter offering to be his friend, but no more. That started their courtship, but it took several years for Byron to convince her to marry him. Reading about their romance in this fascinating, eye-opening, multi-generational biography, I wanted to leap through the pages, grab her by the shoulders, and shout, â€œNo! Donâ€™t do it!â€ But even after everything that happened in the short time they managed to live together as husband and wife, and all the ways her eyes were eventually opened to the kind of man Bryon really was, it sounds like she didnâ€™t regret her decision to wed the original Byronic â€œheroâ€.My previous encounters with Lord Byron usually left me with a feeling of good-natured indulgence toward him, â€œOh, that crazy poet!â€ But while reading about him in this book I experienced a rising sense of horror--was he rabidly abusive because he was insane, as other members of his family were rumored to have been, was he â€œjustâ€ a cruel, self-indulgent beast of a man warped by a difficult childhood?  Regency era morality may have been part of the problem, but his actions went well beyond even those norms.Byron berated and threatened Annabella from the first days of their marriage. She had no idea then why his behavior toward her changed so quickly, and she didnâ€™t know that part of the reason Byron wanted to marry her was to cover up the incestuous relationship he had with his sister, Augusta Leigh. He also had affairs with many other married women including Annabellaâ€™s aunt, Lady Melbourne, and her sister-in-law, Caroline Lamb. After learning all this Annabella still hoped to â€œsaveâ€ him, but following the birth of their daughter he threw her out, never saw his daughter Ada again, happily used Annabella's family money to fund his expensive eccentric lifestyle and adventures on the Continent--including outfitting a Greek band of freedom fighters--and then died overseas with Annabellaâ€™s name on his lips, unable to complete whatever last message he had for her, leaving her once again distraught.Unknown and surprising to me, Annabella has been castigated and considered a villain by many of Byronâ€™s  biographers, a viewpoint Julia Markus counters forcefully in this book. According to her research many of their facts were wrong, and the â€œgenius excuses crueltyâ€  defense of Byron is a foul argument in any case.After her separation from Byron, Annabella became a politically liberal philanthropist, funding and setting up schools, assisting and advocating for the poor, and opposing slavery. The â€œdaughtersâ€ in  the title refers to both Ada, the brilliant child of Annabella and Byron, but also to Medora, Byronâ€™s daughter by his sister. Medora was a troubled young lady and Annabella unofficially adopted her after she was essentially abandoned by her own mother. Ada became famous because of her computer science insights, long before there were any computers to be had, and she can probably thank her mother for those abilities because Annabella was also drawn to and gifted in mathematics--early in their relationship Byron called Annabella â€œmy Princess of Parallelogramsâ€.In addition to Annabella, her two daughters and her three grandchildren, this multi-person biography also has interesting side trips into into the lives of a number of other notable people of the nineteenth century, including Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wrote Annabellaâ€™s first biography.I was initially put off by the writing style of this book--it felt choppy and sometimes awkward to me--a fact I mention only because that sense didnâ€™t last much longer than the first chapter. If other readers feel the same way and consider putting the book down after a few pages I would advise sticking with it in case their experience continues to mirror mine. I soon became enthralled, so either the writing style changed, or I adjusted to its flow, or there wasnâ€™t much  problem with it to begin with.I read an ebook advanced review copy of this book supplied to me at no cost by the publisher through Edelweiss.

"Every year this is my favorite ""Best American ... Writing"" collection because it's always has an accessible, well written mix of mostly fascinating essays, and 2015 is no exception. I'm fond of birds, so two of of my favorites this year are A Question of Corvids, an article about the intelligent birds in the crow family written by Sheila Webster Boneham and originally published in Prime Number Magazine, and From Billions to None, an article about the now extinct passenger pigeon written by Barry Yeoman and originally published in Audubon.This isn't a book you'd want to sit down an read straight through, but that's not a bad thing. Most of the essays are thought provoking and take a little time to ponder.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EZHUGH7Y7PF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054428674X#wasThisHelpful","R1EZHUGH7Y7PF3","A32EOHLFZYXJEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EOHLFZYXJEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Short but deeply fascinating, this book about Hannah Arendt  covers both her life and the evolution of her thinking in less than 140 pages. It opens with the controversy surrounding her coverage of  the 1961 trial of Nazi officer Adolf Eichmann in Israel, and her pithy but divisive â€œbanality of evilâ€ observation, then cycles back to her turn of the century childhood in Prussia, where her highly educated, politically liberal, religiously agnostic family had established itself several generations previously after leaving czarist Russia.Even as a child it was obvious Arendt possessed a prodigious intellect, but unsurprisingly that did not make her life easy. Her father died when she was seven and she had to flee Nazi Germany as a young woman, resettling first in Paris and later in the United States. Before leaving Germany she studied and had an affair with the Nazi involved philosopher Martin Heidegger, a relationship she had trouble renouncing even as she embraced her Jewish roots more and more avidly.I was drawn right into this book. It was refreshing to read about someone devoted to the life of the mind rather than the pursuit of fame, political power, or wealth. Even though the book is not long it doesnâ€™t feel slight because it plunges right into the heart of Arendtâ€™s life and intellectual development. I have never read a book so copiously footnoted, all the authorâ€™s sources are cited right there in the text, which I appreciate but it did take some initial effort to not be distracted by them.â€œThings looked different after she had looked at them . . . Thinking was her passion, and thinking for her was a moral activity.â€ Philosopher Hans Jonas on Hannah Arendt","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E3QY82QLQ726/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054445619X#wasThisHelpful","R1E3QY82QLQ726","A32EOHLFZYXJEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EOHLFZYXJEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in 1999, cartoonist and writer Jessica Abel  wrote a slim but very interesting graphic novel-like book--maybe youâ€™d call it a nonfiction comic book--about how the radio show This American Life creates its often irresistible stories, stories that lead to â€œdriveway momentsâ€ where youâ€™ve arrived home but canâ€™t get out of the car because you must hear how those stories end. Iâ€™ve treasured my copy of Radio: An Illustrated Guide for years and now Abel has written a greatly expanded update.At 200+ pages Abelâ€™s new book, Out on the Wire: The Storytelling Secrets of the New Masters of Radio, includes other American radio shows with high quality narrative nonfiction, shows like Snap Judgement, Radio Lab, Planet Money, The Moth, 99% Invisible, and Radio Diaries. The people who work on these shows are characters in the â€œstoryâ€ of how they put together their various radio pieces, and Abel uses graphic images in ways that I didnâ€™t expect but that really work well on several levels.She shows herself interacting and  in conversations with many of the radio people she interviewed for the book, creating  dialog and  pictures that give a sense of the personalities involved while also conveying  information about the sometimes varied story processes the shows use--Snap Judgement and This American Life have very different  philosophies for instance. Some of the picture panels are set in radio offices, meeting rooms, or broadcast areas, but Abel also puts her characters in a myriad of other more dramatic locations, including wandering around lost in a dense â€œGerman forestâ€ and scaling a treacherously steep a rock cliff, images that vividly and charmingly illustrate the creative steps the characters are struggling through.Itâ€™s both amazing and fascinating how much goes into making these shows as compelling as they are--it might take hours or even a whole workday to get 20 seconds right. Iâ€™m a big fan of radio, I think itâ€™s natural for a bibliophile to treasure a medium where words play such a key role, so I already loved many of the radio shows in the book but Iâ€™m listening now with a lot more alertness and insight into the techniques behind the finished products.The book is broken into chapters that explore how to: come up with story ideas that will work, find the right characters and voice, structure the storyâ€™s components, use sound and music to create images and scene breaks, and edit hours of tape (they still call it that, even in the digital age) into a tight radio segment. I think anyone interested in radio, the creative process, or what it is that makes stories riveting will find this book as fascinating as I did.I received a free review copy of this book from the publisher through the website LibraryThing.

"Sheâ€™s back! After finishing the third and final novel in Neve Maslakovicâ€™s  Incident trilogy--a brain-tickling, time-traveling, whodunit series--I despaired of ever reading any new stories about unflappable university administrator Julia Olsen again, but sheâ€™s back in a new novelette . .  . and back in time because itâ€™s a prequel.Someone in the university's  biology department is stealing lunches from the common fridge, a minor but awkward crime for a collegial community of learning, and everyone in the time travel department is placing bets on whether or not  physicist Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger owned a pet cat when he came up with his quantum superposition thought experiment  about  a simultaneously alive and/or dead feline. A professor and two graduate students are heading back to 1935 to discreetly locate SchrÃ¶dinger and settle the wagers, but Julia herself doesnâ€™t actually leave the present day in this story since it predates her first trip into History, told in The Far Time Incident.Even though Julia is only able to fantasize about time travel in The Feline Affair, this novelette will give new readers a good sense of the writing style and tone of the series. For those of us whoâ€™ve already enjoyed three full length books, itâ€™s great to be back at  St. Sunniva University, and entertaining  to see earlier versions of characters  weâ€™ve gotten to know well. This series is for readers who like time travel stories peopled with eccentric  academic historian types--it has pervasive but subtle humor, space/time conundrums, adventures in interesting historic eras, and just a light, non-torrid background romance.I read a complimentary ebook copy of this novelette provided by the author with no strings attached.

"Sarah Vowellâ€™s acerbic, insightful wit comes through loud and clear in this fascinating account of French General Lafayette and his role in the American Revolution, but it took me a while to adjust to her irreverent banter in print--as well as being an author Vowell is also known for her radio pieces on This American Life. This book runs almost 270 pages without any chapter breaks, and reads like the long-winded but mesmerizing stand-up routine of a highly knowledgeable, history obsessed comedian who knows how to use humor to make a point.Lafayette was still a teenager when he left his young bride behind and snuck out of France to join the American Revolution against the wishes of his family, but he ended up becoming such a key figure in the winning of the war that cities all over the country are named for him. Vowell has a special knack for revealing the personalities of the many historical figures she writes about, their foibles, revealing quirks, and strengths. Since Lafayette had a close relationship with George Washington he features prominently in the book and I really appreciated getting a clearer picture of the man behind the myth. Vowell even manages to make battles and military strategy interesting, in part by keeping her focus on the people involved, and in part  by not overlooking the missteps or ironies of the situations.Vowell finds plenty of opportunities to relate the struggles of the Revolutionary period to American politics today, pointing out that many current ideological divisions and tendencies have an origin, or at least an analog, dating back to the founding of the country. The book also covers the aftereffects of the Revolutionary War in France and Britain, and the America of 1824, which was when John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson competed in a notorious presidential election and the then elderly Lafayette made a return trip to the country that was still so besotted with him that two thirds of the population of New York City welcomed him ashore. While researching the book Vowell visited historic sites in America and France and she takes readers along on those trips too, giving us her impressions of tourist destinations like Williamsburg and Valley Forge while relating what happened there in the past.In this book Vowell manages the neat trick of being both funny and stirring. She clearly loves history, and she makes it very easy to join her in that passion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR5ZIDLKUH2IX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594631743#wasThisHelpful","RR5ZIDLKUH2IX","A32EOHLFZYXJEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EOHLFZYXJEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Susan Caseyâ€™s Voices in the Ocean made me fall deeply in love with dolphins, those intelligent, highly social mammals of the sea, then tore my heart out by describing the appalling abuses they receive at the hands of our species. Deeply sad after her father died unexpectedly, Casey was in the middle of a perhaps ill advised solo swim across Honolua Bay when she encountered a large pod, forty or fifty animals, of gently chattering spinner dolphins swimming toward her. Instead of just passing by, they swam with her for a while, lifting her spirits almost like magic and setting her on a worldwide dolphin odyssey.Casey traveled to some wonderfully quirky places, like the new-agey Dolphinville on Hawaiiâ€™s Big Island, where 200-some people live, work, meditate, and swim with wild dolphins together. But she also visited marine parks and tourist pleasing â€œswim with the dolphinsâ€ sites, where community-loving dolphins are isolated and kept in slave like conditions, and she connected with dolphin activists in several parts of the world where dolphins are slaughtered in mass numbers, often because itâ€™s believed they eat fish that should be food for people and sometimes, even more horribly, just for spite. Sea pollution and the US Navyâ€™s underwater sonar are other human activities that have had a devastating impact on dolphins.Along the way Casey sought out researchers whoâ€™ve studied dolphins, so the book is a mixture of science, history, personal experience, and social commentary. Itâ€™s beautifully and movingly written, and I especially loved reading about the evolutionary background of dolphins, the special qualities their large brains endow them with, the eons long and mostly wonderful history of human-dolphin interactions, and the fascinating characteristics of dolphin societies--Casey compares them to an ancient tribe.The abuses were painful to read about, but Iâ€™m glad to be better informed. And Casey ends the book on an up note by summarizing what is known about the intriguing, apparently dolphin-loving Minoan civilization and describing her visit to the art-rich Minoan archaeological sites and museums of Santorini and Crete-- Minoan art is both colorful and beautiful, and definitely worth Google-imaging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MY1QTSQHRU9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537301#wasThisHelpful","R2MY1QTSQHRU9X","A32EOHLFZYXJEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EOHLFZYXJEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's always a pleasure spending a few days with Georgie, aka Lady Victoria Georgiana Charlotte Eugenie, one of Queen Victoria's many great-grandchildren and currently (that is in 1934)  thirty-somethingth in line to the throne. Georgie is expected to act Royal, but she doesn't exactly have the funds to pay for such a lifestyle, which in itself leads her into all sorts of scrapes and awkward situations, but she also seems to be a favorite of Queen Mary, who's always giving her assignments--like checking out what that Mrs. Simpson woman is up to for instance--which involves Georgie in all  kinds of investigations and adventures.In this book Queen Mary has asked Georgie to act as a companion for Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, who's the bride-to-be of the Queen's youngest son Prince George. George is something of a wild child whose escapades include intemperate partying, possible drug use,  and amorous exploits that make his brother, the future  Edward VIII, look like a parent-pleasing Puritan, so the Queen wants to ensure that nothing untoward happens to disrupt the scheduled wedding. But the first night Georgie and Marina spend at Kensington Palace, Georgie spots a body in the courtyard. As it's someone who's rumored to be an ex-lover of Prince George the whole thing has to be kept hushed up as much as possible--the princess must not know!--so Georgie and her discreet investigative skills are again put to use.After the last episode in Hollywood it was wonderful to have Georgie back in England, since in this series I prefer class to crass. Georgie's charming Irish fiancÃ©--the elusive penniless Lord Darcy--is in the midst of a police operation that brings him into the story too (hooray!), but there may be changes in their relationship. Georgie's savvy best friend Brenda has troubles of her own this time, Georgie's Cockney, non-royal, ex-police officer grandfather is on hand to give advice, and Georgie's incompetent but loyal maid Queenie is seeing ghosts. . .There's some interesting history in the story this time,  and an author's note at the back of the book fills in more of the real life details. Georgie's part of the story ends with an exciting cliffhanger--I can't wait to see what she gets into next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3054A0FNSOMX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425260380#wasThisHelpful","R3054A0FNSOMX5","A32EOHLFZYXJEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EOHLFZYXJEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This action filled conclusion to Amanda Hockingâ€™s Frostfire trilogy opens with Bryn on the lam, falsely accused of treason and murder, and forced to partner with dangerous and puzzling Konstantin Black who she has good reason not to trust. Iâ€™m a big fan of Hockingâ€™s richly imagined  troll-verse, a world exactly like our own but with the addition of human-resembling trolls based on Scandinavian mythology who love nature, covet gemstones, prefer being barefoot, and live in elaborate out of the way communities, and  Iâ€™ve enjoyed both earlier books in the series, but Crystal Kingdom is my favorite for several reasons.First, while Bryn scrambles to stay one step ahead of the trackers sent to apprehend her, readers are taken on a road trip that stretches from the swamps of Louisiana to the snowy northern reaches of Canada as she visits the home settlements of all five of the troll tribes in her quest to save her own community. Theyâ€™re all trolls, but each group has unique features, abilities, and customs. Weâ€™re even taken to an especially remote and icy dumping ground for outcast trolls, where we meet 14-year-old Ulla who has a mixed tribe background--sheâ€™s part Omte, the super strong tribe that sometimes includes ogres, and part Skojare, the semi-aquatic tribe. Ullaâ€™s parents were unmarried royals who abandoned her as a baby so sheâ€™s working as a maid when Brynn finds her in Iskyla--Iâ€™m really hoping to meet Ulla again in a future troll series.Another reason I loved this book is that several major characters from Hockingâ€™s first troll books, the Trylle series, make major appearances in the story. We had already seen Finn, but now Wendy, plays an important role and itâ€™s wonderful to catch up with her and see how sheâ€™s managed the transition from changeling to queen.Crystal Kingdom is full of other delights, Brynâ€™s friend Tilda proving that being pregnant doesnâ€™t mean sheâ€™s not a formidable fighter for instance, and Brynâ€™s own struggles to reconcile love and duty. Amanda Hocking doesnâ€™t write lyrical prose, but I canâ€™t resist her moving stories, her spirited but conflicted characters, and her inventive settings. There are plenty of books about vampires, fae, witches, and werewolves, but not many about trolls so Iâ€™m hoping that Hocking continues to write about this world.I read a free ebook advanced review copy of Crystal Kingdom, supplied to me by the publisher through NetGalley.

"What happened after Alice went missing down that rabbit hole? Gregory Maguire uses fancy words and elaborately constructed sentences to tell this clever mash-up story peopled with both fantasy characters and real life Victorians, including Charles Darwin. It sounds wonderful but the bouncy cleverness overwhelmed the story for me and the writing style held me at armâ€™s length  because I often had to read sentences more than once. Sometimes more than twice.Itâ€™s well done so Iâ€™m sure most fans of Maguire will enjoy this book, and if you havenâ€™t read any Maguire Iâ€™d suggest reading the sample of After Alice that will be available on Amazon once itâ€™s  released. If you love the beginning, youâ€™ll probably be a fan of the whole book because it continues as it starts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OHP1869FGBXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060548959#wasThisHelpful","R1OHP1869FGBXB","A32EOHLFZYXJEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EOHLFZYXJEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As soon as I read the first few pages of this book, I was hooked.The prose is beautiful, even graceful, without being ornate or fussy and Graham writes his characters, female and male, with clear-eyed but sympathetic insight that reminds me of George Eliot. There are touches of history (the doings of mad King George, the unrest in France, etc.) and humor, but the heart of the story centers on the families--noble and not--of Cornwall. We see their courtships, their marriages, and their home lives, and we travel to the mines, farm fields, and ocean waters where they earn their livings. Itâ€™s a credit to Grahamâ€™s skill as a writer that I was actually interested in the sections on copper mining.In the first chapter of the book--and first episode of the TV series--Ross Poldark returns to Cornwall after fighting with the British in the American Revolution, only to find his father dead, his property in ruins, and his girlfriend engaged to his cousin. Ross is the son of a younger son, and not much interested in the niceties of class and society, making him an appealing character for modern sensibilities. His quick to learn but almost feral kitchen maid Demelza also plays a major role in the story, and so does Elizabeth, his former girlfriend, and his cousins Verity and Francis.The book and the TV show complement each other wonderfully. The gorgeous scenery of the BBC production made my reading pleasure all the more vivid, and the book fills in details that the show has to skim over. The novel also gave me a chance to dwell in the story a little longer--an addictive pleasure. Immediately after finishing the first book I started the second volume in the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R371FHLWZZQRFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003D8V7DK#wasThisHelpful","R371FHLWZZQRFZ","A32EOHLFZYXJEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EOHLFZYXJEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first started reading Emily Hahnâ€™s candid memoir I felt like Iâ€™d walked into the middle of a witty and fascinating conversation that I didnâ€™t quite have the context for. Thereâ€™s a reason for that, when China to Me was first published in 1944 WWII was still going on and the public was already well aware of Emily Hahn and her unconventional somewhat scandalous life, so there were details she could assume people already knew. I was out of that loop, but I soon enough found my footing.Hahn traveled to Shanghai with her sister in 1935, got a writing job for a British newspaper and decided to stay. She mixed with the rich and powerful, mainly British and other European expatriates, but she also had a romantic relationship and business partnership with an already married Chinese publisher and poet. Her apartment--which she describes in humorous detail--was in the red light district and she kept a pet gibbon name Mr. Mills who sometimes accompanied her to parties.In 1940 Hahn traveled inland to the mountainous city of Chungking (now Chongqing) to interview one of the Soong sisters, who Iâ€™m ashamed to say I had never heard of, for a book she was writing about the family.  All three sisters were married to prominent Chinese men--political and military leader Chiang Kai-shek, revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, and uber wealthy finance minister Kung Hsiang-hsi--but the sisters also cultivated their own positions of power and influence. Hahn was in Chungking while the Japanese were conducting bombing raids on the city, so she had to type her book between frightening but tedious sessions in cave-like air raid shelters.But Hahnâ€™s experiences in Chungking were nothing compared to her life in Japanese occupied Hong Kong. She had about a year in the city before the invasion, which was long enough to have an affair with a married British military officer and give birth to their baby. Up until this point Hahnâ€™s memoir had been highly interesting to me, but her harrowing descriptions of the chaos, scarcity, and menace of living under enemy rule while trying to care for and feed her infant daughter and make sure her hospital imprisoned lover had  food and medicine made the book almost impossible to put down.Hahn was a follows-her-own-rules kind of person, and this is a lively, entertaining, and informative book, but itâ€™s her astute and forthright observations about people, including herself, and their varied reactions to hardship, displacement, cultural difference, tests of love and loyalty, and the loss or gain of power that elevated this memoir above a simple recounting of events for me. The book closes in 1943 when Hahn finally returns to the US with her daughter, but the war is  raging on so her life and the fate of her lover are still up in the air, making me very relieved that I had a biography on hand to fill me in on what happened next--though you could just check her Wikipedia page.This memoir is well over 400 pages, and I did find myself skimming at times, but like many of my favorite books, China to Me sent me into passionate internet research mode, and itâ€™s added several titles to my TBR list--I for sure have to read Hahnâ€™s book about the Soong sisters. Thereâ€™s a lot more by Hahn to choose from because she authored a total of 52(!) books and wrote articles, poems, and short stories for New Yorker magazine almost up until her death  at the age of ninety-two in 1997.In 2014 China to Me was republished by Open Road Media. I read an ebook review copy supplied to me at no cost by the publisher through NetGalley.

"I am going to miss Jane and Vincent. Of Noble Family is the married coupleâ€™s fifth and final adventure in Mary Robinette Kowalâ€™s Glamourist History series set in an alternate Regency Britain enhanced by glamour, the loveliest system of magic Iâ€™ve encountered. But while their glamoured displays are often breathtaking, Jane and Vincent have taken ether-based illusions far beyond the ubiquitous drawing room decorations created by accomplished young women. In previous books theyâ€™ve found practical, if hair-raising, applications for glamour in the war against Napoleon, the Luddite riots, and an escapade involving pirates on the Mediterranean. For this last story the couple will be off to the Caribbean.When the book opens, Jane and Vincent have been resting after their harrowing exploits on the Italian Island of Murano and enjoying the company of Janeâ€™s family, especially her sister Melodyâ€™s new baby boy, who is already showing a precocious ability to see inside glamoured images. But things donâ€™t stay relaxing for long. Vincent receives a letter from his brother Richard that turns their world upside down.The first shocking piece of news is that Vincentâ€™s father has died of a stroke at the family estate on the Caribbean island of Antigua. Lord Verbury fled to the island in an earlier book to avoid being imprisoned for treason. Since Vincent was badly abused by his father while growing up, the death wasnâ€™t as upsetting to him as it might be, but the bad news didnâ€™t end there. Upon their fatherâ€™s death, Vincentâ€™s oldest brother Garland inherited the title Lord Verbury, bought himself a new barouche-landau, and then died when the vehicle overturned on the badly maintained road leading to Lyme Regis. Vincentâ€™s middle brother, Richard, was severely injured in the accident, losing one of his feet. In his letter Richard asks Vincent for a very large favor.Apparently their fatherâ€™s most recent will is in Antigua, and it will only be released to one of the sons. Richardâ€™s injuries make it impossible for him to travel right now, so heâ€™s asking Vincent to make the journey and straighten out any problems on the estate that need attention. Jane is completely against it. Why should Vincent go? Sheâ€™s seen how poisonous anything to do with his father is for Vincent, and Vincent has already disassociated himself from his family by changing his last name.But Richard has always been kind to Vincent and was just as badly treated by their father himself. Plus, being professional glamourists Jane and Vincent have no possibility of work in Britain for the time being anyway. Beloved Princess Charlotte, daughter of George IV, recently died in childbirth so the country is in mourning for a year and all glamour has been stripped from homes and public places. For these reasons, Vincent decides to help Richard by traveling to Antigua, and Jane of course goes with him, but nothing turns out as they expected. The boat journey across the Atlantic is much more difficult than any water trip theyâ€™ve made before, and once they reach the island they discover theyâ€™ve been lied to as shocking family secrets begin to come to light.Of Noble Family is a heart-racingly superb conclusion to the series and includes all the charms Iâ€™ve come to expect from Kowal. I love that the books don't shy away from charged historical issues--here Jane and Vincent are confronting slavery, and grappling with their own prejudices and well-meaning but sometimes short sighted feelings about it--and I love that the stories arenâ€™t set only generally during the Regency period--all the stories take place at specific times, this one during the mourning period for Princess Charlotte.It continues to be a pleasure to see what happens after an Austen-like happy ending marriage. Jane and Vincent have a strong relationship but itâ€™s not effortlessly wonderful and they have to work at it. Also, Of Noble Family is a richer story than it might have been in other hands because Jane and Vincent arenâ€™t its only heroes. The enslaved characters practice their own forms of glamour, and act with agency, resource, and intelligence.My only complaint is the one youâ€™d expect--I wish there was going to be another book. But Kowal wraps everything up in a moving and satisfying way, and there is at least one more thing to look forward to. Kowal always narrates the audio versions of her books, but since Of Noble Family has characters with Caribbean accents this time she has the help of two other readers. Iâ€™ve listened to a sample and itâ€™s wonderful, especially Prentice Onayemiâ€™s deep, Mr. Darcy-like interpretation of Vincentâ€™s voice. Iâ€™m going to enjoy revisiting the story in audio form.I read an advanced review copy of this book provided to me at no cost by the publisher. Review opinions are mine.

"The hardships of living in a once modern country that no longer has enough reliable electricity to cool its citizenâ€™s home refrigerators or run the now defunct factories where they used to work are more than I could have imagined and heart-rending, but there is at least one advantage. When the sun sets the country goes completely dark, itâ€™s a blank spot on nighttime satellite photos and the starry sky must be amazing to see, which provides cover to young teenage lovers who otherwise would be prevented from meeting by their scared conservative families, their class conscious society, and their frighteningly punitive government.North Korea is one of the most culturally isolated nations on the planet, which makes this poignant and descriptive book about the personal lives and families of six former residents of Chonhjin, a city in a northern outpost of the country far from what any foreigner would see, a testament to Barbara Demickâ€™s patience, perseverance, and humanity. While working as a journalist in South Korea Demick was able to meet and spend considerable time with of many former residents of that region--her reasoning was that she would be able to verify facts more easily if she talked to people who were all connected to one place--and sheâ€™s created a surprisingly complete and moving picture of their lives.Part of what makes the book so interesting is how varied the six people Demick profiles are. Some lived on the fringes of North Korean society even before the famine and infrastructure breakdown, others were formerly loyal party members only gradually disillusioned by the dysfunction and corruption of their government, and two were teenage lovers who could only meet in darkness.The North Korean government does not come off well in this book, but neither do the Allied powers who made such a mess of Korea after WWII and then followed it up with the devastating Korean War. Dystopian fiction pales next to the gripping real stories told in Nothing to Envy, but since the people Demick talked with were resourceful during their almost unimaginable difficulties and have all escaped to make new lives in South Korea the book isnâ€™t flatly bleak.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37F05C4KWXE8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZB26AO#wasThisHelpful","R37F05C4KWXE8S","A32EOHLFZYXJEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EOHLFZYXJEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I could not resist the narrative voice of this earthy, augury filled, family rich story set in the First Nations Haisla community of western Canada. Nineteen year old Lisamarie is generally fearless and never takes guff from anyone--sheâ€™ll launch herself at a gang of bullies without hesitation and her uncle affectionately calls her monster--but the nighttime visits she receives from a small, wild, red haired man terrify her because they always precede a death or tragedy. Itâ€™s a visionary â€œgiftâ€ she discovers runs in her family, though no one talks much about anymore so sheâ€™s mostly on her own with it.When her younger brother Jimmy is lost at sea Lisamarie embarks on a solo speedboat trip up the Pacific coast driven by guilt, fear and grief, determined to find him or his body. Her vivid memories and visions along the way take the story all the way back to her early childhood and into the land of the dead.The ending? Itâ€™s somewhat hallucinatory, not something I could confidently articulate, but I was swept along anyway. With writing thatâ€™s beautiful and raw, this book is a colorful, sometimes dizzying odyssey, filled with ghosts, poverty, kinship ties, Haisla culture, Sasquatch monkey men, and the grit and wonder of the natural world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SL54BMDWCQTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0349107912#wasThisHelpful","R2SL54BMDWCQTY","A32EOHLFZYXJEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EOHLFZYXJEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sturdy and attractive, this planter didn't come with directions--my one complaint--but it only took a few minutes for us to figure out how to put it together, and I'm not gifted in that department. Some earlier reviewers have complained about the size, but the dimensions are just as they are listed--30 inches long, 12 inches wide, and about a foot off the ground. The planter itself is about 6 inches deep at the center and curves up on the side, so plants that need an extensive root system won't have enough space.

"2014â€™s Station Eleven captivated me with its story of life after a pandemic flu caused the collapse of society, and The Lola Quartet, an earlier novel by the same author, shares many of Station Elevenâ€™s story elements, including a life during crisis theme, though here the disasters are on a smaller scale.Gavin is unsettled by the news that he may have fathered a daughter by a troubled high school girlfriend who disappeared--so unsettled he makes mistakes that sabotage his NYC career as a reporter, though print journalism is in its death throes anyway and his paper shut down not long after he was fired. He moves back to Florida because an economic crash similar to (or the same as) the one of 2007-2008 has created a job opportunity for him with his sister, whose work involves foreclosing on homes--she has to use a punching bag to work off the stress.

In the process he reconnects with the other members of his high school jazz quartet--his girlfriendâ€™s half-sister was the drummer--but everyoneâ€™s life has changed drastically since the almost magical evening of their final concert outdoors on the back of a truck, and no one seems able or willing to help him.As in Station Eleven there are several third person narrators, the writing is beautiful and evocative, and the story is riveting, moving, and complex. Both novels unfold while shifting back and forth in time, revealing information slowly--a technique that irritates me in some books, but author Emily St. John Mandel makes it feel artful.

"Resourceful, optimistic, determined, and unflappable, Miss Marjorie Marjoribanks would make a delightful, though perhaps slightly controlling, companion. While staying dutifully--albeit perhaps a bit technically--inside the closely circumscribed boundaries of what is correct and proper behavior for a young Victorian woman, Miss Marjoribanks is able to manage just about every aspect of life in her little town, including politics, even though she canâ€™t, of course, actually vote.After finishing school and taking a brief tour of the continent, Miss Marjoribanks comes back home to â€œbe a comfortâ€ to her dear papa, a modest and selfless goal she mentions frequently at the most strategic times. Her mother had died a few years back and while her father, the town doctor, finds his life quite complete, Miss Marjoribanks is determined to make it better. She also has a quite a few other things in mind to improve the social life of the town as well, including holding lively and soon beloved Thursday evening gatherings in her fatherâ€™s drawing room, which she had specially painted in a shade to flatter her complexion (she thinks of everything!).Miss Marjoribanks decides sheâ€™ll continue on this course for 10 years, long enough to make up for papa having had the expense of redecorating the drawing room, before she thinks about getting married. But even Miss Marjoribanks canâ€™t anticipate everything that will happen.Some readers and reviewers have remarked that Marjorie Marjoribanks is like Jane Austenâ€™s Emma but less irritating, and I concur completely with that sentiment. Itâ€™s a long book, and it did drag a little in the middle for me, but the story has a wonderful ending and itâ€™s filled with a variety of spirited, humorous, mostly lovable characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R311WGKVQ7UUTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQMKQFG#wasThisHelpful","R311WGKVQ7UUTQ","A32EOHLFZYXJEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EOHLFZYXJEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This entertaining, often enthralling, mix of history, humor, travelogue, family memoir, and no holds barred social commentary reminds me of my favorite Bill Bryson books--especially A Walk in the Woods about Brysonâ€™s (mis)adventures hiking the Appalachian Trail. When Rinker Buck discovered that large stretches of the Oregon Trail still exist, he had romantic visions of a back to basics journey across the western half of the continent and began obsessively and meticulously preparing for a mule-drawn covered wagon trip along the old pioneer route. Since he was divorced and his daughters were grown, why not? Rinker planned to go solo, but even replica wagons have breakdowns, so fortunately for both him and his readers Rinkerâ€™s handy, force of nature brother insisted on coming along too--a brusque, big-hearted, syntax challenged, mechanically gifted giant of a man who has some resemblance to Harry Potterâ€™s Hagrid.Rinker blends the fascinating if fraught history of the mass migration westward into the story of his own journey. Pioneer journals were his guides, and the sections devoted to their lively accounts of trail travel were some of my favorite parts of the book. Rinker also writes movingly about his father, an adventurous, family-centered man who inspired his trip. I found the chapter about the surprising (to me) importance role of mules in 18th and 19th century America--starting with George Washington as a savvy land speculating donkey importer and mule broker--utterly captivating, and itâ€™s a good example of the atypical historical perspectives and insights that make this book so riveting.But The Oregon Trail: A New American Journey is as much about the modern day West and its people as it is about the past, and as an Easterner I learned a lot--Rinker, his brother, and their mule team often spent their nights in open publicly maintained corrals where teenagers gather to hang out and practice rodeo skills, not something we encounter here in the Boston to Washington megalopolis. The writing about the actual trip is detailed but evocative, so I felt like I was watching the scenery and riding along in the covered wagon myself. I wasnâ€™t quite so interested in the wagon maintenance aspects of their journey, but Iâ€™m sure those sections will delight some readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R195Q6FTB55HGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451659164#wasThisHelpful","R195Q6FTB55HGQ","A32EOHLFZYXJEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EOHLFZYXJEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband enjoyed this shaver and has taken it over from my son, who originally tried using it. My husband tends to use this as a way to quick shave on days that he's running late or if he missed an area in his blade shaving. My older son was never able to get this shaver to completely shave and to give him a clean shaven look. As other reviewers mentioned, it will not really give you a close shave. My younger son who is just starting to shave and doesn't have much hair found this worked fine for him.For a price of $25 (about) it is ok for a beginner shaver who will shave every day but doesn't have a lot of thick hair on his face. That is why it earned a three stars from me. IF you are buying this as a first shaver for a young man who is just starting to shave and doesn't have thick hair- this is a five star, light weight easy to use shaver.It comes with a brush for helping to clean the shaver. It comes with a cord. The charge seems to last a few shaves. It even has a little trimmer on it. The one thing it doesn't have is a docking station so it just sorta lays around on the counter. We found it fit fine in a hair iron stick on the mirror type thing so that is where it sits in the bathroom now.Figure out what your needs are before you buy this shaver.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S0Q7B50Q9L1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0X2T9C#wasThisHelpful","R2S0Q7B50Q9L1H","A30H2335OM7RD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H2335OM7RD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, let me share the conflicting emotion I have about this video.Essentially this is about a man (Blake) looking for a movie that will earn him some money and get him started on his movie making endeavors. When who should come knocking but the pizza delivery guy with his fear of and belief in everything alien and weird. So they begin together to explore these 'things'.What I didn't like was that Blake Freeman started this with no clue how it would end and little if any thought of what kind of impact he might be having on LeRoy. In fact, it wasn't until the middle of the show, at a minimum, that he really started to be a friend to LeRoy. Blake simply had the belief that by fighting LeRoy's belief system he would be making LeRoy's life better. And in the end, he had to do more to help LeRoy. And may I say that while I enjoyed the ending and thought it was hilarious, it was a bit chancy and a leaned towards the same fraud he was fighting in the first place.With my conflicting thoughts though, I will say that I loved this show. I laughed out loud at some parts and while I'd love to share some of those parts, this is really one of those see it to believe kind of shows. I loved that Blake was so creative in ways that he was able to show LeRoy the fraud that men and women perpetuate on people in order to make money. (Pet mind reading is just one example!)And despite my conflicting emotions, the ending was the BEST part and made me laugh and laugh.I think Blake Freeman will have a future if he chooses to continue to make documentaries like this.

"In light of the fact that the long lost first version of this story is coming out, I have decided to sit down and reread this book. I am so glad I did. What a joy to read, it was like revisiting an old friend. I had the opportunity to refresh my memory in the funny parts and the sad parts and the brave parts and the scary parts.I have always associated this book with the trail and the story of the father defending a black man. This must come from my vague memories of watching the movie in the classroom.However, I realized that I missed this whole 'nother story' of the Boo Radley and Jem and Scout. This sub story really brought home the feel of small town southern life with the fear of the house and the man in the house because he's not known, like everything else around them.Additionally, the details that you can read about in the book that make things seem more real or believable stuck out at me. The flowers in the corner of the lot were Mayelle lives brings home the misery of the small home she lives in and makes everything all that more understandable in some sad way. Dill with his stories of life 'back home' helps bring home how really lucky Jem and Scout are with their father. And many other countless examples.It is things like this that made this book a classic and have kept it a classic. It is the great writing and the story told through Scout's eyes that bring it all together to make this the book that brought home the times and the culture to a nation (and now a generation) who might never have otherwise seen it.Well worth the money and well worth reading and rereading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HOEWBMMVZI6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0OI42W#wasThisHelpful","R1HOEWBMMVZI6I","A30H2335OM7RD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H2335OM7RD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I wasn't disappointed in this video.I am not interested in watching a show that glorifies a criminal but the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa is one of the mysteries you grow up hearing about during the course of your life. So, this movie interested me.I learned a little bit more about who Jimmy Hoffa was and what he did and why others might have wanted to kill him. I thought the director did a fairly good job of setting the stage of the mystery and in explaining why the public is always interested.I don't know that it was exciting or heart pumping, nor was there a romance.

There are a few minor changes, such as the wand he carries in the book becomes a hocky stick in the show. The one change that was big was the character of Bob. In the books Bob is a ghost like being that stays in a skull and only comes out with approval, often using the cat as a body.  In the show Bob is a character that lives and breaths and looks like a human and is not stuck in a skull. Mostly though the show does reflect the books.Because this is only the first season, those who have read all of the Dresden books will be able to accurately say that the books are darker than this show.If you haven't read the books but just wonder if you might like this show, I can say that I completely enjoyed this show. If you enjoy a little bit of science fiction/fantasy, if you enjoy watching shows about the underdog who does well, if you enjoy a little bit of mystery and a little bit of magic- you will probably enjoy this show.Complete fun. Well worth the money.

"First, you can tell through a variety of ways that this is a dated show. They show older computer models, older cell phones etc.If you can get over that then this is a great show.I really liked this show. It is obviously pro FBI. It covers an FBI case from beginning to end. It explains how some of the decisions were made during an investigation. For example, why was the press notified about one case but not another case or why certain evidence was withheld from a court case etc.I enjoyed watching it. I enjoyed that they often mixed original phone calls or videos with recreations and interviews with the actual investigator along with interview of the people involved in the case.Overall, this followed the same format over and over again which only is a problem if you binge watch this and sit through six seasons all in one setting.

"I am in a position where I often need to have a card very quickly- sometimes a thank you card, often a happy birthday card or sympathy etc. I was going to the store often paying a lot for cards.

There are even cards with cuter more meaningful poems inside. If you are looking for one card to a specific event for someone special, then you might want to give this set  a miss.However, these are lovely cards with lots of white space, perfect for writing a long message or having lots of white space for signatures from a group of people.

"First this item came exactly as pictured. It came with a carrying bag and all of the parts and pieces you see in the picture.This took only a few minutes to put together. It was simple to do.We bought this for my husband who had eye surgery. He was required to keep his face down for 90% of the day for three days and then 75% of the day for another 3 days and then 50% of the day for another few days. We were able to rent some equipment but he felt that this might be helpful. I am writing this review based on his experience.A massage table was not comfortable for long term laying on as it was completely flat and fairly hard. (We tried) Additionally, a massage table was big and bulky and difficult to move or adjust.This tucked in under his body and he was able to sleep for several hours at a time using this. One of the things that he liked though was that he was able to use it while we were in the car. He was able to travel to and from appointments and keep his face down with support. Because it was easy to move he would join us in the kitchen while I cooked or while we read in the front room etc. It provided him many more options than a massage table would have for his recovery.One thing suggested is that you buy the covers for the pillow. Otherwise your skin will stick to the round head pillow and that is not comfortable. Another suggestion for recovering from this surgery is to provide yourself with options so that you are not stuck using only one thing. There are pillows that you can lay on that help. We had a wedge shaped pillow that he used to hold himself up instead of being flat on his stomach. There are pillows with holes in them, etc that you can buy. Consider what will make you most comfortable and do not plan on using just one thing to help you keep your head down for that long.welll worth the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO9VXTSI07Y9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GG62TM#wasThisHelpful","RO9VXTSI07Y9P","A30H2335OM7RD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H2335OM7RD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First the one thing to be aware of in reading this book. This is dated. It is an older book published many years ago. So the mother stays home and cooks breakfast, lunch and dinner. This was written at a time when fewer people drove cars but walked or taxied or bussed it everywhere. This was written at a time when kids left home in the morning, played all day and come home when it got dark. The fact that is dated shows up in a variety of odd little ways.Having said that though, this is a great book. It is funny. It reflects life of a mother who is trying to live within a budget, manage a family of kids and a husband and a personal life. There were many times that I was able to nod my head up and down in agreement. There were times I chuckled and laughed as I saw myself in the same position. I was able to appreciate the stories of her children changing their names and only responding if you also spoke to their imaginary friends and so on.The author writes about what she knows- family life, daily life, mothering, being sick, the refrigerator going out, science experiments and so on. But she does it with humor, a dash of vinegar and it is well worth reading her books.Many of these chapters you may have read in short story collections or if you are older in ladies magazines. Together as a whole though is so much more enjoyable and coherent.A great fun read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WVB1UBRKPU3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O9A4B3O#wasThisHelpful","R2WVB1UBRKPU3M","A30H2335OM7RD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H2335OM7RD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My daughter who is in her teens and I devoured this book. Once we started it we didn't stop reading it until it was finished.Many have reviewed the plot of this book in much more detail than I will in this review. I will simply share a few thoughts.There is no swearing, no gratuitous sex scenes although there were some hints briefly of prostitution. Additionally, there was attempted rape. However, I felt that it was handled with the best possible way considering the situations. Because of the attempted rape I would say this might be more appropriate for an older teenager (maybe 15 or 16 and above). However, this is something you will need to decide for yourself and your own children.I found the main character to be completely believable. It was easy to see Jayden as a real person and to slip into her life. The setting was just as believable. It was well described and in many ways the setting was a character in the book that added to the story. The minor characters in this book were also well developed. I particularly liked the substory of Jayden and her sister. I appreciated their relationship and the story of their choices they made and how it impacted their lives.Overall, this was a romance but it was much more than a romance. It is a book about family, about the history of the area, and more. It is about trust and pride and love.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HEWB93LTG9PY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062194976#wasThisHelpful","R3HEWB93LTG9PY","A30H2335OM7RD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H2335OM7RD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So bad it's good!There are a few things you need to know about this movie:First the director and his wife wrote this movie. Italian is their first language and they speak poor English (according to IMBD). They insisted that the characters go by the script as it was written when the movie was filmed. Second, ALL of the main characters went into the auditions hoping for parts as extras and were given the main character parts.In this movie, a young boy is hallucinating that his granfather is still alive and trying to help him save his family from trolls. The trolls have managed to turn themselves into human look alikes. This way, when they are hungry, they can go to town and take their pick of tasty humans to eat. Through a house exchange, the Wait family is on the menu. There are any number of ways the trolls can make you digestable for their system, all of which involve turning you into plant slime. Eat the green food and you become green plant slime, drink the green drink- plant slime. And once you are plant slime- you are eaten!This movie has all the earmarks of a cult classic- poor acting, strange creatures that aren't scary, green food, and someone peeing on the dinner table!What makes it even better is that it's so quotable. I have started quoting this movie to my children. ""Big Sister, Your a Genius!"" It's a Double-decker Bogna Sandwhich."" etc.There is very little of redeeming value if you are looking for a true horror movie, a good kids movie, a movie the whole family will enjoy, or really, any kind of movie. Even the gratuitous scenes that show the girl and the boyfriend alone, together- are simply horrible. The only type of person that will enjoy it is those who have an oddball sense of humor, enjoy watching quotable bad movies.Enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E7RQA4VSBXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001BXY7FY#wasThisHelpful","R3E7RQA4VSBXZ","A30H2335OM7RD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H2335OM7RD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I can see that this book would be appreciated and liked by others, more than by me. There was a lot to keep it interesting. A mystery keeps it going. The characters are true to themselves and only add to the story line.

"Abuelita Chocolate is a great hot chocolate. It smells so yummy and it is just as yummy as it smells. It is not at all similar to traditional hot chocolate that you might have grown up with in the U.S.Abuelita comes in a hard chocolate disk. You melt this in warm milk and it makes a very light colored hot cocoa that smells of cinnamon and tastes wonderful. I believe you are supposed to use the whole disk if you are making many servings. To do a serving for one I believe you use about a 1/3 to a 1/4th of a disk. We have found that to make three servings, if we use about a 1/3 to a 1/2 of a disk that is the perfect ratio for our tastes in our family.Although the disks are hard, they are not difficult to break apart. You can take a kitchen butter knife and put a little pressure on the center of the disk and it will generally break up into several pieces.We do not like to put things like whipped cream or marshmallows in this hot cocoa. It is simply perfect the way it is. It is easy to fix. It definitely has cinnamon in it. You can smell it and taste it but it is not an over powering cinnamon taste.Well worth the money.

"We like to make Abuelita hot chocolate which is made with solid chocolate. To do this in a hot pot with warm milks seems to take forever and we have scalded several pots of hot chocolate. With that in mind my friend suggested we try this. What a great recommendation.You can use milk or water. You can use powder mixes, syrups, or  you can use solid chocolate to make yummy hot chocolate. This makes about 4 cups of hot chocolate. It heats it up hot but not scalding hot. We found that we needed to let it sit for a while or add some cool milk to the mixture in order to drink it. Of course, this gives you plenty of time to add whipped cream, marshmallows, etc and it will still be hot. There is an off button and sometimes when we think it is done, we will hit the off button.One thing we liked was that it came with recipes. Some were adult versions but most were easy to make and great for kids. There was gingerbread version, azteca hot chocolate etc. And that got us thinking about other types of hot chocolate we could try in this machine.The milk is spinning around in this machine as it is heated. We did take the lid off to look at it and it did not splash out and spin out. So I suppose if you wanted to check your hot chocolate, you could easily peak and see if it's done. I don't really suggest you do that though.To use solid chocolate such as pieces of dark chocolate or milk chocolate (such as Hershey Kisses), you put the suggested amount into the chocolate basket and add the milk or water and then hit the start button. It is really that simple.Additionally the clean up simple as well.Overall, I would buy this again and I believe this will have a place on our counter during the winter months. yum.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AF2RZB3BXNYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5IL2Q4#wasThisHelpful","R3AF2RZB3BXNYY","A30H2335OM7RD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H2335OM7RD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What is not to love about this game?The rules are fairly simple and easy to follow. The set up is very easy and quick. The game play needs you to think and put some thought into your strategy.It is quick and easy to learn and younger children can probably pick up the point of the game quickly. We played with an 11 year old but a smart kid who is 9 or 10 could easily play with no problems I believe.Do you use your pieces to block other players? Do you start to lay down track just anywhere because it might help you in the future? Do you take extra route pieces because then you can pick and choose your routes? How do you use your turn because you can only do one thing- draw cards, play cards to make a route, a pick new route cards?My youngest, age nine, who is a get up and go full of energy kid, enjoyed playing this game with the family.

"This is a fun game for ages 5 and up -- and I would take that age limit seriously since it is a pretty complex game -- with lots of different kinds of cards and lacking a clear ""start"" and ""finish"" line. The design of the game is kind of an endless loop, and you can decide at many spots which way to go -- do you take a shorter route, or stop off at ""attractions"" on side pathways?The goal is to gather 10 stars first, and you don't have to move very far to get stars. Thanks to the ""activity cards"" that you can pull on just about all the spaces on the board, you have a chance to pick up a star or some play money on just about every space. So while in most games a 6 is clearly better than a 1, that's not necessarily true here.The real weakness is the spinner that tells you how many spaces to move. It is not attached firmly to the board, and it spins off onto the table or floor very, very easily. How annoying. The spinner was one of the most distinctive and fun elements of the old Life game when I was growing up, but on this new, cheaply made Junior version, it has become a real liability. Very disappointing and it brings down the overall rating from four stars for the game itself, to three stars taking the poor design and quality into account.Overall a good game, but the drive to be cheap has hurt this game more than many others of the similarly cheap games out today.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4LEQ8U5HP9WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQQTXW6#wasThisHelpful","R4LEQ8U5HP9WF","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are surprisingly nice, very functional all-purpose kitchen towel. As microfiber, of course these are soft. They are also quite absorbent, and we have found they perform well as both dishtowels and hand towels.The towels have a pleasing if somewhat boring print pattern - at least I would say that of the ""Cream Lattice"" pattern, which is quite plain.  However, there are many other, much more striking colors and attractive designs, whether Yellow Dots or Lime or Orange Slices.The value or money is good, as a single package has 12 towels - enough to meet the needs of a household like ours for several years. They do appear durable - so sign of fraying or pilling even after multiple washings.We are very happy with these and can warmly recommend them for people who are mainly interested in function, and only secondarily in appearance. They look good, but they clearly aren't fancy -- although again, selecting one of the bolder patterns could help quite a bit on the attractiveness front.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RNR0KP4V8V5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRQ4S2C#wasThisHelpful","R2RNR0KP4V8V5I","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are very pleased with the quality and design of this kitchen towel. It is soft, absorbent, and pleasantly larger than most kitchen towels. Although the coffee pot is screened onto to the towel rather than woven into the fabric, it is still very soft - none of that hard ""paint"" residue you can find on many towels.We usually have two kitchen towels at any one time - a dish towel and a hand towel. We use this as a hand towel since the dish towels are, in our home, usually more like normal cloth fabrics than terry cloth-type towels. But you could use this either way with great success.The only downside is the price.

"My four year old loves this game. Don't be too discouraged by the sourpusses lamenting that this game ain't what it used to be. That's the way things work today. The companies find ways to cut corners and keep things cheap, and we buy them because they are cheap. If you haven't found peace with that basic fact of modern life, I can't help you and you shouldn't buy this game.Judging this game by what it is, and not against some idealized version of the game from our own long-lost childhoods, it's not bad. My boy loves this because of the minions, and he hasn't even seen the movie, and won't for a while yet.We modified a rule or two to make the game easier for a slightly younger crowd - the recommended age is five and up. We did away with the rule that you have to roll a 6 to move your guys out of their base - at least for the first guy. That shaves off a lot of the frustration for short attention spans right at the start, for example.If your kid likes minions and you don't already have Trouble, you could do worse than this one for a pre-K and up board game. Recommended if those two conditions are met.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K1L2ZPXGEBWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQQTXY4#wasThisHelpful","R1K1L2ZPXGEBWZ","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this printer and scanner for what it is - a compact all-in-one that delivers decent results at a good price. It is effective, and the inks are much more reasonably priced than some of the other printer brands (I'm looking at you, HP). I am happy with the printer.The downside is that after multiple attempts using all possible troubleshooting tools and the manual, I could not get the computer and printer to establish a connection over wi-fi through my router. The instructions say reinstall and try over in the event of these problems, and I did that about four or five times. I tried disabling my firewall on Windows 8 and network protection on my AV software (one of the Symantec products). That didn't help. The computer never recognized the printer even though both devices were logged on through the same router. The product's instructions don't get into any more complicated remedial steps than ""uninstall, reinstall."" Nothing like ""create an exception at port XXX in your firewall"", or something that would have allowed action to be taken. I wasn't willing to invest the time, after a good 8-10 total hours trying to get setup to work, to find more complex solutions.The ""direct"" wi-fi hookup worked for me - this allows the computer and printer to communicate directly with each other over wi-fi rather than going through the router. But that's pointless because you lose computer network connectivity - my laptop can't be on the router's wi-fi and the printer's wi-fi signal at the same time.So I use a cable. Who cares? Not a big deal, but as this is advertised as a wi-fi printer with easy installation, it's disappointing.Happy with the product, but it doesn't do what it says it does, so that's not great.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24XYNZUTXQ2IX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SX0R6MO#wasThisHelpful","R24XYNZUTXQ2IX","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent, heavy, cast iron roasting pan that achieves great heat distribution. It has a very attractive enamel finish on the outside and a somewhat ""rough"" interior that isn't smooth or even quite flat - just like it's supposed to be.

"These are perfectly functional terry cloth dishtowels with a retro design and middling quality. We prefer washing towels in warm/hot water for more of a sterilization effect, especially for kitchen towels where cleanliness is important, but these require cold wash to preserve the design.Why do they need to be washed cold to preserve the design? Because the design is kind of ""painted"" on to the white terry cloth towel rather than woven into it. So it has that special stiffness you get from painted on designs.I would also call this more of a kitchen hand towel than a dish towel. Maybe that's peculiar to our family, not sure, but we tend to use terry cloth for washing our hands and more straight textiles (rather than towel-like fabrics) for dishes.These are fine but nothing to write home about. The design is middling as is the overall quality, but they do work just fine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32MCENQ3QAJ5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXTUQE6#wasThisHelpful","R32MCENQ3QAJ5N","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You may have the great experiences others describe with this watch. I was hoping I would. But mine was a real piece of junk that literally fell apart after less than a month of totally normal, non-abusive use.The first sign of trouble was when the watch lost an hour, exactly an hour, one day. I thought it must be some daylight savings time feature and the watch was just confused about when the switch was. I changed the time back.A week later, however, the watch stopped completely. And when I went to change the time, thinking I must have a defective battery or something, I noticed the crown had come clean off. No crown. Nearest I can figure is it must have been the friction from putting my hand in my pocket, or taking it out.This was all on April 28, and my 30-day return window had closed April 9. In addition, delivery took much longer to me, because I have an APO address. So I got maybe a month out of this watch, and only about three weeks of actually wearing it daily.Amazon gives their own two-year warranty, and they pay postage for shipping. I am curious what they are going to do when I send this back without a crown. Will update review based on experience. But I'd recommend staying away from $50 Timexes.

It seemed for a long time that even if I kept the phone perfectly aligned and unmoved compared to a north-south axis, the unit didn't want to move in the directions I was sending it. This gets better with practice but it's not as intuitive as you would think or hope and can try one's patience.

"I can't get over how much the animatronic technology of these Sesame Street toys has developed in just a few years. We have the Cookie Monster Count And Crunch, and compared to that, this Elmo toy is a versatile, sophisticated, precision instrument. Our three year old likes it quite a bit, although like with most of his toys, it doesn't hold his interest for more than maybe 10 minutes at a time. But he keeps coming back to it, which is a good sign.We got the Cooke Monster registered above in 2011. It has maybe 10 or 12 things it can say, and the mouth makes little pretense of moving in sync with the words coming out of its speaker. This Elmo is remarkable in comparison - with a much more varied palette of phrases, possible stimuli and reactions, in four different modes - one mode each depending on which of three hats he is wearing, and a fourth, more limited mode in effect when he is wearing no hat at all. (Plus there is a demonstration mode, which I'm not counting.)You can squeeze Elmo's nose, tickle his tummy or bounce him on his behind to get different reactions. Elmo gives directions as to what to do with him (squeeze his nose, etc) and my son likes not following the instructions on purpose. He thinks the sounds he makes when you do the ""wrong"" thing are funnier than the sounds for doing it right.The downside of the toy is that it won't hold a toddler's attention for too long. But really, what does? Not much with our boy, at least. This Elmo does better than a lot of other toys in that regard, so we are pretty satisfied.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH13XTOBA22XN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHHLNZ4#wasThisHelpful","RH13XTOBA22XN","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are replacing/supplementing a worn out five-year-old set with this Rachel Ray cookware and we are basically satisfied. We are casual cooks, however - not pros. This cookware meets our needs well enough and we like that unlike some hard anodized cookware, this is dishwasher safe.On the downside, the metal is fairly thin, which makes for less effective heat distribution on the bottom. And although the orange-brown plastic handles are attractive in their own way, their color and relative flimsy feel somehow add to the perception that this is not a ""serious"" set of cookware.These pots and pans are working just fine for us and I'm sure they will for several years. We do like the convenience of being able to put them in the dishwasher if we wish. No meals have been ruined in the preparation of this review. If you run an average household and want something simple that will do a good job, these could be great for you. But if you consider yourself a master cook and want top-quality cookware, move along.

"My wife and I are hoping to have the opportunity to Rome one or more times in the next couple of years, and this book is an invaluable planning reference.  It is full of ideas for things to do, as well as maps and illustrations to help you plan and get there.I especially like that the guide is focused on things to see and do, rather than taking up too much valuable space with lodging and dining options. I generally shop for lodging online, and I think Lonely Planet has caught on that a lot of other travellers do too. Regarding restaurants, it probably would be good to plan more carefully to get the best eats, but when traveling my wife and I generally start looking around at the options wherever we are at the time, and choosing a place based on what looks good at the moment. We generally have not gone by travel book recommendations a lot in the past, so I'm glad the book doesn't devote excessive space to this.In general, I think it's fair to say that the ""Discover"" series is Lonely Planet's alternative for travelers who want to see the sights and enjoy what a city or country has to offer, but who don't need a ton of detail on other aspects, like on lodging or dining. On the disappointing side, history and cultural background can suffer too, but not nearly as much as in other guides, like the DK ""Eyewitness"" series, which are long on pictures and short on most other things.This book, like others in the ""Discover"" series, has a great level of detail for the standard, casual traveler. People who are moving to a country for an extended period of time should probably still get the big Country Guide, but if you just want to enjoy a good vacation in Rome for a week or two, this is the only guidebook you'll need.

"We like bamboo placemats. We have used many over the years, and among them, these take quality and good looks to another level. They are very elegant-looking due to the blue ornamentation in the center and down the sides. They look terrific, giving an impression almost that they are made of cloth rather than bamboo. But it's nice that they really are bamboo.But make no mistake, these placemats are for look rather than function. We would only really use these for company, and that mainly for friends rather than VIPs, not that we have many VIPs over to the house. These are not placemats for everyday dinners with our three year old.One reason is simply that they don't protect the table from spills at all. Spilled soup or pasta sauce will go right through them to the table or tablecloth underneath. But if you are buying bamboo placemats, you know that and expect it anyway.Another reason is that cleaning them is not the easiest, especially on the cloth parts. You'll be hard pressed to get tomato stains out, for example. Again, this is a problem you'll have with the trim on most bamboo placemats.But for what they are - bamboo - these are great.

Love it!Cheese is also a snap, as are other vegetables we chop a lot, like various kinds of peppers (cut those shiny side down - the blades work best on the uneven inside of the peppers rather than the smooth outside).Where is performs less well is on smushy veggies like tomatoes, which get pretty messy and squirty. Also not recommended for super-firm tubers like uncooked potatoes - I'd be very nervous about the blades and the plastic construction holding up on those.Cleaning is OK, we use a dishwashing brush and do it right after use.So this is perfect for us with our needs for onions, onions, onions plus some other assorted veggies and cheeses.

"These headphones have pretty good sound while still allowing ambient noise to come through. I do like them, but I like many other headphones better, mainly because of discomfort after having them in for more than an hour or so.I have no real issues with the sound of these headphones, which really do sound pretty good with decent bass for this size. (I do not listen to heavy boom-boom music though - if that is your thing, you may find these lacking.)Putting them in your ears is a bit counterintuitive. The basic design is a little similar to the Bose IE2, with funky outer ear half-moons to hold them in. However, the comfort level is far below the Bose, which are made of very soft silicone. These are made of pretty unyielding plastic, and are fairly large. The size and hardness of the phones - even if you select the correct size - make these pretty uncomfortable after about an hour and downright painful after a few hours. That is their main drawback.The noise isolation is weak, but that is a design decision. If you want to hear the ambient environment, that won't be a problem with these headphones.Overall they would be a solid four stars if the comfort problems were fixed.

"I have to have a timer for so many things, from cooking  to laundry and more, and this timer fits the bill. I leave it stuck to our refrigerator - at first I found it slipped down the side of the fridge, but then I found a place where the Mag ted stick well.It is a bit of a pain to put in the batteries, and you will need a n eyeglass screwdriver for this. Can't be helped as this is necessary to keep the unit watertight, but the screwdriver should have been included because not everyone has an eyeglass screwdriver around.I like the alarm, which is pretty easy to set and has a low and high volume available.

"This is really a heavy duty, rugged piece of equipment and the LED bulb offers an intense, bright light. I really like it and find the quality is excellent. The construction is solid and durable metal with rubberized ends that offer some cushioning in case of falls - the company says it will withstand a drop of 20 feet but I haven't tested that claim.It's a plus that the body is not round, so you can leave it on a tilted surface without having to worry about it.falling off.

"This is a much better than the standard, no-frills seat protector we were using to protect the back of our passenger seat from our toddler's dirty shoes in his car seat. We do like it, but feel it is loaded with some features that are unnecessary and just clutter things up unnecessarily.Let's take a look at the features they bill as selling points:- Zips up to hide the mess. We like that we can zip it closed when we want to. We don't choose to do this too often, but if there are non-family members riding in the car, for example, it's nice to be able to tidy up relatively painlessly.- Big stuffable compartments. Well, this is OK but I feel there are too many compartments. It makes the whole thing feel too busy. Putting too much stuff in it can make it look bulky. But it does hold a lot, I have to admit - and that's good.- Tablet viewer. Holds up to a big screen tablet - fine for our small screen (Kindle Fire HD) as well. One problem, which may not be a problem at all, is that unless some special effort is taken, this is best for watching videos but not particularly great for listening to them. The sound gets out but not that great especially in a noisy moving car. On the other hand, if you have a long enough audio patch cord, you can plug the tablet into the car stereo for a good audiovisual experience. We don't do that, but we could.- Attachment system maximizes rear leg room - this is good.- Deluxe wipes case. Huh? Why would we want to take our wipes out of their ready-made, resealable wipes package and put them in this plastic case? I have heard legends of wipes that don't come in resealable packages. If you are determined to save a nickel a box or whatever it is to buy no-frills wipes, maybe this will be welcome to you. We found it completely superfluous, cheapskates though we are.So on the whole, this is a nice product and worth recommending.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R167ZE3KTSTU9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3X80VS#wasThisHelpful","R167ZE3KTSTU9I","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The coolest thing about this set is the Flo's V-8 Cafe building itself. That's about it.You put two cars at the starting line and pull the handle to shoot them out of their starting blocks to race. There are then two problems. First, there is a mechanism at the other end of the track that makes a flag come down for the winner and a saguaro cactus for the loser. Problem is, the cactus is set up to actually block the track of the losing car, making it stop dead on the track while the winning car is allowed to speed away.This might be fine, I suppose, if the track were longer. But they give you about a foot and a half or so of track. So the entire race lasts about 1.3 seconds (I made that number up, but it may be less for all I know.)If you modifications to solve both of these issues, it's not bad. First, take off the cactus. Then both cars can go pretty far. Kids can tell which one was faster without having the slow one physically restrained after 1.3 seconds, if they are interested. Second, put in a longer track. it uses standard Hot Wheels-type tracks.Even with the modifications, this is not an essential toy. The ""bleachers"" for the spectator cars are kind of pointless too. OK but nothing great here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R6BPLB0N6Y85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAQW0PC#wasThisHelpful","R3R6BPLB0N6Y85","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, this is really one of the worst toys ever, and I feel I am pretty easygoing and forgiving when it comes to toy ratings. Talk about a pointless toy. You put the car on the ""stairs"" and then push it up to the top and let it go down where a big alligator chomps down on the car which the car tries to knock a piece of ""gold"" out of the alligator's mouth.Except all that part about the alligator? It doesn't work. Sure, if you manage to hit it just right, maybe it kind of grabs the car, and you're supposed to send another car (not included) to the rescue. That car hits the alligator in the eye to kind of reset the whole thing.If it worked and did something cool, that would be one thing. But it doesn't work the way it's supposed to very often, and what it doesn't isn't cool, it's just kind of pointless.Move along, move along -- there's nothing to see here.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JE01T98C8K4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FF5I5MU#wasThisHelpful","R3JE01T98C8K4K","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our three year old was very interested in this right out of the box, even though he hasn't seen the Planes movie. He wanted to assemble the track together with me, and actually we both have a lot of fun flying the little Dusty Crophopper plane around and around the track. Look, this is a simple toy. It's neither difficult nor sophisticated, and maybe bigger kids would get bored soon. But I'd recommend it for toddlers and their dads.It would be better if it came with two planes, but they are very tricky -- they give you one plane and two plane holders that allow the plane to ""fly"" on the track -- an open invitation to buy second plane. Now we are tempted to buy another plane, because our son wants to play with two.The plane is pretty good quality and sturdy build, but the plastic track itself is kind of flimsy. Don't think this is a toy for the ages, but both my son and I like it.Otherwise it seems lightweight and not very sturdy plastic, so you need to be careful not to break it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34UTIJLB4NGCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAQVY40#wasThisHelpful","R34UTIJLB4NGCU","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have been using this for over a month now and we love it. It is just about perfect for our RAV4 -- although not quite since the sun still can hit our three year old if it's shining from the right angle. Still, it is much, much better than our previous sun shade, an Eddie Bauer roller model. A big advantage is that our boy always wanted to pick and play at the rolldown shade, trying to take it off the window. He can't do that here, but he also doesn't seem to want to.The package contains one shade, so it's great if you only drive in one direction. (Kidding -- actually it makes perfect sense since we always want it on the window next to the child seat.)  It looks great and doesn't disturb us when driving. It sticks to the window really well, but also is easy enough to remove.

"When testing a detergent for a review, I always try to make sure to really put it to the test. Normally I pre-rinse my dishes pretty well to get all the real gunk off them, but in testing these ""Power and Free"" Finish Powerball Tabs I made sure to leave on as much non-solid nasty junk as possible. The results were very good, I was pleased with the quality of the wash and didn't notice any difference as compared to standard quality detergents -- meaning detergents that do not advertise themselves as containing fewer ""harsh chemicals"".Overall I would be very likely to use this product again, depending on price.

"A good French press is all about the filter on the end of the plunger. Nothing else really matters. No French press is ever going to make ""better"" coffee than another. You put coffee grounds in boiling water, and the quality is going to depend only on the quality of the coffee, the amount you put in, and to some extent the grind of the coffee. The only value the French press adds as compared to something like a Turkish coffee is the extent to which it actually keeps the grounds from pouring out into your coffee cup.On that score, I found the Francois et Mimi to be a pretty darn good French press. The instructions for a French press will always say to use coarsely ground coffee, since the filter can keep those out of your cup more easily. I tried an espresso grind as well with this coffee maker, and even that worked acceptably well -- I had to leave the last couple of millimeters of coffee at the bottom of the cup with the espresso grind, but that's not bad.With a coarse grind, almost no grounds are left at the bottom, but a minimal amount of grounds are visible in the coffee when you get down to the bottom of the pot. This French press performs better most I have used.My wife used it as a milk frother as well and got very good results. She also has a dedicated frother that works a bit better, but she said in a pinch the froth from this coffee press is also very good.Nice product, well made, easy to like and recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11VHY0SU0HEN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HO0ZLPI#wasThisHelpful","R11VHY0SU0HEN7","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are great kids' scissors that really cut paper, threads and other things well. At the same time, they are well designed from a safety point of view -- the blades are not really sharp and they have a blunt tip to minimize the chance of injuries.However, I would say only that it would be difficult for children to cut themselves with these scissors -- not at all impossible. These are real scissors. A kid would almost need to try to cut himself or herself with these, but they could do it.Take the age recommendation seriously. These are five-and-up scissors. The trade off between safety and the ability to cut things well has been managed with skill in this product. I believe they are pretty safe, but still caution is warranted especially with littler kids.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D76ENJ20U5RB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PLROO8#wasThisHelpful","R2D76ENJ20U5RB","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is actually a package of two different albums: Peter Gabriel's 2010 collection of cover songs Scratch My Back and the late 2013 followup And I'll Scratch Yours, which has (most of) the artists whose songs Gabriel sang on that album reciprocating by performing Gabriel's songs. (A few backed out of the project or declined to participate, sadly including David Bowie, Radiohead, Neil Young and Ray Davies.)So don't expect a single, unified musical experience from this package. ""Scratch My Back"", which features Peter Gabriel performing with piano and chamber orchestra, is definitely an excellent, high-concept musical experience as the songs all share similar orchestral colors. But like most tribute albums, I found ""And I'll Scratch Yours"" to be a hit-and-miss hodgepodge with brilliant moments but also less brilliant ones.I like ""Scratch My Back"" a lot, but as both a popular and classical music enthusiast, I am positively disposed to ""crossover classical"" music -- things like most of what Sting has done for the last few years, or Tori Amos' fantastic album Night of Hunters. Hell, I even like the orchestral version of The Who's Tommy.What we have in ""Scratch My Back"" is a lushly orchestrated set of Peter Gabriel music, even if he didn't write it. The atmosphere is somber and wistful overall. Very frequently, Gabriel deconstructs the music so completely that the songs are hardly recognizable, for example with Bowie's ""Heroes"" and Paul Simon's ""Boy in the Bubble"", both of which dissolve into lovely orchestral atmospherics punctuated by Gabriel's voice bearing only slight resemblance to the original singing.""And I'll Scratch Yours"" is definitely a mixed bag, however. (But you can count on two fingers the ""tribute"" albums that I really like -- they are almost always real hit-and-miss affairs.)I found the brightest spots when the artists did a similarly thorough deconstruct of Gabriel's music as he did in his covers. The late, great Lou Reed transforms the light and airy ""Solsbury Hill"" into a dystopian, arrhythmic fuzz-guitar fest. I had never heard of Joseph Arthur before, but he actually pulls a somewhat similar feat with ""Shock the Monkey"". Feist (who I previously knew mainly from my son's Sesame Street DVD, where she sings a wonderful song about counting to four) also does an excellent, stripped down ""Don't Give Up"".Another highlight is Randy Newman's take on the hit ""Big Time"". Of course it comes out dripping with irony that was not as obvious in the original. It actually sounds like it could have been written by Randy Newman -- a kind of prequel to his early number ""Lonely at the Top"". Fantastic.Paul Simon's 12-string guitar take on ""Biko"" is pretty great too. It kind of felt to me like Simon was getting some closure on South Africa with this one. Steve Biko was an anti-apartheid activist killed by police brutality in 1977. Although he was not a member of the African National Congress, the ANC does recognize him as a hero in the struggle against apartheid. Paul Simon caught hell from the ANC for breaking their cultural boycott of South Africa with his ""Graceland"" album, and it was actually a pretty big deal at the time. Paul Simon's final reconciliation with the ANC establishment is caught on film in the 2012 documentary film Under African Skies.A lot of the covers fell short for me, though. I'm not too into synth-pop/techno things, and we certainly have some of that here. David Byrne, normally a musical hero for me, kicks the album off with an ironically oriented electronic version of ""I Don't Remember"" that falls short, as does ""Not One of Us"", which was like a mildly nightmarish flashback to my 1980s teen years. Arcade Fire does OK on ""Games Without Frontiers"", but I felt they played it too straight rather than really making it their own.Another thing that stands out is that no one touches Gabriel's ultimate smash hit, ""Sledgehammer"". I imagine Gabriel asked people not to choose that one. It has been covered a lot anyway.So overall this is a nice package. I like it. I'd give 4.5 stars to ""Scratch My Back"" alone, and 3.5 to ""And I'll Scratch Yours"". Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SN1GD98AV5JL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1ZIZ6G#wasThisHelpful","R1SN1GD98AV5JL","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set is absolutely identical to EMI's six-disc box set Jascha Heifetz: The Master Violinist, right down to the number of tracks and track lengths.The only disadvantage to this collection as compared to the MP3 version from EMI appears to be a lack of metadata (although I can't confirm that the EMI metadata is any better).

It involves a kid named Christopher who stands on a sidewalk watching a parade go by. ( I think the parade is actually imaginary, but the book does not state this.) There are airplanes, clowns, camels, elephants, cowboys, pirates, acrobats, astronauts, a marching band, monkeys, a guy in an Uncle Sam suit on stilts, a hot dog vendor and a lot more, all going by as Christopher watches them.As an adult (and a Beatles fan) I appreciate the obviously strong influence of the animation style from the ""Yellow Submarine"" movie.

Feist (who I previously knew mainly from my son's Sesame Street DVD, where she sings a wonderful song about counting to four) also does an excellent, stripped down ""Don't Give Up"".Another highlight is Randy Newman's take on the hit ""Big Time"". Of course it comes out dripping with irony that was not as obvious in the original. It actually sounds like it could have been written by Randy Newman -- a kind of prequel to his early number ""Lonely at the Top"". Fantastic.Paul Simon's 12-string guitar take on ""Biko"" is pretty great too. It kind of felt to me like Simon was getting some closure on South Africa with this one. Steve Biko was an anti-apartheid activist killed by police brutality in 1977. Although he was not a member of the African National Congress, the ANC does recognize him as a hero in the struggle against apartheid. Paul Simon caught hell from the ANC for breaking their cultural boycott of South Africa with his ""Graceland"" album, and it was actually a pretty big deal at the time. Paul Simon's final reconciliation with the ANC establishment is caught on film in the 2012 documentary film Under African Skies.A lot of the covers fell short for me, though. I'm not too into synth-pop/techno things, and we certainly have some of that here. David Byrne, normally a musical hero for me, kicks the album off with an ironically oriented electronic version of ""I Don't Remember"" that falls short, as does ""Not One of Us"", which was like a mildly nightmarish flashback to my 1980s teen years. Arcade Fire does OK on ""Games Without Frontiers"", but I felt they played it too straight rather than really making it their own.Another thing that stands out is that no one touches Gabriel's ultimate smash hit, ""Sledgehammer"". I imagine Gabriel asked people not to choose that one. It has been covered a lot anyway.So overall this is a nice package. I like it. I'd give 4.5 stars to ""Scratch My Back"" alone, and 3.5 to ""And I'll Scratch Yours"". Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17XNTNZQKJ99G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FEGIVKG#wasThisHelpful","R17XNTNZQKJ99G","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have always liked Seventh Generation products in principle for their lack of harmful chemicals, particularly as our son has eczema and we need gentle products to avoid nasty flare-ups. In practice, we have found them to sometimes fall short -- particularly when it comes to wipes. For example, Seventh Generation Free & Clear Wipes strike us as flimsy and they leave threads behind when they encounter even a slightly rough texture.That's why these wipes are such a pleasant surprise. Man, they are thick. They don't need to be this thick for us to be satisfied. But if you want a good, study wipe you won't get much better than this. These are thicker than just about any wipes we have used.We really like the flip top as well, even though it is not quite in keeping with the environmentally friendly tradition of Seventh Generation -- extra plastic going into the landfill. But we aren't saints.

"We have been using cheapo house brand dishwashing tablets for a while and haven't been really happy with the results. Even after considerable pre-scrubbing to get the worst food remnants off, the dishes were ""acceptably"" clean at best. We would always see considerable spotting on our glasses, even though we try to keep our in-machine water softener well stocked with rock salt -- the water is very, very hard where we live.These detergent packs really impressed us coming off our negative experience with generic tablets. The difference is remarkable. This detergent handles food remnants and nastiness very well and our glasses are spot-free.The lemon scent is a downside for us, since we know it doesn't come from lemons but from kind of chemical designed to smell like lemons even after a long washing cycle. That must be some strong artificial aroma, and we just hope it is relatively benign. Better life through chemistry, right? We'll try to stay optimistic about that.Overall this detergent does a great job.

"This is a DK coffee table book. It is not going to be used as a textbook at the Curtis Institute. No one should expect depth here. But if your expectations are for an attractive coffee table book that offers great breadth and a lot of ""fun facts"" for people who like music of all kinds but don't have a lot of knowledge, this is actually a great choice.I think it would make a good gift for music lovers who don't have a lot of formal training, and who don't take themselves too seriously intellectually.I am not a trained musician at anything but a superficial level, but I listen to a lot of music and read a lot of reviews, program notes and liner notes about a lot of classical as well as popular and world music. I am enough of a dilettante to fake may way into polite and sometimes sophisticated musical discussions. I know quite a lot about music compared to the Average Joe on the street, but extremely little compared to someone like Daniel Barenboim.What I found here was a lot of information presented in that entertaining and informative DK style that seems designed to cultivate just enough knowledge to allow people to show off at cocktail parties. Much of the information here was new to me, especially about early music history -- which is the part I found most valuable and informative.Yes, later on it gets into all too familiar popular music territory, and this is pretty dull. Its coverage of things like jazz and rock is doomed from the start, since so many people have so many opinions and no one will ever be satisfied.Despite being forced to shallowness by the format and concept, the authors do seem to want to maintain at least an appearance of sophistication. I found one omission in the late book very telling. When talking about 21st century ""classical"" music, they make no mention of Osvaldo Golijov, even though his La PasiÃ³n segÃºn San Marcos has made a greater populist splash in the last 15 years than any other ""classical"" work. I really enjoy ""La Pasion"", even though it can easily be written off as pedestrian and unsophisticated. I thought Golijov's failure to even garner a mention on a list of contemporary composers was telling of a certain snootiness, as if the authors were trying to maintain their dignity even while wading through the intellectual shallows.So is this book perfect? Of course not. But does it give most people at least cursory entertainment and some new information they might otherwise never learn regarding music history and the historical and cultural context of different musical developments and trends through the centuries? Damn straight it does.This book does a great job of doing what you should expect from a DK coffee table tour-de-force on music. If that's what you want, you should be pretty happy with it. You will have big problems if you expect something else.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBL7QH93OZU97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465414363#wasThisHelpful","RBL7QH93OZU97","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book shows dinosaurs in various modern urban environments, which is a fun concept. Not unlike the end of Jurassic Park 2 (or was it 3?), when the T-Rex tears loose in San Diego.The pictures are pretty entertaining and the short descriptions of each dinosaur are pretty good, and appropriate for the 4-8 age group that is the target audience of this book.The one complaint I have is the inconsistency in carrying out the premise. If the dinosaurs really were in the situations shown in this book, they would be eating the people around them. It would be pretty bloody and gruesome. I'm not saying the pictures should show people being eaten, just that there is an inconsistency between the realism of the illustrations and the lack of realism in some of the fictitious scenarios. Yes, they do hint in some of the texts that you would need to watch out if you encounter certain of these dinosaurs.You may also have some trouble explaining the concept of extinction to some younger kids who may think dinosaurs are still living animals based on seeing them in modern surroundings.None of these issues merits docking a star, however. It's still a really enjoyable little book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32SB7ZZZBP5ZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770852212#wasThisHelpful","R32SB7ZZZBP5ZS","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We like these wipes for their lightness and lack of harmful chemicals, particularly as our son has eczema and we need gentle products to avoid nasty flare-ups.What we don't like about these wipes is their small size and very light texture. They seem a little flimsy, and although I haven't experienced them falling apart, when I tried used one to wipe a stain off my clothes, little white threads were left behind in droves. They are made of a somewhat gauzy, indeed almost diaphanous material that just isn't to our taste.Many other reviewers say their lightness is just what they like about these wipes.

"I have had these knives for two and a half years now and they still provide good service. After about a year, however, they were in real need of sharpening -- don't think they will stay sharp forever.The good news is they can be sharpened without special worries -- I use this sharpener B007Y15LD4 but any standard one should do the trick. There are no sharpening instructions with the knives, nor is there any on the company's website. I sent an e-mail to customer service and got a noncommittal answer. They said the straight-edged knives could be sharpened normally but recommended I buy their sharpener. They also said the serrated blades should be sharpened professionally. I didn't feel the cost and quality of the knives justified the expense of professional sharpening so I just use the serrated blade groove of the sharpener listed above, and that works OK.I really like them and give them five stars for the price -- note the ""for the price"" caveat, which is important. My wife doesn't care for them and would probably give them three stars. She thinks we should have spent more on a good European set like Henckels. I disagree. I like the colors and think the knives are great for non-professionals, they just will need some sharpening on a regular basis after a while. .However, the colors also have one major drawback for households with little kids. These are the same colors used on plastic kids' toys, and our 2.5 year old son thinks they must be great to play with. We have to pay special attention to keeping them away from him. If they were black and boring, he would probably be less interested.The colors have not come off even after a lot of washing with the scoury side of kitchen sponges -- except the little green paring knife, from which the colors scratched badly on the side of the knife during what I thought was normal washing as we had washed earlier. Perhaps I got hold of a sponge with a steel wool scouring side? Not sure what was different, but once and only once, the color came off badly from one of the knives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWZL6Z0N4B2K0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0029XAAQ0#wasThisHelpful","RWZL6Z0N4B2K0","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an extremely attractive hard drive enclosure, and I liked it a lot for quite a while. Would have given it five stars for about the first year after buying it, it was my favorite of about four or five different enclosures I have used to keep old hard drives for portable storage and backup purposes.Then, when I went to retrieve it from a drawer about a month ago, it had fallen apart. The screws at the closed end of the drive -- not the end with the connection, had somehow broken the threads and it was impossible to keep the enclosure closed. The back end just dropped off, rendering the entire enclosure worthless. I did not subject the enclosure to abuse, didn't throw it and to my knowledge I did not overtorque the screws -- it was fine for about a year and worked well.None of my cheaper, less attractive enclosures have had a similar problem. I managed to get the screws to stick with a couple of drops of super glue (I didn't have to go anywhere near the drive or electronics with the glue, so that's good at least.)I am pretty disappointed in this product, I don't think it should have fallen apart.

He likes this one and plays with it a lot, but note that although it is rated for kids two and up, it did not make much sense to our two and a half year old at first. Unlike boats and planes and cars, he does not see rocket ships in real life and didn't know what to make of it at first.

"We have been using a related product -- Pampers Sensitive wipes -- for a year and a half, and have always been very happy with them. The reason why we like them is they are hypoallergenic and perfume free, which is good for our son's atopic skin.Recently we have tried this new product -- Pampers Natural Clean wipes -- and they are good quality wipes too. Pampers Natural Clean wipes are unscented, hypoallergenic and have a touch of aloe. They are good size, strong, wet (but not too wet), and most importantly they don't irritate our son's sensitive skin.To be honest, we don't have any Pampers Sensitive wipes in the house right now to do a direct comparison, but they seem very similar to us. Looking at the ingredients, the main difference between these and the Sensitive wipes is that these contain Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E) as the second ingredient, while the Sensitive wipes contain Glycerin. (There are some other differences at the very bottom of the ingredients list, but the rest are the same.) If you have strong feelings about one of those ingredients over the other, that will probably be an important factor for you. I am not aware of a reason to have a strong preference of one over the other.Here are the ingredients: Water, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Benzyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Benzoate, BIS-PEG/PPG-16/16 PEG/PPG -16/16 Dimethicone, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Pentadecalactone, Dipropylene Glycol.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V787TF6DKOS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094GA0LA#wasThisHelpful","R1V787TF6DKOS9","ATLZNVLYKP9AZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATLZNVLYKP9AZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was shocked to read that they changed the formula of Grape Nuts and added soy protein. I've been buying it on subscription through Amazon Subscribe & Save for a number of years. I am obviously not a connoisseur, because I did not notice the difference.I have liked Grape Nuts, at least sort of, since I was a kid and saw the Eull Gibbons commercials on the TV. I have to admit I've always insisted on some fruit in the cereal to give it some taste -- usually I go with a banana.Grape Nuts is a simple cereal, and I do regret the change that they recently made by adding soy protein. I am inclined to suspect, as some others have suggested, that this is the result of some big agribusiness backroom deal with Monsanto. That is disappointing.But it's not the end of the world. Maybe I'm not enough of an extremist, but I am not too disturbed in the end. The taste is still good for me, and I am not very concerned about eating GMO soy (although I do have ethical concerns with some of the tactics Monsanto has resorted to in trying to put the squeeze on farmers who don't use their products).I have made my decision -- I cannot afford to spend the time and energy it takes to fight against inevitable change. I still like Grape Nuts and I'm still going to eat them. I feel a pang of regret that they did this to Grape Nuts, but I'll get over it.

If I could, I could give this item no stars at all.June 27, 2014 update:  My rating was lowered to one star because I noticed that the lotion that I put in that well just three days ago had leaked into the well next to it.  This is a manufacturer's defect.  This means that if you purchase this item, be sure to test immediately to be sure that the liquid you place into that well stays there.There are things to like about this soap caddy, which is in my front guest bathroom.  Now I can ditch the undecorated liquid soap container; the lotion well will hold about eight ounces.  The other wells are size versatile; they easily hold my large toothpaste, brush, and contact lens cleaner.  This caddy looks attractive [and not cheap] on my bathroom counter.Note that the items shown in Amazon's picture, i.e., the brush and the scrubber, do not come with the caddy.  What I do not like about this caddy is the fact that the lotion top just sits down on top of the container; it is difficult to seat and has a tendency to move.  I would have preferred the lotion well to hold 12 ounces.  Also, I think that the plastic could have been a little thicker, and the price, at $16.29, is excessive.

"We rarely shop in brick and mortar stores and then buy the article on the internet.  In this case, however, after going into several jewelry stores and watch fix-it places with no luck, we ended up finding the watch band here on Amazon.

"My husband has owned this calculator for 15 to 20 years, and it still runs perfectly; he had me buy him a second one for convenience so he could have it handy in two rooms.  He says that this calculator is great at computing mortgage schedules and does full math calculations, i.e., square root and logarithms. It has 10 memories that retain values even when the calculator is powered off.  The calculator runs on two flat batteries that last at least six months with daily use.  His only criticism of the new calculator is that the keys are not quite as responsive as his older one.  Overall, he says that this is the best hand held calculator he has ever used, and the five star rating is his.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DS06P2MH3LXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000CAQ0C#wasThisHelpful","R3DS06P2MH3LXP","AAPPWNP9FWVWS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPPWNP9FWVWS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My husband is 72 and plays golf three to four times a week to a seven handicap and estimates that his swing speed is about 88 mph.  He is very picky about what golf balls he uses and prefers Titleist Pro V1 or Pro V1X, Bridgestone Tour 330 RX or Callaway Hex Control balls.  He played two full rounds with the TaylorMade balls, and following is his assessment.The TaylorMade ball is not as long as a pure distance ball such as a Pinnacle or Titleist Tour Distance ball.  However, the TaylorMade ball spins better than a Callaway Hex Control, spinning as well as a Pro V1X.  Regarding ""working the ball"", these balls ""work"" well with fades or draws fairly easily, comparable to a premium tour ball, such as a ProV1 or Pro V1X.  The cover appears to be very durable, like the quality of a tour ball.My husband liked best the combination of soft feel and good distance.  He noted that he is the oldest in his foursome, and he was outdriving all of the others with this ball.  I asked him specifically if there was anything that he did not like, and he said there was not.  He added that this ball was as good as any other golf ball he has ever played; yes, he would buy this ball, and the five stars is his rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26Y5QBZFID0LW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYQI4A6#wasThisHelpful","R26Y5QBZFID0LW","AAPPWNP9FWVWS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPPWNP9FWVWS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My kitchen sink had, separately, a soap dispenser, plastic scrubber and standard sponge, so this caddy was immediately of interest to me.  It surprised me because it looks much better in person.  The plastic is thick and if it is not, is a double for Lucite.  The matte black finished parts do belie the fact that they are plastic.  The soap container holds between 14 and 16 ounces, which is great because I buy liquid hand soap in large bottles.  The caddy is a little pricey at $22, but it does look good on my new granite counter.  You can research this item online and possibly save up to three dollars on another site; however, I would still like this item priced more around $15.  I know there will be a problem with storing wet sponges in the caddy, but at least the water will no longer get all over my counter and dry sticky; it is a matter of preference, but I would rather have the mess in the caddy.

"There were two main reasons that I was interested in the Electrolux:  (1) having a lightweight vacuum and (2) a vacuum that would go into tight places.  First of all, I hate to vacuum, mostly due to having chronic pain recently diagnosed as fibromyalgia.  My husband does not mind vacuuming, but he is in his 70's and also has chronic lower back pain.We both used the Electrolux.  My husband's assessment was that he still prefers the Dyson Animal 15 he bought (without input from me) for overall use because he thinks it rolls easier and has a much longer cord (eight feet longer); he thought that the assembly instructions for the Electrolux were written poorly.  He did allow that the suction on the Electrolux was terrific.On the other hand, I much prefer the Electrolux for a number of reasons:1. Both the canister and the handle/head assembly are considerably lighter than the Dyson, making the Electrolux much easier for me to use;2. The canister is readily movable with my foot;3. The controls are all on the handle with the exception of the angle of the handle to the power head;4. I like the bright light on the power head, bright enough that I do not have to turn on room lights to vacuum;5. The vacuum handles all thicknesses of carpet without having to constantly bend over to adjust the power head, whether it was the thin guest bedroom carpet, middle grade master bedroom carpet or very thick high traffic carpet in the family room and halls;6. You can actually adjust the suction power from 1 to 3;7. It runs fairly quietly for a vacuum;8. The dust cap compressor feature works well, releases and reinserts well, even for the mechanically challenged such as myself;9. The power head glides gently across the marble tile in the kitchen, with no worry about making scratches, getting up all debris right up to the wall (the cat makes a continual mess in there with his scratching box); and10. This is the first vacuum I have ever had that would actually go under the beds.The limited warranty is impressive at five years, excluding parts of the cleaner that require replacement under normal use.  Electrolux will at its option repair or replace a defective vacuum.  Do not forget to complete the online product registration.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35UTSNRJNPVO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVOGM0U#wasThisHelpful","R35UTSNRJNPVO5","AAPPWNP9FWVWS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPPWNP9FWVWS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a more formal cookbook than I expected, definitely not done by Betty Crocker and not necessarily for beginners.  The recipes may be scaled back for only two people, but the dishes are just as fancy as any other gourmet cookbook, including ingredients not commonly found in my spice rack, refrigerator or pantry, like feta, fennel, curry, and saffron threads.  Many of the recipes are complicated and/or labor intensive.My husband and I eat a lot of rotisserie chicken, so I went looking for a recipe for leftover chicken.  There are two full columns of recipes in the index.  I tried the Sichuan Orange Chicken with Broccoli, altering as necessary for items not on hand, and we liked it.There are helpful notes about preparation of some ingredients.  For example, I had no idea there was a difference between wet and dry scallops and how to compensate when they are wet.  I also appreciate knowing the proper way to squeeze a lemon, and one can even flame torch crÃ¨me brulee instead of having to put it in the broiler.  These instructions are clearly written and easy to follow.  Nutritional information for some recipes is provided, although one improvement for this book would have been to include full calorie counts for each recipe, since many two person households, like ours, are watching their weight(s).","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KMAH9SE554BX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936493837#wasThisHelpful","R1KMAH9SE554BX","AAPPWNP9FWVWS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPPWNP9FWVWS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although the color is not as pink as in Amazon's picture, these earrings are definitely rose gold and have a great shine.  I placed mine next to a rose gold ring, and they match in color.

"The picture correctly shows what you will receive, and the dimensions are accurate.  The most important feature for me was that the nap was flat enough so that my bathroom door would go over it without catching.  That said, there is more than enough softness under foot to stand on it.  In my opinion the rug is of quality construction.  I have the rug over a Pergo floor (medium brown) in front of a sink, and the rubber backing keeps it from sliding.  Perfect!

"May 28, 2014 update:  I am still using this product, but in order to stop my browsers from freezing, I ended up entirely deleting the Norton Identity Safe program, which is separate from the anti-virus program.  The identify safe program is a password program that I do not use anyway, preferring to use RoboForm instead.It is important to establish a free account with Norton before you try installing this anti-virus.  The program simply would not install, either by online or by disc, until I first established a Norton account.  Once this was done, the program installed easily either by using the disc or downloading from online.The program was installed on 3 different types of computers in the house:  a HP desktop, which is 3 to 4 years old; a Dell Pavilion laptop 1-2 years old, and a Toshiba Satellite laptop 11 months old.  The computers were loaded on November 2, so my experience has been for 20 days.  The installs go very quickly, but applying the updates takes around 5 minutes more per computer.  Note that a computer with a slower processor is going to take longer for everything, especially the full scan the first time through.  While I do notice a slightly quicker boot-up on the HP desktop, the Toshiba laptop seems to boot up much faster than it did before under Kaspersky.  The entire process takes the longest on the Dell because it has the slowest processor; it took several hours to complete the first scan (it ran overnight).So far, everything has been running pretty much glitch free on all computers.  However, in my opinion, the one feature that needs work is the Norton Identity Safe, which puts a terrible drag on the computer.  I ended up disabling it on the HP.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R72YQNJMVLVQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZPXOTA#wasThisHelpful","R72YQNJMVLVQF","AAPPWNP9FWVWS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPPWNP9FWVWS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"About three weeks ago, I bought this watch to give to my 10-year-old granddaughter this Christmas, but she and her older sister will be getting the next two that I just ordered, which still should arrive in time for Christmas.  This watch is even prettier in person than in the picture.  I especially like the rhinestone markers for the hours and the fact that it has a second hand.  The reason it loses a star with me is because the watch came already running, which other reviewers have noted, and there was no gift box as advertised on the Amazon site.  Even the back side of the watch is cute, with a full Hello Kitty picture, along with the words Stainless Steel Back.  At under $5 with no delivery charge, this watch appears to be a real bargain.  This review will be updated regarding how long the battery lasts, the durability of the watch band, anything that breaks, and whether it continues to keep accurate time.December 23, 2013 update:  I did order two more watches on November 1, and they arrived on November 29.  Both of them are in perfect condition.  Let me share what happened when attempting to set the time so that this does not happen to you.  The stem is pretty fragile, and it only needs to be pulled out slightly and gently to change the time; I pulled it out too far, and the top piece came off.  Fortunately, I was able to put the top part back on.  However, note that it is way easier to wind the hands counterclockwise rather than clockwise.

"This rug is everything I hoped it would be.  I have it in front of a bathroom sink with a wood cabinet below; this rug will never be exposed to water.  The extra soft texture is sublime for bare feet.  The medium grey (toward blue rather than pink) color is as represented in Amazonâ€™s picture, and this rug matches perfectly to the contour bath rug.  Note that it is very important to follow the washing instructions that indicate cold water only; I have learned this the hard way.  Also from experience, I would also suggest using a gentle wash cycle to avoid threads being pulled out of the rug and excess stress to the latex backing.  Personally, rather than try to determine what â€œlow heatâ€ means for drying this rug, since it washes in cold, I intend to hang it to air dry in warm weather.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZH347UNIUQ8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008KWP0FK#wasThisHelpful","R1ZH347UNIUQ8A","AAPPWNP9FWVWS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPPWNP9FWVWS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This rug is a medium dark grey (toward blue tones), well represented by the picture on Amazon's product page, and fits well around the base of the toilet.  The fabric is very soft, and the latex backing does impede slipping, although mine is placed on carpet, which is the main reason I needed to have it.  These positives aside, the rug could be a little wider than it is.  The width is only 19 and 1/2 inches (conveniently rounded up to 20 inches in the product description); the length is okay at 24 inches.

"While there is a setup guide included with this mouse, plus plug and play, most of the information needs to be accessed online; I note that the Logitech site is more user friendly with Chrome rather than Internet Explorer.  The software download is a must and is easy to find on Logitech's website, but you have to search specifically on the G602 model to find everything.  After much searching, I can tell you that at present the Logitech site is not set up to register the product; this should be possible by e-mailing customer support. Online there is full information on programming the buttons, specifications, keyboard compatibility, and troubleshooting; profiles have been added for specific games.  There is a three-year limited hardware warranty on the device, but note that the Logitech site says that there are no replacement parts available for this product.  Of course this mouse is perfectly usable for regular computing; the responsiveness, wireless, and battery longevity features are above average.  For my desktop, I really like having the little receiver attachable to a cable so it can be positioned for maximum reception.  The most positive usage factor for me was that the pointer is very precise, helpful not only for regular mouse use but for some games.However, after using this mouse for gaming for over a week, I find that it has maneuverability issues for me, primarily because my hand is not large enough.  In my opinion, this mouse is more suitable for a man's hand or for a woman who has longer fingers than I do.  Lengthwise, my hand measures 7 inches from tip of middle finger to wrist; widthwise, from tip of little finger to tip of thumb outstretched measures 7 and a half inches.  Try as I might, I could not adjust to using this mouse in playing my regular games, and it is not comfortable either.  The thumb rest, while relaxing pressure on tendons on that side of my hand, just adds to the width of a mouse that starts out with a high arch, again a problem for a smaller hand.

"Back in August, Amazon ran this mill on sale for $6.66, including super saver shipping.  I had just broken my third (yes, third) battery operated pepper mill.  That is because those mills sit pretty tall, and when placed on a kitchen island, I kept knocking into them so that they ended up shattered on my kitchen's marble floor.  So, I decided to go retro with something smaller, less expensive but hopefully effective.This one had me with the 10-year warranty on the ceramic mechanism, which is stated on the tag that comes with the mill, along with only a website.  Going out to the website, under a warranty heading, there is a company address, toll-free phone number and e-mail for Swissmar, an international company with Niagra Falls, NY as the U.S. location.  However, I could find nothing on how to obtain service in the event of a problem; so I e-mailed them.  The prompt response was that they would want an e-mail explaining the problem and either the type of mill or a picture for identification.  Then they would send your e-mail to customer service, which would respond with assistance.  I would guess that you would want to keep your sales receipt as well.The ceramic mechanism works hard, meaning I would not recommend this mill for anyone with arthritis or carpal tunnel issues in his/her hands.

"At 65 and counting, if I am going to eat a meal replacement bar, the very first thing it must do is taste good.  Admittedly, KIND bars are my absolute favorite because they are way ahead of others in terms of taste as well as satisfaction.  With any meal substitution bar, it is important to read the ingredients and determine for yourself whether these fit your particular situation.  Beyond that, the Cranberry Almond bars are packed with almonds, with less of a cranberry flavor, which is sweet, but not overly so.  They weigh in at 190 calories, and they do satisfy; I use them either for breakfast or lunch.  The only quibble I have is that the bars are not only moist, but they are very sticky, making them in my opinion not suitable for eating in the car while on the go.

"My husband and I love flavored coffees and each drink between four and six cups a day.  French vanilla is my personal favorite.  This coffee is as represented, a medium dark roast, not too heavy.  From there, however, it is difficult to find the vanilla flavor or indeed any.  I asked my husband if he noticed the flavoring, and, after another sip, he said he thought he could.  In using flavored coffees, I want to enjoy the scent as well as the taste.  From the bag and from the brewed cup, I frankly could not notice any aroma, which was a disappointment.  From the taste, there is some flavor there, but it is pretty subtle and difficult to identify as vanilla.  Similar to another reviewer who noticed little or no flavor, my shipment has a brewing date within six weeks of receipt.  There are two more bags, and this review will be updated if there is any discernible difference noted in those.

While the bar contains sugar, it is understated, the dark chocolate on the bottom is a pleasant complement, and the bar really is crunchy.  All things considered, the bar utilizes the 190 calories well.  The thing I found the most impressive was that I had the bar at 8:30 a.m., then went out to run errands all morning, arriving home at 1:30 p.m., and I was not in an immediate hurry for lunch.  Would I buy these bars?  Yes, I would, as a substitute for breakfast, lunch, or mid-afternoon snack, but no way would I pay the current price of $2.42 per bar; about half that amount is what I would pay.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SCC61G1UT306/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YDIQRO#wasThisHelpful","R3SCC61G1UT306","AAPPWNP9FWVWS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPPWNP9FWVWS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My experience with KIND bars has happened within the past two years, when I saw them in the grocery store and tried some.  They are one of my favorites simply because of the taste.  I decided to try the dark chocolate cinnamon pecan because this is a flavor that I cannot find in our grocery stores.  The dark chocolate is decadent, not too sweet nor bitter.  The cinnamon is just enough to know it is there.  I love these bars for breakfast, lunch or mid-afternoon snack, and because they taste so good, I have been able to forego candy bars and substitute these.  Price wise, at about $1.45 a bar, they are comparable to regular price in my grocery store at $1.50, although there they do go on sale once in a while for $1.25.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35JXYTMLZ4N12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PE7AV6#wasThisHelpful","R35JXYTMLZ4N12","AAPPWNP9FWVWS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPPWNP9FWVWS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"May 28, 2014 update:  These glasses are very sturdy.  I always place them in the top rack of the dishwasher, and so far have not broken any of them.Yes, these glasses are classified for old fashioned drinks, but they are more versatile than that.  We use them for drinking anything...milk, water, soda or juice.  I have used the Bormioli brand of glasses for years, and they are not only durable but attractive as well.  The glass in this style is clear, heavy, and will not easily tip over.  They go through the dishwasher (use the top shelf only) perfectly.  Currently, at a little over $3 a glass including super saver shipping, these are a good buy, comparable or better priced than you will find them in brick and mortar stores.  It is always a concern to purchase glass because of possible breakage, but if it happens, simply contact Amazon and use their easy, risk free, replacement or refund policy.  I have ordered these glasses twice without any incident.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DS26GRQ30WRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MDB2KW#wasThisHelpful","R1DS26GRQ30WRK","AAPPWNP9FWVWS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPPWNP9FWVWS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"May 28, 2014 update:  We have this chair positioned so that it only gets morning sun; there has been no fading, and so far Matt the cat has not deemed it necessary to use it for a scratching post.We needed to replace a 15-year old La Fuma zero gravity chair that Matt the cat has been sleeping in on the patio for the past 11 years.  This is because the La Fuma chair was a gift, and I never found it particularly comfortable.  On the other hand, this Caravan chair is very comfortable for me at 5'3"" (okay, sure, my legs do not reach the floor, but my back is comfortable) as well as my husband at 6'1"".  It adjusts effortlessly.  The fabric appears to be very sturdy, and the beige color, in person actually has a slightly greenish cast, which is okay with me because my other new patio chairs have light green and beige stripes.Here is additional information on the chair tag that is not presented on the Amazon product page site:  comfortable ergonomical armrests; anti-slip pads for security; finger tip locking system; and weight capacity of 300 pounds.  At $49 including super saver shipping, in my opinion this is a good value.

"We replaced worn out umbrellas and patio chairs.  I did not do my usual research and thought that Home Depot's price on a 9-foot umbrella was fairly good.  So, this is what I bought.  Hampton Bay dimensions:  106.3"" (8.86') W x 106.3"" D x 101.2"" (8.4') H.  It has a rust-proof aluminum frame, wind vent, weather-resistant fabric (beige color), crank opening, three-position tilt, 11 pounds, and was made in China.  The cost was $97.18 including tax and a cover.  The umbrella comes with a one-year limited warranty.Then I belatedly got smart and checked Amazon and found this.  TropiShade 9 foot umbrella [108"" (9') W x 108"" D x 94"" (7.8') H]; the cost was $69.11 including tax and super saver shipping, a difference of $28.07.  While there is no cover, this umbrella features fiberglass ribs for strength, a wind vent, crank opening, Sunbrella fabric (rust color), three-position tilt, 13 pounds, and one-year limited warranty.  What is covered: 1. Warping, splitting or rotting of wood frame poles 2. Rusting, discoloring of metal parts 3. Broken tilt mechanisms, broken cords, broken cranks.  What is not covered: damage caused from wind conditions are not covered under any circumstances.  TropiShade is a company that has been in business for 18 years; the umbrellas are made in China with some assembly in the United States.A touch comparison of the fabrics in the shades showed me that the Hampton Bay cloth was slightly thicker.  Both umbrellas will be continuously exposed to brutal summer sun, and this review will be updated regarding the degree of fading and overall wear which will inevitably occur.  As a final thought, I did call TropiShade and was advised that insofar as tipping and wind, a 50-pound, versus a 30-pound, base was greatly preferable to avoid damage to the umbrella.September 22, 2013 update:  I have downgraded my four-star rating to two stars because in the four months that the rust umbrella has been outside, it has faded horribly in response to afternoon California sun.  This review will be upgraded again according to whether the fabric deteriorates as well.June 1, 2014 update:  So far, the fabric has not deteriorated.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKB1FOI3COYBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076HL6SK#wasThisHelpful","RKB1FOI3COYBV","AAPPWNP9FWVWS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPPWNP9FWVWS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"May 28, 2014 update:  I am not a computer geek and have very straightforward needs for a printer and do not want to spend a lot of time figuring out how to work it.  This is my own personal printer in my office, and after a year, I do love it because it never jams, loads paper very easily, and responds immediately to printer controls, whether from a Word document or from the internet.  This is a real workhorse and very dependable.We are home users of a laser printer, and our last one ran for over 20 years (actually still works but is super slow and sometimes cranky).  The Canon was appealing to us because of the brand and price, under $200 including super saver shipping, and it did not disappoint.  We know from experience with laser printers that it is important to shake up the cartridge before insertion in the printer to insure even printing.  Then this should be done about every 500 copies or eventually copies will become streaked or blurred.Initial setup is very easy when following the instructions and removing every one of the orange plastic parts.  My husband missed one and ran into error messages immediately.  Apparently this is a common issue, and Canon technical support gets five stars for promptly diagnosing and fixing the problem. Although there is an installation CD included, my husband did not use it and instead went directly to the Canon website and downloaded the latest software version.  In either case, until the software is loaded, the plug and play feature will not operate.  If you plan to network the printer to more than one computer, you will have to download the software from the Canon website to each individual computer; each download only takes a couple of minutes.  After that, interface is accomplished through your computer's print protocol and on ours was immediate and seamless.As far as the performance is concerned, printing is greased lightning fast, and the copies are crystal clear.  We tried Xeroxing some documents, and the process is very user friendly, quick, and the copies are great.  If and when we fax anything, this review will be updated.  The energy saving feature is a nice touch, shutting down the display between uses.  The printer's limited warranty is for one year; registration can be done on the Canon website.  A Canon replacement cartridge (rated 4 ½ stars) for this printer sells on Amazon for $73.15 including super saver shipping and yields approximately 2,100 copies.  Remanufactured cartridges are currently available through 4inkjets for $28.79 plus shipping, or buy two of them and get free shipping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G4PI2Q8S5C0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YD1V4Y#wasThisHelpful","R1G4PI2Q8S5C0P","AAPPWNP9FWVWS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPPWNP9FWVWS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"May 28, 2014 update:  After using this keyboard for a year, it has held up very well so far.  It is used every day for several hours.  I remain particularly impressed with the action of the keys, which is smooth, effortless, and will take rapid typing.Having worn out several of the keys on my Microsoft SideWinder X4 Keyboard in less than three years, I was happy to try this Logitech keyboard. Installation was effortless, true plug and play.  After using it for over two weeks, there are several aspects that I particularly like:1.  Depending on the light in the room, with one button I can adjust the backlighting in three ways, none, low, and high.  The blue has been somewhat difficult adjusting to because I was more used to the red in the SideWinder, which for me was clearer to see in pitch dark.  However, this down side is somewhat made up for by the flexibility to adjust for other light situations; the SideWinder offered only the option of permanent backlighting at one level.2.  The very best feature for me is the action of the keyboard, which has the lowest resistance that I have ever seen in a keyboard.  I type very fast and do a lot of daily e-mailing and regular internet browsing, and the smoothness (no sticking whatsoever) and responsiveness of the keys is nonpareil.3.  Regarding the macro keys, frankly I thought they would not be of much use to me because my gaming is not keyboard driven, but mouse driven.  However, I experimented and discovered that the macros will record any keystrokes, not just game moves.  What this means is that you can record, for example, your e-mail address and then be able to enter that with one stroke.  Think about how many times you would type out your e-mail address.  Similarly, you can record a password as well, meaning that the macros will enable you to enter your game sites with two keystrokes.  These can be done using the ""recording a quick macro"" instructions, which are very user friendly.  Actually, there is a large gaming software download indicated in the product sheet that you must do in order to be able to fully maximize use of the keyboard, including extensive instructions as well as a help and search index.4.  I was already using Logitech's Gaming Mouse G300 with Nine Programmable Controls (910-002358) with my SideWinder keyboard, and now I realize that the mouse is way more responsive with this keyboard.  This goes to show that if you are going to go for a particular gaming keyboard, it makes sense to pair it with the same brand of gaming mouse.Logitech warrants the keyboard to be free from defects in material and workmanship for one year from the date of purchase.  For that reason, it is helpful to register the purchase on the company's website.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VLM5PPTLPZ4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBUCCKO#wasThisHelpful","R2VLM5PPTLPZ4Y","AAPPWNP9FWVWS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAPPWNP9FWVWS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A good sized castle to brick together for Minion fans with lots of fun details.  Our children love the Minions; they, like most of us romantics, dream about living in a castle, and they had great fun putting together Lego sets.  So, here's the combo of all those.There are a lot of pieces, especially small ones, so supervision might be in order for little ones.  School aged children should do allright.  These are different than Lego's, and as others have said they fit looser.  There are no decals.  Multi-level rooms and full of nifty Minion themed contraceptions, it comes across as a Minion adventure park.My girls have built Lego's Hogswart's castle, and take turns putting the pieces together, advising each other.  They build it on a smooth square of finished wood as a firm base, and when completed, lay out on the floor to dream up stories.I strongly recommend keeping all the pieces together including the box for future use and posterity(value).

"I finally got around to reading/visualizing this one to my delightful surprise.  I have graphic novels of Jane Eyre, Sense and Sensibility, and, also, Pride and Prejudice(of, course!); however, I was put off reading this one because of the caricature-like drawings- mistake.Have you ever gone to a movie expecting it to be a stinker or even just so-so, and then totally amazed how good it was?  Same here.  Grumbling about the drawings for about the first page or two, I soon was immersed in total enjoyment of this fun adaptation of Jane Ausen's classic.  There are an immense amout of frames here, full of the wonderful dialogue and cleverness we've all come to thrive on over the years; moreover, the art work flushes out with all the different angles and expressions, the emotional fun of this story.  By George, it works!I recommend, unless you are simply a total, unflexible realist, to give this book a try.  Go with the flow.  Feel the interactions, teasings and playfulness between the characters, such as Knightley and Emma.  If you've only seen the movies, you're, definitely, going to get a lot more details from this very accurate telling.  Then, go read the real novel.Good stuff.

"Larry Buster Crabbe is at it again, now as Buck Rogers of the 25th Century!  Simple, basic, Art Deco'ish fun, if you like old time movie serials, or Buster, you  won't be disappointed.Our family discovered recently the nifty entertainment of these old cliffhangers.  Good guy vs. bad guy, fist fights, adventure, budget but often interesting sets, these serials offer non-complicated action that our children love.  Here, the dapper, well built(Olympic Swimmer) and ever affable, Buster Crabbe plays Buck, frozen in time along with his young friend, Buddy, only to be discovered in the 25th century- now ruled by a despot, Killer Kane.Having watched the immensely enjoyable, Flash Gordon series, this one was less popular with less imaginative sets and situations; however, it still delivers plenty of fun.  My kids think it's simply an imitation of Flash: Ming the Merciless=Killer Kane, Dale Arden=Wilma Deering, Professor Huer= Docter Zarkov, Buddy=?Happy(FG trip to Mars), Clay People= Zugs(less interesting), and spaceships that sound like noisy fans with spewing sparklers.Only 12 chapters here, but the print overall is good.  Apparently, since the audience wasn't as enthralled with Buck Rogers as Flash, the producers gave up on it and returned with the next show being, FG Conquers the Universe.  I bet Killer Kane, I mean Ming returns as the villain.  (Killer Kane reminds me of a Spanish matador while Ming the Merciless, of Fu Manchu)Buster Crabbe won an Olympic Gold Medal for swimming.  He married his college sweetheart, and seemed to really enjoy his roles.  His friendly, go to it attitude and enthusiam is quite appealing.Get your popcorn and every Saturday night, gather the family together for Family Movie Night, and get ready for some swashbuckling good times with Buck, Wilma and Buddy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R259M70RYQF7AF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002KVSJ6O#wasThisHelpful","R259M70RYQF7AF","A1NIGUK4M2ST8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NIGUK4M2ST8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great soft sided bag for our child's full sized 6 string acoustic.  She's 9 and loves the multiple pockets.  It zips up easily.  The zipper and material appear durable.  One can use the handle or the back pack straps(It's about as big as she is!).Nice case, decent price, for storing one's guitar or hauling it around.

"A not half bad traditional styled Western about a man about to be hung but set loose only to be hunted by a rich gamesman for the sport of it.Yes, it the old classic scenario, set in the mountains and forest of the old West.  It's a low budget affair, but they make good use of interesting camera angles and pretty good editing and scenery.  The hero while trying to save his family is thrown in jail to be hung after killing a baddie.  A rich old hunter and his martial artist lacky set him loose to be hunted.The acting can be a bit stiff, and some of the forest chase scenes repetitive, but over all it puts together a decent action flick with even a martial arts fighting scene.The hero does meets a single woman, who helps him, while out in the woods, so there's a touch of romance suggested.  Overall, it's a clean flick, really no language, sex, only a very, very brief bathing shot of nudity, and the violence is not overly gratuitious or bloody.  At the start of the film, there is child endangerment.  Probably rated PG-13.Also, called A Good Day to Die.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SCAKFCN3IKS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSEXF3E#wasThisHelpful","R2SCAKFCN3IKS0","A1NIGUK4M2ST8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NIGUK4M2ST8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, if you're top priority is cost, but you still want a decent phone, tablet, ""phablet"", and don't want ot deal with the ""usual suspects"" of vendors and contracts, this Blu Life 8XL is 5 star material, and look no further, at least for now.  Besides the great price, I like it for it's size(I prefer the larger display), long lasting battery(although, it does take it's time fully charging), stylish lean look, and easy to use functionality.I'm not a phone expert or a techie, but I've done such research, and messed around with this phone.  They've enlarged the screen to 5.5"" which works for me and my middle age sensibilities, but hey, my kids like it too.  It may be larger and heavier than some, but it sure is thin at 7.7mm.  There's a pretty good size white base, and the camera protrudes out a bit so it doesn't lay smoothly flat on one side.The cameras are up to par with most phones, hold them steady, allow a moment to adjust to the light.  The volume plays loud, and the brightness excellent.  The screen responds quickly  to light touch.  (My kids love the Voice Google).I'm not a gamer, but I've read complaints that it's slow.  For my everyday needs and for basic kid games, there's plenty of storage, expandibility and speed.  It's easy to install the Simm or SD cards.  To fully charge the battery takes a couple of hours.  Volume and on/off buttons on the side.  It comes with a basic display and case protecter.Overall, it appears solid enough.  I've read professional reviews saying the material and workmanship is cheap.  All I know, it works for me, all the main bells and whistles, and BLU makes it affordable.  Affordability is freedom for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZBVBT3KA3Y0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAKR5Z4#wasThisHelpful","RZBVBT3KA3Y0B","A1NIGUK4M2ST8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NIGUK4M2ST8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A not half bad 1950's 12 chapter serial that does its best with a low budget by using pretty good actors, especially Phyllis Coates, and some tried and true Republic Pictures cliffhangers.I discovered the fun of movie serials in the last year.  The kids and I love to sit around on a Saturday night for pure, good guy vs. bad guy in exotic or unusual locations and stunning, ""How will they survive?"" cliffhanging escapism.  Some of favorites: Spy Smasher, Perils of Nyoka, Tiger Woman, Flash Gordon, and the one this one styled after, Jungle Girl.Serials are on their last leg here in the 1950's, but you'll still get a good fist fight, although not quite up to the Golden Age of Republic fights; jungle setting with some stock animal footage, and a cliffhanger with dynamite, monster(giant crayfish), gorilla( a always love a man in monkey suit), crocs, bullits in the back, etc.The weak spots are the repetitive bad boss/scientist stays the whole time in his office while his cronies report back to decide next course of action; his demise is anticlimatic as is the ending, the giant crayfish is totally lame, but this is the fifities and giant insects and creatures were in; stock footage and I believe some original Jungle Girl shots/ vine swinging were used.  Also, the quality of the film, although fine, is a bit dark.The good points: Phyllis Coates, the consumate, up to any scene, actor is always watchable.  I liked her as the first year, no nonsense, tough Lois in Superman.  Here, whether being held by a giant lobster claw or tied up awaiting the crazy gorilla, or standing and pretending to watch giant crustaceans, she acts with total realism; moreover, she's famous for her screams.  Her Panther Girl is no whimp, frequently rescuing hero(finally gets to play a hero- Myron Healey), she also rides an elephant, swings on the vine, wrestles alligators and a lion(while wearing a headdress).  Only a couple of times does she get knocked out.Overall, not bad if you really like these old time serials, Ms. Coates, or late night, cheesy,1950 style monster movies.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F4JFF5RFEHTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0031KONKE#wasThisHelpful","R1F4JFF5RFEHTR","A1NIGUK4M2ST8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NIGUK4M2ST8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sony DSCHX90V/B offers what I've been looking for in a digital camera: 1. Compact for travel, 2. Great Features 3. Big Optical Zoom w/o big lens.  Why use a digital camera anymore when you've got your Smartphone?  For me, I want better pictures with optical zoom and good stabilization for those faraway shots.  Add to that WIFI and GPS, why do I need a phone?  It's just a distraction from capturing a beautiful, moment in time, piece of life.Of course, I'm exaggerating, but sometimes I just want to be totally in touch with the shot and nothing else.  I know basic camera works, I'm no pro.  I have gone through the reviews, talked to photo-freaks, played around with this tiny, really loaded piece of equipment, and have grown to love it.  So, here's my very unprofessional take on Sony's latest.Out of the box, you get a ~4'X2""X 1-1/2"" , little more than 1/2#( with battery and card) camera; small battery, plug/cable, wrist band, simple instruction guides including WIFI.  The basic set-up is simple- use the Sony Play Memories App to connect to Smartphone or tablet and settings at will.  Actually, one uses the scroll wheel(on rear of camera) for menu and settings, somewhat intimidating at first because it's quite exhaustive, but I think that's a good thing.  There's a Fn(function) button for 12 settings, e.g. ISO(80-3200 automatic or manual- I usually use auto)), picture style, drive mode, etc.  On-off button on top with snapshot button.I absolutely love the high resloution, electronic viewfinder- it's good sized, and finally gives one something to look at out in broad daylight!  The 3"" tilting LCD, that turns up and touted for 'Selfies', allow 3 seconds to take the picture.  It's not touchscreen but its cool.  Video shooting maximum at 1080X1920 pixels.  The GPS pinpoints where your picture took place.  The camera fits in my pocket, no problem, or better yet, buy the Sony case that's made for it, and flips open nicely with snaps and gives your camera a little protection.  Set the aperature and shutterspeed via the scroll wheel or one can use the control ring around the lens.  It moves smoothly without a sound.Now, what about the pictures:  the focus at almost any speed is almost instant.  The color is sharp, brilliant and no 'noise' until above ISO 800.  What surprises me is the stability.  I get great resoultion even without a stand with hand only looking thorugh the viewfinder- like the good old days.  I hold it close and tight to my face.  Optical zoom to 30X, Dig. to 60X.Here's my grades; Size- A; LCD- A for flip, B in general, lacks touchscreen(too small); Features- A, especially the pop-up viewfindfinder-A+; Autofocus-B;  Connectivity-B; Zoom- A(absolutely love the size); Operations/Learning to Use- B(I struggled initially with the menu).  Noise control-B; Stability- A(amazing for size and power).Overall, this is my dream camera that meets my needs of small size, especially for travel, with max pixels and sharp images, stability, super optical power and a lot of bells and whistles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35BB0IQ1PFAQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VWJOK7M#wasThisHelpful","R35BB0IQ1PFAQQ","A1NIGUK4M2ST8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NIGUK4M2ST8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You have to like these monster machines.  They look fierce, make lots of noies and have moving parts.  Matchbox designed a rescue chopper that flies by being handheld and using one's imagination and offers a cool and a few tricks.A good sized monster, one turns the power with a small switch that allow off-on-demo.  Two circular props turn(harmless); a water cannon propels 6""water""(plastic) bullets in rapid succession by button(harmless), and they include a Matchbox car that the chopper can hook on to or carry inside its body- it can hold three small ones.Looking like a prehistoric bird, the ""mouth"" opens up to allow the car to drive all the way through.  A nice design with lots of details, it's fun to fly aorund picking up stranded Matchbox vehicles with its talons or transporter hook or heading out to the Sahara(sandbox) for a resuce mission.

"Smaller and more compact with a fairly strong output, the Holmes True HEPA air purifier will adequately filter a typical bedroom or single living space.We own several other air purifiers including Energy Star germguardian which I really like for its narrow configuration, UV mode and easy to carry hand slot;  the Fellowes Plasma TRUE is easy to use, works well but does not have the UV or timer function on our model and there's no easy way to carry it.The Holmes model has the advantage for its small size, but its heavier for its size.  It blows with sufficient force and is adjustable for time and force.  The twin filters remove easily, and there's no problem with operating it right out of the box.

"The Teach Yourself Instant series are my favorite way to prepare for a trip to Europe.  They are  well organized and only require a short time every day- consistency makes the day.  I have studied Italian, French, Greek and now German.  They absolutely allow me to communicate the basics in just about any situation, and make my vacations much more fun and interesting.Definitely buy the book with the tape.  You need to hear the sounds, over and over.  I'm old fashioned and don't mind using a tape.  Whatever method you do use, success comes with consistent practice, mostly hearing and speaking.  This book starts with a weekly dialogue, list of vocabulary, very lean and basic grammer, a memorization piece, hearing and speaking practice and a written test, which amazes me that I can do what it asks at the end of each week.They also include words and phrases that you can cut out(I just leave them in) and practice frequently.  Follow the steps faithfully, and you too will be amazed.  The 400 words they give you and the basic structures is enough for simple travel.  If you want more get their beginner course, but have fun with it and enjoy using it- it works!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS1OP3ULDNG1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0340705000#wasThisHelpful","RS1OP3ULDNG1B","A1NIGUK4M2ST8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NIGUK4M2ST8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Black and Decker offer this lightweight, stainless steel, counter top oven to cook your 12"" pizza of choice.  The set-up is easy, and the cooking is fast.Basically, a high temperature toaster oven, this one delivers heat from above and below.  You need that to get a crispy crust.  We've travelled to Italy, and enjoy the stone oven cooked pizza they serve as the best in the world.  One needs high heat and some experimentation with the ingredients to create something familiar to that style.I actually prefer using a cooking stone over this unit whether in an oven, grill or a specifically made unit.  Here, they feature a ceramic insert which is fine and easy to clean.  What this has as it's advantage is the ablity to cook many different things besides pizza including cookies, frozen snacks, pot pie, lasagna and frozen pizza.  The instruction booklet shows temperatures(375F up to 600F), food item, recommended bakeware(their tray or oven safe cookware) and cooking times.It cooks very well and fast.  It's imperative to preheat before cooking.  The pizza, if the dough is made right, has a nice crispness.  Careful with the machine because it gets quite hot on the outside.  Let it cool and clean the tray in the sink or dishwasher, wipe down crumb tray.My quick and good pizza dough(for thin crust): use the instructions for cooking pizza on the back of a packet of Pizza Crust Yeast except I use a little more sugar and only about 1/5 of the packet of yeast; split the dough in half, and using a rolling pin, roll it out very thin.Overall, this B&D unit is great for cooking other stuff, fast and easy, not just pizza. During a party, while the ovens are busy, we can use this unit to cook appetizers, or cookies, as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HGPMD63YWZK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2OZM66#wasThisHelpful","R2HGPMD63YWZK0","A1NIGUK4M2ST8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NIGUK4M2ST8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For those of us who love these old time serials(way before my time), this one offers everything one could desire: atmospheric setting, lots of action, 15 chapters, thrilling cliffhangers and a pretty good mystery to solve.  Good guy vs. bad guy, entertainment for entertainment's sake only, and besides a good mystery, there are a few catch you off guard twists.Linda Stirling, queen of the serials(our girls love her in""Tiger Woman"") and Richard Bailey, I think he does a decent enough job as a amiable hero, head to Mystery Island where Ms. Stirling's character's father/scientist goes missing- kidnapped by one of the 4 owners of the island(which one is it?  Or is it someone else?), who's able to transform himself into an ancient pirate as his disquise.  His plan: force the scientist to create a radium machine that can be used for...world dominion?!The stuntmen/woman do a super job- crashing over tables, diving on each other, flipping around the room.  There's never a bruised, swollen face or scraped knuckles, and even though there's a fair amount killing- there's never any blood.The chapters last about 16 minutes or so, and always include a great fight scene, and of course, a cliffhanger.  Yes, they can be a bit repetitive-best not to watch back to back to back.  Save it for the weekends.  Our kids love watching these.  We have two daughters, and they really enjoyed this one.  Linda Stirling is no sit on the sidelines femme in distress.

"What if we could interact with all sorts of magical creatures(MC)?  Such is the gift of this book's heroine, Pip Bartlett.This 184 page children's chapter book with a few B&W drawings of the creatures is, in my opinion, fun and easy to read.  It showcases Pip's adventures with the unepected.  She stays with her Aunt, while parents are away, a MC vet at the Cloverton clinic for MC, makes a friend and attempts ot solve the mystery of the Fiery Fuzzles.  There are a lot of ""Terrible"" chapters, but everything is in good humor.My 2 daughters, ages 8 & 11, were so-so about the story.  ""I like the cover,"" the oldest says.

"This autobiography takes one into the bleak and dark existence of North Korea, to escape, redemption and to the abundance of western culture, and it's own sense of soullessness; however, it definitely rings of hope.Starkly and plainly written, the short chapters flow quickly, starting around 1990 to present days.  Growing up, patriotic and loving towards their leader, and taught hatred for the West, the harshness of survival during unrelenting famines force the boy to survive by any means, learn to fight, and eventually, like many, try to flee the country via China.Fascinating, rivetting and sad all in one, the tale brings an undestanding of the day to day life of North Koreans.  He was fortunate to escape where many didn't.  He found meaning in his life through Christian love.  The story finishes with an epilogue of his current life, his success through education and persistence, and he talks about how he still finds Western culture strange and about moral dilemmas which he still struggles with and, in some ways, we all share.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UL399QY88BK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544373170#wasThisHelpful","R1UL399QY88BK4","A1NIGUK4M2ST8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NIGUK4M2ST8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"OK, ask me why, a DC Super 'Villain' Hall made to confront the Super Friends, appeals to my kiddoes.My two elementary aged girls like this plastic contraption.  It comes with Lex Luther and features an elevator the raises and a snake that pokes out at the base as the red disk(used in many of these Imaginext creations).  Turn the disk at the top with or without Lex's help and presto!, the eyes open up and an eery yellow light from each orb flickers and comes on(turns off automatically).  A great effect in the dark  A speargun rotates around and gently propels the spears by pushing button.  A smaller, curly snake slithers down a tree side pole and a trap comes down on unsuspecting superhero.Our girls pretend it's a video game.  They use their other figures, Batman, Robin, etc. to take turns trying to break into the fortress without getting hit by spears or caught in the trap.  They play against each other, and seem to have a lot of fun making up games.  They already own two Imaginext Batcaves, a Spiderman lair, Joker lair, and, they're favorite, Catwoman- so not just for boys!It sits about a foot high, all plastic, and my first impression was, too basic- they're not going to be interested.

"Dream, fantasy or allegory, take your pick, Scottish based, Kristy Logan's debut novel evokes a sense of emptiness in a mystic, but not quite fairytale world.Nicely writtten in almost a prose-like style, the chapters flow together with simple but unique descriptions.  Each chapter named after a character with the heroines, Callanish, a ""gracekeeper"" and North and her bear, the circus performers, the main characters but intertwined with others.The images focus on the water and death, to a degree, and the tale rings with overtones of darkness and lonliness.  It's not particularly graphic but instead, suggestive and threatening.  Don't get me wrong, there are light moments, and I enjoy the descriptive artwork, but I beleive the story drifts along too much in a fog.  I could not grasp and hold on to any of the characters.  They exist too far out, in never neverland, for me to relate to them.In practical terms(per my humble opinion): 2 stars for story, 3 for setting, 3 for characters, 5 for writing, and covers are pretty much meaningless(unless it's a really good story!)- 3 1/2 stars, give it 4 for good debut effort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FGBIW9AWHI0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553446614#wasThisHelpful","R1FGBIW9AWHI0O","A1NIGUK4M2ST8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NIGUK4M2ST8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Purell Advanced Instant Hand Sanitizer makes an useful, pump delivered unit that's not too large but still holds a sufficient amount.This plastic unit holds 450ml (a little less than a pint) of sanitizer.  It easily installs on a clean smooth surface.  Simply apply 3 sticky strips to the back of the base, press and hold it on the wall for a moment and then leave for an hour to adhere before adding the top fluid container.  Press the grey front to deliver the sanitizer.  Rub hands together.  Easy-peasy.It gives out the familiar Purell, alcohol-type, smell.  Cool and refreshing.  Hopefully, it still kills the germs.  Our rule of thumb is to hand wash as the main source of cleansing.  Don't drop it or it'll break.This one's great for out of the way places, e.g., in our barn or near the chicken coop before we get back to the house for a proper handwashing.  It might serve well on camping trips or in out of the way places(from sinks) in the home or office.Easy set-up, holds a fair amount, reasonably priced and easy to fill.

"Fun, nostalgic, serial entertainment from the wartime(1940's), offering 12 episodes in the deepest, ""darkest jungles"" of South America.First, you must have a inkling for watching these oldtime chliffhangers.  They're made on a low budget, corny, and repetitive.  If, like me, you enjoy pure escapist adventure with lots of stuntwork and romantic, imaginery settings and simple good guy vs. bad guy, then, Perils of Darkest Jungle, aka, The Tiger Woman is for you.Amiable and good to the core, Allan Lane's character goes to the jungles of South America to discover why oil men and local tribesmen are being murdered.  He gains the trust of the Tiger Woman, the region's jungle queen(although white) and soon they're battling greedy baddies.  The episodes run about 15 minutes or so(longer in the first one) and always include a good fight and a ""Did they die?"" cliffhanger.Linda Stirling, model turned movie serial queen, does a super job.  She's elegant and tough.  Her acting's a bit stilted but she's ready for action and mixes it up with the best of them.  The first crook she fights, she does judo on him and takes him down; another one, she lifts him over her head, spins him around and tosses him.  She rides, shoots, punches, saves the day, and manages to do all that while wearing an outfit that looks like it should come from the ""Kit Kat NightClub"" in Manhatten: short skirt, gloves, cat hat with ears and hair, coiffured perfectly.  Interestingly, this was her first serial, and she's well known for these, and when she finished her last, she pretty much retired to family life and went to college for a degree and eventually teaching.Even with a small budget, the editing and acting is fine.  The stuntmen and woman are excellent.  They excel at horsebackriding, fisticuffs, and falls.  It's absolutely amazing watching these artist dish it out- crashing over tables and through doors, dropping off cliffs after being bloodlessly shot, and it's in every episode.  They, definitely, took pride in their work- I wonder how many injuries they had?They use a few background mattes and do shoot a fair amount of outdoor scenes.  You wonder on each episode, what cliffhanger this time: firepit, explosives, waterfall, crushing elevator, etc.  And, of course, how they escaped, to be seen on the next.Obviously, no sex, blood, or language, but there's plenty of killing.  The bullet hits them; they grab their chest; fall off cliff.  There's even capital punishment- a murderer being dropped into a firepit/volcano after dancing native girl gives the sign to cut the rope.If you need CGI, complicated characters and story, look elsewheres; otherwise, grab your popcorn, turn down the lights, and let your inner kid travel to dangerous Perils of Darkest Jungle and Tiger Woman.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUGLV9IVCR6FS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OSZSVU#wasThisHelpful","RUGLV9IVCR6FS","A1NIGUK4M2ST8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NIGUK4M2ST8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"An excellent but not overwhelming scent from Paris, France that works, even for those, like me, who rarely use a cologne or eau.How to describe the fragrance?  Yes, I suppose wood, forest, fallish, spring-like(oh, boy), masculine, although lightly so and not reeking through all one's clothes and closet or house.  I find it refreshing in small amounts.  My wife sprays the air and walks through it.  Hmm.Regarding the masculine aspect, it states ""pour home"".  ""Homme"" is man... like hombre, macho hombre.  And ""Rochas"" I believe means rock(s).  I think that's manly, too.  Then why for goodness sake, did my wife confiscate my bottle of 'Eau of Rocks for MEN'?

"A miniseries that sounds terrific- mystical, romantic, adventuresome, and lots of special effects- but, at least for me, turns out kind of off beat and boring.Hallmark puts out this multicasted, fantasy-adventure with pretty good special effects and a story that mixes fairytales and various strange kingdoms from another dimension with everyday New York City reality.  The heroine's a waitress; her Dad's a janitor and they cross paths with a Prince turned into a dog, mean Stoogelike trolls and other creatures from another 'Kingdom'.  It's good vs. evil stuff, and it sure must look good on paper, but I have several reservations about the whole thing.First, I found the characters not particularly interesting to a point that I cared about them(very important to make a story watchable).  Most of the humor is kind of sour and repeated, especially with the trolls.  This is not a family friendly film for little ones in the room.  It's Hallmark, no blood or swearing, but there's killing, piking, threatening no end and a fair amount of sexual innuendo.The storyline does pick up after the first few episodes, and is helped with some romantic bantering and interaction with hero and heroine; moreover, there are parts that are amusing.  Finally, there are some very good actors here and excellent sets and backdrops with castles and outdoor shots.Overall, I wouldn't watch it again, and I know there are tons of positive reviews, and I'll get blasted for my lukewarm one, but what can I say.  A nice travelogue through mystical kingdoms, turn off the sound and ignore the characters and story, and I'll simply enjoy the scenery.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBP8U60J5ZQ5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B04NIZO#wasThisHelpful","RBP8U60J5ZQ5U","A1NIGUK4M2ST8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NIGUK4M2ST8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This two step toothpaste, plaque remover/whitener worked very well for my teeth; however, my wife, who suffers from chronically stained, maybe genetic oriented, teeth did much less so.My teeth plaque like crazy: so I brush, rinse, fluoride, waterpick, multiple dental cleaning just to stay on top of it.  I'm willing to try a two step process, twice a day, and stick to it.  It definitely made a difference: less build-up, more white.  My wife felt an initial surge of encouragement the first few days, but then felt nothing else happened.There's a certain potency or, may I say, stinging to the cleaning process, but a good rinse at the end with warm water remedies that.

"Imagine Jane Eyre as a bear.  Ursula the new governess comes to the Vaughn estate to teach their cute cub; however, secrets abound and all is not as it seems.Katherine Coville takes off wonderfully with a classic Victorian-type tale of mystery, sinister threatening forces, romance and enchantment.  I found myself forgetting frequently that these are bears, only to be reminded by interjected words such as, paws, fur, ect.  Humans exist in this story, too.  That's where the enchantment and fairytale realm enters with the likes of a sarcastic, teasing mirror-mirror or, of course, the well known blond girl of Three Bears fame and others.Very well written, with short chapters that fly by and always end with one wanting to read more.  Actually, I'm  having to share the book with my 8 and 11 year old daughters.  Well, I know the book is really written for them. A shame, not really, because I'm reading it, too.  I just have to sneak in to get it.This book has lots of great vocabulary and a classic but fun style.  My kids are voracious readers and eat this stuff up.  They've read all the Harry Potter books, Jack and Annie books, Little House on the Prarie, Alice in Wonderland, WIzard of Oz and just about every other type of young reader and many of the Classics that are out there.It may not be the taste of some, but, one must admit, it is well crafted, and a big thumbs up from our family.P.S.

"What a great device to quickly mount on a door or window and produce an instant alarm or chime on opening.This small handy-dandy alarm took me <5 minutes to unpackage, read the instructions and stick up!

It's nice to know where the kids are and who's going in and out in our home.  This one we use in our garage for the door exiting to the backyard garden.  The chime can be heard in the house.

"Well, how about some mystery/thriller themed escapism to the Southwest, a la T. Hillerman, but with a Christian viewpoint.At first, I didn't plan to bring up the Hillerman comparison, but it looms over any novel of this genre, so I addressed it.  Let me just say, Lisa Carter does a quite admirable job writing in that 'looming comparison'.  Her story flows nicely and with characters that one cares about.  One finds mystery, excitement and romance.  Romance striking big here.The story splits immediately into basically two tales of two times: !906 and a missing woman, who after the first page we learn, ""Her scalp prickled.  He lunged.  She screamed..."" and present day, heroine who seeks the answer to her disappearance and finds attraction and conflict, and potential love, with a Native Amercian policeman.  It may sound a bit corny, but the plot develops well and holds one's interest.What I'm looking for here is a well-written Christian novel with romance, some adventure and a neat background.  And it delivers.  It balances on a difficult edge between getting the Navajo/Hopi cultural elements right, offering enough of the Christian message and themes, dealing with relationships between Believers and non-Believers, and providing enough realism and romanticism to satisfy us and still make sense.You can't please everyone, but it pleased me.  Yes, but any criticisms?  I'm of the Zane Grey mode of loving great descriptions of nature,  It flushes out the surroundings and enriches the mood and setting.  Ms. Carter uses a lot of dialogue, which is great, especially in a romance; however, her descriptions tend to be more matter of fact and short, e.g,  ""Icicles hanging from the eaves of the dome-shaped hogan dripped, the snow tucked only in higher elevatons... the pass was almost clear.  The spring thaw had inexorably come.""  Ok, I've got ""just the facts, mam.""  Definitely, crisp, clear writing.

For the best sound, they recommend 2 subwoofers, but one works great for us, and not to place anythng on the woofer; moreover, they warn, that it could discolor sp ecially treated flooring(e.g.waxed or polished flooring).The sound comes across solid with no distortion.  I can hear the voices and individual instruments so much clearer now.  I find that moving it around one can find the idea placement for the best, fullest sound.  They include a small pad of foot cushions to decrease vibrations.  Besides a Power Save switch, there's a Cut Off Frequency knob that goes from 200Hz-50Hz- this matches up with your speaker's size; there's a Volume Level control to up the bass sound a little more than before;Basically, set-up the  connectons, plug them in, turn on the amp, press power(green light) and play.  Adjust the sound by using the Cut Off Frequency, Volume Level and choosing the phase- normal or reverse polarity.  For me, it's a matter of trial and error, i.e.,where to place the box and which adjusment makes it sound, to my naive ears, the best.

"This aluminum caddy is easy to set-up(30 seconds), lightweight and convenient.The aluminum is soft, malleable and could be broken if one is rough with it; however it sits nicely over the shower head pipe without any significant weight.There are three trays: bottom for soap, second level for smaller bottles, and top level for a couple of tall containers, e.g., shampoo and conditioner.  Hang a wash cloth or a sponge on the 2 protruding ends/arms at the bottom.A rubber liner protects and holds the unit over the pipe, and they include 2 suction cups that snap on behind the piece to secure to the shower tiles.

"A nice compact, fits in your hand, staple gun great for quick jobs.I own several staple guns including a 'club, that you swing down to staple; however, this is the first compact one, and I really like it.  I have skinny hands with long fingers made for playing the piano.  This grip handle suits me just fine.  It doesn'r require a mega-squeeze to staple, and for the most part, staples flush every time.

"Myra Johnson provides a well written novel of romance and finding oneself in periods of change.This is a Christian fiction piece by an accomplished author.  As a amateur writer, I enjoy following how other writers put a story together.  Storyline, characters, descriptions must flow together in a balanced way, and here they do.The setting is post-WWI.  The heroine returns home after the heightened experience of wartime  France.  It is definitely a bittersweet place for her, and she must find work and deal with family matters.  On the opposite spectrum, is the man she meets.  Stuck back in the US during the war, and living in the shadow of his brother, he strives to establish and make something of himself in the business world.Can two very different personalities find common ground to sustain a mutual attraction?I like the period setting and the gentle flow and development of this story.  It doesn't necessarily sweep one away, but still maintains one's interest.  I have not read any other stories by Ms. Johnson, or in this series, but would read more of her work.  ""Every Tear a Memory"" stands alone, and I had no trouble following the story.

"This is a top notch electric razor that offers a good shave, compact size and a travel case.I've used Remington shavers all my bearded life in conjunction with regular blades.  I have a large face and a heavy beard.  I can easily shave three times a day or more.  Most of the time I use regular blades- usually quicker and a closer shave; however, the Remingtons have worked well for me when I want to mix it up, and this one is definitely the best I've seen.Of course, they now feature different, decorative designs which I can take or leave.  What I really like here is 1) very lightweight, easy to travel with unit, 2) fits and feels nice in hand 3) the floating, contouring heads are the best yet especially with those 3 all metal precison heads.  Now, my old  Remington SR9130, which I liked a lot, is bulkier(it would indicate time remaining) but with a larger cutting surface area and a larger trimmer, it was less gentle on the face than this one.I follow the instructions and use in the shower: wet face, apply gel, rinse often under water.  Try not to press hard- that's a definite for most electric shaving.  For cleaning, daily: pull the rotary face off and tap or blow out shavings and rinse.  My old shaver had a nice push button to open that I like better.  Weekly: a more thorough cleaning plus lubricate with houshold oil.  I find if one complies with servicing the machine lasts a lot longer.  Usually, I get 2 years(which is the warrenty here) or so out of a machine if I use it regularly.  After that the blades don't cut well enough on my beard or the motor's weak and the trimmer doesn't work.Now I own the XR1340.  After the initial 24 hours of charging, they suggest a full 4 hour charging time for about a 1 hour shaving time.  It does have a small low battery/charging indicator and will work worldwide for voltage.Overall, with that flex head, it's probably the best out there; however, as before, for my ultra-thick beard, blades still work better.  This one is amazingly light and compact for travel and neat to use in the shower.  Finally, it is very cost prohibitive, but I've noticed that the price has been coming down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZYAM6FGQJZIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBZQ6YU#wasThisHelpful","R2ZYAM6FGQJZIM","A1NIGUK4M2ST8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NIGUK4M2ST8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An easy to apply cutting clamp edge that has amazingly sped up my building projects.I'm a DIY at home 'carpenter'.  I use that term lightly so not to offend real carpenters; however, over the years from simple desire, I've constructed a treehouse, a chicken coop with run, a chicken tractor, sandbox, swing, teeter-totter and various other nice concoctions using only, for cutting, a circular saw and a jigsaw.  I say this not to brag, but to indicate my love for basic backyard building.  I could do it all day, eveyday.  I know there are bunches of other dads, husbands, men, and women who have the same drive to create.I'm always looking for the latest gadget to simplify or ease up my projects, and this Bora clamp edge meets the need.  It's lightweight, nice, smooth  aluminum material.  There's not much to it(whick I love). Lay it down, up to 50""; the underneeth clamp slides to fit your piece of wood; set it up and simply ffold the end clamp down to hold it in place.  There's a hole at the end to hang it up on the wall when done suing.In the past, I've used wood planks as guiding edges, but now, quickly, I can lay this one down, and I'm ready to cut.

"I love and collect the Countdown to Christmas movies by Hallmark.  This one had the good Hallmark production values, nice Christmas shots, good actors, and some romance; however(and it's a big However), the script in one particular but very important part soured the whole movie for us.The heroine(expressively played by Kellie Martin) mourns the loss of her beloved husband.  She wants nothing to do with Christmas traditions, other than making yummy cookies.  Ornaments hold a special meaning for her(thus the title).  She meets a tree shop owner who hits it off with her, and she starts to open up to life again.  It's all done nicely, gently and very sentimentally.Ok, now my issue ***SPOILER ALERT***  Nearing the end of the movie, after she's started to open her heart to him, his beatuiful, model-like ex-girlfriend, who left him and broke his heart, comes back and wants to start up again.  Fine.  He withdraws from the Kellie Martin character- they don't go skating together like usual, he's cold and distant- and she doesn't know what's going on.  That is, until she happens to see them together.  He's apparently trying to figure out what he wants, so he pretty much blows her off.Nothing happens between him and said old flame, and, of course, he realizes he wants the new girl.  In the meantime, she's heartbroken, throws out her Christmas tree, and accidentally breaks an important ornament.  He returns to her with an attitude of pretty much 'What's the matter with you?'.  She tells him what she saw and that she can't handle the relationship.  He, more or less, chews her out, instead of apologizing for his insensitivity, and storms off.  Later, she runs back to him, after receiving a 'sign', and apologize profusely to him.  Ta-ta, Hallmark happy ending. ***END ALERT***Well, the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth.  The movie, otherwise, is alright, and up to typical Hallmark standards.  Perhaps, they needed a woman screenwriter on this because it just doesn't sit well with me. Or perhaps, they wanted to show what happens in real life, so just get over it. I don't think so.Please, with all the great reviews, somebody convince me that I'm off base here.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SG9RL7OLVKB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LOCLBWO#wasThisHelpful","R1SG9RL7OLVKB8","A1NIGUK4M2ST8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NIGUK4M2ST8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For me, you can't beat a live production; moreover, I'm old enough to remember and have enjoyed the Mary Martin TV production, and these two are different but the spirit's the same, and here, you get great sets, fun dance numbers and, I think, overall good family entertainment.There's a lot of work put into this show, as can be seen with the included ""Making Of"" featurette(I love those!).  We really liked the Sound of Music(SOM) last year, and the same NBC group orchestrated this one.  I favor SOM much more than Peter.  The music's better, but here they do offer some very good dancing scenes, neat imaginative sets and terrific stage special effects.The actors do a super job- especially Allison WIlliams as Peter.  She becomes totally boyish, self-centered and magical in her role.  Watching her in real life, discuss and rehearse the role, she's beautiful, a talented singer and fearless- especially- with all those wire scenes. Fun Christian Borle returns from last year's SOM.Of course, then there's Christopher Walken... maybe terribly miscast... but you got to love him(or hate him, I guess).  Christopher Walken is Christopher Walken: A little bit of that accent, a little bit of tongue in cheek acting and always, always, a little soft shoe.  He makes me laugh.  He's in his 70's doing his thing, take him or leave him.  In his bio, he say he loves doing comedy, harder to do, even though he's remembered for those dramatic if not creepy roles.OK, looking at the some of the negative comments: the kids are too old, they shouldn't be sleeping in the same room, their clothes are too neat and clean, their treehouse too nice, Christopher Walken ""looks like Fu Manchu""(Hmm, yeah, I guess he does.) and so forth... come on, this is a fantasy.  There are a lot of talented people busting their rear ends to put all aspects of this show together including some really good child actors.  It may not be the way we remember it or imagine, exactly, the way we might like it to be, but still, what an eyeful of spontaneous showmanship and creativity.We look forward to, hopefully, NBC returning next year with another Live show!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QNVF7EB87I1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8RSFOE#wasThisHelpful","R3QNVF7EB87I1F","A1NIGUK4M2ST8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NIGUK4M2ST8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very nice open tablet for hobbyists. Unlike most commercial tablets, which come with a pre-installed OS and won't let you install the OS of your choice, it comes without any OS preinstalled. That means you'll have to pay for a Windows license if you choose to install Windows. It comes with a CD of drivers for Windows 8 and 10.The tablet arrived with the battery completely discharged, and it took a while for it to have enough juice that it would start up. I was worried the battery was dead or the tablet was defective, but it's fine. So, when you receive it, it's probably smart to plug it in and let it charge overnight.It took me a while to figure out how to get it to boot off external media; I was stuck on the UEFI prompt until I realized I needed to hold the ESC key as it restarted to access the BIOS setup screen. At that point, if you have bootable media installed on the USB connector or in the microSD slot, it will appear in the Boot section. Make sure your installation volume is at the top of the list, save and restart.I installed Windows 10 without a problem, and it recognized most of the devices; I only needed a couple of the provided drivers. Windows worked smoothly and without a hitch.I then wiped it and installed Ubuntu. While this OS is not exactly ready for tablet prime time, it runs well and as long as you have the keyboard/trackpad for the tablet, it makes a very capable little Unix laptop.PROS---------- It's not an ordinary tablet, more of an open/unlocked laptop with touchscreen in a tablet format.- You can easily install the OS of your choice- Great specs for an entry level product (64GB SSD, 4GB RAM, 1366x768 11.6"" display)- Thin and lightweight- USB 3.0 port- microSD slot- built-in easel- Comes with US, EU and UK cords- InexpensiveCONS---------- Requires installing an OS, unlike most computers these days it's not ready to go out of the box- No documentation and I couldn't find any web site dedicated to it- Screen contrast and viewing angles are good but not great- Proprietary power connector- Does not support 5.4GHz WiFi bandsCONCLUSION--------------------There are a lot of Atom Bay Trail Windows tablets in this price range; they're usually 8"" or 10"", feature a 1280x800 screen, 1 or 2GB RAM and 16 or 32GB of SSD -- and you can only run Windows on them. This tablet offers a larger screen, a comfortable amount of RAM, a larger SSD and the capability to install any OS of your choice. The extra RAM ends up making a big difference.If you're only interested in running Windows, and have little patience for installing an OS and tinkering with drivers, you should probably go for a more traditional Windows tablet. The lowest end Surface Pro 3 is clearly a better product -- it also costs three times as much.If you're a tinkerer in search of a low cost customizable tablet, you just found it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z9MLHXIY586J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NK9E266#wasThisHelpful","R1Z9MLHXIY586J","AVPNQUVZWMDSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVPNQUVZWMDSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, a disclaimer: I was given these headphones to review by the manufacturer.A very classic design, these bluetooth headphones consist of two earbuds connected by a noodle style wire. The electronics (battery, microphone, control buttons, microUSB charge port) are located in a small pod near the left earbud.The controls couldn't be any simpler: three buttons, plus, minus, and action. Hold the action button for a few seconds for power on/off, short press for play/pause or answering calls, same with +/- which control the volume and double as prev/next buttons.The headphones come with a short charging cable, a set of ear tips of different sizes, and a set of ear inserts of different sizes (these little crescent shaped pieces that keep the earbuds in place). The box also contains a short USB to microUSB charging cable.The external part of the earbuds is adorned with a large squarish shiny magnet, and they can attach to each other. It's great to prevent them from tangling up in a pocket, or to keep them from falling off your neck when the earbuds are not in your ears.I left the best part for the end: the sound is great and the battery life fantastic. Previous generations of these tiny bluetooth headphones strained to deliver 4 hours of continuous play, but these last almost twice as long (7 hours). If you're happy using the headphones bundled with your Apple or Samsung phone, you will not miss their sound quality. These sound just as good... without a cord. Five stars, because they sound surprisingly good for the price, they're durable and convenient.

It doesn't work. It never accurately detected the presence or absence of eggs, so it's completely useless. And then one time someone forgot to close the lid, which caused it to drain the batteries...Probably the worst product Quirky ever came up with. It would be borderline stupid if it worked...

"This is the traditional French butter keeper, revisited. Unlike ordinary butter dishes, the butter is stored upside down into a small cup of water. The water provides an airtight seal preventing the air from oxydizing the butter: it lasts longer and tastes better (the water does not touch the surface of the butter).The water should be replaced every few days.You can keep the dish out on the counter even in summer, so your butter is always soft and ready to spread, instead of fridge-hard.The long shape is more adapted to our US butter sticks, and the dish comes with a simple explanation of how to refill it:place a stick of butter on a cutting board and cut about 1/2"" from each end. Place the two pieces you cut off on top of the stick, and press the container down onto the butter which will fill it up.Finish by smoothing it up with a spoon.The glaze finish is of very high quality without any of the imperfections and pores you always find with low-cost crockery.

It includes a full color 300dpi scanner that uses the same feeding mechanism as the cutter. The CM350R includes the rhinestone startup kit (sample materials and rhinestones as well as a code to activate the rhinestone design option on the ScanNCut Canvas online software)The CM350 can be used as a standalone cutter, either with the built-in fonts and artwork, or with the built-in scanner. It can also cut files created by the ScanNCut Canvas web application, a free app available at http://scanncutcanvas.brother.com. This application runs inside a browser and also works well on iPad and Android tablets (no need to download or pay for an app). You can download the cut files to a USB stick and plug it into the ScanNCut, or send it directly to the ScanNCut if you purchase the $50 ScanNCut Online Activation Card. Unfortunately, you cannot purchase the code online; you have to actually buy a card, scratch it, read the code and enter it manually. Still, I like the fact that the software supports SVG in its free version (that will set you back $50 on the Silhouette).The CM350 has a big brother, the CM650W. It comes with more built-in designs and fonts (not very significant if you prefer using your own designs), the online activation card (a $50 value), but it also supports PES (embroidery file) import for appliquÃ© work, and the larger 12""x24"" mat. Unfortunately, these are features that can not even be purchased and activated later, which makes absolutely no sense considering this is essentially the same exact machine. So, if you want to work on 12""x24"" mats or do appliquÃ© work, skip the CM350. Note that Silhouette offers embroidery format import as a $25 upgrade to Silhouette Designer (it's called ""Designer Plus""). User Fawn pointed out that 12""x24"" mats are supported for cutting, just not for scanning.As a vinyl cutter, the Cameo is a clear winner since you can directly feed 12"" wide vinyl and cut designs up to 10 feet in length. The CM350 limits you to 12""x24"" (you can use the 12""x24"" mat or feed the vinyl directly without a mat, thanks Fawn for pointing out my original mistake)Where the ScanNCut really shines is with its built-in scanner feature and the many ways it leverages it:- automatic cut line detection: scan artwork, isolate a section and let ScanNCut detect the cut line, and cut directly without even changing mats (you can do this on the Silhouette using the optional PixScan mat, but it's a much more cumbersome process)- background scan allows you to perfectly place the cut on your material, perfect for cutting patterns in just the right spot without guesswork, or reuse scraps of materialWHO IS THE SCAN N CUT2 FOR?The ScanNCut2 will be best for anyone with an allergy to computers. It does about as much as a standalone machine can possibly do, and does it extremely well -- and the ScanNCut Canvas software is available for free whenever you need to access more advanced features (the $50 online option buys you the capability to transfer the cut files from the web software directly to the ScanNCut over WiFi, but if you don't want to pay extra you can always use a USB stick). It's also a must for scrapbookers who do a lot of die cutting, as the scan and cut feature is incredibly easy to use and quick, unrivaled by any competitor.WHO IS THE SCAN N CUT2 *NOT* FOR?- Advanced computer users familiar with Illustrator or Corel Draw are likely to feel constrained by the limitations of the online Canvas software- Vinyl cutters: the 12""x24"" work area makes the Silhouette Cameo a much better choice with its 12""x120"" vinyl capability- People who need 12""x24"" scanning or the embroidery PES import feature should avoid the CM350 and look into the CM650W instead (or the Silhouette Cameo with Designer Plus software, a less expensive option)This is really a 5 star machine because it's so easy to use, and while as a computer expert I feel much more comfortable with the Silhouette products, I know many craft enthusiasts who still are intimidated by computer software but desperately want to move away from the constricting cartridge-based Cricut; the ScanNCut will be a perfect transition machine for them.I took away one star because I am really mad at Brother for creating this confusing set of models out of what is essentially the same machine, making it difficult to choose and even understand what it is you're buying, and arbitrarily locking you out of upgrading to get these new features.As long as you know what you're getting into... It's a very powerful and well made machine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UQ1MUGACY1V7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EE7UZ0#wasThisHelpful","R3UQ1MUGACY1V7","AVPNQUVZWMDSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVPNQUVZWMDSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These bamboo frame sunglasses come in a nice cylindrical bamboo case with a soft fabric carry bag and a cleaning cloth.The frame has a classic shape and gradient tint polarized lenses. The tint gradient provides a small clear area towards the bottom so you can more easily see your dashboard, read a map, etc... as you look down, while still darkening most of your field of vision.While the frame's material is unusual and innovative, these are not novelty sunglasses: the lenses are of excellent quality, similar to what you would find on expensive brand name sunglasses: high quality polarizing, no optical distorsion.An unusual product that is getting me lots of compliments.

"I had previously been extremely disappointed by the trackpad on the Logitech TK820 which is wobbly and vague, so I was very interested to see if Logitech had corrected the situation with the K830.The K830 is smaller than the TK820, which is about 1"" wider and 1/2"" taller. The K830 is a little thicker but does not have the bulbous area of the TK820 which is necessary to house the AA batteries, since it runs on a rechargeable battery for weeks.The trackpad area is only 3""x2"" instead of 4""x4"" on the TK820, but it has separate left/right buttons which work much better than the TK820's wobbly built-in click. There is also an extra click button on the edge at the top left of the keyboard.Along the same edge, you will find the microUSB charge port (cable provided) as well as the mechanical on/off switch.The keyboard layout is great and while the keys are slightly smaller than standard, it's hardly noticeable. Typing is very comfortable and matches the quality level usual with Logitech keyboards. The backlighting works well. The black matte finish looks great but is a fingerprint magnet -- don't expect it to stay matte very long.The keyboard comes with a Logitech Universal receiver USB dongle as well as an extender cable -- good thinking. By default the keyboard connects to the Universal dongle, but if you press FN+Del it becomes discoverable on Bluetooth (and disconnects from the Universal receiver). It paired effortlessly with my Surface Pro 2 tablet running Windows 10.The dual Universal/Bluetooth support is extremely useful, although it would have been even better to be able to toggle between the two, allowing you to control two separate products like a HTPC and an Amazon FireTV for instance. Unfortunately, there is no convenient way to switch.PROS--------- Rechargeable (microUSB port, cable provided)- Logitech Universal dongle (provided) *AND* Bluetooth support- Quality construction, pleasant typing, trackpad tracks well- Key backlightCONS---------- Can't toggle between Bluetooth and Universal to easily control two devices- Thick in front and no angling feet so prolonged desk use could be uncomfortable (it's a lap keyboard)- No cover- Black finish collects fingerprintsThis is a great keyboard and by far the best keyboard/trackpad I've ever used -- and a huge upgrade over the lousy TK820. While it's a great HTPC keyboard, you may find out that it's also a great everyday keyboard for your computer especially if you don't have a lot of desk space.Expensive, but worth it.

"This unusual toy consists of the ""hologram"" base and a bluetooth brainwave headset. The base, once assembled, takes up quite a lot of space, which is all the more irritating because the white part at the bottom serves no other purpose than to raise the black imaging part at the top to optimal viewing level. It would have been nice to be able to remove it and even use it as a protective case; unfortunately the current design does not allow that.The pompously named ""hologram"" is really... a teleprompter. Clear plastic windows angled at 45 degrees reflect the image displayed by the upside-down tablet held at the top, and also let you see through. There are three windows, a large one in front and two on the sides, providing a more convincing effect and allowing for a better viewing angle. The tablet is held by a clip on its edge and must not be in a protective case, which is taking a bit of a gamble for a kid's toy.The bluetooth headset runs off a single AAA battery (not provided). It paired easily to my iPad (the game requires a 10"" tablet, iPad or Android), and I had no trouble downloading the free game from the App Store, although a QR code would have been nice.After the easy setup, I was able to play. The instructions are very minimal, but it does work surprisingly well. The different levels use all sorts of Star Wars imagery, characters, props and music, which make the game very immersive. Unfortunately, no amount of licensed material can hide the reality of how limited your input is: you're just controlling (not that well) an intensity. That gets very boring very quickly to a generation used to 3D immersive first person shooter games and controller pads with buttons everywhere.My biggest gripe with this toy is that it offers only one game, which requires the use of the huge base for its gimmicky ""hologram"". It demos well, but being able to use the controller with other games would add so much value to the toy. As it stands, it's a one trick pony with a beautifully executed but boring game, and takes up way too much space.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2538P8Y39TXZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5CCDYQ#wasThisHelpful","R2538P8Y39TXZG","AVPNQUVZWMDSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVPNQUVZWMDSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Pairing is easy and quick (the device shows up as ""Soviifone"" in the Bluetooth list). No on/off switch: the stick turns itself off automatically to save power and turns on when you press the shutter button.The non-removable but adjustable smartphone holder fits devices up to 3 1/2"" in width -- more than enough for my iPhone 6 Plus in its big ZVOLTZ battery case.Other selfie sticks offer multiple mounts (camera thread, smartphone, GoPro...), a threaded base, removable triggers, longer reach...

"This string of 200LED lights runs about 72 feet. It's very minimalist but sturdy. The strand ends with an electric cord capped with a weather-resistant power plug which connects to either the solar unit or a USB adapter. The USB adapter can be plugged into any USB power source, like a phone charger or a power bank. The solar unit can be attached to either a stake or a screwable mount (screws are provided).The back of the solar unit features two switches: on/off and flashing. When on, the light comes on automatically at dusk. Unfortunately the small panel does not generate enough juice to provide more than a few hours of illumination out of a full day of sun, but that's plenty.These lights can be used as holiday lights, tree lights, but their very simple and bare nature also makes them ideal for creative projects. The USB adapter makes it also very easy and convenient to power them off an inexpensive battery pack to get extra long illumination times on long winter nights.

"I recently purchased an Apple Watch and realized that a charging stand is a must, not just because it keeps the cord and watch tidy, but also because it keeps the base and cord in place when the watch is in use.This bamboo stand is beautifully finished and comes with a holder for both the Apple Watch and a phone. There are grooves to run both wires to the back. My Apple Watch charging base fit perfectly, and the groove makes it obvious to see how to run the cable.I use an iPhone 6 Plus with a ZVOLTZ battery case and it fits (barely) standing up straight and being plugged in, although a phone with a thinner case will be more at ease.The bamboo looks really beautiful and the finish is very smooth and pleasant to the touch.If you have an Apple Watch you need a charging stand for it, and this one is an excellent choice I recommend wholeheartedly.[sample provided]","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N02WM0XT2LAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010L2PJKW#wasThisHelpful","R1N02WM0XT2LAT","AVPNQUVZWMDSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVPNQUVZWMDSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like many people these days I'm a sucker for those cooking shows where experienced chefs explain to you how important it is to have a high quality knife and keep it sharp. So, of course, I buy quality knives and keep them sharp. And every single frickin time I sharpen my fancy knife and start chopping vegetables I end up cutting myself.A while back I saw that the sandwich making person at Safeway used a chainmail glove and lined it with a thin plastic glove, so I bought one. Unfortunately, I could only find one size and it was a little tight. Also, it's quite heavy and somehow restricts motion and ""feel"".These gloves are completely different: they come as a pair and in a variety of sizes, and instead of being made of metal they're simply made of a cut-resistant fabric. They're much more lightweight, and maintain the feel of what you're doing: they're just a good protection, and it's just like wearing very lightweight thin wool gloves.

"I live in an area with pretty crowded airwaves and never had much luck with FM adapters, and I've tried a lot of them since the early days of the iPod, so I was curious to see the performance of this one. Earlier models required locating an unused area of the FM band, which is a tall order around here.The Mpow Streambot is comprised of a long cigarette lighter adapter (about 3"") which also doubles as a USB power adapter, a clever idea; and a control unit at the end of a 3"" gooseneck.The control pod features a ring to set the FM frequency (displayed numerically on the red LED readout), track +/- controls, a volume control ring (U00-U16 is displayed on the readout when adjusting the volume) and an action button. Pairing is easy, the device appears under the name ""MPOW"" in the bluetooth device list.The action button triggers the phone's vocal assistance feature if available. The microphone for hands-free operation is located to the left of the LCD readout.Just out of curiosity, I set the frequency to that of a powerful local radio station, which is likely to be the worst possible operating conditions I'll ever encounter. To my surprise, the radio broadcast went completely silent and my music played loud and clear, without any interference. The sound quality is really good, with practically no background noise or hiss, just a slight hint of over modulation sometimes, characteristic of FM.STRONG POINTS-------------------------- built-in USB power outlet for a phone- simple design, small and easy to remove- music playback and hands-free speakerphone features with easy to access action button- well designed control, easy to operate without looking- Surprisingly good sound, overpowers even strong FM signalsLIMITATIONS-------------------- It's an FM transmitter -- the audio quality, while excellent, is no match for an auxiliary line input, but FM is the only option on many older vehicles.- The design requires a cigarette lighter outlet in a location easily accessible from the driver's seat -- usually not a problem on older vehicles which are the very ones that also happen to lack an AUX input.CONCLUSION--------------------By far the best FM transmitter adapter I've ever used; actually, the only one I ever used that actually works and works well.

"This waterproof case is lightweight and adds minimal bulk to the iPhone 6 Plus (only 1/2"" thick) while maintaining access to all the buttons and ports. The Lightning port is protected by a hard plastic flap, the headphone port by a rubbery plug, volume +/- and power buttons are extended to the shell with , and the mute switch (the hardest one to do since it's not a push button) is taken care of by a clever up/down toggle.The plastic film protecting the screen allows excellent tracking (despite the added thickness of the tempered glass screen protector I had already installed), and even better, the film on the TouchID button preserves the fingerprint scanning feature, which works beautifully.The case comes with a microfiber cleaning cloth, a screw-on headphone cord pigtail should you wish to use the headphone port, a wrist strap that can be attached to the bottom right corner of the case, a very clear instruction booklet, and a puzzling hot pepper-shaped red plastic thingie.You discover what the red pepper thingie is for when you try to open the case... it's sealed tight. You can use the plastic tool as a wedge at the bottom right of the case. Mind you, a quarter will work just fine too, but you have to admire the branding flair. Nice touch.The case is made of only two parts, front and back, which assemble with satisfying ""snap"" sounds. You must verify the silicone gasket is not damaged before closing the case. Note that you can't assemble or disassemble the case if the Lightning port protection flap is closed.The manual recommends doing a test run by immersing the case and maintaining it underwater for half an hour. I kept mine in for an hour, and the interior was perfectly dry, so I know my expensive iPhone will be protected.HIGH POINTS--------------------- Adds minimal bulk to the phone- Easy to install and remove- Preserves access to all buttons and ports, including fingerprint recognition on TouchID- Compatible with an ultra-thin tempered glass protector- Short, clear and well written instruction manual- Wrist strap, can be used to attach a keychain buoy- InexpensiveThis is a perfect case if you're going to use the phone near water: water rides, boating, at the pool or hot tub... A small price to pay for peace of mind.Highly recommended.[sample provided for review]","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R316KSPYLEYQ7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VMF06EM#wasThisHelpful","R316KSPYLEYQ7S","AVPNQUVZWMDSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVPNQUVZWMDSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 12,000mAh battery comes with fairly standard features (one 2.1A port, one 1A port, charging via microUSB). There is enough juice to refill an iPad Air 2 and still have enough left to recharge an iPhone. The case is very thin (only 1/2"") and 3"" x 5 1/2"", and lightweight (8.7oz). Both sides are made of a smooth, textured hard plastic, and the edges have a chrome finish. It's beautiful and fits easily in any pocket, and its rounded corners and smooth shape will ensure that it doesn't damage your clothes.There's no need to look for the power or charge test button: a little shake does the trick and illuminates the 4-LED ramp.According to the manual this is also needed to turn on the power, but in my experience just plugging in a device was sufficient -- YMMV, as they say.It takes about 8 to 10 hours to restore a full charge once the battery is near depleted (only 1 LED left) using an iPad power adapter.I like the finish, capacity, small size -- and the low price! An excellent value.[sample provided for review]","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH05AJ3CRZONM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XFZ40EO#wasThisHelpful","RH05AJ3CRZONM","AVPNQUVZWMDSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVPNQUVZWMDSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bluetooth speaker has a convenient size (about the size of a kid's juice box) yet it delivers a nice, crisp, well balanced sound without much distorsion at reasonable volumes (it's loud enough for a bathroom or a dorm room). It also has a hands free speakerphone feature.The non-replaceable battery is recharged via a micro USB connector (cable provided). There is also an AUX stereo minijack input (cable provided). And it even comes with a wrist strap so you can hang it from a hook or your bicycle handlebar.Playing at reasonable sound levels, you can easily get the promised 8 hours playback time and more. The speaker is waterproof, so there's no problem with leaving it on a bathroom countertop, or taking it camping or on a hike.I like to listen to internet radio on my phone in the morning, but the built-in speaker is not loud enough. Now I can leave my phone charging on the nightstand and take this speaker with me to the kitchen and the bathroom, and listen to the news while I have breakfast and shower -- I can even answer a phone call with wet hands without worrying about damaging my phone.This little speaker delivers a lot for the money.  Long battery life, speakerphone, decent sound, small size, waterproof, and even better -- it won't break the bank.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15CLN3PYTTA93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZZUC30A#wasThisHelpful","R15CLN3PYTTA93","AVPNQUVZWMDSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVPNQUVZWMDSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This battery packs enough juice to recharge a fully depleted iPad Air to 100%, and have plenty of power left. That's no longer an exceptional feature, and neither is the convenient built-in LED flashlight.However, the three USB ports are an unusual option (most batteries only offer two ports) and even better, they are ""smart ports"" so you don't have to squint to figure out which one is the high current port for your tablet: all ports can adjust to the needs of the devices that are plugged in, up to a total of 3.9A -- essentially, one tablet, one smartphone, and one accessory.The really great feature of this battery is the fast charge port: most external batteries recharge using 1A current, but this one can take advantage of a more powerful 2A (like what an iPad charger provides) to charge twice as fast: 8 hours is enough to recharge an almost fully depleted battery.With its huge capacity, fast charging and very reasonable price, this battery is a must have tool for the road warrior -- it makes a great stocking stuffer.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31T1MXWOF96Z0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZZN6J0W#wasThisHelpful","R31T1MXWOF96Z0","AVPNQUVZWMDSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVPNQUVZWMDSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:04 Mins This natural wood aromatherapy diffuser is beautifully finished and runs very quietly (you can check on the attached video, I captured both segments using the same settings so you can get an idea of how much noise it makes)Fill it up using the cup provided, making sure you do not overfill it, close it up, plug it in, press the button and presto! a calming scented mist emerges from the stack (I almost expected Barbara Eden!)There are two buttons hidden in the back: the top one turns on the mister, the bottom one the lights.On the bottom of the lower part towards the front are two very bright LEDs, one red and one blue, to indicate power and light function.The light function turns on colored LEDs inside and cycles through a constantly changing color, fixed colors, and off. I assume the original designer intended for the mist to serve as a light guide and provide a beautiful light show. That's a great idea, and maybe my mister is defective... I can clearly see the light changing by looking down the chimney, but even in the dark, the mist doesn't carry the slightest amount of visible light. It's a little disappointing to have included this feature if it's not going to work... I'm assuming it's because the same mist engine part is being reused in a variety of misters, but it's confusing to have this button that does not do anything detectable.Apart from this minor gripe, I'm thrilled with this product. It's useful, quiet, but also very beautiful and quite a conversation piece.Since some people mentioned difficulties opening it to refill it, I included a segment showing how to do that in the second part of my short video, I hope it will help.An unusual mister that works well and looks great.

"The specs on this battery are very ordinary: one 2.1A USB port, one 1A port, LED ramp power indicator, microUSB 1A charge port. The 10,400mAh is high, but there are higher capacity batteries on the market.The FP10 improves on its competitors on two points: size and quality.- Size: using Lithium Polymer packs instead of the more common Lithium Ion cells, it stores the same amount of energy in less space. The case is only 4 3/4"" x 2 1/2"" x 3/4""- Quality: The case is made of extruded aluminum, which gives it a sturdy and posh finish. One end features all the ports and switch, the other has a mirror and white finish with all the technical information easy to read, as well as a QR code that will take you to the manufacturer's product page (it works! I tried it)It comes bundled with a very convenient short noodle-style ""octopus"" cable (USB to microUSB, microUSB 3.0, Apple 30 pin and Apple Lightning) which should take care of all your charging needs, and a very nice lined fabric drawstring pouch with an external pocket for the cable.A battery that is not only convenient, well built and well thought out, but also impeccably finished, so it also makes a great stocking stuffer for the road warrior.Recommended.[sample provided for an unbiased review]","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QMW11CD3MIGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NV8ZEJK#wasThisHelpful","R1QMW11CD3MIGC","AVPNQUVZWMDSX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVPNQUVZWMDSX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This 2.6ft long noodle-style USB to microUSB cable features a MFi-certified microUSB to Lightning adapter secured to the microUSB tip by a springy plastic coil, so it can be used to charge pretty much any phone, tablet and modern electronic gadget you have. The MFi certification guarantees that you're not going to get an angry message from your iPhone saying that you're using an incompatible device: it just works like an OEM cable.This is an ideal cable to keep in your computer bag or travel bag if you're a road warrior: it's short and doesn't take a lot of space, the noodle-style makes it easy to wrap up, you can use it to charge and sync anything, it's the cable you want to have handy at all times.For some applications a longer or Lightning-only cable may be better indicated, but you can't beat this one for convenience.

"This flea control ingredient combination for my 5 rescue dogs just has never worked. This is the same formula as Hartz & other over the counter flea control which is absolutely worthless in the hot flea infested summers in the South. (see my specific ingredient info.)I also have never liked that you had to place this type product all up and down the dog's back.Frontline and K9 Advantix are more expensive unless you buy the generic Frontline, which I have been doing but they do work!!  I do not see where the ingredients are posted on the product's web page here and there is no close up of the pkg available to actually READ what the ingredients are. I just assumed (should never do that) that because of the high cost, it was the same ingredients as Frontline....Not so.....A reviewer incorrectly stated that this product is the same as K9 Advantix. IT IS NOT ! The active ingredient in K9 Advantix is imidacloprid.It is NOT off patent so there can be no generics made. This product's main ingredient is permethrin which is the same as Hartz, Sargents and any other cheap flea control you can buy at your local grocery store.

"For some reason, it's not working as long on my pets as it has in past years. It barely lasts a week so I have had to go to topical flea control. Last year, this was all I used and I had no fleas. I don't know if the fleas have built up an immunity or what but it's just not working this summer. When I saw on the label that it's supposed to last up to a month, I thought that was a stretch. So for the money, I think I'll skip buying this next year and stick with the topicals which do seem to last longer. I'll just use this as a back up for spot control.

"The reason that I gave this case just 3 stars is that it does not have the port covers that the ULAK for less money has. I just don't think protects my phone as well as the ULAK case does and I also think it's important to cover the ports to keep the dirt out. I knew this case didn't have the port covers but I thought based on the great reviews that it would be a good back up cover in case I didn't like the ULAK case, which turned out not to be the case. So I'll keep this one on hand but I much prefer cases that cover the port openings.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10SAKLHQSKO1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VSNDUH8#wasThisHelpful","R10SAKLHQSKO1J","A1KWLSHD6O5V9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KWLSHD6O5V9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initially I didn't care much for this cover. It was hard to get on and off but since I have dropped my phone several times on my driveway and the phone was not damaged, I think this is a terrific cover for the price. Yep, it is a bugger to get on and off....No double about that. Broken finger nails speak to the difficulty. But it does what it's supposed to do: it protects the phone. I installed my own glass screen protector so I'm happy with the way the case performs for the money. I especially like the port cover which are working way, way better than an Otterbox case that I had.

"I would not use any other kind of vacuum bag ! Ever ! I have several models of the Windtunnel upright vacuums ranging in age from old to almost new. I first tried the Hoover paper bags and was over come with the dust that the vac put out during the vacuuming process. So when I discovered these bags through GoVacuum I ordered them and have never looked back.  I am a long time animal rescue volunteer so I always  have multiple animals in my home at any one time. Currently I have 5 dogs and 6 cats. That is a lot of hair and add to that I am highly allergic to dogs and cats and I must have a vac that has good filtration. These bags do the job! If I had to say anything negative, I would have to say that sometimes I don't think they get full enough but animal hair can be very deceiving in quantity so I have to squish the bag to ensure it is full and needs to be changed....plus the light on the vac tells me to change the bag.  So I highly recommend these over the paper bags with the pleats on each side and are oblong. They just do not do a good job of filtering the air for me and I think they are harder to attach to the vac.  So this type of bag is a 5 star product for me !","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6PJMBWPN8KP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009BTPI76#wasThisHelpful","R6PJMBWPN8KP4","A1KWLSHD6O5V9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KWLSHD6O5V9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This just sent me to the ER: I was vacuuming my stairs and was on the 3rd step and the vac was on the landing. All of the sudden out of no where, the vacuum came down the stairs, the handle jabbed me in the throat and chipped my collar bone !!!  The vacuum fell on top of me and I went down the stairs with the vac on top of me.... Thankfully I was able to grab on to the hand rail to break my tumble.This vac has a terrible center of gravity and this is not the first time it has fallen over while I was vacuuming from mildly pulling on what is supposed to be a stretch hose.....NOT so.....It is way too tightly coiled to be of any use.This is going to the dump. It's too dangerous to pawn off on someone else. I am done with Hoover vacuums until they design them to be better balanced. I do not have this issue with the Eureka that I use in my lower level.

This is a perfect example of ""you get what you pay for"".....NOT MUCH !!!.UPDATE: August 20, 2015: I am so impressed with the Customer Service of this company ! I received the nicest e mail regarding my comments asking me if there was anything they could do to make my purchase right ! What company actually has personnel in customer service who READS the reviews of purchasers??? Apparently they do ! We have e mailed back and forth and it turns out that they had a newer model that is probably more of what I had in mind for a smart phone and I'm going to buy it. I also suggested that they update the product information on this product that is woefully lacking in tech information. I am told that is in the process of happening also.So I am updating my review to 4 stars because of the fabulous responsive customer service of this company and the fact that this phone may be right for someone who does not have the exact requirements in a phone that I do.

The screen is bright, the signal is strong and so far I am pleased !The 920 is another story: no wifi connection at my house, did not recognize my SIM card  (this is a HUGE problem per Google) and even after downloading updates on my neighbor's wifi, still no Cortona despite 8.1 being downloaded.

I cut her hair almost to a surgical cut so that makes her feel good too.

"I'm an artsy fartsy kinda senior lady who has done all manner of DIY projects and have used Contact Paper in ways even the Contact Paper people never envisioned That said the only way I can describe this product is ""from hell"" ! It was a nightmare to TRY to use. Even with help we were both at our wit's end with attempted installation of a 36 x 41 piece on an end counter top. We attempted to practice great patience & watched so many videos from various sites I think we could have made a pretty good one IF we had been successful.  First of all the paper is wound way too tight in a roll. There should be some other way to ship this product out besides wound in a tight roll....Perhaps shipped on a piece of flattened cardboard with rounded edges like fabric is put on....We even cut our piece one day, put weights on the corners over night and came back the next day to work the piece. It did no good. As soon as the weights were removed, it rolled back up as if it had never been flattened or....attempted to be flattened. It was as if the backing was smaller than the top vinyl piece and so there was just no way it was going to lay flat. When we held it down with our hands on each corner, you could see the top had bubbles and rolls all in it....  We used the ""wet method"" which is supposed to be easier but it was not. The backing did not tear cleanly off the vinyl front....We had to get tweezers to pull the backing off when it came off in pieces and apart....Picture pulling the backing, which is coming off in pieces and the paper is STILL CURLING !!! Gr-r-r-r-r-r  To shorten this story, we trashed the piece and I ordered a faux granite painting kit for less than what this ""experiment from the devil"" cost.I just can''t recommend this product under any circumstances to anyone.

"These arrived 2 days after the maximum delivery date...From China, of course. I should have known better.They are thin. They are contoured to some small extent but the major problem with these and the reason they went straight in the trash can, is that they do not block the light. Light comes in all around the nose area no matter how the mask is adjusted on your face. It just is not designed or made well. So for $3.07 they are a total waste !Do not recommend under any circumstances: long delivery time, crammed into a teeny tiny plastic envelope and above all, they do not fit well enough to block the light around the nose and nose bridge area.

I also did not get sick when friends all around me were sick with the ""crud"" so I felt like I had a strong immune system thanks to the good bacteria in my gut.

To the contrary, I've been sick with a cold for a few days, had an upset stomach and gastro problem before the cold set in.

"A friend just gave me her iPhone 4 since she got a new 6 on sale at walmart. She said she paid ""a lot"" for this Otter Box cover which is in pink. I'm having to replace it. I have no idea how long she's used this phone/cover.  The covers for the various ports do not stay in place but stand out from the phone cover waiting to be torn off. They will stay for a couple of seconds if I really cram them into the opening (this can't be good) but they pop out and the covers just hang open. The right hand top of the outside cover is stretched out of shape so that it no longer hugs the curves of the phone on the top right. In addition, the covered part at the bottom that rests on top of the button is also stretched so that debris can get into the phone case, which it did. When I took the case apart, I was shocked at the amount of dust and debris that was inside the cover. She said she carried the phone in her purse most of the time. Probably what most women would do.  Because of the shape of this cover, I won't order this kind again. I am willing to pay more to get a better cover.

"Fits my rescue Italian greyhound well and he looks so ""hot"" in it and he knows it. It does need to be rolled up when he goes out to pee and during the course of pulling it back down on his back, it's now beyond his tail ! So it does stretch out a bit if you pull on the fabric. That said, it washes and dries much, much better than a light blue one by another maker. This one is well made and I think will hold up over time.I like the fact that it has a reinforced hole for his dogcollar loop to click on the leash. The other shirt did not have that and I had to pull the dog collar loop out on top of his collar to attach the leash....

"I bought this from nothing but savings dot com for one hundred seventeen dollars, no sales tax and free shipping. It was delivered on time. I gave the lower price to Amazon but they would not match it so I ordered it from this other seller.The stove is plastic, of course. It appears to be well made, however, there was something loose rattling around in the stove. It turned out to be a tiny silver screw when I removed the back panel. This is the fault of the maker who obviously has zero quality control.The ""flame"" is really disappointing ! It is not nearly as realistic as the Duraflame stoves that I have in other rooms in my home. There is a stationary piece of metal that has been cut out in the design of a ""flame"". So when the ""flame"" is turned on this shadow is stationary and does not move. There is a small area that has the moving flame effect which is a roller of alumnium rectangular cut outs that rolls over the 2 light bulbs. (not LED) I tried to capture this in the pics I will post. (The picture of the stove on the web page totally, totally, totally misrepresents the ""flame"" effect in the stove. Do not be fooled !)IF the flame had been more realistic, this would have been a killer stove with the viewing area on 3 sides, but as it is, it's just barely acceptable and will never ever be confused with a real glowing flame. The glow of the logs is good and there are many logs. That's probably the best feature of this stove. It's a shame the flame is so cheesy. It is not close to the quality of the new 3D flame effects on stove not much more money than this one at the lower price. Comfort Glow has a long way to go in perfecting a realistic flame !!!The controls are behind the door. There is a dial for changing the temp. An on/off power switch and an on/off for the flame. There is only 1 setting for the flame.I will use this in my breakfast room this winter. I plan to buy 4 brick pavers to put under the feet to raise the height a bit and improve my viewing area from the table. Cheesy or not a ""fire"" is mentally warming in the cold winter !Regarding the heat output: it's still too warm here for me to run the heat feature. I will update this review as the temps fall and I begin to use the heater. For now I can only comment on my disappointment with the faux flame part of this stove. But I am not disappointed enough to return this. I just would not recommend this model or order it again, of course.(Sorry but this page does not offer the option to add pictures. I don't know why.....)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6Z6MA1L88OHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EOATFL2#wasThisHelpful","R6Z6MA1L88OHJ","A1KWLSHD6O5V9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KWLSHD6O5V9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought a big bottle of these at Costco about a week ago. I wanted to get off the Prevastatin that I have been on for years. It had no side effects but I wanted to try a ""natural"" alternative.My physician recommended red rice yeast. Not knowing they came in capsules, and never having had any issues with taking large tablets, I bought the big bottle at Costco.Big mistake ! The short time these tablets are on the back of my tongue are enough to almost make me vomit and if I do get them down with a glass of milk, the taste stays in my mouth forever. I can't seem to overcome the taste with peanut butter or any other food. I mean the red coating is just disgusting !So I am trashing these before I even find out if they work due to the horrible red coating on the tablets.Another 1 star reviewer has addressed what the red coating is made of, which may answer why these tablets are so disgusting to take.

"Got it for much less money on nothing but savings dot com. One hundred seventeen dollars with free shipping and no sales tax ! What a deal ! I love this stove. It heats up my breakfast room in the morning in nothing flat and I get to watch the pretty realistic flames from the kitchen due to the 3 sided box.I also like that the infrared heating does not dry out the air as my central Trane propane powered unit does. All forced air furnaces dry out the air and my house was loaded with humidifiers in the winter before this little stove. I'm going to save a fortune on humidifier filters !

"I bought this for a close friend as a house warming gift. She was here when it was delivered so I had an opportunity to see some pieces right out of the box. The pattern is nice but the carving knife was not nearly as heavy as I had hoped. Also on one side of the knife handle, there were numerous scratches while the other side was flawless....I did not make a big deal out of it since it's not a piece that will be used that often....but I do wonder what the handles on the other pieces look like and I intend to bring up the subject with my friend shortly . I'll update my review as I get more information from my friend. It was a good price for so many pieces but I hope this is not a case of being too good to be true and the other pieces have scratches on them too....Stay tuned. The jury is out on this set for now.UPDATE AUG.22,2014My friend reports no rust spots so far. She lives in rural Georgia and is on well water so she has an issue with spots at times despite using several kinds of dishwasher detergent. She says the spots wipe right off. This set is being used by a family with children so it gets a work out each meal. She said that the bottom of a fork says: ""18/10 stainless Made in China"". There is no name of the manufacturer or name of the pattern. It's probably sold under a number of different pattern names, depending on who is selling it. She likes it !

"I bought two of these for forty dollars each on amazon.com prime shipping about 2 wks. ago. Now I see they are temporarily out of stock. Glad I bought mine when I did !I have 2 wing chairs that needed a cover to protect the fabric from 5 rescue dogs who think it's beneath them to nap on the floor.... These were wrinkled when opened but as they suggested, I put them in the dryer with a damp towel and they came out almost wrinkle free.The fabric is like a canvas duck but made of poly. (I ordered sage which is true to color) It has a very slight sheen to it. It has nice sewn in tags that tell you where each piece goes. It went on in a snap. It fits almost perfectly and much better than any other style I've tried. The wing part is a little too pronounced so I'm going to put it on wrong side out and re fit and sew to more closely to  follow the lines of my chair. This will be easy since the fabric is not all that thick and the other edges are serged for strength. The front T cushion fits perfectly with no adjustments needed. Just the wing part needs to be taken in a bit. The length covers the legs and the front inverted pleat gives a more finished look to the cover. It does not look custom made but it's good enough for me....dogs or no dogs.....Oh and it has 2 ties in the back on each side to pull in surplus fabric which is nice and makes the cover fit even better. Also the original fabric is a stripe and it CANNOT be seen through the chair cover fabric. So no issues with see thru.....I highly recommend and hope they get more in stock soon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35F90W1MZMYAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A8EBKO8#wasThisHelpful","R35F90W1MZMYAM","A1KWLSHD6O5V9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KWLSHD6O5V9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Purchased this in ""expresso"" not expecting much for the price but praying I would get lucky and get a decent finish on the table.Wrong. It was a mess: gouges on the sides, paint chipping off, the inside of the legs not finished and the outside of 3 of the legs had the finish rubbed off in places. This was either produced on a Monday morning or a Fri. afternoon in China. It was packaged very well but it was packaged with all these defects. The bottom shelf had no pre drilled holes for the supplied 4 screws. I knew it would be expensive to return to amazon.com and I had no expectations that a replacement would be any better. The worst part was that I really needed a table this size and with this configuration. So I asked amazon.com customer service what alternative they could offer me and they came back with 4 options. I chose a 30% discount of $10.85. I will end up sanding this piece down and completely refinishing it.It is veneer over particle board.

It's not that this lap top shows colors being ""off"" all the computers and tablets in my house show a beautiful sort of robin's egg blue and nothing close to what I received.Frankly, these look like rags in an auto shop....that dull drab gray.....They are going back as the valances did.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EY4F1LPZ0LJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FDPXUYU#wasThisHelpful","R2EY4F1LPZ0LJ1","A1KWLSHD6O5V9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KWLSHD6O5V9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the bright white I wanted but the sewing leaves a great deal to be desired. One end of the rod pocket on 1 panel has left raw edges showing. Rod pocket sewing lines are off but not enough to make a difference. Ditto the bottom rolled hems. No deep hems on these panels.So for the staging that I needed, they will be fine.

"I ordered 6 panels from ""1kidandaheadache"" seller,. The pic shows a nice deep hem. That was a huge selling point for me.What I received was 6 panels of the cheapest sheer fabric I've seen in a long time, NO deep hem. A rolled  bottom hem of about 1/4 inch and very poorly sewn at that. I held the sides together and one end is longer than the other by 1.5 inches. There is no side hem on either side. The top rod pocket was a mess also. Sewn crooked and right in the middle of the lower sewing line, the sewer nicked....picked up a piece of the sheer curtain, in the sewing line and so the panel would never be able to hang down straight !Frankly, the Dollar Stores have better quality than this panel I opened. By the way, these are ""no name"" panels. Nothing in the clear package but a panel.I have e mailed the seller for paid return shipping and a full refund including my initial shipping charge. I saw on another sheer panel product here on amazon.com that this seller has a product currently under review for ""inventory problems""....No wonder !!!What I received was garbage & crammed into a mailing envelope I'll never be able to re use. Someone had to use a crow bar to gets 6 panels in the envelope.

"The black design is actually braid or ribbon stitched on the white sheer fabric. Gives a great dimensional aspect to the valance. I can see why it would be dry clean only.

"OK call me a comforter snob. This did not impress me at all. The microfiber cover is thin and not all that soft. It's not brushed. Just plain thin microfiber. Absolutely nothing special about it at all.This is a thin, thin, thin comforter ! It is for summer use only. The way the seller has pictured the corners, you can't tell that the corners are NOT sewn down and there is a large area on each corner where the stuffing is free floating in between the top and bottom and when washed will most certainly sink down into one of the open areas of the comforter. There is a Greek Key like sewing design so only every other square is sewn through with the bottom (or 4th side of the square) leaving the corners completely open !!! What this means is that the entire perimeter of the comforter is not sewn through leaving this extremely thin filling to shift and bunch up. When I rubbed my thumb and forefinger on the top and bottom of the comforter, I could tell the filling was so thin I just felt the top and bottom polyester cover.How this comforter has gotten such rave reviews is a mystery to me based on what I received. This is something I think would be comparable to a dollar store or maybe a Walmart ""special purchase"" comforter. Certainly terribly over priced for what you get !!!And looking at the outside package of the comforter, there is no country of origin information given. You would not know where it is made but the inside tag of course, says CHINA.....I hate to say it but this may end up in a dog bed cover as stuffing for one of my 4 ft crates for my dog. It's just too thin on its own. (note no weight information is given on the amount of stuffing....) No wonder !!!UPDATE: MAY 21, 2014. About a month ago I washed this comforter on gentle and dried per instructions in dryer with a couple of tennis balls to ensure it dried evenly. The dog bed cover was washed separately. You would not believe the pile of junk that I removed from the dryer. As I anticipated, all the stuffing in the corners was wadded in little balls. Mostly there is NO stuffing in the corners. To add to the lousy quality, the inside fabric has apparently frayed, loose threads have become entwined with the stuffing and now pull one side from the inside so that the comforter will not lay flat. I am going to have to rip open the comforter, cut the frayed threads to free them and re sew the comforter so it will lay flat in the dog bed cover.It seems all of us that have rated this piece of over priced junk have had exactly the same issues: the filling does not stay in place nor does it stay flat but becomes wadded balls of stuffing leaving large areas of the comforter with no filling whatsoever. For what it is worth,I am e mailing the seller to complain just to let them know how lousy this product is. It's too late to return it but I won't be fooled by this company again ! Far and away, this is the very worst shopping experience I have had on amazon.com !","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TYOCHLW9MEFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008N31RNA#wasThisHelpful","R1TYOCHLW9MEFD","A1KWLSHD6O5V9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KWLSHD6O5V9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me say that I foster cats and dogs so there is always pet hair on my carpets and area rugs. I have 2 Hoover Windtunnel upright vacs that I love but they are so heavy and have taken a toll on my shoulders pushing them back and forth. They do however, pick up animal hair extremely well on both carpet and area rugs. Not so good on hardwood but I put up with that. This is a lightweight vac which is nice. I don't think it's too loud but the fact that the only valuable feature of this vac is the rotating stair cleaner, makes it a mighty expensive stair cleaner.I tried it on my dark green carpet in the rec room which had combination dog and cat hair on it. No matter how many times I went over the same path with the carpet attachment, I could not see that ANY hair was removed. NONE ! The suction was good but the hair was just not being removed. So it's worthless on this kind of surface.Then I tried it near cat litter boxes that are on vinyl floors. It seemed to push the litter forward and not pick it up to be sucked into the vac bag. Again excellent suction but the design of the floor/carpet attachment was faulty. It just pushed the litter around. Uprights with a rotating brush just splay the litter in a 360 degree pattern so that's not a solution either. I finally drug out my Shark cordless and it sucked the litter right up. The downside to this vac is that it's not for big litter clean up jobs as the dust pan is not large & must be emptied frequently. But the trade off is that it is very, very effective on cat litter clean ups.So I am back to doing my shoulders in and using my Windtunnels with attachments and trying to balance it on the stairs when cleaning the 2 sets of 17 stairs in my home. The Windtunnels also have the rotating bush stair attachment but it doesn't work quite as well as the Eureka does.Too much trouble and expense to return so I will just donate to local human society thrift store after I clean it up of my pets' hair etc.I am just mystified as to how this vac can get such high marks and good reviews. I consider it basically worthless and grossly over priced !","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWHN62PP75ZR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019KOFEC#wasThisHelpful","RWHN62PP75ZR8","A1KWLSHD6O5V9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KWLSHD6O5V9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I don't want to have to use a hub so this is being returned.Also I had a huge issue with my lap top staying  on the cooling pad.

"I installed this water filter 4 different times. The first 3 times it kept leaking from the unit itself and not where the unit connects to the faucet. It even leaked around the handle that turns from filtered to non filtered water. I was about to return it as defective when I decided to get some pliers, a soft cloth and really screw the unit to the faucet. The 4th time was a charm and I know to remove it I will have to use the pliers and cloth again. It is on to stay !. It  did seem to waste a lot more water clearing the new filter than my old Brita did. I wish I had filled pots to measure but I had no reason to believe it would take more water to clear the charcoal out of the new filter than a Brita would. I am on a privately owned water system and our water is terribly expensive, so every drop counts. I could just see dollars running down my sink drain while I waited for the ""OOO"" on the meter to tell me the filter was ready for drinking water. It is NOT easy to see the filter. It's got a blue back light, so you have to bend down to get at eye level of the filter reader and the light only stays on 5 seconds. I won't be checking the water as frequently as I originally thought. Taste wise the water is good. No chlorine taste which was what I hated most about our water. I thought I was drinking out of a swimming pool before I began using filters. I bought this model so I could know when to replace the filter. I was tired of guessing with the Brita and it's electronic light system that failed more times than it worked. This unit is much bigger and seems to be made better than the Brita and especially the new PUR filter systems. It's plastic but it has a solid feel to it.At this point, I recommend this filter system. Just be prepared for possible connection leaks. My faucet had outside threads so no adapters, rings etc. were needed.UPDATE Feb.27, 2014:Still liking this filter and am glad I changed from the Brita to this one. I am amazed at how long this 200 gal filter will last. I guess I thought I was filtering more water than I actually was. I fill up my plastic water bottles, put them in the fridge to chill so I'll have water beside my bed at night. No more naming a landfill after all the plastic bottles I bought and used. I make my iced tea and cook with the filtered water also. I've even put filters on my shower heads to remove the chlorine in the shower water. Better for my hair and skin. This water filter is a keeper !","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AA1UWW2HFIU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VZ2LM2#wasThisHelpful","R3AA1UWW2HFIU1","A1KWLSHD6O5V9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KWLSHD6O5V9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It shows a zipper which led me to think this mattress protector was zippered around the mattress. It is NOT ! It has elastic sides just the same an any other mattress pad !Very disappointing in the fact that the item description does not say how the mattress pad is attached to the mattress.....zipper, which is pictured on the pkg. or elastic which is the reality of the mattress pad. In my experience with my long time asthma, only zippered mattress covers can really prevent dust mites. This is nothing more than a water proof mattress pad and there is absolutely nothing special about it. Even the elastic nylon tricot sides are thin, thin, thin as well as the single piece of elastic stitched on. There are much better choices out there. This is going on a seldom used guest bed or I would return it just on principal of false visual advertising. Next time I will make a written inquiry if the pic shows a zipper and nothing is mentioned in the item description. I do not recommend this for dust mite prevention. I can't address its water proof properties or lack thereof.UPDATE 1/15/2014..... the seller left a message on my phone that he was sorry that I was disappointed in the mattress protector in thinking that it was an ""encasement"" instead of being elastic. He asked me to remove my negative review and offered ""a $10.00 check for your inconvenience.""I have not responded and will not remove my review. It is true as it stands and even though the seller said they would change the packaging, there are probably thousands of these mattress covers out there selling with the misleading zipper showing on the front of the package. When the packaging is changed there won't be any negative reviews about misleading package pictures and purchasers will KNOW it has elastic all the way around the edge of the pad and NOT a zipper as shown.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R358T7D7JI6VY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ET7QBCG#wasThisHelpful","R358T7D7JI6VY4","A1KWLSHD6O5V9J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KWLSHD6O5V9J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This pack of washcloths really surprised me. I of course have tons of cotton washcloths but these ones are made of Bamboo and that made me very interested in them. So I found out that Bamboo fiber naturally prevent microorganisms and mildew from growing on the towel. Cotton washcloths towel can have a bad odor after a short period of being unwashed but this is not an issue with bamboo fiber towels. Bamboo fiber is a natural deodorant effect that can fight bacteria that causes odors from lingering on the towel. I have found this to be very true I tested both towels for the same period of time and the bamboo not only out lasted the cotton one for 2 days (that's all I gave it) in smell but how soft it was still too. The cotton one got dry and stiff but the bamboo one was still soft. As soon as I got these in the mail before I washed them they were so soft. I washed them right away and was really happy that they were still just as soft.The bamboo washcloths have bamboo fibers that cover the washcloths with loops. That is what makes the towels to feel exceptionally soft and smooth on the skin. Even after using these and washing them the towels stay silky and soft. Bamboo fiber washcloths are said to be the best thing to use on baby's sensitive skin. I am so glad I got the 6 pack and I love that they come in different colors so each one of us have a different color and my daughter and I also have the other two colors for our faces next to the sink.  Their is dark and light pink , Purple , white , light green and light blue.  The colors are great and the towels are double stitched making them really durable.

" 2:52 Mins Let me start by saying I have a addition to Essential Oil Defusers. I have many of them by None are shaped and designed quiet like this one. It is shaped like a onion and has a wood print on it and is made of a durable plastic. This one is simple and easy to use Like I show in the video. The front button can be clicked once to let it run continuously  and it will last about 3 hours or you can click it twice and let the diffuser mist every so often and it will last about 6 hours click it again to turn it off. I like how large the water container is compared to some. Aso this is easy to clean, it even comes with a little brush to help you get in the small spaces.

"I really like this travel sleep mask and pillow from NuCell Skin Solution.The pillow is a blow up one and can be blown up to be pretty firm or use less air to make it more soft. It does not take long at all to blow it up . There are little tabs on the inside neck part that fold down so you aren't bothered by the seams of the pillow ,  the pillow fit my neck perfectly and was comfy to use while sitting, and while laying down. I was also surprised at how soft this actually was. This can also be used on kids and teenagers too! This is not just a normal sleep mask!!!! There is a small liquid filled pack that comes with this set and fits inside a pocket on the sleep mask. The liquid filled pack can be frozen, so you can use it to reduce puffiness or just cool down your eyes with a refreshing chill. This can also be heated, I just grab a bowl and fill in with water and place the liquid filled pack in their then microwave it for about 30 sec or less depending on how hot you want it.. The heat feels really good and it is extremely relaxing! The mask has a elastic band that  has velcro so you can adjust to your comfort zone and is even a spot to hold the squishy earplugs to keep them from getting lost! The sleep mask is made of a satiny feeling materiel and is is fairly thick and blocked the light easily for a restful sleep. I also like that this did not leave any marks on my face. The best thing is that this comes with a matching Travel pouch making this great for planes , bus and car rides , and so on.....

"This CD-RW by Yinenn is really quite useful! My kids both have laptops and neither one of them have a CD or DVD burner in it this has allowed my kids to Burn/copy pictures, music and movies to CD that they can use later and enjoy. I like that this is really small and dose not take up any room at all and is easy to switch from one computer to the other. Also you don't need anything but what comes with this well other than the cds that you are going to burn. This simply plugs into your computers usb port to work. Insert the cd and your computer will tell you the rest but it is super easy. I also really like that I don't have to store all my pictures on my computer anymore I just burn them and add it to a CD book  that I have for the kids. Memories forever!

Aside from the setting this looks and woks Amazing it gives a better water pressure with a stunning look.

"These Glowing Cross Necklace and Earrings from DM are really fun! My Daughter was a Pirate for Halloween and we used a Pack of these with her costume! I really like that this comes with 2 separate packages so if I want to save one set for late it wont get lost or if I want to share a pack I can. Each pack comes with three crosses one is larger than the other that one is for the necklace. These crosses are just like glow sticks just bend them a little bit and they glow for hours more than all night! This has the Necklace that is more than long enough even a Adult could wear this. It is also adjustable just tie it in a knot. Their is a little piece on the necklace that the cross is inserted into. It also has a set of fake earrings that just clip on to the ear that also has the same piece that the cross slides into. The only downside is that they hurt my daughters ears so we attached them to her sleeves. No big deal it was still a fun way to add to a glowing good time! The crosses glow a bright yellow and stand out in the dark. Even after all the fun my daughter took these to bed with her they were still glowing in the morning!

"This can opener from Bru Joy is simple and easy to use.  I have a electronic can opener but I really do not like it so I gave this one a try. The things that I like about this can opener is that it opens your can on the side so 2 things don't happen 1 the nasty lid dose not fall into your food and 2 the safety edge prevents your fingers getting cut open by sharp edges of the lid.

"This yellow robot superhero toy from Inovative Games is really neat!  It comes with 117 pieces and has a battery operated motor that allows the toy to move once it's built.  I really like the bright green and yellow and it's eyes are just adorable.  The thing I like the most about this is my son has no clue that while building this he was actually learning.  Building things and seeing how they work is one of the best ways to boost a child's imagination.

" 3:10 MinsThis Bladeless Fan from Aura is something quite well.... Cool yea a small pun was intended.... Anyway this is my first ever Fan that I have ever had that dose not have Blades.  Thus idea alone makes this fan interesting and quit genius actually.  With no blades I don't have to worry about any little fingers getting hurt because all mom's know kids just can't help it. Also the design of this makes it really easy to clean no hundreds of tiny holes to have to clean the dust out of. The open teardrop shape of this looks really nice and easily snaps off and on to make it even easier to clean.  The Base of this just makes a nice thing even better!  It has a function that allows it to swivel 90Â°. Not only that but this has lights all around the base adding the ultimate touch. The base is where the fan is blows from and with the top it pushes out a good bit of air. What I really like is that this is super quite so it dose not keep me up at night.

"These Pruning Shears from Gardenite are really easy to use and come in handy. I love to garden and have many different plants and bushes , some plants will grow faster and bloom more when cut back. I have tried many different Shears but because of a broken hand I don't have the strength that I used to to be able to clip with ease. These ones from  work wonders , they are the first ones that I can actually squeeze to snip my plants.  The way that the blades are angled and how sharp they are is what makes these so easy to snip bushes and flowers.  Aside from these great things I really like that these are comfortable in my hand. carbon steel blades are ultra strong and will last longer plus they are less likely to nick or need frequent sharpening. I LOVE that they are Coated with non-stick Teflon that resists sap and other sticky materials and are  really soft and also it that also gives you a better grip.  I was not the only one in the family that was impressed with these my husband that has a much stronger squeeze really put these to the test with some small tree branches . We were both very surprised that this not only snipped it but it did not break the shears. These are really durable and last under extreme use. This also has lock on it to keep them closed safely whine in storage so you don't get hurt! The lock slides easily just apply slight pressure and slide. This also has a really neat and convenient hole that also allows you to hang these up easily and that also saves room.

"This Digital Scale by  Mesqool Ecommerce Co;ltd is really Multifunctional and that is just one of the reasons I really love this. First off let me start by telling you what I noticed first and that is the Sleek look that this has to it , it is simple yet beautiful and will look great wherever you store it. This is really thin also so it doesn't take up much room , with that and the stunning Chrome brushed Stainless Steel Surface just tops the design off.  Right out of the box this was ready to use it dose use 2 AAA Batteries but they are already included so that is a bonus for me. This works with two buttons on the front to me the less buttons the easier it is to use and this was very easy! The buttons are separated by a nice large LCD display that is easy to see and read.  This can weigh up to 11 lbs making it great for kitchen or office uses and so much more. This weighs fast and right on the nose!

"This Bag Sealer from MesmerizingSealerTM is really cool. Let me Start by saying I am not only a cook for my profession but I am also a mother of Two Kids. This Bag Sealer is something I wish I have had for years. When cooking this comes in handy, I love that I can keep my food fresh by keeping the air out it extends its life and taste way better. Like at home if you have kids like I do ALL while growing up till now my kids have always been really bad at closing bags properly. Nothing worse than going for your favorite chips and find they are stale because the bag was open! I have tried the bag clips and so many other solutions nothing worked. Until now my kids love to close the bags now and it is so easy and safe that I can allow them to do it their self! I also like that I can seal in some chicken or whatever it may be to marinate the meat in my secret spices the flavor when you do that is AMAZING!  This is RECHARGEABLE and needs NO BATTERIES!!! This factor is the best thing to me I hate things that use batteries it seems like I never have any when they die and its a pain, Charging this with a simple USB Cord that is provided ( in a awesome green color might I add ) is easy just plug it into your computer or USB station and after a hour or so you are ready to go. Mine came in charged but I plugged it in for about 10 minutes and I have yet to have to charge it, I wish I could tell you how long you can use it without charging but all I can say is a LONG time! This works like a Breeze simply flip down the safety that is where the white and black is and you are ready. I like to start from one corner and slide it to the next while applying slight pressure to close it. Their is a heating element in it that heats up and melts the bag slightly causing it to seal tightly closed.

These wipes come's in a bag with a box around it these are easy to open and close plus stay fresh until the next time.  Their are 20 wipes that are really large way bigger then my hand they also have a texture to them helping to clean your pet. Right from the package these a wet not soaked but wet enough for a mini bath and the smell is amazing very light and fresh. All you do is wipe down your pet with the towel I used this on both my dog and cat to freshen them up. Their fur will be damp but not wet and when it dries you can tell your pets a little cleaner. I love the fact that I can freshen up my pets in the winter when I do not like giving the a real bath . I also find it to be enjoyable for my dog she didn't care just thought she was getting love and the kitty didn't like it as much but was not bothered by it either.

"This wall USB Charger from plusLIFEGUARD is Awesome! Now these things are nothing new to about 90% if not more of us so we know what we are expecting. What I like about this one is it dose not cover both of my outlets some have and that is just a waste if you ask me. I really like that sleek design that this has it is simple and looks good plugged in anywhere. The fact that this has 2 USB Ports is another BIG Plus about this. The fact that I can charge 2 devices on one socket is saving room and aggravation. The Final thing that is awesome is that this wall charger is 3.1 A this is way higher than most devices so this will charge pretty much anything that uses a USB Cord and the devices will charge super fast!

"I am in LOVE with shampoos with Argan Oil in it, I never knew how beautiful these oils were until I tried some Conditioner. I really like that the Shampoo is separate from the Conditioner because sometimes I like to use a hair mask instead of the conditioner and this makes sure i'm not using it when I don't need to. I really like the bottle that this comes in and its pump nozzle that it has is so much easier than the flip ones when your hands are slippery. The bottle is 8 OZ and that will go along way because you do not need a lot of this shampoo to get a nice lather. The great thing is that this Shampoo is beneficial to ALL Hair Types like Dry , Frizzy , Itchy , Oily and so on you get the point. The Natural Oils and the Vitamins  A,B,C and D is what makes this shampoo stand out. All of these things put together gives your hair just what it need to be healthy. And healthy Hair Grows faster , Has a Natural Shine , Is so Soft , and is much Stronger. I swear by these Oils and would use nothing else on my hair.

"This Power Strip from ORICO is really a convenient and amazing product.  Nowadays I don't care who you are you never have enough plugs or USB charging room in your house. No matter who you are I know you have a room in your house that needs this. This is also great for traveling because of its small but effective design , how great would it be to have this in your hotel room...... Oh why.... Well in this little design this has so many useful things packed into it. OK first the obvious reason this has Two power outlets and it's cord is really quite long giving you a longer extension.  The cord is really heavy duty to and it protects whatever is plugged into it against power surges. Now the really great part about this is it has 4 USB ports that means you can plug your cords right into that for whatever reasons the cord is for. Charging phones and electronic devices powering humidifiers or defusers really anything that works with a USB cords.  This frees us so much outlet usage and that's a great thing for me.

"When I ordered this set of couples necklaces from UHIBROS I was hoping that my husband would wear his , I loved the design and hoped for the best.  When these came in the mail I was so excited to see them. They came in a really nice jewelry box with both necklaces inside. I immediately loved the women's one it looked way nicer in person than on the picture.  The woman's necklace is gold in color and has crystals on it in the shape of a heart.  Inscribed on the necklace is the phrase "" I am your light "" the writing is beautifully done and easy to read.  The pendant is the perfect size big enough to stand out but still delicate and feminine the pendant size is 33mm height, 8mm width. The chain is a link type chain with a lobster claw clip that is easy to take on and off. The chain is  44 CM  and can be adjusted to the perfect length for you.  Now the men's necklace is just as nice as the women's one just made a little bigger.  This one is a black color and has crystals on it also just no heart. Inscribed on this one is the phrase "" I am your shadow "" again the writing is clear and beautiful.  This pendant is a little bit bigger than the other it is 37mm height, 10mm width.  This chain is the same as the women's chain but a little longer it is 50 CM and also be adjusted to be smaller.  Each pendant is made of Titanium Steel. This metal is popular because it is light weight and really dose not need any care at all.

"This portable air humidifier by MAXTOMARS is really neat. This product is designed for travel , it is very small in shape and easy to set up and use. I love that I can use this at the office to help freshen and humidity the air I breathe.  Simply insert the skinny end of the humidifier into a water bottle or cup of water. I use a vase and added some fake flowers for it to look really nice. Now simply plug the USB cord into the slot and then in to your computer or USB hub this gives it it's power.  Now we're ready to press the button that's on the cord to turn it on or off and now we're working that easy. I like to add some oils to my water for extra fragrance it's so relaxing.

One of the main things holding me back from more stars is this comes in Assorted Colors their is 8 colors in all Red Great Orange Light Blue Navy Blue Dark Blue Brown and Purple.

"This portable power bank from MeKo is a essential item to have. I first off love that this is fairly small in size and can be stored anywhere really.  I really love the idea of having this in my purse or glove box for multiple reasons.  The biggest reason is that this has a light on the end of it. That light can come in handy for so many situations like unlocking the door at night , walking to you car in the dark , it sure would be handy if you broke down at night and so many more. I really like the simple sleek design that this has its outside coating keeps it firmly in place.  This has everything you need right on the side of it. There is a space for one usb cord , it is designed to keep dust out of the space when not in use that I thought was neat. Simply plug the cord in to begin charging you device this works for pretty much anything that charges by a usb cord. When charging their is a battery symbol that will light up showing it's charge. When that battery runs low it's time to charge the power bank. Simply use the cord that is provided and plug in to your computer or usb hub and ta da charging again you will see the battery symbol light up as it is charging. It is so nice knowing that no matter where I am or what the situation  I have this to help.

"These Knee High socks by Lucky Love are more than PERFECT! Their are a few reasons why I fell in love with Lucky Love Socks. Right away even before I ordered I saw they have a lot of different colors to choose from I liked that because I am going to buy a pair of each so I know everyday of the week I have a different color to match my outfits! When they arrived I loved the simple cute package it was in and couldnt wait to try them on they looked and felt like they were going to be comfortable. The color of the socks were just as pictured bright and vibrant. I tossed them in the washer right away on cold water and low heat and they didn't seem to shrink at all and held up nicely. As soon as they were ready I slipped these on and I loved the feeling soft and not really heavy but not thin either just right! They were a little long above the knee but no big deal  I just roll it down one or scrunch them a little either way it adds a nice touch to the sock. I seriously wore these all day washed them and wore them the next day and didn't want to take them off that's how great they fit. These are well made and I can tell will last me a very long time the stitching is tight around the toe and their are no loose strings even after washing at least 5 times. I even catch my daughter stealing them so looks like I really need all the different ones they have!

"I have recently tried hair products with Argon Oil in it and now I am hooked. The mask I use is only for once a week and I wanted something that I could use everyday that's why I tried HSI Professional Conditioner. I also got the matching shampoo I mean you have to right???? Well I know us girls do! I really LOVE the Bottle this comes in!!!! I know I know Its a bottle whys it so special????? Well its different because of the lid it has a pump bottle like a lotion bottle I have never seen this before and let me say it is convenient to have I much prefer it like this!!!!! This bottle has 8oz in it ans you really don't need a lot so depending how long your hair is it will last a good while! It smells AMAZING it has a soft floral sent but nothing strong at all. After washing your hair just put a few pumps in to your hair making sure to work in. It dose not say to but I like to leave my conditioners in for a few minutes before washing it out. This Conditioner has so many benefits to your hair because of the Natural Oils that is used in this. Like it helps restore damaged hair, makes it soft , shiny , and silky because in general it just makes your hair healthy. The Vitamin A , B , C , and D that are in this is just what your hair needs to grow! This is also Sulfate free and that means its not damaging your hair while cleaning it! I Love the way my hair looks and I can not wait to see if my hair will start to grow faster but that takes time after a few weeks I should see a huge difference!

"Let me say this Argan Oil Hair Mask by Pure Body Naturals is AMAZING for your hair, it doesn't matter what type of hair you have either! I have recently been obsessed over Argan Oil Hair products and I have tried several different things and one other hair mask so its safe to say I know what I am talking about! Their are a few reasons this one stands out from the others and the first thing is that it smells AMAZING, So Fresh with a light Floral Smell that just seems to linger in the air after you. This comes in a nice Bright Pink Jar that I particularly like and had 8 OZ in it, depending how long your hair is this will last you a few months! This is a thick and easy to apply kinda looks just like conditioner just a tad thicker. The Directions are a little different than most but not a big deal at all because it actually fits into my shower route anyways! Simply apply a generous amount to towel-dried clean shampooed damp hair, I usually wash my hair and then do my women shaving route. Use your hands and fingers to evenly distribute through hair, I have a Brush that I use for the shower and brushing it works well also. Just make sure you get the top of your scalp all the way to hair ends. Now we just leave it in and wait for 5 to 15 minutes or longer its up to you, I also have a shower cap that I use when this is on to help keep my hair out of my way. When your done waiting simply jump in the shower and then rinse. Use 1 to 2 times weekly to keep your hair strong but I don't think it would hurt if you did it more than that. I really love how I feel like I just got my hair done my hair is so shiny and bouncy just beautiful and again the smell is amazing! This mask has so many benefits to your hair like it hydrates dry hair , Strengthens your hair helping it grow , cleans the build up on your scalp , and repairs damaged hair and so much more, I love that the ingredients are from natural Oils the exact Ingredients:Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Organic Cocos Nucifera (Coconut Oil), Organic Argania Spinosa (Argan Oil), d-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Organic Rosa Canina (Rosehip Seed Oil), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Organic Coriandrum Sativum (Cilantro Extract), Wildcrafted Baptisa Tinctoria (Wild Geranium Extract), Wildcrafted Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract), OrganicAsparagus Racemosus (Shatavari Extract), Organic Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa Extract), and Organic Zingiber Officinale (Ginger Extract)I am happy to have received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VX66Q03D7I58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JEPIKE#wasThisHelpful","R2VX66Q03D7I58","A9PT2OOFZP0YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9PT2OOFZP0YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I really like the Snake chain this makes it really flexible and moves nicely on the wrist. I also appreciate that this dose not weigh very much it is actually really light. The bracelet is attached with a lobster claw design and extender that makes this very wearable for many ages and wrist sizes! I have wore this while doing the dishes and got it wet the metal did not react and it did not chip or discolor any. As you can see in the videos pictures the charms are very detailed and this was well made very durable.

"Let me start by saying yes this is a nice silky soft shirt the print is clear and well done and the stitching is very nice and sturdy. Now let me tell you why I gave this such a bad rating..... First off this says MEN'S I bought a XL for my 12 year old son. This is SO SMALL it is wont even fit my 10 year old niece and she is a bean pole! I right away contacted the seller  lovejoylife . Let me say I deal with a lot of Amazon sellers and NEVER have I been treated so rudely! All I was asking is if I could return it for a different size he told me that because I received a discount I would have to return it and buy a new one. He also added that he would not honor the price that I had bought it for. Yes I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion but I DID PAY MY MONEY for this and I AM A CUSTOMER. He completely disregarded me like I did not matter I really hope the full paying customers read this and know THIS WILL NOT FIT and THEY WILL NOT HELP YOU!!!!","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O4JWVGTE76W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011B86HK6#wasThisHelpful","R2O4JWVGTE76W","A9PT2OOFZP0YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9PT2OOFZP0YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Candida Cleanse by Purely Holistic is so far a great deal and is what I expected and I hope to see good results with this product giving it the time it needs. I really like that their is a lot of pills in this bottle 120 CAPSULES that is a  2 MONTHS SUPPLY most that I have tried are only 1 month so that is great. Also each Capsule is 630mg. This pill is made to help CLEANSE, RESTORE and STRENGTHEN your body. It is formulated to go through 4 distinct phases that is why they suggest taking it for 2 Months to make sure that it is working and keeps other virus away. I really LOVE that this is made of herbal, enzymes that have antifungal and probiotic formulation. The herbs includes Oregano and Caprylic acid, these kill the Candida, while the probiotics, restore and strengthen the immune system. This also uses no artificial flavors or colors. The directions are simple and clear but I would always ask your doctor first! The pills are not large and are easy to swallow with a glass of water. I have been taking these for a short period like I said and can not wait to update you with the final results later.

"This shirt from Virgin Only is AWESOME! I love the way this shirt fits it hugs in all the RIGHT places and is very flattering! This is great just as a tshirt or it is a nice layering piece! Looks great with just a pair of jeans!!!They are like a Stretch fitted shirt made of 95% Cotton, 5% Spandex/ 95% Rayon, 5% Spandex. I washed this in cold water and hung it up to dry and it did not shrink one bit, It still looked like new. They have so many styles of  printed t-shirt with Detailed embellishments as a part of the print it was hard to choose! My Daughter is obsessed with cats so I went with the Roaring Tiger shirt that is Pink and Black. She LOVES it!!!! The embellishments of beads on the face of the tiger really makes this shirt pop!!! The beads are sewed nice and tight on the shirt I have washed this several times now and not one has fallen off! All of her friends want to know where she got this shirt and I got extra cool mom points for finding it. The only down side that I have with this is now I have to buy more of the different designs for her!!!!

"I am loving this clock by ZhiPuAoTe TEC.ltd. They have made quite a durable and stylish clock, I got the blue but they also had black and white. I am happy with the pretty baby Blue this clock is. What I love the most about this is that their is no ticking, keeping you up at night. And no outlets to have to worry about. The fact that it has a really big LCD screen that allows you to clearly see the time and other functions from anywhere in the room is my favorite thing about this. It has so many great functions in such a small package like:A really bright and convenient Light, Just press the SNOOZE/LIGHT button and they display will light up.A repeating snooze when the alarm sounds, Just press the SNOOZE/LIGHT button to snooze. The snooze runs about 5 minutes and gets louder and louder each time you press it.You can set it to be dimly illuminated in the dark or to be completely dark while you sleep. This is really nice I have mine set to the censer so when it gets dark out it will illuminate the display according to how dark it is. Very Cool!At the bottom right of the display is the temp you can set it to C or F very easily. I find myself checking the temp in the room quite often.Right above that is the Date. Showing the month and date, again very easy to set.And above that displays the time that the alarm is set to. This is very convenient so I know what time is set I don't have to push any buttons to check.The Time can be displayed in a military format or not it is your choice.As I was saying all the functions are really easy to set on the clock, Everything is on the back of the clock clearly marked for what it dose.This clock runs off of  3 AAA batteries that are not included. Being as this runs off batteries and is so small this clock is very portable...... Take it on Vacation, Camping or just be like me and carry it from room to room!!Their are a few things I would change if I could about this and that is the only reason that I did not give this a 5 star.The main reason is the batteries I don't mind it uses and the batteries really do last long in them but it would be nice to either have a rechargeable battery or a usb charge just to make this a little more friendly to mother nature! Another thing that bugs me is the middle dots on the clock always blink I can not get them to just be steady, on most clocks I have when it blinks that means that its not set.

I also know that the quality that was put in to choosing the material and making the pajamas these are going to out last her!

They have two pockets one on each side of you, the pockets are a nice size and are super soft and warm inside perfect for keeping your hands warm! Another thing that she loved is that this has no feet, She hates her feet covered and with feet you out grow them faster. They button up the front with big buttons that are very easy to button and unbutton. Their is a secret in the back!!!! Their is a zipper so if you need to use the restroom you don't have to take these completely off. The hand and feet holes have a stretchy like material that helps hold heat in.

"This apron from Sheing is so adorable!  I went with the red and black choice in color, I like that they have various choices I'm sure their is a color for anyone.  I just love the Vintage design that this has making it simple and cute. The checkered touches in this apron are just perfect!  The bottoms and tops, tying strings and the top of the pockets. Yes I said pockets this has a nice wide and deep pocket on both side of you. These are great for so many things I like tucking a towel in one of my pockets and leaving the other free for whatever I may need it for. The checkered pocket top kinda looks like a bow to me. This ties around your waist and neck. Both string sets are very long allowing this to fit any size.  I also like that i can ware this all the way up or fold it over for a half apron. I am a cook and love to cook at home so I have  used this a lot, I've washed it so many times I can not count! Yet still the Black and Red and White still are just as vibrant as they were when I got it. The stitching is also done very nicely making this very durable. When I put this on and strut around the kitchen it makes me feel like a sexy mama! Hubby has a hard time leaving me cook when I ware this in the kitchen. The apron also has great coverage ensuring that you won't spill anything on your top or pants. Their is literally not one thing I would change about this apron!

"This Portable Trash can by Zone Tech is great! I really like that this come in sorta a combo package first is comes with a garbage can that that is great for collecting the small garbage.

I would have liked this better if the little trash bin hung differently I really like this but I really cant hang it in my car with my seat covers and things it just keeps falling off and the clip that is built in dose not work anywhere in my car but my sunroof and then I get smacked in the head with a trash bin! I wish that this had come with a clip that could be adjusted to hang from a car vent or something like that. A Suction cup bottom maybe???","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JBNFSWQOKQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010C86HG0#wasThisHelpful","R2JBNFSWQOKQD","A9PT2OOFZP0YH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9PT2OOFZP0YH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Majestic Pure's Ylang Ylang oil is Amazing!!! This is my first Ylang Ylang Essential oil and I had no idea what it was going to smell like. Let me say I am Pleased!!! It smells so good like i'm in a beautiful Garden with the Sweet Floral Aroma drifting in the air!

"Nilight LED Flood Lights are so INCREDIBLE! I used them on my dads farm at night on his old farm truck, never on the road. In fact, using these on on the road or highway would be illegal in my state, as they're THAT BRIGHT. Really, everything is illuminated with these lights on. My Dad was super impressed with these and we had a blast using these! First I did not install these but my dad did he said that these were pretty simple not a lot to it if you know about wires and things.Mounting them was simple for him he said the hardest part was deciding where to put them. They come with  a rocker assembly that you can mount first, before attaching the actual lights to the rocker assembly. Dad said that's the easiest so that it is. Who am I to question it. The look and feel of these lights are completely crazy to me it seemed like something that would be on a SWAT team vehicle or something! Very heavy duty and they definitely mean business! They are filled with high-power LEDs, which is what makes them so incredibly bright! We had a blast going through the fields at night spotting deer. And this came in handy the other night at about 3 AM a cow was stuck in the creek it was so much easier getting to her with the trucks bright lights now! We also didn't have to carry a flash light while working on getting her out this provided more than enough light! This can be used for so many other purposes like  Construction Lighting Garden, Backyard Lighting ,Boat Lighting and so many other ideas. Like I said I do not know much about lights like this and things like that but dad says it dose not use much power maybe 1.5-2 Amps..... And the fact that that truck is older than my oldest brother and has no issues running it I don't think anyone else will.

"After having a car accident and experiencing numbness in my hands when waking in the morning and tingling during the day, I talked to my doctor and he suggested compression gloves may help.So, after reading the reviews and looking at the pictures online (where it showed how to measure the size) I ordered the small size, but they were entirely too small.  After about 5 minutes of them being on, the circulation was being cut off in all my fingers.  I was going to get the size larger, but as I went to put on the the second glove, I noticed the stitching was fraying on the top of the middle finger and entire sleeve of that finger was coming apart.PRO:  the concept of compression, and ability to work with them on all day, colorCON:  Quality, sizing chart, lack of wrist support","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NI6D4U9DMITI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N4G8IQ#wasThisHelpful","R3NI6D4U9DMITI","ASK93R0CW4C2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASK93R0CW4C2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know this may sound crazy but I have gone through so many vacuums in the last 5 years of owning Saint Bernards and everyone of them stated they can handle heavy volumes of pet hair....but not so much.  When my husband told me his wet/dry vac broke (small one on sale 5 black friday's ago) it got me thinking....why don't I invest in a more powerful wet/dry vac and we can use it inside the house...not just for the cars and garage.  So instead of wasting $30.00 on a small unit for the garage, I went looking for a larger size and larger hose that I know will not have any problems sucking up dog hair.When looking at the selection on Amazon, I found myself gravitating towards this machine.  It seemed to have all the things we needed but it was not a BEAST!!  The things that were important to me were the sound, the large canister and the HP.  After reading the reviews of others and this one, I found this one really had all that we needed and even a blower (which we really don't need but will come in handy).Sound:  It is not as loud as the small one we used just prior to this one.  In fact, its about the quietest wet/dry vac I have ever heard.  Many vacuums are even louder.  Keep in mind it is a wet/dry vac, so its not like a dyson for being quiet, but its the best I have ever heard.Large canister:  Being a 12 gallon unit, it was a good size for us, not too small like the former one but not so huge that it takes 2 people to maneuver it.  But it really hold a lot.HP:  This was important because many of my former vacuums had decent HP, but that dog hair needs extra!  The HP seems to me to be more than 5 peak HP....and I have to be careful around small objects..because it can suck them up even when they are a foot away....and when I used it to clean my car, it sucked up a couple tools that were under the seat.....WOW!Hose size:  This was also very important to me.  I am tired of the regular vacuums with the small hoses, even with good HP, they get clogged with the dog hair.  This one has yet to get clogged...and between a husband that brings in the dirt, the dog hair, the dust bunnies and whatever else ends up on the floor, let me tell you that says something!Overall, this is a great unit and I have no complaints so far!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF7HFV0R5XR1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0023EY052#wasThisHelpful","RF7HFV0R5XR1U","ASK93R0CW4C2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASK93R0CW4C2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hubby drinks lots of coffee and he needed a larger coffee maker....his 4 cup was not enough....so after reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided on this one.  We were used to having a permanent filter in the other one, but this one did not come with it, however, I found a permanent filter that fit just fine into this maker.This unit is perfect size for the counter, easy to fill the water, the coffee pot is well made, not flimsy, and perfect size.

"Love Himalayan salt....used it for years....so many uses for it:  to eat, foot and body detox in tub, fill my inhaler and use it when sick, etc....and its difficult to find in this size with the ""fine"" grain (which is the eatable kind that can go through a regular salt shaker).  I was really glad to find Amazon had it in this size and at the best price!!Many friends ask me why my salt is ""pink"" and I provide them with the literature on the healing properties of pink salt or refer them to the Internet that has plenty of info about all the great things about Himalayan salt and its healing properties....as well as how it makes everything taste so much better!!  Most people think of salt as ""white"" not ""pink"" but they don't realize the pink is the natural salt and has not had the minerals stripped from it....NOTE:  Anything smaller than the ""fine"" grain, is like a powder, so if you use it for eating, order the ""fine"" grain....IF you have a grinder, get the next size up...","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25X6M4TST1Q8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVJI7KI#wasThisHelpful","R25X6M4TST1Q8J","ASK93R0CW4C2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASK93R0CW4C2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband likes to transition after working in working boots all day, into a slip on shoe at night.  And after I looked at his old ones a little closer, they had holes in the bottom, I surprised him by purchasing these new ones for him.  I had not purchased this brand before, but I thought after reading the reviews, I would give them a try.  Really glad I did!Husband loves the fit, (I was worried about the size, because so many times I find one has to go one size smaller or larger) and that varies with everyone with nearly every shoe.  So, without trying on the shoe its difficult to really get it right.  However, Amazon reviewers are great with detail and usually include the fit in their reviews.  So, I felt confident that I needed to go a 1/2 size larger than he normally wears (9 is his normal size) and the 9 1/2 fit PERFECT!  Thanks Amazon Reviewers!!They are not heavy at all, but they are not paper thin either.  Just the right feel.  He loves the suede on them, super soft!  The grip on tread is great for the outdoors and winter!  He says they are warm, but do not make his feet sweat.  He does not wear a heavy sock, so maybe that helps.  They slip-on easy and are easy to remove.  No heel slipping either.Hubby has a foot issue from when he got hurt in Iraq, so its difficult to find good supportive shoes for him.  He tells me his feet feel fine even after wearing them for hours and they give him just enough support.Really don't have anything negative to say about these shoes....will buy again....","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30S5D9MV3BCRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VWBNOG#wasThisHelpful","R30S5D9MV3BCRN","ASK93R0CW4C2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASK93R0CW4C2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Husband drinks lots of coffee, so he needed a larger coffee maker.  The small one we have (4 cups) came with a permanent coffee filter and we found that just fantastic!  No more waste of filters or wasting money...the 4 cup permanent filter worked really well for us, but it did leave a ring on the filter (after each use) where the coffee grounds topped off in the filter.  It was actually a bit ""slimy.""  I was hoping this one did not do that, but it does.  Its not that horrible, but one cannot just rinse the grounds out, one has to really clean and wipe that part of the filter.  It does leave a stain on the filter, but if you keep up with washing it daily, it does not get worse.  Not really an issue for me (because I would rather do that than use disposable filters), but it may be an issue for someone else.  Husband says it does NOT affect the taste of the coffee at all.I was also worried about what some other reviewers said that it did not fit into their coffee makers....but we found it fits perfect into the 12 cup hamilton beach coffee maker we purchased....its a #4 cone, and those should fit into any 12 cup coffee maker....We will never go back to using disposable filters, this is a keeper...hope they keep making it!

"I have been using the Bender Ball prior to getting this.  It has worked well for doing my ab workout.  I would like to work my back more but the 1 ball method is a bit harder for me since I have a neck issue.  I decided to try this item and it is working great.  It does allow me to work my back better because its level on both sides with the two smaller balls, instead of 1 bigger ball.  The Bender Ball is more flexible, but the Gaiam ball is more rugged and tougher exterior.  I think I will alternate between the two of them during my workout.  Easy to inflate.

I have never had this problem with any other sleeping bag I have purchased before...so not sure if it was just a defective item that stood alone or a bad batch....but whatever it was I was unwilling to try another bag from the same company....","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GLHQ6OJ2AIN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017S37UY#wasThisHelpful","R2GLHQ6OJ2AIN1","ASK93R0CW4C2O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASK93R0CW4C2O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is not as heavy as the other one and a bit more flimsy, but as long as you don't use it as a baseball bat, I think it will hold up fine!  The bristles are soft and less dense (compared to our other one) but they cleaning the vehicle just as good as our old one.  The great thing about these units is that they telescope and when the brush wears out, you can simply purchase just the brush part and attach it to the unit.

"SEVEN SEAS TO CALAIS (1962, 99 minutes) is a fun, sword-wielding swashbuckler of a movie with my favorite Rod Taylor as Sir Francis Drake, on a secret mission to get South American riches for Queen Elizabeth the First. It is a colorful, fun and humorous film that gave Taylor a chance to stretch all of his considerable muscles.I was deeply moved by the portrayal, since the 1960s wasn't the decade for biopics--but it was a Sir Francis any kid would be interested in learning about, fully. There were little touches between Sir Francis and Queen Elizabeth that rang true: she did give him a ring, he may have had a warm friendship with her, and the idea that she intended to execute Mary Queen of Scots is thrown into question as she admits to Sir Francis that the death warrant was meant as a warning only.The only thing they left out was the debacle of Sir Francis using the Drake coat of arms, which was an issue because he was questioned about his right to bear it. But the queen set him up with his own armorial bearings anyway. Too bad that wasn't in here. Instead there was a dopey on-the-side romance having nothing to do with anything significant.You'll howl when you see the queen eating a potato for the first time and asking why it bore such an odd name ... one of the many pleasures I leave for you to discover here. The greatest pleasure is Rod Taylor, who was in my opinion badly underused here. It's all great fun in any case, and the queen is simply hilarious.When interrupted by someone at a bad time, her normal reaction was to growl, ""Whaddaya want!!"" Just pure old fashioned fun. Get this movie and enjoy a little forgotten period in cinema history. The Elizabethan age never looked so fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10EBXP82H3U4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RNYMM4#wasThisHelpful","R10EBXP82H3U4T","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WRIGHT'S SILVER POLISH, LIQUID, 7 OUNCE BOTTLE is simply the only silver polish you need. It is nontoxic, a pleasing consistency/color, easy to use and better than you can imagine. I use it for my rings, and nothing compares. You wet the silver, put a bit of the polish on a soft dry cloth or towel, buff the silver with it. Then you thoroughly rinse your silver, buff it dry and the silver life is sweet.Wright's always amazed me because it strips dirt and tarnish like nothing I ever saw. I recall cleaning a blackened antique ring with Wright's ... in record time.  Without that acid we used to use, and if not for Wright's, that ring could never have been polished as it was.Old Joshua Wright, I think it was, lived at the start of the 19th century. His prize cow had lost her prize silver bell, and he could not find it. Returning much later in better weather, he found the bell, buried in mud but otherwise unharmed. The thing that stunned him was the high polish. That bell, Wright concluded, had been gently, brilliantly polished by Mother Earth's best mud.Wright set out to duplicate that, bottle it up and get rich. Thank God he succeeded, and Wright's is still with us. If you own silver and care about it, you can't live without Wright's. And I don't see why you'd want to do so. This is excellent for other metals, but it does leave a safe protective coating that fights tarnish: good for the silverware. You can literally polish, then eat with, your silverware in one fell swoop ... IF you use Wright's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZI2R0YANZ64O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KKIKOS#wasThisHelpful","R1ZI2R0YANZ64O","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SIGNET/MONOGRAM RING, STERLING SILVER by BLING JEWELRY is not a terrible alternative in a market where a plain silver ring can cost up to $500. The signet ring, one of our oldest traditions, does deserve a better treatment than this overly thin, hollow-backed style. The trouble is, this kind of cheaply cast ring is a must, in order to keep costs affordable.I detest such cheaply cast rings only because they always tend to have sharp edges. You can rely on a cheap ring to have a sharp/dangerous feature of some kind, usually its edges. All my life I have worn a signet, but I had one of these cheap rings as a teen for daily wear. One day I got my hand caught in a door and that damnable thing cut right into my finger. So as this product's first reviewer said, it's a shame the ring is not solid or comfort-fit. Buy at your risk.Also, you really can't get much engraved on a thing like this. A nasty little line-drawn monogram is as far as you'll get, because the bezel (the face of the ring) hasn't enough metal to accept proper, deep intaglio engraving. Therefore I specifically label this style a monogram ring style because there is no way you'll get an emblazon, coat of arms or even a decent personal cipher on it. However, I've seen lots of young people wearing these without engraving, and they look marvelous.In summation, a simple reminder: you get what you pay for or, better worded, keep in mind the cost of this item. Sure, it may be well made considering the style, but remember a crummy silver band can cost you around $100. If you like Bling Jewelry's offering, then go to it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LOSVL6UOQKIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJE8038#wasThisHelpful","R2LOSVL6UOQKIQ","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"APOCALYPSE: WORLD WAR ONE (a.k.a. APOCALYPSE WWI, 2013, 5 parts, approx. 1 hour each, Canada) is one of those pure, excellent documentaries which it infuriates me to see omitted from the usual dvd canon of (bad) war documentaries. This seemingly humble work is the pinnacle of the genre: it is the opposite of bad.With the intelligent, gentle narration of well spoken, multilingual French Canadian actor François Arnaud (ne FranÃ§ois Barbeau), this features a no-chicken-bones approach to the war, in five parts. What stunned me was not the exclusive WWI footage, which comprises this entire film. What stunned me was the perfectly restored clarity of that footage--and the beautiful colorization of it. No talking heads and no need for any.Such quality in every detail is the thing I love, that rivets my attention and holds it firm. As a scientist, I love seeing clean, accurate footage of what the people wore, how they comported themselves. The only thing I find unnecessary is the foolish addition of sound effects to footage that sees its centennary birthday, and therefore has no sound. Color is one thing, and I applaud it. The Foley artist, on the other hand, has no place here anymore than a reenactor.This is so wonderful I was furious I could not find it on dvd. I will simply have to drink in all I can while I can see it on television. I feel my eyeballs will fall out after seeing face-to-face those bloodcurdling Socialist Russians who killed the Tzar and his family. But then this made me wonder why the series says nothing about Jews.Imagine my astonishment, then, to see film of Prince Faisal bin Hussein, accompanied by Lawrence of Arabia, just a few weeks away from becoming the King of Iraq. I had never seen film of Prince Faisal, let alone of Lawrence. I had no idea there was film of that campaign. This whole amazing documentary is like that--the annoying rapid jerkiness of century-old film is slowed to natural speed and full of surprises.What this show accomplished was to give a clean, sometimes quasi-anecdotal account of World War One, a war which I think is undertaught today. This program is so very worthwhile.The messy sales here are mind boggling. This is billed as ""season one"" even though it is a simple tv minidocumentary in five 1-hour episodes. As I review it I see the title of only one episode, ""Fury"". It isn't sold as a dvd set, as God intended, instead being sold in some weird way which I for one do not appreciate. It doesn't help that there are dozens of things out there that are similarly titled.This review I dedicate not only to that brave generation of a century ago, but I dedicate it also to France ... as I grieve with my French siblings, I watch this series with gravity, reflection and hope.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR1DS525NJJ8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M548OE8#wasThisHelpful","RR1DS525NJJ8X","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EVELYN PRENTICE (1934, 76 minutes) is one hell of a crime/courtroom drama. William Powell and Myrna Loy play the Prentices, John and Evelyn. John is a busy, hotshot criminal defense attorney with seemingly little time for his wife or small daughter. When Evelyn gets herself mixed up with a vicious gigolo, things turn horrid.Even worse, the gigolo turns up shot dead. This is the drama of a seemingly innocent woman accused of his murder ... and a deeper plot that explodes at the end in the courtroom scene. Powell and Loy are dazzling, modern and riveting in these final scenes. Not only does the sad truth emerge: the movie also becomes a lesson in self defense, why it is and how it is.No lover of classic movies, no lover of crime drama, can afford to miss this. I am irritated that this can only be had on dvd if you buy the Loy/Powell collection, but you can get it on VHS for whatever that's worth! In any event, see the proof of one of my favorite sayings: they did it all, and better than anyone, in the 1930s.You'll finally see how crime drama ought to be done ... by seeing the granddaddy of all crime dramas.TECH NOTE: I battled with myself about asking this in a review ... since I'm not a tech-head, I wonder if I'll ever find the reply. Aside from remastering, I always noted the films up to 1932 are sort of oozy and fuzzy. After that time, they are as crisp as a 1950s tv series. Was it budget or a leap in film stock quality? This film under review is as clear and awesome as anything can be in black and white ... but take PRIVATE LIVES or any other smash hit from just a year or two earlier and you have a creepy mudfest!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWTCQQ2VLNOWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001N3P6M0#wasThisHelpful","RWTCQQ2VLNOWI","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MR. HOLMES (2015, 103 minutes) is the finest Holmes film and story I've ever seen--and I've seen 'em all. Sir Ian McKellen gives an Oscar-worthy performance as a 93-year-old Holmes, nearing the close of his 35-year retirement in sight of the white cliffs of Dover in 1947. The beginning of Alzheimer's, which Holmes calls ""senility"", is rearing its ugly head. Or is it?His only real contact with humans is with his grumpy housekeeper and her wonderful young son. At one terrible point, Holmes famously writes on his shirt cuff the name of the boy so he won't forget it. Another name written there brings back a painful memory of his recent trip to Japan in search of a memory cure, but the film makes one wonder if Holmes is just a very tired old man, struggling to forget a trauma--or else being haunted anew when he thought he'd finally escaped it.McKellen's startling performance will frighten you at first: he really looks badly aged and that is stunning acting. He looks every inch like a nonigenarian. Everyone else in his life is long gone and his acting even conveys that. The intimacy and richness of this film will bring a tear to your eye. It is a quiet, masterful piece about a lonely old man facing his regrets before he dies. Perhaps more importantly, it is a story about how the very young and the very old need each other--a lesson our society flees as from a swarm of wasps.It is the deeply resonant power of McKellen alone that reminds us this is THE Sherlock Holmes.The Holmes makeup deserves mention. I saw Sir John Gielgud in McKellen's makeup and bearing, which only added to the delightful power of his presence. So powerful is he that he reduces everything else to mere background. Few actors have that power, and it will intoxicate you. In this era of stupid and/or modern portrayals of Sherlock Holmes, it is lovely to see what is easily acceptable as the real thing.Little touches also tell us who this character is: a beautifully understated gold aristocratic pinky ring (incidentally identical to Harry Truman's), an exquisite walking stick, a fine fountain pen, an unfailing Victorian manner. Whether you are a Holmes fan, McKellen fan or simply love the best of film, this one is a film to add to your collection. It is one of those creations that is a total objet d'art, yet one feels as if one is living it. There's nothing like this kind of living.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NYBX1CCJIUP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PIQYIO#wasThisHelpful","R3NYBX1CCJIUP8","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HAT, ""WALKER"", POLYWOOL BLEND BY STETSON (WALKING BUCKET CAP), is a nice, wonderfully made wool ""walking cap"" fedora. In my day a gentleman went to the hat shop or haberdashery and asked for a tweed hat--this is what he'd get. Today these hats have so many names, and all that fuss for a stingy-brim (1.5"") trilby fedora!It was good enough for Inspector Clouseau, and I like it well enough. The blend is brilliant, as the wool won't shrink thanks to the polyester. This design is like any other tweed, though I admit it is ""crafty"", combining a herringbone pattern with a windowpane check. The lining seems like standard cotton, very thin, and the sweatband is polyester grosgrain.The hatband is 100% matched-n-attached, bearing the little Stetson brass rivet-stud.What has to be addressed without omissions is a list of things this hat features--things that may or may not please you. The design of these really is more like a paper cup than a bucket: they narrow quickly toward the crown. The crown is way too low, so this gives a strangled feel. Also the materials are stiff as a board.This one in particular feels too tight ... it isn't, but it feels that way. A lot of quality work (and so-so quality material) went into this hat, so I wonder at a company like Stetson manufacturing these in China. The people of China I love; it's the communists I despise and they run everything there in case you did not know. So let me ask you, how would you like Al Qaida, ISIS or the Taliban making your socks and underwear?That's just about what America is doing when making deals with the communist devil. For that, and an annoyingly tight fit, I deduct two stars. It's a good buy ... however, I say buy at your own risk. The devil drives a harder bargain than you think.DEDICATION: One man who never made deals with devils was my father, who died on 23rd March 2007, aged 98. Pop had one of the first Stetsons made in this ""walking"" fedora style. It was not a tweed, it was a dark blue plush, if you can believe it. When he wasn't wearing it, I'd swipe it--this was back in the early 70s. That hat gave us decades of loyal service. So ... for you, Pop, for U.S.-made, and for ""Old Blue""!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HEJ1989DLG92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NRBK8Y2#wasThisHelpful","R1HEJ1989DLG92","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PONY BEADS, ACRYLIC, 9MM X 6MM ~These fantastic, nontoxic and indestructible craft beads are the best on earth. Whatever type of ""beader"" you are, you must know about these. If you've never used them, I suggest you find an excuse.Going back to one of the sacred arts of my early priesthood, I just laid in a supply of them for making rosaries. They are indestructible and I string them on 2mm Paracord. This makes for an indestructible finished item--whether it's a rosary, jewellery or some other craft.I'm pretty big on the durability part because when I began making rosaries, I mainly used only these beads. I have had old students tell me they still carry their rosaries after decades of use. That is what the right materials will yield. I get mine in brown, which is the color of my religious habit.And I am a Buddhist, by the way. Hindus and Buddhists invented the rosary as we now know it. In spite of my deep fondness for the Orthodox Christian prayer rope of knotted wool, I love to string my own simple rosaries. They are well used, believe me, and I mainly love to give them as gifts.This bead is so tough it is used in the military. At the same time I began doing Buddhist rosaries, a clever Army sergeant made a Catholic rosary with these. Thus began the Rosary Rangers and Rosary Army, whom you may have heard of ... and whose volunteers have provided the military with rosaries since the early 1980s. Even non-Catholics beg their chaplains for one.It may sound boastful, but it is not: great minds think alike!

"This was truly a film I never expected to see; the franchise was one I thought to be deservedly dead. I was wrong. Here we have parallel introductions, two young brothers, two sisters, a hunky velociraptor-whisperer, a terrible supersaurus and Jurassic World, which I saw immediately as based on Sea World.The rest is a clever homage to JURASSIC PARK--that is, when it's not a Godzilla movie. The director was able to pay deft homages to Spielberg--who produced this--and to my massive annoyance paid too much homage to J. J. Abrams. The acting was what I'd expect: I call it quackting and always blame the director. He wanted every male, regardless of age, to be either John Wayne or Chevy Chase. He wanted every female to be a mix of every female stereotype without any of the charm or charisma Spielberg always got from his actors.The effects are top-notch and nothing less could be expected. This is the garish, nightmarish world envisioned by the original character of John Hammond, and prophesied by Malcolm the Mathematician. Wish I could say more, but that's it. A fun, rousing action film and popcorn viewing garnered this its 4th star. The rest was frankly a waste of time.The depth, the humanity, of Spielberg's original is absolutely absent here. The messages he conveyed to a riveted audience in the mid-1990s are drowned out here, by the endless growls of dinosaurs and screaming victims. I was only glad this did not descend into the land of pure gore--the violence was bad enough. Call me grumpy but I expect more than half-baked acting covered by clever CGI. In a project overseen by Spielberg, I expect him to shine through and show us he still cares about what goes into, and emerges from, a movie.The truly great stuff just wasn't here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17J9FA7IRYHW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZHWD78I#wasThisHelpful","R17J9FA7IRYHW3","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OUR QUEEN (PAL/Region 2 UK format, Dir. Michael Waldman, Narr. Sarah Lancashire, 2013, 90 minutes) is a rich and splendid look at Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of England. While this covers all the ground and then some of the beautiful Andrew Marr documentary THE DIAMOND QUEEN--but this was done the following year during the Jubilee Year--it too is a must-have and it has some spectacular treats.I was deeply moved by the dinner Her Majesty held for all crowned heads, many who of course are her cousins. Queen Margrethe and Queen Beatrix clearly have sister-like relationships with Her Majesty. Actually witnessing that bond in a documentary is a GIFT! It is also stunning that this documentary could follow DIAMOND QUEEN, on the very heels of its conclusion. This is for almost all intents a sequel.As I have indicated, this is even richer and more special than anything done previously. DIAMOND QUEEN did not have the personal access to Her Majesty that this film has achieved. I never learned how Marr gained access, and this documentary sheds no more light on the subject. But it is marvelous.As an example of the closeness the viewer can feel here, the Jubilee events are revisited--Her Majesty, with the saddest expression I've ever personally seen on her face, had to navigate the Jubilee without His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh. He was in hospital with a bladder infection. The worry is written all over Her Majesty's face.It may have eased things a bit when Prince Charles called her ""mummy"" during the formal address at the Jubilee, and urged the crowd to cheer loudly enough for Prince Philip to hear them. I do not mind admitting I wept many times during the Jubilee itself, and this film made me squeeze out a few more tears.The documentary follows all the post-Jubilee activities, especially Her Majesty and the Royal Family. The damnable thing that has me in a tizzy is that this is not Region 1 NTSC. When are we going to stop this asinine delay--which in some cases is a hopeless wait! When are we just automatically going to get the dvds available ASAP?!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R80ND2EP44STH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPCNOH8#wasThisHelpful","R80ND2EP44STH","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prayer Rope, 100 knots, wool, ""soft barrel knot"" style~Since I have been reviewing rosaries and prayer ropes on amazon, as an avid collector and rosary user, this grey rope seemed good to add. This wool is fine quality and holy Orthodox Christian monks in Macedonia make these every day. This is not the cheap, tightened wool rope you may be familiar with, but a soft heavenly way to tell your beads.Once, I was asked why a Buddhist like myself would want this. Buddhists along with Hindus invented the rosary. Buddhists of every order use rosaries daily. I used to make rosaries in every religious tradition, and now I collect the best ones on earth. The prayer rope, a.k.a. komboskini, is my absolute favorite and always will be. Naturally I respect all sacred things, but it'll shock you to know the Orthodox share the Buddhist tradition in that they see the prayer rope as a tool: nothing more.This particular wool quality and knotting style is my favorite, very common in Eastern monasteries. The skein of wool yarn is like Merino, held and knotted a certain way with great care. The finished rope is spongy, comfortable, joyous to hold in prayer/meditation. Best of all, the rosary is a lifeline that could, ideally, unite the world in peace. Whatever your taste, remember that.Also remember Vodocha Monastery in Macedonia. It'll take the post a few weeks to deliver your rope--and in a few awful cases you'll never get it at all. But don't give up on them because the price you pay supports the monks and that should mean something. Their devotion, lives and souls go into these ropes--and so should yours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21YF6RFX0VSXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O54BO3O#wasThisHelpful","R21YF6RFX0VSXY","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LIVE FREE OR DIE is the story of Episcopalian Bishop V. Gene Robinson, New Hampshire. Bp. Robinson, the first openly gay man anywhere to be ordained a bishop, is a most delightful and fascinating subject. This marvelous Independent Lens production follows Robinson to the Lambeth Conference in London, the annual Anglican bishops' do, to which Robinson was pointedly not invited. Despite death threats, he went anyway but did not participate at the behest of Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams.There are so many touching scenes and powerful scenes, but there is one that stands out: it is the bishop, alone at some refectory or cafeteria. He complained in an interview that in London he had not only been totally frozen out of Lambeth, he couldn't even eat with his fellow bishops. In the scene, dressed and looking like a lost schoolboy in a simple striped polo shirt, Bp. Robinson glances placidly--yet so sadly--around the room.As a cleric, as a person, I too have been treated like that just for being gay. In that and several other scenes, Robinson charmingly demonstrates what anyone would feel: the deeply wounded child every one of us carries, that early version of ourselves which we remain no matter how old we get. What I loved also are the scenes showing what a fantastic priest Robinson really is. He has a character and charisma akin to that of the Dalai Lama.""I wish I could have talked to more people,"" Robinson says wistfully about his disappointing trip to London.I recall very well when Robinson first hit the media ... which culminated in an under-publicized schism in the Episcopalian Church. My feeling was in concert with the bishops who said the Church needed to end the paradox of prejudice against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. Robinson is one contemporary I'd love to meet. This documentary made me all the more anxious to meet him and his wonderful husband.With his fantastic courage, childlike smile and warm heart, Bp. Robinson is one of the most interesting and cogent voices in today's spiritually confused world. I suggest we listen, because this was never about gay marriage or even the consecration of an openly gay man to the Anglican bishopric. It has always been about putting an end to hatred and the use of faith as a battering ram.The Right Rev. V. Gene Robinson is a Senior Fellow at American Progress. He was elected bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire on June 7, 2003, having served as Canon to the Ordinary (assistant to the bishop) for nearly 18 years. He was consecrated a bishop on All Saints Sunday, November 2, 2003, and was invested as the 9th Bishop of New Hampshire on March 7, 2004.

"Being housebound and crippled, I thought Dell was the best company for a laptop. Laptops had been in my dreams forever, because I would be able to sit in my customary spot and do all my work. We are even paying a colossal monthly charge for wireless. Boy, was I wrong. About everything.From the first day the laptop was screwy. Certainly it works, but takes a lot of training to understand it fully, if you're an old person/laptop virgin like me. The thing is, it never worked quite right. The set-up was a nightmare even though I had an unpleasant slob of a tech come out to do it for me. He was more interested in trying to convert me to Christianity than setting up my PC system correctly.Just under a year after it had all cost me a total of $1,000, the thing gave out on me. No one had ever said I needed to call Dell, so I had it carried to my repairman. The problems with that laptop were beyond the repair team. So I began to tangle with Dell--that is when the true nightmares began.I got a troubleshooting clown from the Philippines, nice enough, smart, but rather useless and a little too giggly for a professional. Then I somehow got handed off to an even bigger idiot, who totally ruined everything for me. Finally I ended in Advanced Escalation, with a rude, obstructive Indian. You see, they are all in India. And they do not want to do anything for the customers.You need to be aware: you buy anything from Dell, and need a little help, you'll get shunted to the Philippines. If things get worse, they'll pass the buck to India. You will never escape whatever Indian person has got hold of your case, and Dell has ground rules that are vaguely reminiscent of Nazi militarism. You'll get nowhere and lose all your money. At this very moment I am still tangling with the brute from India, though I have refused to deal with him further.Philippines and Indians are lively people. They work hard and I am no racist--nor can I afford to be. But I think Americans deserve the honoring of the law of getting what you bargained for, and I never bargained for an obstructive foreigner to ruin my life.What price a computer, dear friends?

"STAR TREK: ENTERPRISE SEASON 4 (final season) was a set I had to buy for the coveted Vulcan trilogy of episodes and of course, for the legendary joke of a series finale, which I am going to assume you know. I really miss this show terribly, but especially this last season in the hands of genius Manny Coto. It only showed what ENTERPRISE should have been--and was, in this final season that almost didn't get made.There are other story arcs here that span more than one episode: the odious racists who tried to take over our Martian colonies, the virus that the Klingons gave themselves, Dr. Arik Soong and his repugnant ""augments"". In the hands of Manny Coto, the Enterprise and its crew really got to soar. Too bad it was definitely the final season, and the revolting Rick Berman even ruined the series finale, swooping in to wrest Coto's job from him to achieve it.It is clearly hard for me to review any of this without the bitter Berman legacy that has nearly ruined STAR TREK's chances on primetime network TV. When other lesser series are now entering their 11th, 12th and 13th seasons, the heart aches for ENTERPRISE, which had at least a good decade potential had it not been for the enemy, Rick [insert expletive] Berman.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HXL3K01HZYBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AOEMXC#wasThisHelpful","R3HXL3K01HZYBW","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"REVELATION: THE END OF DAYS (2-part TV special for History Channel, 2014, approx. 3.75 hours)This TV special was too good to pass up--for anyone. For an ex-Christian, it was pretty spectacular. In short, a goofy reporter and his cameraman find themselves at ""the end of days"", funnily enough occurring in Louisiana. The antichrist, U.S. President Brandon, has the world as his oyster, with this film cleverly working in all that eerie stuff you may have heard from the New Testament Book of Revelation. My guess is the action is set in America because of the budget (and setting it in Canada would have been laughable).One of the most clever usages of news footage was delicate borrowing from Europe and the Near East. Some of this is like a video diary and the effects are stunning, marvelous, believable. TV footage and even snippets of film--such as CHILDREN OF MEN outtakes--are expertly woven into the story of Armageddon and the Second Coming of Jesus. Of course there are chilling moments here, such as the twisting of Revelation passages and the terrorist-like actions of the Christians. This is nothing new, as the LEFT BEHIND series had some of the same.The acting, innovation, cleverness in this weird Canadian two-part film is all very good. It is a thorough twisting of Revelation, but then a good myth deserves some good rewriting, as the original writers of the New Testament knew well. I think they would have liked this adaptation. That is, had they not closed the canon--and in some cases made the Revelation of John a deuterocanonical book.However, this film was great to watch for what it is: pure cinematic art. How I'd love to congratulate the producers and makers. I seriously doubt they'd want to hear it from an old Buddhist who is descended from Jews and was educated by Jesuits. Ah well â€¦ the film makes up for all that. Just don't expect any deep Sunday school lesson.Which is part of the beauty of this worthwhile show. It will also tell you some of the weird flotsam that floats around in Christian heads.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUDJGUGXQXQ9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00REG9GEE#wasThisHelpful","RUDJGUGXQXQ9S","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ME AND EARL AND THE DYING GIRL (2015, 106 minutes) is an incredibly deep, hilarious and tear-inducing film that will redefine teen angst for you, whatever your age. Thomas Mann (a Michael Angarano lookalike) plays Greg, a gorgeous but painfully self-loathing Pittsburgh high school student. His only friend, Earl (first-timer R. J. Cyler) is one of the coolest kids ever--he and Greg have been making hilarious home movies together since childhood.Greg's mother informs him that an acquaintance from school and near neighbor, Rachel (Olivia Cooke), has been diagnosed with leukemia. She essentially forced Greg to go visit Rachel--and a deep friendship blossoms. While Greg can't quite catch it, he and Rachel are incredibly alike. Through this relationship, Earl is ever-present and is yet another teacher for the audience to avail themselves for friendship lessons.This is an artful, sensitive film and is the first time I have ever felt so close to high school characters--as if an actual high school kid directed it. The humor is subtle and fall-down funny, while the drama is real, pointed, sharp just as it is in life. Thomas Mann and Olivia Cooke are two of the brightest young stars I have seen since the kids from HARRY POTTER. The adults in the film are well fleshed out, not just parodies, but they achieve performances that parody adulthood. (Catch that wonderful principal, expelling the kids from school!)The director has a feel for ambience and a gifted eye. He favors narrow, claustrophobic hallways because that reflects high school, but the characters' homes are lovely. Greg Gaines' house is actually the director's childhood home. Therefore, the only film I can compare with this is THE SASQUATCH GANG, and I am obviously loathe to compare them.This film has homages and witticisms you'll miss on the first viewing: I guarantee that. It won't matter, because you will be riveted by this film no matter what. It is going in my collection, and THAT is saying something.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R221Y9IL3HIUAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014662FQ0#wasThisHelpful","R221Y9IL3HIUAF","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ETERNALLY YOURS represents the sad ending of the great comedies from the 1930s, which I always say are the best ever made. Here Niven is a rush-seeking magician based on Harry Houdini, with Loretta Young as his assistant and later, his wife. The conflict comes when Niven thinks Young still loves him long after she divorces him (plus a surprise about their divorce).Few people would recognize great actor Broderick Crawford as Young's 2nd husband Don, an ex-football player and appealing, gentle soul. I love Crawford from Fellini's IL BIDONE and as a baby boomer, I love Crawford from TV. In fact it is Crawford who brings a ton of great comedy to this--and as usual is bypassed by most critics. But he gives Niven a run for his money both in the dramatic and the comic scenes. The film is also a good example of Niven's early comedy work.Often this film is panned for its corny, derivative script--though I may partly agree with the criticism, this also has a very modern feel to it. The banter is understandable to a modern young audience, the comedy not overdone and the acting is on the level as well. I think the heavy pall cast over this comprises the end of the great 30s comedies, the start of WWII, and in a lot of viewers' minds will be the loss of Harry Houdini just a decade before this film was released. Even Niven's talent (he was a skilled amateur magician) seems to add to the weight of sadness that just permeates this film. That phenomenon needs to be understood.Don't deal harshly with this. Soon Niven and most of Hollywood would be off to the war. Hollywood would lose all its steam and require a couple of years to get it back. Look at the film as a refreshing time when the people really were most like people are today, and you didn't need stupidity or crudity to do comedy.""WATCH-FOR"" ALERT: the scene when Niven shows he's a martial artist!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26GJJ14RP2V4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AGWMQ#wasThisHelpful","R26GJJ14RP2V4T","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The unique sickle-shaped handle and extra length add to the strength of this superb cane. It is an inch or two longer than the standard 36"", and that really helps.

I've always said Jason Hawes gets old fast, but to see him once again with his inability to speak proper English, his bad temper (but he never shouts), his endless bullying of Grant Wilson for no reason â€¦ yuck.The extremely irritating presence of Brian Harnois, who has had his share of troubles in the last few years, was also a horror to relive. As stupid as he was, I could neither understand why Hawes kept him, except they were old friends, nor why they didn't try to be nicer and help him somehow. Combine the bickering with ridiculous scenes showing Hawes and Wilson at their old Roto-Rooter day job ... what a trip back in time.And it is a bad trip.My poor little wifey, knowing I like to relax watching this type of mindless paranormal hunting show, found this for me at the Goodwill for 88¢ â€¦ bless her goodwill, kind heart and now how does the poor thing get her 88Â¢ back?!","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K88T5TDPY5HM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009Y2726#wasThisHelpful","R1K88T5TDPY5HM","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"LOAFER, SUEDE, RUBBER-SOLE, HUSH PUPPIES ""WALTER THORPE IIV"" (either black, grey, or khaki, made in India) seems to be getting little to no attention so I thought I would wax poetic about this, a combination of my two favorite shoe styles. First off, these are loafers and I don't care what anyone says. They are ""slip-on"" shoes but a loafer IS a ""slip-on""! However, with the thick flat rubber sole, these shoes are also an iteration of my favorite Chinese kung fu shoes (known in America as ""Winos"" or ""skaters shoes"").Make a note that these shoes in particular are not only undersized, they are somehow mismatched in widths. My left shoe fit like heaven and my right shoe ... no deal. I had to give them to my wife because they were so badly undersized. So order a size bigger and wider than you think you need. After the ""giving-to-the-wife"" debacle, I then ordered these in a size larger than I wear. There is, with that pair, STILL a bad fit with the right shoe. What do these folk have against the right shoe? Hausch Proppers seems intent on stealing my right shoe!One thing I noticed the last time I wore these: somehow, instead of looking like nice loafers they looked like house slippers. I was in the grocery store and I felt ashamed. If a shoe looks a certain way, then it matters little how nice it is--if it looks like a slipper well then it IS a slipper. Be careful that this shoe looks right when you wear it. On me it looked bad.Sadly, Huish Poopies everywhere are not quite true-to-size. I reckon they run too narrow, therefore way too small. Another pair of Horse Poppies I own are very oversized. In fact the oversized ones I bought are almost exactly the same dimensions as the undersized ones. How did they accomplish that?! So really, you can only do so much when it comes to knowing your correct size.One thing you can remember is your feet do get fatter (wider, that is) as you get older. No one escapes that fact. Cartilage grows, so as you age, your nose, ears, hands and especially feet actually grow. However, all you can do in the end is hope the cobbler made the shoes right.SELLER NOTE: Seller ""ShoeMetro"" (if they are even still listed in the future) sells on eBay under another username and pretends ignorance of it. They don't expedite with any courier other than FedEx (which I deplore), no matter how much you beg them. That is just rude and bad business. They are not entirely capable, and are far from professional in handling emails/complaints. They are also not entirely honest about their shipping practices and this is amazon's fault because one can't know what method of shipping is used no matter how much you pay for expedited shipping. While the weirdly undersized shoes get 4 stars, the seller was lucky to get 2!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUCHYZ8FAJPFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NY68ND8#wasThisHelpful","RUCHYZ8FAJPFJ","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HUSH PUPPIES ""CIRCUIT"" LOAFER sold by God-knows-whom is a shoe I decided to add to my reviews because it is the closest to the old formal ""pumps"" of my youth, and also matches the model ""CRAWLEY"" by Giorgio Brutini. Actually to be much more precise, these are loafers without any strap or other adornment on the instep. Hush Puppies are made in India (at least this batch). The leather, as to be expected from Hush Puppies, is buttery soft and quite handsome. Their colors for this model vary according to size: they have black, tan and grey suede that looks like it was made from mice. This shoe looks a tad more formal than a penny loafer.The ""insoles"" are weird, being a sort of half-sole at the heel, ending midway, with the rest just the sort of cloth bed I'd expect to find UNDER a shoe's full insole. I guess that is due to the disgusting habit of wearing loafers on bare feet. The soles remind me of ""Croclite"", the material used to make Crocs clogs, but they have one hell of a grip. These run not quite true-to-fit [size] because mine are 11EE and I have measured the insides--their 11EE is actually a 12 EE. Oh well. I can still wear them, all I need is to put some Spenco Rx Comfort Insoles, Women's 9-10 / Men's 8-9 insoles in them. (The Spencos come in larger sizes, do not be put off by the listing, see my review.)I hope I can help all you bone-headed shoe shoppers out there, first by saying the biggest boneheads are the darned shoe companies. They just do not adhere to the quality they once offered: Hush Puppies is already lousing up true-to-size fit, as I can now attest. No matter, since it is essential to have one's correct shoe measurements and know the correct sizes to start with: length and width (length is in numbers, width is in letters but you need to measure your feet properly and consult the chart to get the right size for you).YOU need to understand: your feet are 3-dimensional, not just some flat linear measurement or misshapen flat foot-tracing. Feet need room to breathe, flex, work and live--just like you do! WIDTH is the most vital measurement, and it's the one everyone gets wrong. Most men average a width of E, which is now called ""wide"". You're nuts if you think your feet are ""narrow"", and the older you get the wider your feet become. Lots of people go limping around in pain, stupidly thinking they can ""break in"" their shoes but you can't change a finished shoe. They either fit or they don't, but they sure won't ""break"" and if you keep on with shoes that are too tight you may end up breaking your hip.Though it is my relief to be able to say I never fell because of bad shoes: I notice a lot of amazon reviewers are having severe shoe problems. My feet are exactly size 11EE, and there my grave error started: long ago, I listened to one expert too many and was wearing FIVE sizes too small on their advice. I was wearing size 9 shoes in a C (""medium"") width. It is little wonder, then, that I never checked on the horrid state of my feet. They were in constant pain with some awful swelling. One fateful day back then, I simply could not get my feet into any of my shoes. They seemed swollen very badly. But then inspiration came a-callin' and I measured them, checked all over the net and found my correct size. The rest is history, and so far, Hush Puppies have remained in that history. I can't say how long that will last.Hush Puppies will give you fine, gorgeous leather uppers and safe soles, but only you can give yourself the correct shoe size by learning and measuring. For years I actually wore a size 9C, out of negligent ignorance. How stupid is that?? Then I wised up and measured my own feet, triple-checked everything and am as happy as a clam with feet, and shoes that fit! (Well, fit better than they used to, anyway.) Shoes are our best friends! So take your choice: know your size/style, don't compromise--or else just buy Crocs right now and get it over with.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19T8Y3YXOQCRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVKHOJG#wasThisHelpful","R19T8Y3YXOQCRT","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"INSOLES, PLAIN BY SPENCO SIZE #5 12/13 (40-212 #5) [MEN'S SIZES 12-13] simply must be reviewed. I was lucky to find these again here on the 'zon ... I had forgotten what the company name was and hadn't owned any for a few years. Insoles ought to be a quality affair but a simple one. Spenco has always been the best deal for the best insoles, high quality, long-lived insoles that won't break your heart or the bank and won't disappoint when you slip them in your shoes. Spenco has always specialized in that best of insole: a good, completely flat foam rubber made like Kryptonite and a sturdy (trademark billiard-table green) cloth layer that helps with perspiration trouble. Best of all, Spencos are designed to fit on top of or beneath orthotics, and are extremely easy to trim if need be.The reason I bought new Spencos is I really needed them: I bought a pair of Hush Puppies Men's Circuit Slip-On Loafer (read my review) and for some weird reason they have no insoles. They had a sort of half-sole then the rest was the normal cloth lining I expect to find beneath an insole. Must be due to the disgusting tradition some men have developed of wearing loafers on bare feet. When I tried them on, I realized I was going to need a pair of insoles and quick because Hush Puppies sized these wrongly! Some memory-diving and a little research helped me find my Spenco babies. Spenco has a myriad size range, which I am going to give you straight off the package, so pay attention. You need to buy one size larger than your shoe size so you have the width (and because Spencos insoles do run short-to-size):0 = ladies 3-41 = ladies 5-62 = ladies 7-8 & mens 6-73 = ladies 9-10 & mens 8-94 = ladies 11-12 & mens 10-115 = mens 12-13 (I wear size 11 extra-wide so I bought these, did not need to trim them and they are a dream)6 = mens 14-15When you see Spencos listed commercially, you'll see a slew of numbers indicating the size but all you need is the Spenco size number...and I just gave them to you. Remember, you should automatically choose the next higher size when buying Spencos for assured true fit (well I wear an 11EE and bought the #5 for 12-13 and didn't have to trim them). Nothing's so handy as a pair of sharp, long scissors for insole-trimming. I have a special pair of scissors just for this job. The Spenco insole is perfect and without peer for any shoe you find that is just plain flat and disappointing on the inside.My parents bought those dead-white, crummy, flat ""air pillow"" insoles for years (1/16"" thick only when new out of the package)--my mother used to sigh and proclaim that it would be better if she cut out her own insoles from posterboard. I must agree. That flat little flimsy insole is still sold on here starting at $10. A disgrace. Or you may choose those overpriced extraterrestrial-type gel monstrosities that absolutely gross me out and are 1/2"" thick. Finally you have the $50 ""orthotic"" insoles, which I can't feature anyone buying without the guidance of an orthopedist MD. You spend less on the cheerful green Spenco insole, and they'll last pretty much the life of the shoe unless you are a swine or a puddle-jumper.Now for some fun. I give you the ""official"" Spenco spiel, having no idea whence it originally comes, but it sure tells it all:""Spenco RX Comfort Insoles features full length insoles that cushion and comfort from heel to toe. The ""Spencore"" material's exclusive cushioning ... absorbs shock and impact to provide maximum comfort .... Spenco provides 7 sizes [#s 0-6] for good overall fit, allowing you to find your ideal size. The 4-way stretch fabric with ""Silpure"" antimicrobial helps prevent blisters while controlling odor. These are lightweight, washable, trim-to-fit with scissors.

"SOAKED IN BLEACH (2015, 88 minutes) is a bare-bones documentary about private investigator Tom Grant's involvement with the search for a missing Kurt Cobain in April of 1994. Grant was hired by Courtney Love to find her estranged husband, who had left a Los Angeles rehab center after Courtney Love had been badgering him there by telephone. Love first turned to Grant to find her husband, possibly to track him, and report back to her. Grant, while employed by Love and searching for Cobain, chanced to hear the news of Cobain's death on the radio. After some additional deep investigating, Grant realized he might be looking at a cold-blooded murder.This documentary is an excellent, stunning exposition of facts but I find one or two things deeply irritating in this case. Grant is either hiding or unable to expose certain things that give his relationship with Courtney Love any sort of coherence. Grant was working for her, certainly, and he continued to work for her well after Cobain was found. This documentary will leave you asking a lot of questions about Grant and not about Cobain's death. As to that, it seems quite obvious the Seattle police did stupid, sloppy work with Cobain's death. It also seems obvious there was foul playâ€”and I often point out that this makes it a legal case not to be bandied around or judged by the public-at-large but by authorities.The other big problem I have with this film is that you don't really need it. Whatever is shown in this film, you can get it from Tom Grant's website. It has the recordings which Grant alleges are his conversations with Courtney Love from April of 1994. On that website, which I read in its entirety, you will see almost what amounts to a transcript of the documentary under review here. Take the time to read Grant's website and you won't need this movie. While I enjoyed the artful and restrained reenactments of Grant's meetings with Courtney Love, I did not think those scenes necessary to the message. The message being that this case must be reopened and investigated to the full, properly, and with an eye on appropriate suspects.We are now just past the 21st anniversary of Kurt Donald Cobain's death. The supposed suicide note he left has been at least partly exposed as potentially suspicious. Courtney Love has made sufficiently weird comments in public. We know Grant worked for Love for an indeterminate length of time after Cobain was foundâ€”Grant does not tell us what sort of work or why he would go so long working for her. He does claim he did this in order to keep her in his sights, but somehow that doesn't wash with meâ€”and it may be mere ignorance on my part, but it seems Grant waited an awfully long time to come forward. Chalk it up to the fact that I'm an old man who reads/listens closely to the news, and I do know the media was blocking Grant, IF he tried to come forward. It is very hard to believe a man of that stature would be utterly ignored by the entire media. It's used as such a common excuse it is hollow coming from Grant.Two posters (originally just one) under my review, with ZERO evidence, tell me Grant came forward in 1994. Well, I was there, following the news all these years since, and have only just heard of Grant. That is somehow wrong, that Grant's name was completely unconnected with Cobain's case, though I can't judge whose fault it may be.I am deeply moved and I ask my questions because I liked Cobain very much (just not his music). It bothered me so much when I heard of his death and as the story leaked out slowly, it struck me right away that he must have been murdered. My friends and I wondered why no one came forward with more information, why the media dropped the entire thing and bought into the suicide story, why no one said a thing except those of us who believed Courtney Love had something to do with it. As I say, no Grant coming forward to save the day, not that I recall. Grant is a hard person to forget and not to be ignored, so where was he? That is based on what I was hearing at the time, and that is all I have to say about what I was hearing.Well, at least Grant spoke, explained what he has regarding this case; at least there is his website and that's free. This is a fine documentary with enough fact in it to be worth buyingâ€”I won't dissuade you. It will help Grant, who I notice is still working and charging the public for his time, but I would definitely read Grant's website first. It's totally free and it will tell you everything this documentary tells. May I also say, the website is as ""entertaining"" as the film. Grant has done a noble, necessary thing, but I have to wonder whether it will make any difference at this point. Without an authority to reopen this case, no suspect will ever be scrutinized, no arrests will ever be made.A REQUEST: My review/view is clearly enough stated, so please do not come here to post that Grant has been public since 1994. He wasn't around in 1994, is all I recall about him. It is the case of that dog barking last night: you didn't hear it, because it wasn't barking. I did not believe it the 100th time I heard it and I'm not sure I ever will believe it without a citation. And I have commended him amply for finally coming forward with such publicity now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FG53LRN3475L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAZNBTI#wasThisHelpful","R3FG53LRN3475L","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A GIRL IN EVERY PORT (1951, 86 minutes, PAL Region 2) may very well be the last film in which Groucho got any attention--and it seems to my memory to be the first post-WWII ""screwball"" comedy. Groucho plays a sailor who is a brilliant small-time crook with 20 years under his belt. He gets mixed up in a silly horse scheme with twin horses and more than one bimbo (what would Groucho be without his babes hanging around?). This film is great for several reasons: it is purely sans pretense of the cinematic bent and in general is just plain bent. The humor is excellent, though Groucho had a tendency to recycle a lot of material. It was difficult since Buster Keaton wrote for him when Groucho wasn't ad-libbing.The thing that gets me is not only the humor of the period, which by the way brought back childhood memories--it is also watching the public death and simultaneous birth of a special type of comedy, the post-Marx Brothers group comedy. The gags actually seem fresh, one of the costars is laugh-out-loud even in scenes with Groucho, and there are lots of street scenes. The older a film is, the rarer the street scenes and it is wonderful to see it from 1951. Then there is Groucho: this was his last starring role, after which he descended into the madness of occasional cameos and TV garbage scows. Personally I was never impressed with his TV quiz show.Before this film, a screwball comedy hardly existed as such--the ones that had been done were always centered around WWII or at east the military. They got stale quick and they were not funny. This film is the granddaddy of those nasty cheap films. William Bendix as Tim, Groucho's best friend and fellow conspirator, gives some laughs that almost made Groucho crack up...and Teddy Hart plays a squeaky-voiced mobster whose voice will make you laugh no matter what he says.

"MALA (a/k/a JAPAMALA, BUDDHIST ROSARY), PLAIN CHINESE STYLE, BEADS APPROX. 6MMThis is a product with which I am all too familiar and I once owned over a dozen. This is one of the most common gifts I enjoy giving, but these days....This mala is advertised as ""Tibetan sandalwood"" and it is neither. Oh, Tibetans make these as quick knock-offs to make money, for sure. However, beyond geographical distinctions, this is no more Tibetan than a cup of Nestle cocoa. This is the ""plain Chinese style"" with 108 beads, a larger ""guru"" bead that has a little Dharma Wheel instead of a tassel.The wood, the species of which I am not going to begin to guess, is NOT sandalwood and that is the main point of irritation. To the practicing Buddhist, materials matter when it is the difference between sandalwood and not sandalwood. Whether or not it is Tibetan is of absolutely no matter, but I say it is dishonest to call it what it is not. So two strikes against this thing. However, as malas go, it is a very fine one in and of itself. The trouble is certain practitioners in America get pretty picky about their rosaries.As a former rosary maker in all traditions and as a collector, to say nothing as a Buddhist priest, I find some of the mala listings to be downright alarming. A few malas have been pulled because their descriptions stated ""sandalwood"" and they were plastic beads. Others got pulled because their descriptions lied in similar ways. This has a fine, strong cord (some customers say it is elastic which is the wave of the future) and the Dharma Wheel is a little plastic thingie wrapped in the same cord they used to use to string the beads.So at this price and with beads this size, I can't complain about the price. However, I always advise customers to return something that is not what the description states. Amazon should be notified about such practices also, because rosary dealers are an unscrupulous lot. As a curator of old, I know this all too well. My preference is for the Orthodox wool ""prayer rope"". At least with that I know exactly what I am getting and it serves me the same as a crummy string of chipped wooden beads.A final warning: although I applaud this seller for coming right out and saying these are shipped from Hong Kong, which I support in and of itself, beware that anything coming from China is going to take a LONG time to be delivered. The seller's honesty in this matter earned them their 4th star. Try to get expedited shipping of some sort and get a tracking number. I always recommend getting the seller to use Air Mail. They don't like it in China, but it speeds up, protects and insures your shipment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KLQFFZZUM9CE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HI73NOI#wasThisHelpful","R3KLQFFZZUM9CE","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OKABASHI COPENHAGEN CLOG (a/k/a OKABASHI CLOG) ~ This is one hell of a clog no matter what kind of high-muckety-muck you think you are. This excellent, simple one-piece rubber clog is categorized as a ""gardening clog""--for obvious reasons. I wore these for quite a while in the wrong size (a terrible, long and stupid story I will not relate here). Even so, they served the purpose. These one-piece rubber clogs are excellent in summer (nice ankle-length white cotton socks recommended by me) and quite warm and cozy for winter. Even though I typically wear such things as house slippers, these are obviously made for serious running-about-town.Some say Okabashi paved the way for Crocs and I agree. The Crocs Women's Cobbler Clog strikes me as a direct descendant of these Okabashi Copenhagens, but then what do I know. Okabashis were my go-to sandals until I was seduced away by Crocs. Naturally I was the first clog/mule nerd in my state to buy Copenhagens when they were first introduced. However, the awful difference in prices between the two brands is painfully evident. I just bought two pair of Okabashi's Copenhagen Clogs for the price of one measly Crocs Cobbler Clog.Well, aside from the plain-jane Croc, what shoe can give so much comfort, have so much life in it, AND be hosed in the yard or washed off in the shower?--I ask you! Now for just one tiny bit of practical advice: unlike Crocs, Okabashi's unique rubber formula means a slight sensation of stickiness when they are new. Do not fret as that goes away fast--only be advised. These clogs are basically the best for the money, for the purpose and then some. I ask you to please appreciate and invest in a couple of Okabashi's Copenhagen Clogs. Try the sandals too, but beware of those: their quality has slipped in recent decades.A few final words of advice about these clogs, if you're not yet familiar with them. First of all, they are not easy to just kick off your feet. Part of their wonder, an Okabashi trademark, is their structured and textured interior. That will grip your feet, and many gardeners or sporting people like to wear these without socks. Just so you know, they will sort of grip your feet somewhat. Secondly, be aware that these are very heavy. I believe these are the heaviest shoes I own, and I have fine loafers, canvas kung fu shoes, lots of Crocs--nothing is this heavy. It is because of the special rubber Okabashi uses.A final word of warning: there is apparently no quality control employed in the sizing of these shoes. You may get a slightly longer or wider than expected pair--but I tell you, they'll fit well wither way. What, you thought you were getting Italian hand-made-by-mountain-peasants shoes here? These are rubber-mold gardening clogs! All the more reason to give yourself a bit of leeway and order a size larger, if you're doubtful. I did not have to do that, but I ordered two pairs in one go: one pair is most certainly wider than the other but I can still wear either pair satisfactorily.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ICQRO2QW2QFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWJC3WW#wasThisHelpful","R1ICQRO2QW2QFB","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE COMPLETE FATHER BROWN MYSTERIES (2013 edition) is certainly a Godsend for the Kindle or in hardback for a rainy dark weekend or a stuck-indoors scenario of any kind. Chesterton's brilliant Catholic priest, who solves mysteries because he knows what criminals are like, is on full display here. I know Chesterton books can be found as limited titles and as crummy old paperbacksâ€”so I am grateful I could get this edition on Kindle for 99 cents. However, I don't really know what they mean when they say it is annotated or has ""rare"" material. It has nothing of the sort. That cost it a star.It's fine by me: I love reading about the world's greatest detective, who in the stories is actually the Chief of Police of Paris, Valentin, who in the very first story literally says with regard to Fr. Brown that he wishes to bow to his ""master"". Nothing beats Chesterton and what everyone says is true: whatever you find in the well-known detective canon was first conceived by Chesterton. In a way, Chesterton foresaw what readers in the future would want from a good mystery; no shock there since it was the same in his time. But there is something about the tiny, gnome-like, large-headed, round-faced and stupid-looking Fr. Brown that Chesterton knew was pure magic.As a priest Brown is apparently absent-minded and sometimes seems a little derelict. He has a way of arranging himself that is like an old lady fussing on a train; he is forever losing, or planting like a conquering flag, his sturdy old English umbrella. He seems glued to his shovel hat (what we know today as a ""parson's hat""). But he is always on fire in his mind, always looking, always solving. He knows crime inside and out, from the petty to the vicious. Chesterton has a way of writing--I love the way he describes Valentin's working methods and philosophy for example--that tells me he was a student of the great early 19th century detective Eugene Vidocq. However, when Father Brown waxes poetic (and theologic) it is spellbinding prose.Let me give you a taste of Chesterton's famous riveting simplicity, which has a message that, as Chesterton always does, rings true as ever: ""In the heart of a plutocracy tradesmen become cunning enough to be more fastidious than their customers. They positively create difficulties so that their ... clients may spend money and diplomacy in overcoming them...."" Another example is when Father Brown himself compares ghosts to beggars. Chesterton has this simple poetry in his writing that makes these mysteries so beautiful and enjoyable to read.This is a must for any lover of reading. This edition is complete Chesterton and that's the main thing. Especially with Father Brown of the Church of Rome, there is a continuity that Chesterton wanted his readers to follow, to make all the stories seem as they ought: sequels of each other. If you know Chesterton's work, then this is the edition I strongly recommend. If you don't know his work at all, what the heck are you awaiting, a divine calling?!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RANHVKK1LC2EB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002DMJMCU#wasThisHelpful","RANHVKK1LC2EB","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HOMBURG, STIFF WOOL FELT, NOT CRUSHABLE BY BAILEY'S OF HOLLYWOOD is a supremely fine, well-crafted felt hat. As my title says, it is the ""prince of men's dress hats"" (in fact it is the king) and I love that compared to the odious ""godfather"" name this hat was given decades ago. This hat by Bailey's of Hollywood is a bit stiff in cost, but it is well worth it really at this level. You will not find a Homburg anywhere else in this price range, because if you do it won't be a true dress hat but a costume hat.This has good stiff wool felt, I'd grade it no more than XX and that is being generous but it is of no real consequence. I've had mine for years and it still looks brand-new. The sweatband is a beautifully comfortable, cushioned yet very thin cotton fabric. The model I have is lined with some sort of colorful, really well-fitted lining and I'd say the crown indentation (the ""gutter"") is no more than about 4.5 inches at most. The total crown height must be around 5.5 inches. The brim is a good 3 inches or thereabouts, and curls to perfection. You just do not know what ""class"" means until you have seen one of these. Best of all, you can wear this hat with any style clothing. Remember, this is a type of fedora and a fedora is THE men's hat.A word about the fit: a Homburg is meant to look like it sits a bit higher on your head than you may be accustomed to seeing. It is perhaps the most comfortable of dress hats, but it is meant to perch a bit high on your head. The last thing you want is this hat bending your ears like some kind of goofy elf. This is not a ""high hat"" (that is a top hat) but it is meant to be worn when a top hat is not needed. Well today, top hats aren't needed. Do not worry about looking like a gangster either: this hat has class and it is of royal blood for a reason. If you want mob boss-looking hat get a wide-brimmed Borsalino fedora, ya dÃ©classÃ© bum.But the Homburg is the Prince. Here is why I keep saying that: when King Edward VII was still the Prince of Wales, he enjoyed visiting Germany and seeing his relatives there. In the city of Homburg, he spotted a lot of gentlemen wearing this, a type of fedora he had never seen. He bought a few dozen of them, being a great hat lover, and created a fashion. That very same year the world was flooded with Homburgs and Homburg knock-off styles. In fact this modern style, which is our generation's true recension of the original Homburg, is as genuine as it gets. The original style was somewhat larger in dimensions and had a flatter brim.It makes no matter, said the hatter. All you need is to look at this and see it is, in reality, the KING of hats. Whether going to a wedding or some weird folk art festival, this is all you need. Just remember one final bit of advice: this is stiff hat-wool, so keep it safe when you must remove it and get a HAT-STAND for it to keep when at home. This is one hat that will make you weep bitter tears if you crush it (nah: it can be reblocked which is a sign of quality). And there is one final, wonderful thought perhaps only I could have given you. Anyone interested in detectives or mysteries should know every great literary detective wore a Homburg. That's right, from Poe's C. Auguste Dupin to Sherlock Holmes to Hercule Poirot, they all wore a hat like this on a routine basis.So what if Ms. Marple did not wear one? So what if Chesterton's short-lived Paris police chief Valentin committed suicide and left his collection of Homburgs behind? So what if ""the cheap detectives"" of the 1930s and 1940s only wore giant fedoras? Get a Homburg and you, too, will cut a memorable, dashing and classy figure! You won't even need to solve anything except, perhaps, why you never wore a Homburg before.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F46M1QP61LXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001HO83KM#wasThisHelpful","R3F46M1QP61LXW","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NEWSBOY CAP (""WINNER"" MODEL, made in the U.S.A.) in Irish linen by Emstate is another classic example of that affordable wonderful newsboy style. This cap is made of Irish linen (it may be a tad warm for some people since linen is made out of flax) with a 100% polyester sheer lining. It has an elastic sweatband (which I don't like that much) so it's a one-size-fits-all and the front of the cap, per tradition, snaps to the brim. I don't like that feature on a newsboy either, but there it is so I'll live with it.One thing I have to address is some complaining I have seen about this cap being way too large in its outer diameter. They are supposed to be that way, ignorant folk. I saw oceans of these when I was a boy. They are bÃ©rets with visors, that's all. This way you could move it around and let the cap settle where you liked it without having to tilt the angle of it on your head: that is to keep the visor in place. Squared on your head, facing forward.To that end I must complain about the elastic sweatband. Everything is quality and the linen is beyond reproach (the Tartan-patchwork model is exquisite), but I just hate an unstructured sweatband especially of elastic. My head is very large and these just fit me, so I suspect they'll do well for nearly everyone--but it might be a bit large for you. As for myself, I had to trim little notches in strategic places to relieve the tightness of the band. In my view that's where Emstate cut corners in order to offer a good price. It's a pity, but this is the way our economy rolls now.If you are a goofy pre-middle-aged fashion-plate wannabe, I suggest you try this out and determine if it is your look or not. These newsboys, which are known by half a dozen other names, are not for everyone. This style is much softer than newer-type models, with a softer material for the visor and the elastic sweatband. As I said, picture a bÃ©ret with a visor and go from there. Lots of men love this style and really don't care how big the cap is, but if you are expecting a baseball cap fit, then get a baseball cap!These caps appeal to a fashionable old Buddhist monk in his declining years, not just to keep my bald head warm (yes, for some of us it gets cold in summer too, hence a linen cap) but also to keep me looking awesome! And if you decide this is your style, get a couple in wool for fall/winter. There are better sales/selections in the wool models--then you can be comfy in the right cap and look awesome like I do, all year round! So if it does not cause a minor revolution, allow me to present yours truly wearing the Tartan patchwork model--and please forgive the grainy quality. Now you have an idea what these caps really are!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RTFWEJS731NV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C4V0U26#wasThisHelpful","R1RTFWEJS731NV","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CAP, ""NEWSBOY"" by Broner (a/k/a CABBIE, APPLE, SPITFIRE, GATSBY, IVY) has only one true name: ""newsboy"". It has various monikers that include the name ""New York"" (as in ""New York Apple"", ""New York Cabbie"") but as the British say, you knows 'em when you sees 'em.This marvelous linen cap is made of 8 panels with a large button on top, a short, broad visor and according to its accurate description is fully lined with lovely cotton material and a fully padded sweatband. All of those things, I might add, are de rigueur with a newsboy cap. Some of the unlined abominations might as well be (YUCK) baseball caps.These are in their finest form nothing more than bÃ©rets with visors. This is great because you can adjust the direction your cap slouches, but I'm afraid nowadays the diameter is somewhat lacking. When I was a kid, these things were the size of a bÃ©ret. Today they are more like a Greek Fisherman cap or a puffy cricketing cap. I don't mind those but I happen not to like this hybrid as much as I love the old floppy newsboys I saw so much in my youth.It was that great actor David Suchet (you know him as Hercule Poirot) who got me hooked on these caps. I had a friend who always wore one and he just looked stupid in it. That always put me off. Suchet, who always wears one to keep his pate warm, really got me hooked on these because he had a fine, stylish one that looked amazing. I resemble Suchet so I thought that comfy-looking newsboy might be a good solution for my bald head, too. And it is! I own several in cotton for the summer, and with a longer visor they give excellent protection from the sun.Best of all are the wool models for fall/winter. They really have become the classy, go-to cap for nearly any occasion, are comfy as anything you could want, and are not nearly the hassle of a hot, unlined wool bÃ©ret. The visor prevents them from being rolled and stuffed into a pocket but then you need never remove it for very long. Tip your cap as etiquette demands, yes, otherwise leave it where it belongs. It's a great buy--I've seen these going for upward of $55--and is nice, well-fitted and versatile. I wonder how I lived so many decades without one.A word about size: this should fit any normal adult male quite comfortably. This specific style has a bit of elastic sewn into the sweatband at the back, which will expand for you if your melon is bigger than a melon. Usually I warn against such elasticized caps, but this is reliably true-to-size and well-made. However, if the elastic is better suited elsewhere, it is easy enough to rip the seam that holds it in place and slip it right out: I have done that several times, no problem. If I am not careful I am going to wind up with two dozen of these babies!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38N42RZQJ17QK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K5ZAHZI#wasThisHelpful","R38N42RZQJ17QK","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WE STEAL SECRETS: THE STORY OF WIKILEAKSThis slightly outdated 2013 documentary, for all its music-video attempts at being ""hip"" and addressing a young audience, I found to be dispassionate and objective. Bearing in mind that Julian Assange refused to take any part in this whatsoever, I watched it with great interest to get at least a chronology of events and an understanding of the WikiLeaks nightmare. At just over two hours, there's not as much here as you might think but it is an easy watch if you can surmount the problem of people mumbling (which I put down to bad production).As a well-read reviewer on amazon, I want to be clear about my stance: I believe in equal justice for all, I know the justice systems around the world are somewhat broken, and I do not ever tolerate a witch-hunt. That is all I have to say about this matter. As to a deeply personal opinion, I have never liked the persona of Julian Assange as I have seen him over the years. He seems like a snotty, antisocial hacker and nothing more.This documentary exposes him as a cad, a liar, and generally a scumbag. It stops there, of course, because all that is based on the interviews with his friends. His enemies don't seem to have been interviewed but the stock media clips and other bits address that very amply. Pfc. Brad Manning, who leaked 250,000 classified documents to WikiLeaks in 2010, is summarily dealt with--rather too summarily I think. Guess I'll have to wait for Manning's story in the future, IF it is ever made into a film or written as a book. In case you wondered or forgot, Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison in 2013, with credit for the 3.5 years he spent in the hole, held by the Marines in the brig at Quantico.The value of this documentary is its concentration on the intel related to the Iraq War which Manning gave to WikiLeaks. There is further material, in which even President Obama is accused of ""war crimes"" in the Iraq War, which I found totally bizarre. You'll have to watch this and see for yourself--but do not judge too rapidly, because this is a legal case and not a public opinion bath. As for Assange, I can state that he remains sequestered in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, unable to complete his asylum-seeking under refugee status. He is not being allowed out of the embassy by the British authorities, and if he could get out, he'd flee to Ecuador.The whole thing is a mess and a headache. What this documentary did show me is that there is a witch-hunt being perpetrated against Assange, some of it thanks to his own arrogance, but I have already made clear what I think about that. America, the UK and in some part Sweden are all in this witch-hunt together, according to the reliable news this documentary is quoting. Assange has been in the Embassy for some years now. The internet is rather silent as to anything new, and as for Manning, he was hoping for a pardon from President Obama as of 2013 when he was sentenced but there is nothing newer.It is of interest to note that Assange did cooperate fully with two new film projects, one I only know as his story (I think Benedict Cumberbatch plays Assange) and one other film about which I know nothing. Get this documentary and forget the others who say you can't trust what is in it. People are speaking to the questions put to them, and you need a proper mind/attention span to understand that. Those who put Assange on a pedestal need to recall that even Mother Teresa wasn't Mother Teresa. Our Founding Fathers were liars, cads, skirt-chasers and God knows what else.It is the actions of a person that count, and really nothing else. I cannot think of another person in history to compare with Assange. All that can be done is to find a frame of reference--we may not like what we learn about the Founders, but look at what they did. Look at what Mother Teresa did. Look at what Hitler did. I leave you with one thought: those who commit great evil could never have done a thing without the many who support them. Hitler, who is always named solely in mentions of WWII atrocities, could not have killed over 6 million people had it not been for the other 6 million who helped him every step of the way. Let us not forget that--and please don't accuse me of comparing Assange to Hitler. Another lesson I learned is to be very precise and careful when comparing anything to Hitler...it's better not to do it at all, and I didn't do it here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XHLK0YLAO06Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DENQEE6#wasThisHelpful","R1XHLK0YLAO06Y","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING (Dirs. Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger, 1945, 91 minutes) is the delightful yet somehow weirdly Scottish-foggy story of English about-to-be-wed Joan Webster (Wendy Hiller, a stunning Oscar-winner of her era who drooped into cameos). Ms. Webster, from a respectable well-off working-class English family, plans to marry the wealthy middle-aged industrialist Robert Bellinger. They plan to hold their wedding on Kiloran Island in the Hebrides.Trouble (and film plot) begin when Ms. Webster gets trapped on the outer island of Mull, due to the gale-force storm surrounding the islands. It is this that delights me more than anything in the film; I am too young to recognize most of these actors for the most part but they speak some darned good Scottish Gaelic, fluently and frequently, peppering the film with one of my favorite languages. That canna be faked, ladies and lassies! It is in fact the only film I know of to feature the Scots Gaelic spoken by my own ancestors. Seeing the men running about in their flat caps or Scots bonnets, rain capes and island coats, a few kilts here and there...it was HEAVEN.There is even a local castle--the typical massive Scottish ruins, that is--and it looks just like Urquhart Castle on Loch Ness. HEAVEN.That's right: it's a Scottish movie, no way round that, and it loves and respects Scotland as it should! Ms. Webster meets the local laird and chieftain, Torquil MacNeil (Roger Livesey) with whom she naturally falls in love as they are much thrown together on the Island of Mull. One is cradled and warmed by the gentle, natural eccentricity of Lord MacNeil, along with his goofy pal, local falconer Col. Barnstaple (played by Capt. C.W.R. Knight, F.Z.S.).A stunning sequence that I love is a desperate moment of weakness when Ms. Webster, fearing the worst, talks a young fisherman into taking her to her final destination in spite of horrid gale-force winds and a nasty legendary whirlpool (Corrybreckan, the second largest whirlpool in the world, located in the Strait of Corrybreckan, between the islands of Jura and Scarba, off the western Scottish coast). Lord MacNeil shows up to assist, they sail...and almost die. The sequence is eye-popping because they are on the edge of the whirlpool just as Lord MacNeil saves the day and sails them back.Well, this is a sort of forgotten classic, and Wendy Hiller sadly is best remembered today as the elderly Princess Dragomirov from Murder On The Orient Express (see my review). A pity as I say, because she is also memorable for her fantastic turn as the tough hotel owner in the beautiful Terrence Rattigan movie Separate Tables [Blu-ray] (see my review). The sheer beauty, the genuineness, the unusual respect for a culture other than British or American, it all conspires to give us a film worthy of cinema history.No matter what manner of films you love, you can't miss this wonderful, rather weird and incredibly funny movie. The humor is natural and occurs as it would in real life--no strain is seen anywhere except in the attempts at Scottish accents by a few of the actors. I have a feeling extras may have been Hebrideans due to the way they speak, lapsing in and out of Gaelic. This was filmed in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, so one also must respect the classic, incomparable effort.Finally, let us never forget Wendy Hiller, who sank into somewhat degraded or cameo television roles even though she landed a good part now and again in films--after her salad days were done. I can't even find out why she fell from that uppermost celestial star sphere of Oscar-winning women where she kept Katherine Hepburn company. A woman of that magnitude should never be cast aside. This film will help ensure that she is not!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38CWE5BAEXSSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004XQMY#wasThisHelpful","R38CWE5BAEXSSB","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"REVERSI (A/K/A OTHELLO, IAGO, REVERSES) by AI FACTORY LTD. is a brilliantly animated, quite spirited game. It should get the full rack of stars. It should cause gushes of joy. There's just one problem with it:IT CHEATS. Don't believe me? Just watch for it the way you would watch a live opponent who cheats. AI has programmed this game not to seize all its legally won pieces when it should; that's a foul right out of the rulebook. Instead it perpetrates an infinite whammy by making a clever move against you then NOT seizing its legally won pieces when it should. It leaves those in play in order to execute its overall plan. There are unscrupulous players who develop bad habits such as this immediately disqualifying tactic--which is what has happened over at AI Factory.The rulebook for this has always clearly stated that seizing the captured pieces (that is, flipping them over) must occur immediately or it's an immediate disqualification. Think about it: that particular cheat defeats the entire purpose of the game. But this game will do precisely that. I played it determined to watch exactly when the game will kick into cheating mode: it does it whenever it is in danger of losing a match.  That is a total deal-breaker.

"SCOTS BONNET, ""BALMORAL"" STYLE, PLAIN RIBBON TRIM, RED TOORIE POM-POM is a must-have for the inveterate cap-wearer. It is also a sort of crossover item because any bÃ©ret-lover will love a Scots bonnet. However, the Balmoral is of a slightly different make. Whereas a plain bonnet is just a bÃ©ret, the Balmoral is somewhat different. This plain model will be more comfortable than the ones with the wide checkered trim known as ""dicing"".But the cap stands up a bit, since it has the classic cockade bow on the side and is structured upward a bit from the trim unlike a typical bÃ©ret. These caps are fully lined, great quality materials including the wool, and just very dashing as a fall/winter cap. Do not forget to order in your precise hat size because the adjusting ribbon at the back is a mere decoration. I own two of these and believe me, on a cold night, even indoors, it is nice to have one of these at hand to help keep warm. It is a fine fashion statement, looks dignified no matter what anyone says, and I just don't understand why these are not becoming normative in America.

"GLENGARRY, FINE NEAT BLACK RIBBON TRIM WITH RED TOORIE (POM-POM) simply must be reviewed. You should know by now that this is a Scots bonnet that has been folded in half--it is said the lazy men of the Glen of Garry abused their bonnets this way--and I trust you've seen these on regimental and pipers' heads. This is a quality, fully lined cap made of the finest thick wool with the lining and ribbons/trimming in polyester. Pity they quit using 100% silk in the lining and ribbons. This is a supremely comfortable cap and it really looks fine on anybody. Be sure you get your exact hat size because the drawstring ribbon at the back is fake: they're just sewn on these days and that is NOT a sign of low quality.

There is no debating the overall quality of these caps and thank heavens we can now get them fairly easily here in America.

"SEPARATE TABLES has always been my personal favorite of Terrence Rattigan's plays. When the Oliviers were approached for the film and agreed to take on a double role each, well, let's just say thank heaven they didn't go through with it. And thank heaven for Burt Lancaster stepping in as producer--which saved us from the presence of the Oliviers. Since so many have reviewed this excellent film, I can weigh in with my little eccentricities as I see fit. Firstly, this is a stunning and marvelous portrait of a gathering of hotel-dwelling English folk (Lancaster and his old flame are the only American characters, with the addition of a young Rod Taylor, an American playing a Brit).It seems to me this film has always been a most generous and understanding display of common humanity in the face of far more common human frailty. Each and every person here has demons or struggles to battle and conquer--most of them are frightened by something or other. Badly frightened. When nearly everyone pitches in to whatever degree they can to assist each other, this becomes more than a Rattigan play. It is a tour de force for David Niven as the Major, who is discovered, after four years' residence, to be a fraud. He is nothing more than a lieutenant with a respectable WWII record in a West Indian office--certainly not the desert fighting hero he has claimed to be, and to top it all off he's a ""dirty old man"". He's my favorite character.This film's setup may seem odd to the audience of today: who lives in hotels for years at a time? What sort of ordinary, normal people go looking for companionship in a lonesome situation such as that? It was very common in the old days, and I recall such places from my youth. It seems far more common in England for some reason. Rattigan's powers of drama are in the deep, hidden things, the everyday battles, hatreds, bigotries and lies. The little white lie that harms no one and in truth is most hurtful, bordering on evil. The monkey on the back, the demon raging inside because there seems no other option, the innocent weakness in the face of dominance. Rattigan understood politics and governments, all right, but he presented his rhetoric in everyday people we can still identify with today.The moments of humor are subtle and natural. Nothing is ever forced, and life unfolds before our eyes until it suddenly strikes us that each and every character is a version of the same, single person. A youth, filled with hopes and desires, working hard for the future while paying no heed to the dangerous obstacles out of innocence, an innocence that vanishes leaving one wondering when and how it all happened. When did it pass us by, when did it all go so terribly wrong? Even in one's autumn years, living only with painful memories about to erupt and never quite erupting, the truth is we all want love. Compassion, forgiveness and understanding come with that--it is truly a single, simple thing. No one could grasp it and write it like Rattigan.Rattigan simultaneously shows us what is the matter with generalized political concepts. The exaggerated English archetypes, the two American archetypes that seem to frighten the British the most. These speak to American and English politics in an intimate way, even referencing socialism and communism without any prejudice. Is the hotel not a commune, with a socialist air about it? Even the owner, the tough English woman who must keep her cool, keep it all pulled together, smacks a bit of the ""benevolent"" dictator. That is all I have to say. This is a timeless classic, and while you may find it unbearable, boring or just plain silly, I still say you need to watch it at east three times. I have seen it a dozen times, and each time for me is the first time. Each time, I see something new, I learn something different.Rattigan grows on you then changes with you as you grow, and SEPARATE TABLES is his finest testimony to humanity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V8TPTG79WVUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6D1RO4#wasThisHelpful","R2V8TPTG79WVUM","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MONSIEUR VERDOUX (Writ./Dir. Charlie Chaplin, based on an outline by Orson Welles, 1946, released in Sweden et al., 1947, 124 minutes) represents one of the very few times I have actually studied a film before viewing it. This approach is a personal old habit of mine but as I say, I almost never do this--I don't even like seeing reviews of films I am about to review.Set in France in the 1930s, we find Msr. Henri Verdoux, a banker who is fired after 30 years excellent, dedicated service. It is almost a persecution, as all such firings are--it unleashes a monster. Verdoux, very much in love with his wife, realizes the only way he can support her and survive is to marry then murder wealthy women. He manages to find the most repulsive women, and for Verdoux, as he says it himself, it is ""business"", not murder. Verdoux's argument: if you murder some, you're a murderer; murder millions and you're a hero. His condemnation of war and other forms of genocide such as starvation and prejudice: ""Numbers sanctify.""The Hitchcockian brilliance of this film (which undoubtedly inspired Hitchcock) lies in Chaplin's ability as a director to get exactly what he wants, every time. A smooth tracking shot up a twisting flight of stairs, a sequence at a nightclub where the dancing couple is yet isn't the primary thing in the scene...all brilliant. When Verdoux meets a young woman who is somewhat like him, he takes a shine to her. When she succeeds in life by marrying a munitions manufacturer, Verdoux gives himself up, and off to the guillotine he goes. In that closing scene, as he walks away with his back to the audience, we see the Tramp one last time. it is Chaplin reaffirming to the audience that it is he.A great deal of this truly sad film is about what might have been, what could have been, and not so much about murder. Alec Guinness got his huge break from such a film, Kind Hearts And Coronets (see my review). The trouble is the film was instantly hated in the U.S. No one was willing to give it the slightest attention, and perhaps it was a blunder of Chaplin's to expect Americans to get the point. Verdoux IS Chaplin: suddenly kicked in the behind after years of dedication and hard work. A man soon to be thrown from the U.S. A man heckled and hated by McCarthy's witch-hunt. Even Welles, who pushed for the credit, pawned it off on Chaplin in an act of personal cowardice.This film is well worth seeing precisely because it is so out of character. Chaplin had been deeply immersed in the idea of resurrecting Verdoux somehow before his wife Oona convinced him to do A King In New York/ A Woman Of Paris instead (see my review, but only for KING). I'm not certain in what way Chaplin might have ""resurrected"" Verdoux, so the story might be scurrilous. If anyone could have done it, it would have been Charlie Chaplin. Verdoux meant so much to him because Verdoux's feelings represented the way Chaplin really felt, and Chaplin easily identified with this serial killer who was based on two real-life murderers.Martha Raye, who plays an American woman, represents the ideals Chaplin admired. She is the woman he cannot kill and she really steals the scenes she's in. What I feel is completely missed by everyone here is the concept that a decent, ordinary man has been changed into a monster--in other words, driven insane. The idea that murder-for-gain is ""business"" paints a picture of a horror that could happen to almost anyone. Martha ""The Bigmouth"" almost saves him from himself, but it can't be--it has to be something else that finally moves him to hand himself to the authorities.Even unto the bitter end, he hasn't regained his sanity. He goes away knowing he continued to do whatever he had to do to survive. The love for his wife was no excuse, but the profound reason for his murders. Chaplin was feeling this role, that's true, but the film is a warning. The Tramp wants to get the last word and remind us that we make every one of our own monsters. Then who should we blame?","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N6SWRCCYYKEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQ6J5I6#wasThisHelpful","R1N6SWRCCYYKEW","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"THE SECOND BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL was a pleasant two hours of basically reliving a beautiful original film (see my review The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel). Since there are no doubt wonderful, detailed reviews I will keep mine uncharacteristically simple. I want to start by wondering aloud why this film was made at all: the original film was a perfect, whole universe to itself. It was not a film one would have ever thought would be used to produce a sequel.As sequels go, this moves powerfully with its cast (sans Wilkinson of course, and with the asinine addition of Richard Gere plus a wonderful cameo by David Strathairn) and smoothly with its rather anemic story. The original film left us with that indescribable magic of being able to extensively imagine a sequel for ourselves without ever expecting--or, indeed, wanting--an actual sequel to be produced. This movie is, in that sense only, the worst sequel I have ever seen. It tells us nothing, short-changes every single character in it, and actually has no decent or coherent storyline.Yet I loved it. Oh, not half as much as I love the original MARIGOLD, but I love it just the same. It certainly caught my eye and I took the proper time I love to take to fall deeply into a film. The cinematography is spectacular; the acting I have already vouched for; the scenery is more comfortable and less crazed than in the original movie; the dialogue is actually so funny it is sweet. Yet I ask again: what was it all for, why make it? My first and last impression was they simply must have had lots of leftover footage (I can't prove that naturally but the stupid Bollywood number near the end rather convinces me), contrived a storyline and threw this together.I can promise you this: it is not close enough to the perfection of the original, and you will need to watch the original before you see this. Not only because they were naturally forced to do this in ""sequel shorthand"" but also because it is otherwise pointless to waste time watching it at all. It is as if everything left to our imaginations from the first film got crammed inelegantly into this sequel--it is one of those events that leaves you with a single, nagging word echoing in your mind: in this case the word is, ""unnecessary"".If you decide to just hit it cold watching this film, I recommend you give it a couple of viewings: the sound is dreadful for some reason and the dialogue is spit out at astonishing speeds. It adds up to making you feel you are truly losing your hearing. And you don't want to miss salient details early in the film which you will if your ears blink. There are mighty, classic moments at the beginning: Dame Maggie Smith's explanation of tea and the way Americans louse it up is Oscar-worthy; you also do not want to miss the clever way Bill Nighy has settled into his new job, or the brilliant newest job Dame Judi Dench is able to land. The saddest part of the film itself is the annoying distraction of Dev Patel's upcoming wedding--just not at all interesting.Let me end on the note that it was lovely to see everyone again, all gathered in Jaipur and having a blast. If this charmed you and you can find no fault with it, then here's the final positive note: don't be surprised if there is a second sequel. They left the doors wide open and that, ironically, was this film's biggest weakness of all. I always say: magic once is the stuff of dreams; more than once and it is old leftover pizza.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DZ7V6FC7D4HT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WW4CHYO#wasThisHelpful","R2DZ7V6FC7D4HT","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DAVID ATTENBOROUGH'S RISE OF ANIMALS (2013, 3 parts, 50 minutes per part, PAL REGION 2 NON-U.S.A.

"CAP, NEWSBOY/APPLEJACK CABBIE, COTTON TARTAN PATCHWORK by ANGELA & WILLIAM, SOLD BY TITFUS (tight fuse, get it?) Is a fine summer cap that has quality cotton materials in its make plus a very fine seersucker full lining. There is a cloth-covered button atop this cap, as you might expect and it is surprisingly well-fitted because it is lightweight (I'd say the button is a cloth-covered plastic disc.) My head is extremely large and I usually wear a size 59 (that's a 7 3/8 U.S.)--and I get headaches from hats that are too snug. This cap is perfect.I got this because it was made in the same way and with the same materials as the Epoch Hats flat cap, see my review for that: Men's Summer Preppy Tartan Plaid Front Snap Flat Golf Ivy Driving Cap Hat Brown. As such, it does more closely resemble a flat cap (or a Greek Fisherman or a painter's cap) than a ""Newsboy"". It didn't matter to me if it was a full Newsboy style, but I am happy it is a bit more like a Greek. Disappointments, see below:A few details give this cap a down-side, unlike the Epoch flat cap: if you examine the photo, you'll see this cap fully articulated and that's fine. Just like a regular Newsboy. In actual fact the cap is much closer to a Greek Fisherman, and I don't necessarily like that bait-and-switch inaccuracy. I was actually counting on a generous diameter and I get something that is, well, rather weird. This cap is not meant to have a snap on the visor like the flat caps do, but it comes sewn down along the visor which gives it the odd appearance you see in the main photos. I was easily able to rip that seam and fully articulate the cap--it looks OK. Just not the way I expected. The visor deserves extra kudos here: it is a full, square-shaped visor and not so much a duckbill. Good eye shade.Mainly, I did not expect this style to be sewn or otherwise attached at the front, because its diameter should be large enough to allow it to naturally fall that way--but I often call this style a ""bÃ©ret with a visor"", which it is. As such, it ought to have enough diameter to it so I can shift it around a little. If you examine the photo I have attached, which is one of the listing's photos, you'll see a more or less properly made cap but it just doesn't exactly pan out that way because the photo model's head is abnormally small. That always disappoints me, but I did not pay much for this, it is quality (just not quite on the same level of quality as an Epoch cap), and the fit, though snug, is adequate. For a general size LARGE it is far too small in general.This was sold to me by TitFus, an unfortunate name and a rather rude seller (ignores emails). It is fulfilled by amazon. Well, I can't complain too much given the price and the fair quality of this--even though it is not quite what you expect it to be and nothing in the description says they sewed the cap to the visor. Most will find it quite useful, if this is the kind of thing you like. My real love for this, aside from its light cotton make, is the patchwork that reminds me of my grandmother and mother. I do recommend it as a terrific summer cap, but it will never merit the glowing praise I feel for my Epoch flat cap.Final note: don't bother with paying extra for ""expedited shipping"", which on amazon should mean ""Priority Mail"". Mine was shipped parcel and they are truly just lucky it got here on time, but then it was sent from a bordering state. I did receive a refund on the shipping, and that is as it should be. Enough with these people pulling those kinds of stunts when a customer pays $10 in shipping. That is as expensive as UPS.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FTEKAWAAI7EY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTZ0GHM#wasThisHelpful","R1FTEKAWAAI7EY","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FATHER BROWN (season 2, starring Mark Williams title role) has comprised a series of fun 44-minutes-each of viewing when it is on PBS here. It angers me that Williams, along with Julie McKenzie's Agatha Christie's Marple, Series 4, are rarely seen in the American Midwest. It makes me ache as per usual at the idea that we're not getting a fraction of good British TV over here.Mark Williams, of HARRY POTTER fame (he was Mr. Weasley) rather chops up and squirts out his performance of Father Brown of the Church of Rome in an odd, almost haphazard way. He often says nothing for very long stretches and makes very weird facial expressions that puzzle even me. Since I always love watching Williams and have been a top fan from ""day one"", I find it tough to fathom why he seems so mediocre in this role. Perhaps he only seems that way: I find mediocrity to be the fault of the director every time.It puzzles me in the face of the beautiful, artful production value of 1950s England in the Cotswolds. The mysteries, of course, are really excellent per se; it is everything else that is awry with many of these excessively short episodes (many have the feel of the old ""half-hour special""). The characters have no time to develop at all, and therefore the whole of Father Brown's English period becomes a puppet show. When that is combined with some serious acting and disturbing issues--as it usually is--plus very little humor, it gets explosively boring. It's as if Fr. Brown is just there, and nothing more, until he confronts the guilty parties.As an example to the contrary: it was brilliantly funny and warm to see Fr. Brown invited over for lunch at a favorite parishioner's home. The way Williams leers and sniffs at the ""famous dumpling"" dish and rolls his eyes--worth a million sterling! Then he simply says, ""Ohhh, heavenly"" and we are, for an instant, as transported as Fr. Brown is...and sadly, it is exactly this kind of thing that is so lacking in these episodes. I'd rather watch an entire story built around Fr. Brown's taste in food, if that is what it takes to breathe more life into this series!Even so, I do love the tea-cozy mystery and I want to collect these, if nothing else than for their value as an oddity--and because I love Mark Williams.

"DESTINATION TRUTH (Season 3 of 5 total, 2010) ~Josh Gates, who talks almost exactly like an evil Kermit the Frog, is certainly able to deliver on the silly humor and cast/crew-oriented paranormal excursion format. Gates, who must be one of the most grating, irritating and smart-alecky of all the crap-TV hosts, has to be given credit for getting out there, traveling and making an ass of himself in general. I chose season 3 since I am presently amusing myself watching it on the Syfy Channel. Unfortunately I am all too familiar with this show from its beginning to date.This, though a few of the same dummies are in the show (meaning YOU Jael Pardo), is nowhere near the horrifically cheesy HAUNTED HIGHWAY (see: Island of the Lost Souls). It is actually closer than I just led you to believe. Here the season hops along from Yeti hunts in Bhutan to leprechaun hunts in Ireland. The globe-hopping is sort of fun, and if anyone had been smart enough, this could have been a respectable travelogue with a paranormal-folklore slant. In other words, it could have been good. Instead, aside from interminable yakking by Gates, who must have had it in his contract to hog the entire show all the time, this show distinguishes itself for establishing Jael Pardo as the dumbest, jumpiest and ""screechiest"" of any paranormal field investigator.What saves the show from getting one star by me is the combination of travel, humor (pathetically little of that) and the cute guys Josh Gates seems to insist on having around him like a harem. Well, at least the man is good for something! The investigations are the usual combination of incompetence, nincompoopery and squirrel-headedness. In other words, just perfect for the audiences of today who bother to watch such programming. It would not surprise me to hear fans of this garbage heap try to compare it to PBS programming. Which of course they would never be capable of watching anyway.In all fairness, now that I can lay aside most of my sardonic critique, I honestly do not know who or what moves producers to actually make shows like this. Entertainment is fine. Beefcake is more than fine, even if it has to be enjoyed through heavy expedition gear or bad weather in a wilderness. The girls on the show must, as ever, surrender to the superior hotness of Jael Pardo, I guess because the other girls on the team seem like truck drivers compared to her. OK, it can't be helped, I am back in full sardonic-sarcastic mode.Mainly the sour attitude is because this show, as with all others of its ilk, is dying to be mocked, begging to be witch-slapped. It could have been really funny (as the momentarily serious moment in Ireland when Gates is claiming he saw a box of Lucky Charms). It could have been, as I said, an anthropological-folklore exploration of our world, a show that as far as I know has never been done seriously at all. Instead, it's a bunch of dummies looking for every single paranormal idiocy you could imagine. If this show was not canceled, but I think it was, I am just waiting for them to start hunting for Sheepsquatch next.But if I must listen to Gates' interminable Kermit-yapping or Jael screaming her lungs out for no reason, I am going to complain to my congressman. I am a darned good letter writer, Gates! Just don't you forget that! ô","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I2UB8Z0QHC1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002OLPJ5Y#wasThisHelpful","R3I2UB8Z0QHC1U","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SCANDAL (Dir. Akira Kurosawa, 1950, 80 minutes) is one of Kurosawa's early films. Actually set in the fall of 1949 and continuing on through 1950, this oddly short yet somehow dragged-out drama features a young Toshiro Mifune as an up-and-coming ""bohemian""-type artist. A chance encounter with a famous though reclusive singer--totally innocent of course--leads to a cheap popular tabloid (""Amour"") defaming both parties with a scurrilous story of an affair. In this early film, Kurosawa questions, as always, the inner morality of each individual, what I call ""the nun in the belfry"". Are you who you say you are ... really? Are you honest? If somebody defames you, well, in some odd way isn't that karma? Kurosawa was always good at showing how karma has a ripple effect: it's not just ""thee"" and ""me"".Kurosawa managed to address the proper legal side: the innocent couple is guilty of nothing. A crappy though popular magazine has defamed them in an illustrative way that reminds me of the famous American case, in which an elderly man and his elderly girlfriend were hung out to dry in what must be THE textbook definition of defamation--and the couple won their case. It strikes me that Kurosawa may have been trying to tell a Japanese version of that story since he was always famous for doing that sort of thing. In a way, this film, then, is based on a true story. The dishonest lush of an attorney hired by the couple soon puts their feet deeper into the fire. This is a film you have to watch to appreciate in full what happens next.What American audiences may never be able to understand is the complexity of Japanese life, justice plus the fact that this takes place during reconstruction. Remember, it is 1949-1950. Japan was emerging from a horrific shambles and I cannot imagine the horror they faced wondering if their nation would survive at all. For example, Kurosawa addresses the pure evil of the cancer epidemic that swept the nation as a result of the bombs in Ikiru (The Criterion Collection); here as in a few of his other ""contempo"" films he is addressing basic morality, delicately quivering beneath the Sword of Damocles forever poised in the Japanese sky. If you are interested in the history of modern Japan, in cinematic history, or just a Kurosawa fan, I highly recommend this film as a study of early Kurosawa. If nothing else, it was his launching pad and a good showcase for his stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJD0F67ZPEI3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=7799733594#wasThisHelpful","RJD0F67ZPEI3E","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE BAD SLEEP WELL (Dir. Akira Kurosawa, 1960, 135 minutes, U.S.A. release 1963, Japanese with English subtitles) is one of the weirdest, most depressing of Kurosawa's ""modern"" films. The legendary Toshiro Mifune plays one Koichi Nishi, secretary to the vice president of the Japanese Public Corporation for Land Development. I do not know anything at all about the Japanese reconstruction period or how the illegal kickbacks worked on construction jobs, but this film is exactly what a corporate whistle-blower's nightmare might be like!The level of murder (in the form of bullying to suicide which is seen as equal to murder in Japan) and the ruthless couple of top dogs making all the money is simply sickening. Once you see a bit of Nishi's ""other side"", you too will be sucked into the emotionally painful moral abyss that this film so baldly lays before us. I have always said Kurosawa is at his weakest when trying to do modern social statements, but this film ranges far beyond all that, addressing the idea of corporate corruption, priorities in life, and of course, defines the very evil, wicked definition of ""kickbacks"".The innovations and power in this black-and-white film obviously inspired everyone from Hitchcock on down the line. I have no idea how many it inspires today, but it says something that the film and the story are so fresh and startling even now. The lessons never change, the mask of goodness worn by evil never varies. This film teaches us how we manage to fall for it every time. This film has one hope: the one pissed off, half-loony righteous crusader who just might have a chance at dismantling the total corruption. In a word, this is about the one person who just might be able to cease the ripple effect of bad karma.And humorously enough, it reminded me of Luke Skywalker being the only one who could bring down his father and the Emperor. No doubt it was an inspiration for George Lucas.Yet I find it necessary to mention my feeling Kurosawa is at his weakest because he always seems to have his hands more than full with these modern-day fables and parables. On the one hand he presents a clean, no-bones-about-it slate upon which he then writes his moral lesson. On the other hand one cannot get rid of the feeling he would rather be making a samurai jidai geki. His apparent struggle with the courtroom scenes is an example: Kurosawa just can't get a dramatic courtroom battle--but I think he might have wanted it that way.The true shout-out goes to the great Toshiro Mifune. Here he is all business, buttoned to the brim in his fine business suit and thick horn-rimmed glasses, the emotionless picture of Japanese business efficiency. Even so, he sends shivers of awe through the viewer. It will always escape me how Mifune did it: I have loved him all my life, he was the Japanese Olivier; exactly how and why still escapes me. Perhaps it is pure talent: how does one describe a force of nature? How does one describe Kurosawa, the greatest director in history? It is easier to describe this film: one man, as close to a superhero as you could get in real life, fighting evil to the death just to avenge the rotten father who was as bad as the rest. If you love cinema, and Kurosawa IS cinema, you have to get this. Even if he is sort of 'idling' a bit with this movie.For fun and games, I highly recommend two Kurosawa films I love and have reviewed: Scandal - 1950 - Akira Kurosawa for an early peep into his sophisticated early reconstruction Japan and High and Low (The Criterion Collection) for a peep into his later super-sophisticated, reconstructed Japan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ1JPU33FF368/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BR6QCI#wasThisHelpful","RQ1JPU33FF368","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BALL OF FIRE (for all you mugs out there a ""ball of fire"" meant a passionate bombshell female back in the day) is a Barbara Stanwyck/Gary Cooper vehicle that is often compared to ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"". I'm not certain where THAT comes from because, aside from the hilarious little homages to DWARVES, this film is not a version of it at all.Gary Copper is Professor Pott, one of eight academics working for years on an ultimate encyclopedia. When it is realized the ""slang"" section under ""S"" is 20 years outdated, Prof. Pott seeks to find a remedy to the situation. While gathering notes about the latest slang (some of it is so funny and I had never heard of it, i.e., ""meatloaf"") he meets a girlie-girl named ""Sugar-puss"" (properly called ""Shug"" by her gangster pals, played by Stanwyck). When she is subpoenaed for some nasty gang business, she agrees to help the professors and moves in with them.See, they live together under the stipulation of the grant money to do the encyclopedia. Only one of the elderly scientists was married, now a widower. The rest are bachelors. What is cool about them is the way they mirror the great scientists known to that time: one is an Einstein-type, another is supposed to be like Max Planck. When the bad guys finally get to the scientists, there is a truly horrible moment when two of the thugs hold them hostage. To me, that was a profound message about the terrorism inherent in crime.The rest you must see for yourself--it is so worthwhile even if Cooper is badly miscast in this. The humor is subtle and to be heard, not seen, in the clever dialogue. It is argued that this is the last of the great pre-WWII comedies, but I disagree. This is also stupidly described as a ""screwball"" comedy, which it most certainly is not. It may be the granddaddy of the screwball comedy, but that is as far as I'll go. Personally I think the Marx Brothers early material, written by Buster Keaton, is the very definition of ""screwball comedy"".But this movie does represent an end to the fun and humor of the pre-WWII era in film. What is a miracle is these stars (they're all great, you'll certainly recognize most of them) and the studios went on to do stunning work post-WWII. Get it for the fun, then remember the sacrifices made in WWII so that we could be here and free to enjoy this today!","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18ZA62X7KP47O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2TE3DU#wasThisHelpful","R18ZA62X7KP47O","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Before I get launched here, let me remind and caution any younger viewers about the film that is NOT this original film based on the play: Heaven Can Wait also found here: Heaven Can Wait. That film has nothing to do with this original film based on the play--but a lot of people erroneously think it is the original film.The famous Joe Pendleton, boxing champ, gets snatched by The Messenger just before his plane crashes due to The Messenger suddenly feeling sorry for the suffering he is certain is awaiting Joe. Trouble is, Joe was due to pass away at a ripe old age in 1991! In heaven, he has to see ""Mr. Jordan"" who is actually God--surely he can fix this unholy mess. So he does, by deciding Joe can return to earth in another freshly deceased body, that of millionaire Farnsworth.This film is a most wonderful, skillful and (once in a while black) comedy about who we are, who we are meant to be and how God considers the human body something like a ""coat"" and nothing more. That ""coat"" is not what matters to him, and somewhere in the film there is a line about previous incarnations that struck me as odd. The entire metaphysical message is supposed to be that the person we are is all that matters, not the body. Yet it is Mr. Jordan's comforting line to Joe that literally has changed my own outlook: when Joe is angry about the order of things, Mr. Jordan tells him ""no one gets cheated."" I don't mind saying it was a challenge for an old Jesuit-taught Jewish rabbinical student who ended up being a Buddhist priest! Suddenly the idea that ""it'll all work out in the end, no one will be cheated"" gave ME a new philosophical understanding of life!This film is showing, in its almost cold, analytical way, precisely that truth. It begins to nag the viewer, making one wonder why one feels cheated all the time and why the universe seems so cold and unjust. It struck me that Mr. Jordan will always be infinitely more than he seems, telling us it will all be OK and no one gets cheated. I tell you, it has changed my perspective and I don't even understand why it changed me! Frankly the film doesn't really seem that deep.And if I can't really encompass the thing in my mind, I suggest you don't try either. It will all work out in the end and no one gets cheated. While it is all so facile and breezy, Claude Rains actually gives the role of the Almighty quite an impish spark of fun--too fun, sometimes, as he coldly looks upon the universe he loves, which he made, and almost seems to grapple with the destiny he also created which he can't seem to change a whole lot. At times he gives an impression of desperation, yet all the while he knows it'll all work out for the best. No one gets cheated. That ultimately comforted me, because in spite of my own weird backstory, and several brushes with death, I had never considered things in this light until today.This film ends up teaching a super-positive, uplifting premise that even 1947's The Bishop's Wife (1947) utterly failed to do. There, by the way, is another film that stole from MR. JORDAN.That is how deep this silly comedy really is. As a multi-Oscar winner, it was remade, of course, and I am not going to bother with any of that. It is enough that I told you which old film is NOT this film. You can't miss this, not Claude Rains as God, and never in a million years do you want to miss the now-forgotten James Gleason as Joe's manager Max Corkle. That Max is a comic genius role, and I can't fathom why this film is one of those half-forgotten beauties they made in the 1940s. Of course if this isn't enough for you in the life-after-death department, you can always do as well with Spencer Tracy's A Guy Named Joe (see my review; frankly I think JOE, made just two years later, was a rip-off of MR. JORDAN).Just don't miss out on this all-time classic either. It may ring corny now, but that is how life was and I just loved the gentle shades of my own childhood listening to those boxing people yakking back and forth.Joe: ""I was in the pink!""Mr. Jordan: ""That is becoming a very obnoxious color, Joe. Don't mention it again!""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34P5WH8GSIYL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KX0IOU#wasThisHelpful","R34P5WH8GSIYL0","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE BOY WITH GREEN HAIR (1948, released 1950, 80 minutes, RKO Pictures) was simultaneously one of the weirdest, most prophetic and somehow ahead-of-its-time movies I have ever watched. I'd never heard of it before--and you'd think with that title it would be a classic by now. A very young Dean Stockwell plays Peter Frye, a boy who awakens one morning to find his hair completely green. Not just any green: a gorgeous, grassy-emerald green. To heck with the Joker, THIS looks like truly green hair!Peter is an orphan, left with his kindly, retired Irish magician grandfather (Pat O'Brien) because his parents apparently died in the London Blitz while saving children during World War II. (It escapes me why viewers and critics call the old man unrelated when the gentleman is called ""Mr. Frye"".) At his school, Peter looks at the stunning, heart-wrenching posters of war orphans with a sadness that is palpable, even though we can't see his face in that shot. Once his hair turns green, Peter runs away--in the glade he encounters the spirits of the orphaned war children who tell him he must use his attention-getting hair to spread a message.That message is that war must never happen again, and to prove the point, he is to call attention to his hair as a sign. I think I'll stop here, because you can imagine what he's going to face under the circumstances. I do wish to point out that this colorful, well-shot film really brings the era to life, and it wasn't all that different from the here and now. I think you should remember that. Peter's message, or rather the heart of it, is ""war is very bad for children.""HISTORY: I think the uneven, oddly comical quality of this picture (and it is, sadly, referenced as a comedy) was due to the harsh and near-insane meddling of Howard Hughes, who took over RKO when the film was partly shot. Wishing to sabotage its pacifist message, which is indeed powerful as performed by a 12-year-old Dean Stockwell, Hughes did his best to louse up the rest of filming. He even went so far as to bully young Stockwell, screaming at him about the necessity for arms superiority. Stockwell would not back down about his own personal anti-war feelings, and glared defiantly at the crazed Hughes. (Ironically, one of Stockwell's greatest cameos is as Hughes in Tucker: The Man and His Dream--see my review.)The crew who worked on this film were later blacklisted and it is a miracle the thing got released at all. My nearest guess as to the parable nature of the film is that the stupid people were so obsessed about Peter's green hair they did not listen to his anti-war message or his warnings about the children's futures. What is so creepy is the power of the message STILL does not get through even to this day--and I do not think it is due to Stockwell's green hair. This is decades after the hippies and the punks, so we've seen it all. No ... it's that we do not listen at all. Perhaps that was the intention of the film all along, since I could not really find a parable in it or anything else metaphysical which I could grasp.However, it is direct enough: I defy you to laugh (you won't, you'll get shivers) when Peter looks directly at the viewer, green hair resplendent, and says sadly about war, ""They think everyone has to die."" He says this because he had heard some ladies speaking about the outcome of an atomic war. He was visualizing all the dead children and he managed to convey that very thought--as if it were a true ESP moment with the audience.Perhaps in the end it was no more than a testament to how crazy Howard Hughes was. But you'll love this if, for no other reason, you like weird old films or are as stricken with the breathtaking beauty of Stockwell as I am. I've seen Stockwell (during his child star years) in such films as Song of the Thin Man--and of course his stunning, Oscar-worthy turn with Gregory Peck in Gentleman's Agreement of the same year as GREEN HAIR, 1948 (see my review). Stockwell knew how to break hearts and did it expertly. In fact in this film as in GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT, he made me cry. ... and perhaps THAT was the true aim of this film. If you saw a 12-year-old Stockwell weep, you'd devote the rest of your life to ending war and saving all endangered children.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PKPRPZYLNF3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NNDJRM#wasThisHelpful","R2PKPRPZYLNF3F","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WOMAN IN GOLD (Dir. Simon Curtis, 2015, 110 minutes (with 10 solid minutes of end credits), BBC Films, in English & German) ~Maria Altmann - Helen MirrenRandy Schoenberg - Ryan ReynoldsDaniel BrÃ¼hl - Hubertus CzerninTatiana Maslany - young MariaHenry Goodman - Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer (Maria's father)Jonathan Pryce - Chief Justice William RhenquistCharles Dance - Attorney Sherman (uncredited?)Bruno Ganz - uncredited voiceoverMaria Altmann was a lucky Jewish lady from a fine Viennese family. Along with her young husband, she escaped Nazi Austria just in time though Maria lost her family (except for her sister). She lived in Los Angeles. This film tells the story of Maria and the famous painting of her beloved aunt, Adele Bloch-Bauer. We all know it well, as ""Woman in Gold"" by Gustav Klimt. I studied that work countless times as an art student. Well who knew! Mirren gives a plucky, humourous performance as Maria, who embarked on a quest to be recognized as the painting's true owner, which she was. Austria was in possession of hundreds of millions' worth of her paintings, stolen from her father by the Nazis at the start of WWII.This is the abbreviated ""short-hand"" story of Maria latching onto attorney Randy Schoenberg, another descendant of a Viennese family: that of composer Arnold Schoenberg. She chose Randy because she had known Arnold and needed a good Jewish lawyer she could trust. Maria was going to get all her family paintings back from Austria, and they were not just going to gladly hand them over and say auf wiedersehen. Told in a rather hurried and may I say occasionally sloppy manner, it is a film within a film, the modern story (set from the late 1990s to 2006) being dogged by the WWII-era story of the Bloch-Bauer Family. Sometimes it is beautifully done, sometimes it is annoying the way a scene is abandoned for the next scene.Quite a head-turner, whatever way your head is originally oriented. The performances are not exactly powerhouse, but they needn't be. The competence and emotion will carry you along as it did for me. In the flashbacks, a great example of the emotional power is when the Nazis eyeball Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer's Stradivarius cello. The way Ferdinand grips a candlestick in each fist--powerful stuff. The cello is his devoted love and the Nazis are about to take it. Like candy from a baby. Mirren gives some fabulous moments as she and Reynolds bounce off each other, almost like mother and son. The trouble is, this film was in certain ways handled amateurishly, and the first thing one notices in that regard is the way Mirren mirrors her performance as Queen Elizabeth. That was a great error. The visits to the concentration camp were nothing more than blurs. In fact, at one point, six months pass, then later, nine months pass.You will literally miss the time gaps if you blink.I will add this: the Supreme Court sets and cinematography are FANTASTIC! Sadly, the acting is not, but they managed to flavor it a little with the peppery back-and-forth between justices and counsel. But I did recognize, significantly, the only side of their bench shown, and could identify Justices O'Connor, Thomas, Scalia, Breyer and Kennedy--all of whom are unnamed and uncredited as far as I know. Significantly the two conspicuously absent Justices were Ginsberg and my personal hero Stevens.So my final verdict is it is a quality film, excellent in so many ways, the soundtrack doesn't meddle, no swearing at all, nearly everything is perfect but it is hastily and sloppily dealt with. The subtitles in this format are horrific (I hope you can at least catch some of the German). Too much information is done in the typical caption form, which is the reason it could be missed on the first viewing. I had to watch this twice to get everything. The story, as I said, is truncated, so do not expect to ever fully know what it all means until you have read up on the real-life events.REAL-LIFE BACKGROUND: Maria Altmann always intended only to gain recognition and attention regarding the Nazi thefts and other atrocities that were not commonly known. This was a thing I loved in the film, since it has a you-are-there quality without the hand-held camera crap or anything else amiss. Her family, her home, everything was stolen by the Nazis then later illegally acquired by the Austrian government. But Maria and Schoenberg fought the Austrian government like David and Goliath. The painting of Maria's aunt (""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I"" but changed to ""Woman in Gold"" due to anti-Semitism) is widely known as ""the Mona Lisa of Austria"". And Maria was already in her 80s when she decided to take on this fight!The paintings, all of them Maria's, hung in the Austrian Galerie Belvedere. After the first suing of the government, Maria was on a crazy roller coaster ... never really expecting to win much. She wanted to educate the world and, as a good Jew, exorcize some demons along the way. Maria was surprised when she actually got the wheels of justice turning, losing each time to the Austrian government and the Belvedere Gallery, but inching closer to victory. She won her United States Supreme Court Case in 2006 (Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 2006)--a case that granted her security under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976. That has to do with an American suing a foreign government, and the USSC said Maria could, indeed, sue Austria because the meat of the case was whether or not the FSIA was retroactive. Which they ruled it to be. Maria could sue Austria with that decision in her back pocket.Austria v. Altmann holds that the law is retroactive, and Maria ended up getting her case arbitrated in an Austrian court to her favor in 2006. She won all of her paintings back and then decided to sell the ""Woman in Gold"" to Ronald Lauder--EsteÃ© Lauder's son. (EsteÃ© had also been a good friend of Maria's, and Lauder made sure the painting hung where all could see it) All in all she made almost $500,000,000. Her biggest dream: to finally buy a dishwasher. And she lived into her 90s, passing away in 2011 and of course, leaving the bulk of her fortune to good charities. All of this is the true heart of the film, which shows very well what the war, the Nazis, did to the Jews BEFORE they incarcerated/incinerated them. That was the most relatable aspect: it made me cry because of similarities with my life, and I am nowhere near Maria's generation.Austrians were rude and evil to poor old Maria. Someone actually said to her in Vienna: ""You people never give up, do you?! Not everything is about the Holocaust!!"" Maria knew everything IS about the Holocaust. That was the whole point. She had to live with the knowledge that her aunt's portrait hung at the Berghof in Hitler's personal possession, long after her parents and everyone had died in the camps. However, I think we Jews, everywhere, are deeply conversant with this kind of horrible, unspeakable loss. So much was put into this film in spite of some sloppiness because there is a double-edged Jewish sword, and I for one am happy to wield it: we People never give up, and we never forget. Wielding that, especially as Jews, is an OBLIGATION.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GHZ1FJ6CCHV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VU4YO7K#wasThisHelpful","R2GHZ1FJ6CCHV1","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PALEFACE (Writ., Dir. Buster Keaton, 1922, 25 minutes) is a classic silent short by none other than Buster Keatonâ€”the man who pretty much invented everything that has ever been any good in cinema. Here BK is an innocent butterfly collector who stumbles into a tribe of Indians. About to lose their land to the evil, greedy white man, they decide to kill the next white man they see. It is of course BK. This is so important as part of the document that is American comedy on film. It is an early BK masterpiece, a slightly longer short (shorts were usually 13 to 17 minutes long), with stunning special effects that are nearly inexplicable today.But always funny as hell. A tumble off a cliff, a change of wardrobe: no one could do a thing that held a candle to BK's best work. This film belongs in your collection if you truly love comedy. The 1920s, black and white film, silent film, none of it matters when you watch Buster Keaton. He was such a genius and fantastic ad-libber that he will be forever funny to the point of stopping your heart for you. Aside from the slightly racist attitude toward Indiansâ€”and several of the actors were Nativesâ€”this is a classic that will have you laughing while your eyes are glued to every second. A lot of the humor is in trying to figure out how he shot certain scenes.That is a thing about BK no one can appreciate without watching his films: he was a true magician, trained, some swear, by Harry Houdini himself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R58CVLFLC9GEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YQT7RC#wasThisHelpful","R58CVLFLC9GEE","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CAP, ""FLAT""/""DRIVER'S"", RED PLAID (VARIOUS PATCHES), 100% COTTON, GENERIC SIZE LARGE (ONE SIZE FITS MOST) BY EPOCH is an amazing thing. Needing a summer version of this cap style, I went for this very attractive-looking fun Epoch version. It was one of the best buys I've ever made in caps/hats. It is cool, perfect for summer no matter what you plan on doing (I would avoid getting it wet, because it will shrink a tiny bit). I am a sucker for tartans and this reminds me of one of my favorite tartans, the Royal Stuart. This has the perfect mix of plaid patches. As a cap, it is superlative 100% cotton!This is fully lined with 100% cotton, a very pretty mini-paisley that reminds me of an old bow tie I used to love. It is extremely comfortable and the sweatband is the same material, with an inner lining that wicks away any sweat. An excellent, beautiful bit of headwear which is what I expect from Epoch anyway. I wish the seller had stated in the listing that it is an Epoch cap. Then I would have had zero doubts. This is also a truly snap-front cap, an important detail because so many companies are just gluing the front of the cap to the visor these days. I just love this and I'm only sorry I'll probably not get to buy a second one.Epoch, based in New York City, has been around since the 1990s. That is when hat crazes began among the young, but Epoch was dedicated to totally excellent headwear at very affordable prices. I own three of their felt porkpies for the winter: among the best hats I own. As to this cap, which I always call a ""Braque"" cap: it was invented in its streamlined modern form by Cubist creator artist George Braque. He called it a ""casquette"" and had his tailor use his design to make two caps: one black, one white. So aside from Cubism and his inspiration of Picasso, Braque also gave us this cap. And THIS Epoch cap stays true to that beautiful design. It isn't weirdly or stupidly designed like some of the newer models I see.An Epoch hat is always distinguished by its beautiful fit. Some think Epoch makes hats too large, but that is because most people don't rightly know their hat size. This cap has a beautifully finished, well fitted bit of elastic at the back. It fits my huge head and the size I got was close to a size L, but it fits wonderfully. I'd say if you get one of these, be aware that it will probably fit anyone from size 56 to 59. And if you don't understand that size system, you'd better learn it quickly. It is your head's diameter in centimeters, rounded up to the next whole number. Measure your head and write it down--and be sure to check hat size charts. My size is 59 which is 7 3/8 inches = U.S. hat size 7 3/8.The seller is listed as SK Hat-Shop, with whom I have dealt in the past. But I ended up trading with a seller called We Buy We Sell. I'm glad about the seller, who is in West New York, New Jersey; only hoping this is not a mis-listed seller. One final detail: if this doesn't quite look like your style, I recommend you try it anyway. You won't believe how well these caps look and how nicely they fit, because Epoch knows what it is doing. They made these caps to be sleek, attractive and comfortable--like all their headwear. Braque was an artist of many talents.

"*Dayenu means in Hebrew, ""It would have been sufficient for us.""HIDDEN INHERITANCE: FAMILY SECRETS, MEMORY, AND FAITH by Rev. Heidi B. Neumark (2015, scheduled to be published in October) is one of the more satisfying and personally touching books I have ever read on one of my most favorite subjects: a person suddenly learning they are Jewish. Or at least sort of Jewish.Lutheran pastor Rev. Neumark was startled by her daughter one day almost a decade ago; her daughter had discovered--on Wikipedia of all places--that their family, that is, Rev. Neumark's father, had been Jewish. Rev. Neumark, as leery as I am of the swamp called Wikipedia, dismissed her daughter's claims. Then on a sort of whim, she began digging. After ceaseless digging she had unearthed the ghost of a titanic family secret: her Jewish father had barely escaped the Nazis but her grandparents on one side and many other relatives perished. Coming to America to start a new and very respectable life, Rev. Neumark's father left the Jewish behind.This story is a deeply touching one. While most of us do not have the money and resources Rev. Neumark had--to research endlessly, take endless trips to Germany and Switzerland, to track down and visit unknown relatives--it is stunning what one can find with just some searching. She never seems to tire throughout the entire book, telling how her daughter found everything on Google. (She makes a reference by naming one of her chapters ""Googling Moses"", the name of an ancestor who was a rabbi.) The trip can be exasperating, since Rev. Neumark is determined to work in some sort of memoire that in my opinion is unrelated to her main story.This stunned me in many ways. I also am a Jew, one who learned about it very, very late in life. I also despaired during a visit to a cemetery in Mexico and not finding my grandfather's or great-grandfather's graves. I also suffered from many family secrets, and I too am a priest of another religion who had to come to terms with my ""new inner Jew"". While I rather resent anyone who tries to tie Judaism into Christianity, I can empathize with someone like Rev. Neumark, who after all had no choice. She did not try to convert, as I did, in order to be ""officially"" Jewish and according to Jewish Law, she is not Jewish on any count because her mother was not born Jewish.The latter points matter little. This book is a fantastic, direct and sometimes overly frank account of that new breed arising: the New Jew. For all family members and even friends, I highly recommend this. Unlike other books I see newly published, this is well written and intelligent, with gracefully flowing prose and intelligent reasoning. A bibliophile could not ask for more ... not even a Judeao-Buddhist bibliophile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TTZLF28SMXPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630881244#wasThisHelpful","R2TTZLF28SMXPR","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rarely do I waste time with 100% trash here, mainly because amazon requires I rate at least one star then spend the entire review defending/explaining myself to nasty readers with nothing better to do. So let's get right to it: Deborah King is some sort of a snake oil saleswoman of the lowest order. Oh, at least her message can be, at times, maybe half-positive. Mostly she is as full of herself as she is of hot air. This book, part self-promoting biography, part new age nonsense, is proof to that.I should have thrown this down when King kicked off the book by bragging about how she exorcized a Chinese student who was possessed by an ancient Chinese dragon who was once a power of good, but had turned evil, apparently with the eternally sought-after goal of possessing a poor young Chinese woman. Can you guess what I decided King was full of, at that moment in my reading?--and of course it got worse, with babbling about chakras, body-mind and the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, an unfortunate individual about whom it is best to know nothing--and try to forget anything you might know already. So what is left? A little of this, a little of that, some psychobabble that always makes the patient/victim/spiritual casualty the ripe sucker because it makes that person the guilty party.Is that all, you may be asking, that would set me off like the Manhattan Project? Not by a long chalk: King has somehow garnered herself a reputation for being able to magically cure cancer. I wish I could incarcerate every such person, who preys on the bereaved, the ill, the dying and the disabled. She describes a friend who eventually died of pancreatic cancer and at least she did not try to heal him--she just tried to psychobabble him into a negative, self-blaming place while he was on chemo. He died miserably, King suggests, because he had talked himself into it as his father had also died of cancer, in terrible pain.Well, this is the type of garbage you can expect here. King's emotional/psychological manipulation of those in the worst shape is the thing that creates my animus. It enrages me. I gave it two stars because my original 1-star, it seems to me, was keeping people from reading this review. It is stupid; it is also true: people won't read 1-star reviews. What little good--and I do mean LITTLE--there is in this waste of paper can be found in any of His Holiness the Dalai Lama's books on compassion and right living.

"BAR SOAP, BY PRE DE PROVENCE, WITH SHEA BUTTER is a pretty fantastic and luxurious scented soap that will leave you feeling like a French aristocrat. And no guillotine required. This lathers well and cleanses in a rich, weird way because I am not accustomed to such things in general. My mother used to have such things for the family but I am a very plain, simple person.

"APRON, 100% COTTON, ONE SIZE FITS MOST by Flirty Aprons was a weird thing to select from the Vine, but I happen to require an apron in the kitchen even if I can hardly stand. This looked good to try out, so what can I say?--I'm going to try it out and see! It is a typical apron, 100% cotton twill, with good pockets but is a bit slender at the breast. The neck strings are untied so it may be adjusted to the height you like best; the usual apron strings in this case are a sash, extremely long so this really will fit nearly anybody. It probably would be safe in the washer, but the instructions say to hand-wash and hang dry. I suspect they fear our washers and dryers in America are garment-chewing monstrosities.This is made in China and I see, more and more often, things being designed totally by the Chinese. They have no idea how we live or anything in general, so one must live with occasionally silly things like instructions to hand-wash a tough cotton twill apron. It'll be fun and really useful, and I do not mind sharing one final secret: this will help save my clothes when I eat certain foods.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R90C79C7UVELQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4IYIWU#wasThisHelpful","R90C79C7UVELQ","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"JUST ADD WATER: A SURFING SAVANT'S JOURNEY WITH ASPERGER'S by Robert Yehling & Clay Marzo (2015) is a rather weighty biography of surfing sensation Clay Marzo and his struggle with Asperger's Autism, most commonly known as Asperger's Syndrome. This attracted me because I have Asperger's, and am always so happy to read and hear about the triumphs and successes of others afflicted with this form of high-functioning autism. So here, then, is a biography extraordinaire of a successful, wildly popular young Hawai'ian surfing star that delves deeply into his past, his family, his current girlfriend and his success of living life daily with a frankly weird condition.This is a truly deep biography that amazingly allows Clay to speak for himself--I can only guess Yehling recorded extensive interviews with everyone he could, but the idea that Marzo ""coauthored"" this beyond fully cooperating with it is a bit laughable. Also, the interviews could really stand some expert editing. Yehling has a way of droning on and on, most unseemly for a good biography. And that is the misfortune with this book, because if you have not the slightest interest in surfers, there is no way you can get to the true marrow of the valuable information about a successful person with Asperger's.That is not the only thing wrong with this effort. Yehling is more than careless about delineating AS, how it differs from person to person, and doesn't even offer very clear or concise explanations which are necessary in such cases as this biography. No AS person is exactly alike (Einstein, it is believed, suffered from it and he was hardly a surfer). The book is simply too narrow and for what it is, I commend it; for what it lacks, I criticize it. A final massive pet peeve is Yehling himself. I know he is a surfing journalist, but this book often reads like a 13-year-old enthusiast wrote it. When I settle in for a biography I expect far better than this.I can't knock a well-intentioned, thoroughly researched biography, which makes this review tough--I have to knock a book that prattles for pages about essentially nothing, and a writing style I'd be ashamed to get from a junior high schooler. Now you have the skinny, and you know my own opinion, you decide. Overall, this book is no more and no less than a thorough biography of Clay Marzo. So much of his life is ahead of him (one sincerely hopes and prays) so it is a bit of a fluke to have a bio of one still so young.For those with an interest in Asperger's, I suggest better reads such as Tony Attwood's The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome and even my own book, No Duty To Retreat: The Stories of Tourette's Syndrome and Asperger's Autism ... just DO NOT pay $100 for a copy if you can find one for $7!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DK1AIETA0AWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544256212#wasThisHelpful","R3DK1AIETA0AWV","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HAT, ""FISHING"" a/k/a ""BOONIE"", BY MEGA CAP is a pretty awesome hat for what it does and look at the price for heaven's sake! This is what a lot of folks call a boonie hat, used in the military (you can easily get a typical khaki color and look like a fisherman if you prefer), a/k/a fishing hat a/k/a bucket hat. When I started wearing these it is because I saw them on Henry Fonda in On Golden Pond (Special Edition) and began wearing them that very year. Nothing like a middle-aged man trying to look like Professor Norman Thayer (or David McCallum as Ducky from NCIS: Season 5 for that matter). His was an old fishing hat, but I got boonies more often for the wider brim and tougher build.Well here's a perfect hat: it's both a boonie and a fishing hat. It has a snap on either side of the brim so you can snap up the brim on the sides of your head (good to keep it out of the way sometimes and streamline the hat shape). You can just jauntily snap up one side only, which would then turn it into yet another style called a ""slouch"". Boonies and slouches originated in Australia, where the heat is super-nasty, sub-Equatorial and therefore those guys are all about sun protection. This hat is 100% cotton, so be aware of that. It WILL SHRINK, but not a whole heck of a lot. I usually put mine through a beating every other year in the wash--they come out just fine. I own a dozen different kinds.This really great, broad-brimmed, comfy and cool Mega Cap boonie is just what the doctor ordered for high summer, low summer, spring and early autumn.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31FADO25L8DC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000B62HOK#wasThisHelpful","R31FADO25L8DC7","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CAP, FLAT DRIVER'S, LINEN BY JEANNE SIMMONS is something I simply have to review. These beautiful caps used to revolt me to no end 20 years ago. Today I can't fathom why. Originally I got a couple in this style as winter caps, and really love them. In the summer it is just as vital for me to have a few caps, but it is weird how summer seems to call for a wider hat variety. This linen flat cap really fits the bill. The sun protection is unparalleled, the linen may feel a bit stifling when compared to my normal go-to hat which is a straw fedora. But this type of cap is indispensable, whether you just keep one handy in the car, closet or you wear them as a rule (like my wife's grandfather). The fit is excellent with no adjustable nonsense and no nasty elastic rubbing on one's head.I have noticed how sad it is this isn't called the ""Braque cap"". It was common all the way back to the 19th century to see caps very similar to this, called a ""Newsboy"" capâ€”but those were of gigantic diameter. The British and Irish cut the diameter down but then they based theirs on the Scottish bonnet which is no more than a beret. But then, artist Georges Braque, master of Cubism, took the newsboy style and really streamlined it in the end of the 1930s. He worked out the details with his tailor who then made him two: a black one and a white one. Braque named his cap design ""casquette"" and I don't even see that name used. Oddly enough, Braque designed it with the usual snap on the brim (which dates back to the end of the 19th century) but his design could be worn with it unsnapped ... and he designed it for summer wear, in linen. So this Jeanne Simmons cap is closest to the original thing. I really love that aspect of it.Like I said: the Braque Cap. There is only one bugbear and it really bothers me: beware of caps that have the front of the cap GLUED to the visor. I absolutely despise that yet even the Scottish cap-makers are doing it now for some stupid reason and it is infuriating. Doing things on the cheap like that will get you no customers and lose you a lot of pals too! So let the shopper beware, live with the glued visor if you must and get yourself a nice, cool flat cap in linen for the hot months as well as the early fall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VERWYUPBY37R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XZIDEJS#wasThisHelpful","R3VERWYUPBY37R","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE CASE AGAINST 8 (2014, 113 minutes, for HBO) is a truly riveting documentary that seems to have been at least five years in the making. California's proposed anti-gay equality legislation (Proposition 8) was and remains at the forefront of the story. Two wonderful, well-adjusted gay couples (Kristen Perry and Sandra Stier; Paul Katami and Jeffrey Zarillo) became the stars of our era's civil rights issue when they agreed to head the lawsuit against then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Prop 8. Perry and Stier each came from failed straight marriages and each had two sons. They are all delightfully intelligent and strong people. So Rob Reiner, president of the American Foundation for Equal Rights (AFER) helped get the best law firm (it is full of gay lawyers) and then pulled a real coup. In fact a double coup.Reiner, very much behind the scenes, got himself one of the most gifted, powerful attorneys on earth: David Boies. The name you might not recall but you'll definitely recall him when you see/hear him. He argued for Al Gore in the USSC case Gore vs. Bush (2000). But the stunner was when they approached Ted Olson and landed his help too. Olson had been for Bush in the USSC case and had been Boies' adversary. The two became good friends during that case. So ... with everything in place, here we go round the mulberry bush. The AFER ""dream team"" won their case to the boiling anger of the fascist evangelicals and Olson basically lost his golden boy status in the Republican party.So this is the story of the legal back-and-forth nightmare from the defeat of Prop 8 to where we are today. If I am not mistaken, Olson is the one arguing this case in front of the USSC in behalf of the gay community. This very case is the ruling we are now awaiting from the USSC: the ruling that would make gay equality the law of the land. It took over four years for the team to arrive at this point, but when they win (I can't envision us losing this) the world will win. It's a HUGE score for democracy. And if you think this will be some dry recitation of facts, just watch it. The documentation, the shooting, is smooth, riveting, and sometimes fun. These are all super-intelligent, charismatic people and the humor zings around like no one's business.What is important to recall is this legal team and the two brave couples already got to the U.S. Supreme Court for last year's ruling that struck down Prop 8 for California. (The other case ended with the USSC striking down the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).) This documentary, while not leaning on that timeline too hard, covers it with ease and thoroughness. With that under the justices' belts in 2014, no one can seriously believe they will rule against gay equality in a few days time. I have my party accessories ready! Do you? I am going to party like it cost $19.99 when the final ruling comes in a few days' time. â˜ºOne of my favorite scenes is the mock supreme court practice trial with several law firm members trying to trip up Olson. That is like trying to make a silk purse into a sow's ear! Lots of great humor punctuates this story of two brave couples, two brave lawyers and one hell of a brave law firm fighting for all our rights. Another scene I love is seeing Paul Katami and Jeffrey Zarillo attempting to get married after they had won their case. It took the Attorney General of California to make a direct phone call to the courthouse to order them to issue licenses to all gay couples immediately. That was so awesome I wept with joy.If anyone sees this as an ""agenda"", they have no brain. What begins here as a fight for equality will end with true, honest, hard-won equality. FOR ALL. This DVD is an important historical document. Few issues could be as important. You must see this and understand that the events at the beginning of this short timeline are about to explode in a fireworks finale--in a few days, the USSC will announce its 2015 ruling. (Again, paired with this ruling will be another of equal weight: the ruling on ""Obamacare"".) This is so important a document that I am buying it as soon as I can.Two more films, documentaries, I highly recommend:Valentine Road about the evil cold-blooded murder of a transgender eighth-grader from Oxnard, California; see my review.The New Black [HD] about the successful, horribly controversial struggle in Maryland to fight homophobic legislation; see my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGDR44ZUKXU0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3E1H3A#wasThisHelpful","RGDR44ZUKXU0A","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a PBS-head you have heard, once in a blue moon, the brilliant adaptation songs of John D. Boswell of Washington State, better known as ""melodysheep"". He has taken footage of people from Julia Child to Fred Rogers (""In the Garden of Your Mind"") to Yoda (""Feel the Force"") and turned them into awesome, cogent electronica-dance songs. What Boswell does is hear the melody in people's spoken phrases, then puts them in order, sets them to music, and in my mind that makes him the greatest composer in the world. My wife and I have seen/heard his work on Julia Child (""Keep On Cooking"") and Bob Ross (""Fluffy Little Clouds"")--which made us weep with emotion.The ""looping"" of spoken words which are then turned into a song is a concept invented by composer Steve Reich back in the 1970s (Reich's best work: Reich: Different Trains, Electric Counterpoint / Kronos Quartet, Pat Metheny). I did a tiny bit of this myself in the early 1970s, and it requires composition skills that are indescribable. To hear then notate the natural music of the spoken word simply cannot be done by most humans. Boswell can do it with ease, but it is extremely hard work. You'll hear all of that in his songs. Best of all, Boswell pays homage to every subject for whom he composes. Just do a search for videos of ""melodysheep"" and pay close attention to the PBS stuff he composed. You can readily hear the entire pieces for yourself. They are usually just under four minutes long.Boswell's videos are as vital as the music, but you don't really need the videos. When I heard his treatment of Yoda (""Use the Force"") I wept with pure joy. His take (""Let Us All Unite"") on Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator (see my review of the film) will send shivers up your spine. (Don't confuse it with Hans Zimmer's rather pathetic music video of the same nature.) Get as much as you can of this young man's work. He is the next big thing and he is happening now. He reminds me of Wendy Carlos recording Bach back in the 1960s on a Moog. That is important and will change the world, note by note.And if Boswell/melodysheep doesn't make you appreciate the skill of a true composer, nothing can!RECOMMENDED OTHER WORK: Midnight Sun and you can find much more in MP3 downloads (you will not find any listings of ""music"" albums by melodysheep and that's a damned shame since he has done several albums).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R43ISA43LN9TO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D9W80DK#wasThisHelpful","R43ISA43LN9TO","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES has a packaging that appears a bit corny, and a rather anemic-looking start ... but wait a few seconds. This 100% better sequel to James Franco's Planet of the Apes take is so astounding and so stirring I thought I felt the shivers I got from the original Planet Of The Apes (1968) [HD].This film simply picks up on Caesar living in what is left of the old park 10 years after the original movie (Andy Serkis in yet another Gollum-like motion capture appearance that would never let you guess what he looks like, but Caesar does have his eyes). He is surrounded by ape culture, some of them can speak and all of them can understand English perfectly. Thanks to the chimp-carried virus that humans invented and managed to spread, the apes think all the humans must be dead. Until they run into a few--cue the human-ape war.The effects here are stunning, and surprisingly moving. I was as involved and interested in the apes as I ever was with any film characters--and far more interested in them than in the humans. The ape sounds are perfect and the ones who struggle to mimic--or shall I say ""ape""--spoken English are absolutely perfect too. I wonder if WE began talking like that. Every other ape merely signs. Just don't be too fooled by their ape-status. They are basically humans in chimpanzee form (with a tiny scattering of gorillas and one, exactly one, Orangutan named ""Maurice""). This film is filled with subtle homages and I challenge you to two things: spot each homage and spot the ""cameo"" James Franco makes in this film. I'll give you one homage right off: the music, which pays tribute to the original PLANET OF THE APES movie.It never occurred to me that I would want to see this. It took them nearly five years to come out with it. The original was stupid, to be honest, and sequels are usually an ill-thought-out egregious error. Not in this case. And there were so many of us who wondered what the sequel might be like. Its only weakness: if they are sticking to the canonical storyline, we already know what happens so they can stop making any more of these right now and quit while they are ahead. Yet this film actually could promise a few more well-made sequels, that is, if the money and fans' patience don't run dry.You'll be glad of having seen this and want to watch it again--but my opinion as to that is two viewings will be enough. Get it for your ""rainy day"" DVD shelf, that is for sure. At a few minutes over two hours, this movie whizzes by really fast. One final thing is for sure: you'll never again doubt humans are truly ape--no matter who you are!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14AGIZL84A8WI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MH8DB68#wasThisHelpful","R14AGIZL84A8WI","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROJECT ALMANAC (Dir. Dean Israelite, 2015, 106 minutes, Prod. by MTV Films) stars Jonny Weston as Atlanta teen physics wiz David Raskin. When David, his sister Christina (a stunning but too-little seen Virginia Gardner) and his two goofy genius friends (Allen Evangelista, Sam Lerner) decide to stir things up, they really stir. Poking around David's basement, they decide to investigate the laboratory of David's late father. What they discover is David's late father worked for one of the spookiest government agencies imaginable--and built a time machine for them.And glory of glories, it's hidden under the basement floor in a special compartment. No spoilers here, but can you guess what a bunch of impossibly cute teen nerds are going to do with a time machine? You won't be surprised--at first. Then you will be at the edge of your seat as this changes from cute teen comedy to something like a quasi-horror movie. Filmed in a clever way I have seen before but never with such smooth, stylish cinematographic genius, this is entirely from the viewpoint of the kids' camera. Most of the time Christina Raskin is doing the shooting as a way to help her brother's documentation, but there are occasions when some of the characters take the camera and film themselves. There is a BLAIR WITCH PROJECT feel to it and it will nauseate you if you don't take regular breaks.The thing about this film aside from its pure vintage 2004 digital camera shooting is the talent of the cast. Though much of the heavier stuff is heaved onto Jonny Weston's adorably thin shoulders, everyone here is absolutely top-notch. The humor, and this does start out as a comedy, is unbeatable and I wonder if some was ad-libbed. All the kids are pitch-perfect and loveable. This is no Disney time-travel movie, but it isn't PI and sure isn't BACK TO THE FUTURE or anything else though it is a remake of 2004's Primer [HD] (see my review) with lots of The Butterfly Effect [HD] thrown into the mix. Aside from the really fantastic humor, which you have to really pay attention to catch, there are several little homages to most of the time travel movies I know.In fact I am a time travel film connoisseur, having seen pretty much every single one with a few rancid exceptions. PROJECT ALMANAC (the title itself is a double homage, did you catch that?) is going down in history as one of the very best of them all. While it is plainly a remake of PRIMER, it is a fantastic, touching and thrilling update making it relevant for young adults, which PRIMER didn't quite achieve. I highly recommend this, but as I said, it has rules: pay close attention to every second, take frequent breaks and I recommend a second viewing within a day or two of the first. Really, this is the only time I know that an entire film is presented as camera footage that is deliberately shot as a record for the audience to view.Naturally you are more than just a ""voyeur"" here: it is like being part of that team of kids. After that, watch as a perennial favorite at your leisure. It seems available only in Blu Ray which is a poke in my eye, but I'll bet a normal DVD version will be forthcoming. This film is going to end up being THE TWELVE MONKEYS of this new young generation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z07WH0O3IG1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T4X9YU6#wasThisHelpful","R2Z07WH0O3IG1Y","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE NEW BLACK was a stunning documentary which seems to date to 2012 and deals with Maryland's vote to legalize gay marriage. Somehow, and I really do not know why other than the huge percentage of black population in Maryland, this issue got immediately cast in a racist sort of light. The message to the entire country seemed, at least for a short time, to be the very concept of gay equality resting purely with the black community. Of course gay equality does not rest purely with the black community and this documentary beautifully shows the tension, the pain, among Maryland's black community. They were starting to feel exactly what the title of this film says: gay is ""the new"" black.It's a stupid concept pro se. Within the context of the documentary, I think that the black religious community and its leaders were right about many things. They were seething angry about the gay community comparing gay equality to black equality--and in some strange way I support that view. It could be the simple matter that gay isn't a skin color, we were never slaves over a two-century period, or slaves at all, and aside from Stonewall and the medication push for AIDS we never had to have violent civil rights-defining moments. A very obnoxious Queer Nation march in the 1990s is not the same as Selma. Or is it?In this film the viewer is presented with that and other salient, important questions. Two people jumped at me from this film: one, a random young man spending time with his homophobic friends was approached and he angrily said the state had no right to tell anybody whom they could/could not marry, to the grim shock of his friends. The other person who tugged at my heart is the young black girl who has a sweet, wide-eyed enthusiasm that one day she'll be happy with the woman she loves, a job she loves, and full equality. Once I saw those two young people, I had my answer. Gay has always been a form of ""black"", just as women understood this about themselves, and did not need John Lennon to write a song telling us what a woman means to the world. (Do you all know that song? Lennon uses the ""n"" word most effectively.)So I counsel a cool discretion and a clear mind when seeing this and watching, listening, with those skills. This nation is not a theocracy, and someone in the film, a very important personage, speaks to the public and says equality, civil rights, all matters of justice, should be free of any dictates of religious dogma. He slapped down the mandarins of orthodoxy and slapped them good. The problem is, as this film also teaches, too few people are willing to listen, care or share of themselves when it comes to the torments and travails of others. The unsupported young gay black people in this film wonder where their families went, why they suddenly got abandoned for being gay, when the referendum came up for the vote. It made me cry--and not because ""the perverts"" were trampling the name of Jesus.That kind of straw man argument was used by racists in the mid-20th century. Let us not forget that!This will make you think very hard, and will make you cry too if you have any sense of justice. They say Rosa Parks sitting at the back of the bus really wasn't the true issue back in the day. I was there and recall it very well. It WAS the issue of the day, and it was Rosa Parks who made this nation wake the hell up. Watch this documentary and ask yourself who the new Rosa Parks is. One thing is for sure: the gay Rosa Parks will never emerge from among the dum-dums who hide in churches behind their pews and their choirs. Rosa Parks did not hide that way. It's the kids, it's your kids, it's everyone like it or not.And as a good loud spoiler, as we all know, Maryland did pass that equality law by such a razor-thin margin it almost looked like the fascists were going to take it away ... that is where you will learn another lesson from this film: how the evangelical white folks are using the black churches to spread their hatred.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHNVVBOSRW4WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOR78K0#wasThisHelpful","RHNVVBOSRW4WF","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CLAWS OF STEEL a/k/a Last Hero in China (see my review for that version, Orig. title Wong Fei Hung V: Tit gai dau ng gung, 1993, 111 minutes) stars Jet Li (credited as Lin Kit Li) as Wong Fei Hung in a super-paced comedy that has far better comedy than kung fu.When Wong loses his undersized school lease, he moves from Foshan to a better place only to become embroiled in a kidnapping scheme that somehow involves the British. While the quality is somewhat between what we grew to love post-1995 and the crap they used to put out in the 1980s, the comedy here is at its finest. Do not forget the film you are watching: the Chinese government was still pushing hard at this time to discredit Buddhists, especially the Chinese Orthodox and the Tibetans. In this film they slip it in no problem.This film amazed me simply because I had never seen nor heard of it before. While knowing what to expect--subpar kung fu and the usual communist messages--its comedic slapstick combined with sophistication really floored me. The wire-fu is barely visible and obviously Jet Li had some fun playing Wong Fei Hung here. He would go on to play the legendary Wong Fei Hung a few times with his last being Badges of Fury in 2013, after having played him famously in the series Once Upon a Time in China Multi-Feature (Once Upon a Time in China / Once Upon a Time in China II / Once Upon a Time in China 3) (that film series would go on without him though he returned to the Wong Fei Hung role almost immediately to star in this film under review).My gut feeling was Jet Li was not only lampooning the film industry and Wong Fei Hung character--but also poking a lot of fun at himself. I also think this film inspired Jackie Chan's fantastic turn as a young Wong Fei Hung in the legendary and beautiful The Legend of Drunken Master from 1994. Of course that very year Jet Li was busily worrying his own spectacular Wong Fei Hung-style spoof Legend of the Red Dragon a/k/a THE NEW LEGEND OF SHAOLIN. (See my review of both those.) CLAWS is also somehow a spoof of all his films up til that time. In fact the film is kind of like a spoof of his whole career--and I can't fathom why he did it at all. I've heard he has a great sense of humor and he certainly has a flair for a kind of dignified, high-brow comedy only the Chinese can accomplish.But then he has a large family in China and no doubt has been kept on a short leash his whole life. Anyway, martial arts connoisseur and fans should see at the very least this silly, rollicking film for the comedy if nothing else. I've seen far worse than this from the famous ""Chinese Golden 90s"", though I was surprised to see Jet Li in something apparently so demeaning. However, I have always felt Jet Li is a kind of unwilling puppet of the Chinese communist propaganda machine, and this film is but one piece of proof to that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U9HNLD9YBQ31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RRKV1Q#wasThisHelpful","R3U9HNLD9YBQ31","A34GZPHWYPSY2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34GZPHWYPSY2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LAST HERO IN CHINA a/k/a Claws Of Steel Aka Last Hero In China (English Subtitled) [HD] (see my review for that version, Orig. title Wong Fei Hung V: Tit gai dau ng gung, 1993, 111 minutes) stars Jet Li (credited as Lin Kit Li) as Wong Fei Hung in a super-paced comedy that has far better comedy than kung fu. Before I go further here, let me advise that this version may have soundtracks in Chinese as well as English, and the earlier release had subtitles only--but you never really know with Chinese releases. I happened to see this for the first time dubbed in Spanish and I LOVED the way it worked so well.When Wong loses his undersized school lease, he moves from Foshan to a better place only to become embroiled in a kidnapping scheme that somehow involves the British. While the quality is somewhat between what we grew to love post-1995 and the crap they used to put out in the 1980s, the comedy here is at its finest. Do not forget the film you are watching: the Chinese government was still pushing hard at this time to discredit Buddhists, especially the Chinese Orthodox and the Tibetans. In this film they slip it in no problem.This film amazed me simply because I had never seen nor heard of it before. While knowing what to expect--subpar kung fu and the usual communist messages--its comedic slapstick combined with sophistication really floored me. The wire-fu is barely visible and obviously Jet Li had some fun playing Wong Fei Hung here. He would go on to play the legendary Wong Fei Hung a few times with his last being Badges of Fury in 2013, after having played him famously in the series Once Upon a Time in China Multi-Feature (Once Upon a Time in China / Once Upon a Time in China II / Once Upon a Time in China 3) (that film series would go on without him though he returned to the Wong Fei Hung role almost immediately to star in this film under review).My gut feeling was Jet Li was not only lampooning the film industry and Wong Fei Hung character--but also poking a lot of fun at himself. I also think this film inspired Jackie Chan's fantastic turn as a young Wong Fei Hung in the legendary and beautiful The Legend of Drunken Master from 1994. Of course that very year Jet Li was busily worrying about his own spectacular Wong Fei Hung-style spoof Legend of the Red Dragon a/k/a THE NEW LEGEND OF SHAOLIN. (See my review of both those: I think RED DRAGON kept Li out of DRUNKEN MASTER but not out of the role of Wong Fei Hung for very long.) CLAWS is also somehow a spoof of Li's whole career--and I can't fathom why he did it at all. I've heard he has a great sense of humor and he certainly has a flair for a kind of dignified, high-brow comedy only the Chinese can accomplish.The very fact that he played some goofy nobody in NEW LEGEND OF SHAOLIN/RED DRAGON while Jackie Chan got the plum role of Wong Fei Hung in DRUNKEN MASTER in the same year shows just how perverse the Chinese industry can get. But then Li has a large family in China and no doubt has been kept on a very short leash his whole life by the government.
