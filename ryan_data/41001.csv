"Red Winter is an entertaining suspenseful read that gallops onward page after page and hardly allows those to catch their breath before another action packed scene charges the reader's vivid imagination. Set in 1920 Russia the reader is immediately introduced to the ghosts that haunt our narrator's mind. Returning from the blood soaked fields and passage of battle, all Kolya desires is his family and the comforting sounds of civilian life. Sick from the images and realizations of war he returns only to find his village eerily silent and his home empty. It is only when the bone-chilling night falls that Kolya begins to suspect the silent woods beyond the village may hold more secrets than answers to the mystery of the disappearance of the inhabitants of Belev and that folk tale monsters may be real...In the end, this was an entertaining thriller that mixed atmosphere with action and pulled the tale of Koschei, The Deathless into a mystery that had this reader sneaking away from real life to her kindle at any available opportunity. The dramatic styling of The Child Thief (another novel by Mr. Smith) continues in Red Winter. Whereas the reader was entranced with the grisly collaboration of a kidnapping, the consequences of unleashed paranoia and the tale of Baba Yaga in The Child Thief; Red Winter takes on the realizations and horrors of war, the limits of a father's and husband's love with the tale of Koschei, The Deathless. Set in similar time periods and the snow howls and screams across the pages in both, Red Winter is completely different than The Child Thief. Different in many positive ways but still the disappointing negatives I found with The Child Thief were again found in Red Winter mainly predictability, repetitive actions or thoughts and a lackluster ending. Still I eagerly look forward to sneaking away from real life and joining another journey into the snow encrusted pages with another cleverly blended tale of Eastern Europe and Slavic Folklore from Mr. Smith.*I would like to thank Pegasus publishing and Edelweiss for the opportunity to read and enjoy Red Winter","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SXBHUQADLVDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDEQNZ6#wasThisHelpful","R1SXBHUQADLVDD","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everyone loves a villain and practically everyone loves ice cream, so what a perfect combination in this a life revisited through the words of a woman who is dubbed The Ice Cream Queen of America and yet in the early 1980's is a celebrated pariah who is about to face the tabloids, the all too eager accusing public eye and critical fight to salvage her image, career and life. It is open season on Lillian M. Dunkle as the courtroom and papers play out as a bad scandalous episode of ""This is Your Life"" and her once brilliant empire of cold whipped butterfat, milk substitute and corn syrup seems to melt before eyes, but wait this is not a tragedy oh no Lillian stands with her own crown of dignity and tells the reader her side of events before they pass judgment. So picture it darlings a back and forth tale of struggles, humble tragic beginnings and rise from obscurity with an extreme and unconventional narrator who uses blunt and sometimes crass wicked humor to relate the moments of her life. Who knew ice cream played so much an integral role in America during the 20th century (at least according to our anti-heroine), with sharp wit and candid access the reader is privy to this hard to ignore magnetic being who seems to have more than 36 flavors of personality and stories to tell. So pull out your favorite ice cream out of the freezer, try to ignore the summer heat and enjoy a real treat with The Ice Cream Queen of Orchard Street.In the end, the unaccustomed weather is what drove this reader to sample The Ice Cream Queen of Orchard Street and I am very happy I did, this was a wonderful entertaining treat that helped me ignore the mugginess outside. The integral whipped combination of history and unconventional narrator had me sneaking away to my kindle at any available moment and I finished this title very quickly. Lillian Dunkle was a charismatic personality that reminded me of Sophia Petrillo-Weinstock (played by the beloved late Estelle Getty) with all the spunk and ease of spinning an engrossing story with a pearl of wisdom hidden deep inside. In Lillian's case though more profanity, wicked humor and manipulation is whipped into her story and also combines the drama and negative publicity of: Joan Crawford, Martha Stewart and the extravagance of Zsa Zsa Gabor and Leona Helmsley to create a believable character that dares the reader to judge before her side of events are shared. I loved the history and details of the fanciful field of ice cream, it seemed more of a confessional behind the locked gates of Willy Wonka's factory learning the secrets of the trade and what drives the consumption and desire of the public. And the forgotten theories on the devastating disease Poliomyelitis were fascinating from a medical standpoint and really pulled this reader in further. Not only a funny read there are also pages of sadness and transformation that caused a few tears to fall (especially at the end)- Ms. Gilman's has a talent with description and building a heart-rending scene. Overall, I would recommend this read for those who need a good laugh, the outrageous scenarios are sure to surprise or cause a smile and you may learn something. So enjoy!I would like to thank Grand Central Publishing and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and enjoy The Ice Cream Queen of Orchard Street","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8ZBJFQM0U9JG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPQCTXU#wasThisHelpful","R8ZBJFQM0U9JG","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't judge this book by its cover. Succession may seem a benign rendering of history told by the dual perspectives of Margaret of Anjou and Margaret Beaufort purporting all the surrenders of romance, fettered views of the rise and fall of the Lancaster and York houses concentrating on frivolous trappings and precious else during 15th-century England but Succession by Livi Michael is actually a compelling tableau of history that is sure to excite history enthusiasts or those who appreciate a brilliantly delivered story. Presented in a distinct clever style Succession combines imaginative dialogue, rich description, a touch of lyrical prose and brilliantly depicted historical events to weave a tale chocked full of: premeditated treachery, all consuming greed, loss of innocence, murder most foul and the strong personalities that dominated the sides of the dynastic Wars of the Roses.Whether the curious reader is unfamiliar with the years or events that led to and followed the uneven rise and fall of the houses of Lancaster and York that historians delight in debating to this day, they are sure to be swept into a convincing tale that not only focuses on views of the 15th-century court but also pulls brief narration from the common man and woman. Machinations that consumed minds and corrupted hearts and its further consequences are shared with the reader in a concise fashion that fully captures the monumental events that affected the rich, poor and left a country torn with loyalty to either the red rose (for the house of Lancaster) or the white rose (for the house of York). Characters are divided by their houses (at times even representing both), cast in multifaceted light and dark shadows of personality and alliances and are heralded in chapters with the red or white rose insignia to aid the reader in understanding the character the chapter focuses on. Chapters are also introduced in a scholarly fashion with a selection from a chronicle, register, calendar roll or ballad that then is spun into a tableau of that event for the entertainment of the reader following a central character and continuing the time frame of events cleverly moving the story along without the need to backtrack and explain a journey or lesser battle. Although, Succession could even at times confuse those familiar with the history, events and central figures and even share in excess certain scenes and over dramatize at times- this is still a compelling title that is sure to entertain and encourage further study. If the reader desires more, it is clear Succession explains only part one of the events of the Wars of the Roses and there is still much to be told.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DGG79GEZIXR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6Y0HHQ#wasThisHelpful","R1DGG79GEZIXR0","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What is it about the story of the Fitzgeralds that draws many of us like moths to a consuming fire? Is it the fascination with the excess and frivolity of the era the golden couple dominated, the fine line of eccentric brilliance and unbalance they both danced or is it just human nature to want to read about tragedy and misfortune of others? With so much material to mold and conjure into a striking portrait of Zelda Fitzgerald and F. Scott Fitzgerald during their rise, ultimate fall from grace and arguable codependent relationship, I'm so sorry to say Z: a novel of Zelda Fitzgerald disappointed this reader.I thought this novel had been waiting long enough on my to-read list and on a whim purchased it, I wish now though I read more reviews or did more research. Ultimately I never lost myself in this story like I hoped. With a broad expanse of topics to cover that made up the years of 1918-1940 I understand that a lot of topics had to be explained and brought into Zelda's narration but for this reader it just became muddled with anachronistic dialogue, terms, and misplaced facts to point of frustrating distraction. Certain topics were also forced into the narration and became irksome to see in continuous pages. In regards to pacing, I found it sadly slow and tedious to the point of almost giving up.In the end, I am so sorry to say I think the central focus and time setting more than the choices of the direction of characterization kept me engaged enough to finish. However what disappointed this reader may fascinate and charm many enough to ignore the negatives. I wish those have a wonderful reading experience but it may help others to learn from my folly and maybe sample this novel, read a couple more reviews before their final decision or perhaps wait to read at your local library.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q546ERPLU69E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096QZ6OE#wasThisHelpful","R3Q546ERPLU69E","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hatmaker's Heart is a lovely read that will take the reader from the millinery shops of New York City to across the pond and back again. Set in the early 1920's the reader will be introduced to the high pressured world of fashion where the final embers of elegance and status of the Edwardian period are competing with the scandalous flamboyant Jazz Age. Where instead of steeped tea being served in halls, gin flows freely into dainty teacups, hemlines move up as fast as the length of current hairstyles and arms and legs swing to the Charleston. 1922 New York City is where the reader is first introduced to Nell Marchwold, who dreams of being a hat designer. But in a cut-throat world that is dominated by connections, margins and a designer's career could be over in a New York minute-what will it take to make it to the top?With historical detail that charms along with a vibrant cast of characters and offers a lively jaunt into the commercial and fashion world of New York City during the early 1920's this novel can quickly capture a reader's full attention and become a pleasant escape from real life. With an easy comparison to Clara and Mr. Tiffany and even a nod to Agnes Grey, The Hatmaker's Heart can also be comfortably taken as a tale of caution, a story questioning what is really important in life. Enough of a cozy quick read to satisfy those looking for a historical or lightly religious themed novel but also with a few surprises for those who desire an interesting twist and mystery with their reading.*I would like to thank FaithWords/Center Street Publishing and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and enjoy The Hatmaker's Heart","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R271FF01SUMDZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPQCSXQ#wasThisHelpful","R271FF01SUMDZS","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been said that home is where the heart is, it is also been said that a King's home is his castle. Ms. Valentine has spun these phrases and a lesser known German fairytale into a ducky read featuring New York City during the roaring twenties in all its intoxicating brilliance. The tale opens with a gawker's view of the large group of women who flock to the dance halls and turn all heads when they arrive, the mystery of the dancers continues when they are simply dubbed ""princesses"". The reader then is gradually introduced to each of these princesses with charmingly titled chapters and a unique combination of storytelling and movement that reflects the popular dances of the time period; the tempo can sweep the reader into a Charleston with the action and drama but then slow to a romantic Waltz with just a few chapters. Although an overall upbeat novel, darker themes are introduced and briefly explored but what would the Jazz Age be without a little scandal?  So hear the music and be sure to keep your dance card open for The Girls at the Kingfisher Club, an imaginative step back into the 1920's for those who love history and a little whimsy.I would like to thank Atria Books and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and enjoy The Girls at the Kingfisher Club","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R162OGNMCK049C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEEB84S#wasThisHelpful","R162OGNMCK049C","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Take it as it is a small collection of some of the strangest tales you will read about the Tower of London, Hampton Court, Banqueting House, Kensington Palace, Kew Palace and a few other locations. In these tales history, modern pop culture references, myth and legend blend into a quick read about the aforementioned locations between 1078 and 2013. In this concise book the reader will encounter amusing tales about: a disappearing bear, bold escapes from the tower, deadly jams and preserves, a misplaced scepter, a wild child, legendary spiders, the embarrassing complications of lady's fashion, and a reattached head for a long overdue commemorative portrait. Of course there is much more to explore and these are indeed some of the strangest tales you will read about London's historic palaces.In the end I just decided to take this small book as it was-a quick and entertaining read. Finishing this read in one sitting I enjoyed the time spent and learned some new tidbits of trivia (and phrases). I was however looking for a more comprehensive read but then again it is nice to let my curious mind to just relax with a light collection of facts.

"The Hurlyburly's Husband is a unique love story that takes the reader on a bizarrely wonderful ride through 17th-century France with a king, a mistress and a cuckold as the main attractions. Dark humor, tragic romance, interesting although vile details (concerning 17th-century hygiene habits and sanitary conditions) and raunchy passages (you may never want to wear a strand of pearls again) create this salacious romp, that the reader is certain to remember days later. The Hurlyburly's Husband is a love story about a cuckold (Louis Henri de Pardaillan de Gondrin, marquis de Montespan), who is humiliated by the King of France (King Louis XIV) when his lewd favor falls on FranÁoise-Ath√©na√Øs, marquise de Montespan and alters the marquis de Montespan's whole perception of France and the monarchy. His undying love and devotion to his wife becomes a central theme as the husband battles for the return of his wife and revenge against King Louis but when the glittering palace of Versailles weaves its wicked charms on Fran√ßoise will she want to return to her simple life? What else can the king possibly do to further ruin the marquis de Montespan's life? The answers and the steps Louis Henri follows in the fervent hope of being reunited with this beloved and show his defiance to his sovereign are sure to shock the curious reader. So if the interested reader has a unique brand of humor, is interested in the crude parts of history that few references will note and enjoys a well crafted story about a bizarre love story- The Hurlyburly's Husband is your next read.*I would like to thank Gallic Books and Edelweiss for the opportunity to read and enjoy The Hurlyburly's Husband","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKGRCZD9313PJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0078XG56K#wasThisHelpful","RKGRCZD9313PJ","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The disappearance of a small child and the traditional structure of upstairs and downstairs collide in this Neo-Gothic tale shrouded in mystery and hidden secrets. Tyringham Park takes the reader into the complicated hive of the fictional ancestral Irish estate of the Blackshaw family where the staff may charm guests with obedience and structure but conceals behind closed doors sinister thoughts, poisonous gossip and dark resentment. Immediately the novel opens with the disappearance of the Park's darling little miss, the confusion that follows leads the reader to be marched from each station introducing them to each member of personnel and their whereabouts at the time of the child's disappearance. The observer soon becomes privy to the complicated relationships of those who share the prominent walls of Tyringham Park, the facade of privilege and status quickly falls and the misery and pettiness is exposed that reveals that something is horribly wrong within this grand house.The mystery continues to deepen and July 1917 soon becomes the 1920's, 1930's and finally the 1940's as the story follows the lives of those left behind to pick up the scattered memories of the lost Blackshaw child and the story travels from Ireland to the Australian outback and back again with swatches of time lapses and flashbacks to the history and origins of certain characters. Tyringham Park confronts many different subjects and depending on the reader may enjoy this twisted dramatic story of what happens behind closed doors of those seen born with silver spoons in their mouths.In the end this reader was somewhat disappointed. I sorely wanted to love this Gothic inspired read but found this novel was a little overly seasoned with predictable and unrealistic drama. Although the novel shined at certain points and I loved the complicated relationships that dominated the characters and the daring venturing into certain taboo topics; there was just something that overall lacked in the delivery of the eras the reader was shown and the presence of foreshadowing revealed numerous major points too early in the novel. Still Tyringham Park provided an interesting experience that I would recommend for those readers who love a historical fiction novel that takes drama to another level and blends mystery and complex relationships with the magnetic aristocratic world of former eras.*I would like to thank Atria Books and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and enjoy Tyringham Park","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D67AEGM263MQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007X52BIY#wasThisHelpful","R1D67AEGM263MQ","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This imaginative re-stitching of 13th-century historical events uses the fictional confessions of King Edward I's lead court jester and fool to sit the reader in a dark corner of a monastery and listen to a story of the making of a king and tale of a shrewd fool. Through the mists of time Hamo Pauncefoot reveals his involvement in historical events from 1253-1274 to a monk he has hired to document the story of his life. The narration takes on dark eloquent styling and magnificent character representation; characters are magnified by this narration and of course embellished for the sake of the story and the narrator's royal benefactors. If readers are familiar with The Lymond Chronicles by Dorothy Dunnett or Bernard Cornwell's Warlord Chronicles then you may find another antihero in Hamo Pauncefoot. The reader is taken to this fool's humble beginnings and then witnesses Hamo's all consuming obsession of advancement of life and status which he believes can be obtained by providing his distinct set of services to the young prince Edward.Set to the backdrop of England during the mid-13th century the reader is privy to the intimate complicated relationships and manipulations of the court of King Henry III. As the story progresses the locations thunder on from battle fields, to towns, to clandestine rooms of taverns, to the holy crusade and back again with always Hamo Pauncefoot under the table or in a corner collecting vital information for his advances. This narration takes on a delicious dark phrasing that leaves more of a convincing representation of the mid-13th century, characters are painted with flaws and very few are described as faultless. Piety and virtue serve little in this story, greed and lust for power reigns over this storyline.In the end, although a few anachronistic terms in the dialogue briefly pulled this reader from this striking narration and the middle sagged with the different excursions, these can be forgotten with the twists and surprises that leapt from the corners of The Chronicles of Pauncefoot and Longshanks: The Making of a King. The footnotes at the end were a creative touch that leant more validity to the beginning claim that this story is true and recently discovered in 2007; all research and implantation was explained and (to this reader) showed superb attention to detail.  Finally the sometimes awkward formation and execution of showing time and births to the reader were seamless in this narration (a very hard thing to accomplish).  Overall this was gem of a read, an original story that I highly recommend for those readers who enjoy a more realistic view of this time period, those who enjoy reading about the machinations of a mind born into misery and desperation and another game for the control of England. The ending clearly indicates a sequel and this reader eagerly awaits the next installment about this shrewd narrator.* I would like to thank Troubador Publishing Ltd and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and enjoy The Chronicles of Pauncefoot and Longshanks: The Making of a King","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z07AP53U0XRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0PFWVW#wasThisHelpful","R2Z07AP53U0XRV","A38V79W0V9FMQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38V79W0V9FMQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The pac seems to dissolve better than others I've used, so no weird glop of goo left over after washing stuck to your laundry. Truly free and clear - this stuff has no coloring or detectable fragrance - yet it powers through stains just as well as regular ""All"", if not better.

Very botanical, light, and pleasant, with a hint of mint. After it's lathered up, the mint really kicks in with a eucalyptus-like tingle on the scalp that gets stronger and stronger the longer you leave it in. It rinses clean, not heavy or oily like after some conditioners, yet still managed to keep my hair looking nice and behaving manageable. One of my favorite Axe products so far. High quality.

"I purchased this toaster three years ago for our vacation home. It still looks brand new as it has seen very little use. In reality, probably not been used more than 50 cycles in three years. Though the look of the toaster is top-notch and it seems well-built on the outside, the lights have stopped illuminating correctly. Press the bagel button, and though the toaster still toasts the bagel as it should, nothing lights up to let you know it is actally in the bagel toasting mode. Quite annoying for a relatively expensive appliance that has seen very little use.I contacted Breville and they offered to fix it for $59, which is almost half the cost of a new toaster. I'm not at all happy with their customer service or with the longevity of their products. This experience will definitely keep me from purchasing further Breville products as I think they are a company more concerned with outside looks than inside quality and durability and refuse to fully stand behind their products. This is clearly an issue of initial workmanship and a lack of quality control. I am shocked that a company that sells premium priced products won't stand behind their workmanship and quality. Very disappointed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SPB4VV4L9ZIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00140SC64#wasThisHelpful","R1SPB4VV4L9ZIH","A3DI391K4GAI7Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DI391K4GAI7Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a restaurant professional, I can tell you that when working in the kitchen, a quality knife is your most important tool. It can make all the difference between a daunting task and an easy preparation. This German-made blade performs flawlessly and makes working with meat a delight.

Working with fish, where a super sharp ultra flexible knife is key, is an absolute joy.Made of German stainless, weighs just under 4oz, and is delightfully narrow and flexible.

"I was admittedly skeptical about this countertop ice maker, but after a week of using it, i'm sold! All you do is add water to the internal reservoir, and this little machine gets to work. The first batch of ice was ready in about 10-12 minutes. The ice is a very nice bullet shape and can be set to three different sizes. The internal tray holds the ice for dispensing and quite cleverly, any ice that melts drips right back into the reservoir to be made into ice once again. The machine is ultra quiet, does not put out a lot of heat, and is great as a stand alone ice maker or as a supplemental portable way to make ice.

Stands up pretty well as a stand-alone Szechwan sauce for stir-frys or you can add your own touches to this sauce to add more of the flavors you desire.

"This is a cute set. My daughter was very excited to get it. She never plays with it. She tried and tried, but it is ""kinda crappy"". Her words.It is almost unusable as a play-doh toy. The problem is with the Mrs. Pots. You are supposed to fill her up with play-doh and ""pour"" the play-doh into Chip by pressing down on her lid. The problem begins with the fact that her spout holds more play-doh than her body. So, you have to push down her lid, fill up the spout, add more play-doh, and push the lid down again before anything comes out.The amount of playdoh that does come out of the spout is small. Smaller than a marble.Also, the lid is hard to push down, taking both hands for me. My 4 year old has to use all her might.The left over play-doh in the spout is ridiculously hard to get out. If you forget to clean it and the play-doh dries you are sunk. It's not coming out.Chip does nothing. It is just a cup. You can put play-doh in it, but the cavity is so small the play-doh gets stuck and has to be scraped out.It comes with a play mat. Pure garbage. It lasted one play time. The play-doh sticks to it. try to peel the play-doh off and the mat rips.The little plate is tiny and useless as a play-doh toy. It adds nothing to the experience.The only thing we liked about this set was the nice shade of pink and yellow play-doh tubs. The tubs were tiny, but the colors were nice.Oh, and the knife. We love the knife. It is our favorite knife.If this set was marketed as simply a ""Mrs. Pots and Chip figurine set"" it would be cool. It is almost as if the play-doh part was an after thought.

"After finishing the cliffhanger ending of Pushed, the first in the series, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book.  You need to read Pushed before starting this one.

My emotions were all over the place.  My heart was breaking for Leila.  I hated Brody. Jaxon is just my hero.In my opinion he was way more deserving of Leila's love than Brody.  That is, until he started doing some pretty hurtful things. I really had trouble with Brody's actions at the end of Pushed.

"Holy crap! That's what I actually said out loud more than once while reading this book. I don't know any other way to describe the intense emotions that I was feeling just from reading this story.  There were so many unexpected twists and turns (and a couple expected ones) that I just couldn't put it down. I got so caught up in the story that time seemed to stop. I read it all in one sitting and never even left the recliner.My heart just broke for both the characters. You could sense their attraction, but both were denying it for different reasons. They both had things from their pasts that they needed to deal with in order to give themselves fully to the other.There are so many things I want to tell you about this book, but I want you to experience it as I did, going in with nothing but high expectations. Besides, there is no way I can do this book justice with just a few words in a review.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a great romance story.

"This is one of the amazing books you can read in one sitting. For all the longer it was, it packed one heck of a story. I was easily able to connect to the characters, Blake and Lara. Their connection was undeniable, but Lara needed a little push to be willing to give her heart away.It was fun to see what Blake was willing to do to get Lara's attention. Rigging the company's Secret Santa was just the beginning of it. Once he had her name, he needed to get her a gift. He had to get to know her a little more to know the perfect gift that would wow her and make her see him in a different light.I just wanted Lara to allow someone in so she could heal and enjoy life again. She is still suffering from the loss of her fiance. Even though so much time has passed, she still feels committed to him. It's hard to put her feelings aside and move on. Blake needs to be a patient and caring man to understand just how hard this is for her.I would highly recommend this holiday book for anyone no matter what the season. It's just a perfect read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RHQS4BA82N9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161PZUY8#wasThisHelpful","R2RHQS4BA82N9T","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't believe I have read any of Ad Ellis's book. I was drawn to this one because it is M/M, a genre that usually interests me. After finishing this book, I have to say, this will not be the last book I read by this author. I just have such a warm fuzzy feeling from these characters. Everyone is just so supportive of each other, you could just feel their love.In my mind, I divide this book into 2 parts. The first part of the story really focuses on Sawyer coming out to his family. It really focuses on Sawyer making the decision to tell all his family, who are really close, and him dealing with the aftermath. Not everyone was accepting, things were said, feelings were hurt. But in the end, family prevailed. It's just how I would imagine someone in my family coming out. Some would be accepting right away, other's would need some convincing. It wasn't easy, but being accepted for who you are is worth it.The second part of the book was more about Sawyer and Luke's relationship. The connection between the two was immediate. Their emotional journey wasn't an easy one. Luke had to deal with his issues from his past. Sawyer was such a patient man, seeming to know exactly what to do to get Luke to find himself.Even if you don't read M/M books, I would encourage you to read this one, especially if you have enjoyed others by this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTYXDEPFRR8KH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011CTUJLM#wasThisHelpful","RTYXDEPFRR8KH","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was one quick read and I loved every minute of it. Knowing it was short, I planned to read it in one sitting and was able to do it with no problem. I was left with the feeling of wanting to know more, much more. I know it was designed as a novella, but the characters drew me in and I really wanted more.This book deals with the days they are stuck together in a cabin during a snow storm, nothing more. But during that time, things really change between them. Sparks fly and a relationship starts.Being too short would be my only complaint, but I knew that going in. I was surprised by how curious I am about what happens with Sierra and Bentley after this trip. That tells me the characters are pretty well developed, showing me the talent of the author.

"The Gray-Haired Knitting Group is at it again. They just can't let a mystery pass them by. Nor can they pass up the chance to meddle in someone's love life.Poor Dee is their focus in this story. She has no clue what she is in for when she comes back to live with her grandmother after leaving her abusive husband.  She puts up one heck of a fight, but in the end she realizes that there is no stopping this group of grannies. Their natural nosey-ness comes in handy again when they try to figure out who killed Dee's husband, working against the detective in charge who is dead set on Dee's guilt. Their antics kept me laughing out loud while the little hints we get about Brock's murder kept my interest enough to put off doing everything else for the day.I loved Tommy. We were introduced to him in the last book, Jack Gets His Man, as the guy the Granny Group tried to fix up with Jack even though he wasn't gay. As much as he didn't want them meddling, he fell for Dee and was willing to be patient until she was ready. To me, his patience showed me the type of man he is, wonderful.This is the second book in the series that I have read.

"The synopsis doesn't do this story justice. There is so much more to this story than a woman who isn't looking for a man in her life or a man who thinks he's found the woman he's destined to be with forever. Their emotions run deep, but it was slow getting there. Ellie has been through a traumatic  event and needs time to heal. Jax is there for her every step of the way. I loved reading about their story and watching their relationship grow.I only had one issue with this book. It says that it is stand alone, but when I started it, I was REALLY lost. I felt that there was so much I was missing, but since it was the first in the Him series, I assumed it would be discussed throughout the book, so I kept reading. After getting about 25% through it, I finally went to double check my information. One of the other reviews stated that this book picks up right where Until July ends. After a little more digging, there are many characters from other books that make appearances in this book. I realize that it is a spin off, but if it is to be a stand alone, I needed more information about the characters and how they met.  If you have read Until July, you shouldn't have this issue at all.Even thought the first part threw me off, I kept reading and truly loved their story.  I've enjoyed it enough to start reading some of the the other books that I missed. I have read some of Aurora Rose Reynolds's books but missed Until November and Until July. I have added them to my TBR list and moved them to the top.

"There isn't a word out there to describe this book, but addicting comes close. Once I started it, I had a tough time putting it down. Even after 3 days and having read another book, I still catch myself visualizing parts of the story. To me, that's what made it so fantastic. I felt like I was there, experiencing their relationship.There were times that Leila's reactions seemed a little immature. Women that run instead of dealing with the situation can be annoying to me. It wasn't enough to make me stop reading though.I was so caught up in their relationship I didn't see the ending coming. This ended with me wanting to throw my kindle across the room. Brody really disappointed me. After what he did, I'm not sure there is anything he can do to get into my good graces again. Leila deserves better than him. It's going to take one heck of an explanation to make me like him again.I am torn as to whether or not I want to read the next in the series. In my head, I have an idea of how I want Leila and Brody's story to end. I'm not sure I'll be happy if the author's ending doesn't match mine.

"This is one of those books that I hate to love so much. I didn't expect it to be such a psychological story.It's not often that I hate one of the main characters (I think the last one was Gone Girl) but I REALLY didn't like Paxton. He was just to arrogant and controlling for me to think that he deserved any devotion from Gabby or his girls. He really just gave me a creepy vibe. Throughout the story, he seemed to change some, some people could have actually liked him for a while. But I didn't buy it for a minute. I was just waiting for him to become an ass again.Gabby seemed like to much of a pushover to put up with Paxton all those years. I wanted her to grow a pair and stand up to him. Or at least take the kids and leave him while he was at work. I actually celebrated for her when she finally broke his rules when her sister appeared.There were so many twists and turns in this book I had to keep reading. As frustrated as I was with the characters, I couldn't stop reading.  Then there was the ending...... GRRR!

"The opening of this book will suck you in immediately. It's not very often that I have tears in my eyes in the first couple of chapters. It takes some wonderful writing to get me that emotionally vested in the characters to draw that kind of emotion from me. My heart just broke for Jeremy.Watching Jeremy struggle with moving on from the death of his husband was difficult. I couldn't imagine being in his position. When he meets Kai, though, the attraction is immediate. I love seeing two people who are destined to be together find strength in each other to overcome their own emotional hurdles.This book is a part of a series. I have not read the first book yet, (but I plan to) and didn't feel like I was missing any of Kai and Jeremy's story. Jace and Carey, the focus of the first book, do make an appearance when they get married in this book. I could also easily figure out who will probably be the focus of the next book because he played an important part in Kai's life.This book is written in third person POV which usually makes it more difficult for me to connect with the characters. However, after that opening, it was hard not to be connected to Jeremy and Kai was just perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W8UZAYGR5OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0159IYAP8#wasThisHelpful","R2W8UZAYGR5OO","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I make no secret that I am a huge fan of Jenna Galicki. I have loved this entire series, but I think this is my second favorite in the series (it would be impossible to be better than The Prince of Punk Rock). Jimmy has been the wild card in the band all along. I have been waiting for someone to tame his wild ways, someone he felt was worth respecting himself for.I was a little more than surprised to find out that Audra was that woman. Audra and her sister Kira have been involved as fans from the first book. Being the boss's daughter and the band's tour manager, she should be off limits to any of the band members. Of course, she has to be the one Jimmy is attracted to. I loved seeing how Jimmy proves himself worthy of her. He made a lot of life changes in a very short amount of time. I kept waiting for him to screw up, fall back to his old ways. Then that bi**h shows up and I thought it was all over. Just waiting for it all to fall apart kept me from putting this book down. I tried to go to sleep before finishing it, but it wasn't happening. I needd to know what happened.One thing I truly enjoyed about this book is that, although the book focuses on Jimmy and Audra, we still get a lot of all the characters I have come to love. We get to follow the band when they are not on tour, seeing their creative process at work. It made me realize just how close they are, like their own family. I can't wait to see what they are up to next.This book is written in third person POV but is almost felt like alternating first person because Jenna switches focus and writes so well you think you are there. It is part of a series, but could probably be read as a stand alone, but I would recommend reading the others first, after all, their all amazing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AVFJ9E9SMYB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K1BQMU#wasThisHelpful","R2AVFJ9E9SMYB5","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book caught me a little off guard. I was expecting a book that focused on the M/M romance with a little mystery thrown in. But it ended up being a light-hearted mystery with a little matchmaking thrown in.I just had to love the ladies in  the Knitting Crew. I could just picture a group of little old ladies who are sticking their nose in people's business with the best of intentions. Their antics made the story so fun to read it was hard to put down.And what's a bunch of old ladies without a little meddling into someone's love life. Jack is the victim in this story. I just had to laugh. Just the idea of a crew of little old ladies being so accepting of his sexuality that they would try to set him up was comical. It was nice to see so many people be so accepting of everyone. Jack's personality really showed in the book. I could hear the sarcasm in his voice so many times.This book is a part of the series, but according to the synopsis, it can be read as a stand alone. I have not read the first book, Murder, Mystery, and Dating Mayhem. There were several times while reading that I wish I had read the first. The antics of the Knitting Crew from that book were referenced a couple times and Izzy and Noel play key parts in this one. I think I will be reading it before I read the third book, Love in the Time of Murder, due out in October 2015.This book is written in third person POV, focusing on Jack's thoughts and actions. It is a stand alone with no violence.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z6GS2W5CMQRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1514390825#wasThisHelpful","R2Z6GS2W5CMQRW","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was supposed to write this review for the release day, which was 2 days ago. I just couldn't do it. I needed time to process this amazing series. I tried to write my review, I really did, but I just couldn't put sentences together. I'm still not sure I can do the book justice, but I'm going to try. Griff is one character that has puzzled me from the beginning of the series. I just wasn't sure what was going on with him. I learned quite a bit about Griff, all of which helped me understand him better. His book has made him one of my favorite Storm MC members.I loved Griff's Aunt Josie. She is such a little pistol. I could see her being anyone's grandmother. You could really feel her good intentions. Her meddling brought a smile to my face, and the fact that she thought Griff wouldn't figure it out... priceless.Of course, getting Griff to finally get past his issues and give Sophie a chance wasn't easy. However, I loved that once that happened, there wasn't any relationship drama.But the tension getting there was almost too hot to handle, but I loved every minute. Sometimes it's nice to read about a couple who are just happy to be together, like they are meant to be.There may not have been relationship drama, but there was a lot of drama with Storm, a lot of it involving Griff.  I've grown attached to all the members of the club and am waiting with baited breath to see how all their issues play out.This book is written in dual POV. It is part of a series and you should read the series in order, Sophia and Griff's relationship would be OK as a stand alone, but the Storm parts of the book needs a lot of background you only get from reading the rest of the series. There is some violence, but not anything more than I would expect from an MC book.  This is one series you do not want to meet. I can't wait to read more and find out more about what's going on with Scott and Harlow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IULU4P4VQKTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPCLT0S#wasThisHelpful","R1IULU4P4VQKTI","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book blew me away. I loved the interactions between Carter and Julia. They just had a fun way to communicate. Their light-heartedness really balanced out the more series parts of their lives. I just felt like I was a part of their lives. They could easily be a couple I would love to be friends with.I will admit that the very beginning threw me off. I felt like I walked into the middle of the story, which in a way I did. Carter found out some life altering news right off the bat. Since I didn't know the characters yet, it was hard to understand what part that played in the story. However, it really caught my attention and I needed to see where it was going. After reading it all, I wouldn't change a single word of it.At the end, I found myself putting my hand over my heart and just sighing with contentment. Their story was absolutely perfect. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a great love story.This book is written in dual POV. It is a stand alone. It wasn't until I read some of the other reviews that the thought that it could be part of a series even crossed my mind. I didn't put the characters together at all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V9KLYBEH43H0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013NXMLWA#wasThisHelpful","R1V9KLYBEH43H0","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This suspenseful book had me on edge many times. I had trouble putting it down once I got started. I got to know a little about Kate in Self-Destruct (the first in the series) but I really got to know her in this book.Kate is hiding something that only her twin, Cameron, understands.  Even though Kate is an amazingly strong character, she feels she can't fight her past and wants to run away from it to keep everyone safe. Eventually the secrets were revealed and Reed and Kate's other's friends are there to support and save her.Reed was absolutely perfect. He is patient when he needs to be and pushes just enough when he has to. There were so many times he showed just how amazing he is.Everything about this story was just wonderful. I loved watching Kate finally allow Reed in and allow their relationship to grow and develop. The suspense keep me on the edge of my seat with a tight grip on my Kindle many times. I enjoyed this book a little more than Self-Destruct because I was more caught up in the storyline.This book is written in dual POV. It can be read as a stand alone, but I highly recommend read Self-Destruct first, mainly because it is an equally good book and it's always best to read books with common characters in order. With each book, the characters become more developed. After reading this one, I am really looking forward to reading the next book in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DIT7VZ71FMT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=168058166X#wasThisHelpful","R2DIT7VZ71FMT0","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was a little harder to read. Mainly because both characters come with so much baggage that I focused more on figuring them out than I did their growing relationship. I love reading books about broken people so this book really held my attention but I didn't feel their connection until further along in the book although they felt it from the beginning. Given their pasts, there has to be issues in their relationship that they have to overcome.I really felt bad for Becca. Given her reaction to men, you could tell something traumatic happened to her and that she hasn't recovered yet. As the story went on, my heart just broke for her. Those that were supposed to support her didn't. As a result, she didn't handle things well. The more I learned about what happened, the angrier I got with her family. But then my attitude changed when Becca finally addressed the issue with her parents. I can't imagine being in either of their shoes, either being the victim or being the parent knowing you couldn't protect your child. It was just heart-breaking.This book is written in alternating POV. It can be read as a stand alone but I want to read more about them and the other secondary characters in the book. This book does address sexual abuse of a child and may be a trigger for some readers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ZZ9K6CZ53H9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XPVAZOM#wasThisHelpful","R3ZZ9K6CZ53H9","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What and amazing read. I devoured this book in no time at all. I just couldn't put it down. I couldn't wait to see what would come out of Chance's mouth next. He perfected sexual innuendo comments.  He was absolutely perfect, the title of the book fit him perfectly. He was so cocky, but he was so sweet too. His personality was just a perfect mix.The best part of Chance was that he knew how to push Aubrey's buttons and really enjoyed doing it. I loved seeing her all riled up. She must have enjoyed it though, because she put up with him for their entire trip.I loved this book from beginning to end. There were so many different twists and turns that I didn't expect that I was captivated the entire time. There were so many times I was laughing out loud or just covering my mouth in shock at the turn of events. I just can't describe how perfect this book was. It's one I will enjoy re-reading soon, something I haven't done in a long time.

"This is one of those books where you'll want to clear your schedule to read it because once you get started you will not want to put it down. I got so sucked into the story that I read it in one sitting.Alex was such an arrogant jerk in the beginning. I wanted to smack him a couple times. I really wanted to see him put in his place or at least make him realize what a jerk he was being and take the time to make it right. As I got to know him more, it was hard not to like him, even if he did act like a spoiled brat sometimes. He's at a crossroads in his life and is feeling a little lost.Oh to be Natasha. She's had a crush on Alex, as lead singer of Steel Roses, since she was a teen. Now, she has the opportunity to work up close and personal with him. Who wouldn't want to be in her shoes?  At least she didn't get all starry eyed and allow him to walk all over her. No, she hid her crush was strong enough to be able to put him in his place when needed.I don't feel like their story is over. There are still some things about Alex and Steel Roses we don't know yet. I can't wait to get my hands on the next book to see if we find out more.This book is written in Natalie's POV. There is no violence. Although there is no cliffhanger ending, however, the story isn't over. It ends by saying ""...how bad could it really be? I'd have to wait and see, I guess.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19AEEGIUXY7LL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119ZM4RG#wasThisHelpful","R19AEEGIUXY7LL","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book had me from the very beginning. I was drawn to it because Claire is a teacher and I love reading books involving teachers (personal connection). Add to that, a sexy actor and I'm all in.I loved the interaction between Claire and Daniel, they were so fun together. Their witty banter had me laughing out loud many times.  Everything about their story was so realistic. I felt like it could happen to anyone. They didn't jump into bed immediately... Claire's parents weren't the support parents everyone hopes for...Claire makes some choices that have devastating consequences for her career,Of course, their relationship can't be all fun and roses. Claire runs into some trouble and needs to find herself. Seeing her get the strength to trust herself and follow her dreams was worth waiting for.After reading this, I want more Claire and Daniel. I just felt so connected to these two that I want to see more of their HEA. I'm sure their careers can lead to enough issues for another book about them (Hint Hint!).This book is written from Claire's POV. It is a stand alone.

"I absolutely loved this book. I have not read any of the others in the series, didn't even realize it was a part of a series until I came to write this review and read the blurb.Being famous can have its perks, but it also has a lot of downfalls. Gavin made me realize that being famous isn't all that it is cracked up to be. Not only does he have a stalker, but someone is always telling him what to do. There was always some expectation for him to live up to, he couldn't be himself in public. Even growing up, he had to hide his sexuality from his abusive father. Watching him and Mitch overcome so many adversities to finally be a couple was amazingly hot. Their interactions were so funny at times I just had to shake my head. At the beginning they were the perfect example of ""there's a fine line between love and hate"".Throughout the entire thing, it was the suspense that was killing me. I wanted to find out who was Gavin's stalker. I knew it was going to be a whopper, and let me tell you, it was. I was not expecting that plot twist. I enjoyed this book so much I will be reading the first two in the series and can't wait to get my hands on the next book.This book in written in alternation POV. It is book 3 in a series of 4, however it can be read as a standalone without any issues. There is some mild violence, but it isn't described in graphic detail.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O4SD5VV7HZH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010OWL0W0#wasThisHelpful","R2O4SD5VV7HZH2","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a great book that I just couldn't put down. The author has such a way with words, she has you feeling the anxiety and stress of the characters as they follow another investigation while finding the Happily Ever After they deserve.Maryann has combined the characters and event from her Love's Series into her Alvarez Security series. I highly recommend reading those books first.  Tony and Sherrie's story started in previous books, you won't feel the connection between them if you don't read about how they met. They get together pretty quickly in the beginning of the book. Not saying their relationship started easily, it didn't. Tony has a heart-breaking past he has to deal with before he can move on.Characters from the other books which I have come to love also make appearances. Together, they make one very happy family. They were there to support Tony during the worst days of his life, and they continue to support him now.I look forward to reading the next in the series... there's still a couple single Alvarez Security team members available.There is some violence in this story, but lots of action and suspense.

"I was totally blown away by this book. It was exactly the type of story I expected from Melissa Collins. I have read every book she has written, all of which are 5+ star reviews to me.The thing that drew to me was how she writes emotion. You can feel the love between Liam and Parker. It's easy to get caught up in their emotions and forget that this is a M/M love story. I got so engrossed in their connection, two people who need each other to breathe. That's a connection you don't see often, but when you do, it's beautiful.The turning point of the story, when we find out what Liam is running from, was so heart-breaking. He was so lucky he found Paulie who gave him a job and treated him like a son. His life could have been so different if he hadn't.Parker comes off as an arrogant jerk right from the very beginning, putting Liam off right away. I was so relieved that Liam was able to see the man underneath the lawyer.This book is a stand alone. It is told in alternating POV. There is minimal violence described as part of sexual abuse of a child.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EQBQIFVJKI6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZO8O3Z6#wasThisHelpful","R2EQBQIFVJKI6W","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What an emotional read! Jett and Presley's relationship is one heck of a ride. Things are not easy for them, throughout the entire book I questioned whether or not they would get their HEA. There were so many things they had to deal with I wasn't sure they would survive. Then there was the BIG event. I thought for sure Presley would move on.This is one of  those books you'll need to have tissues nearby. Not only because of relationship difficulties, but because of events of a secondary character's life. You know it's well written when you are crying like a baby for a secondary character.I was also drawn to Van, another band member. He's a moody SOB, but there are glimpses of a wonderful softie under it all. Something was up with him and I'm dying to know what. I hope to see more of him...and West... and...This is another one of those books that once I started, I couldn't put it down.

"This is the first book by Rie Warren, but it won't be my last. Kinkaid's life is complicated enough. He's a stripper and he's trying to keep it hidden from everyone, including the MC club he's trying to join all while trying to take care of his grandfather. The last thing he needed was being caught at work by his best friend, Sadie.The story really focuses on Kaid's personal life and his stripping life. There isn't much of his MC life explored. Since this is part of an MC series, I was really expecting more of a focus on the MC part. I think that lead to this book being more of a fun read. I found myself smiling at the ball-busting all the guys at the strip club did. The book wasn't all fun and games though,  there was a part where I had tears rolling down my face. My heart just broke for Kaid.I really enjoyed hearing Kaid's side of things. That moment when he realized he that Sadie can be more than a best friend, that there was an attraction there all of a sudden. Crossing that line between friends and lovers isn't an easy one, you put your friendship on the line. It wasn't a decision Kaid made easily.I really enjoyed the story and look forward to more from this author. Although this is a part of a series, it can be read as a stand alone.

"This book sucked me in from the beginning. I had trouble putting it down for long. I highly recommend that you one-click this book today.I will admit to having an issue with the cheating. Lucky for me, the author didn't describe how hurt Flynn was every time Lucky went back to her boyfriend. That would have shattered me. Flynn was the character I connected with the most. You could feel how much he loved Lucky. My heart just went out to him. He has a heart of gold that shines through in so many ways. I just wanted him to find his happiness.I also helped that I didn't like Dylan in this book. He just seemed like an egotistical jerk. Lucky was better off without him. She had a crush on him as a teen, but he's not the man that was on the poster on her walls.  My guess is that they only lasted a year because he was on tour for most of that time.This book part of a series, but it can easily be read as a stand alone. There is no cliffhanger ending.

"I have to admit that I was not looking forward to this book. I just wasn't ready for Bea and Hawke's story to be over. I'm not ready to let go of the characters that I have come to love. Even after reading this final book, I'm not ready to let them go, which is why I plan on re-reading the series now that I have all the books and I can read it uninterrupted.Bea still drove me nuts even though she has grown so much throughout the series. She still referred to Nicholas as a billionaire, telling me she is still hung up on his money.  At least she's figured out Hawke is the man for her, that he's the one that meets all of her needs. She has everything, but then she lets her insecurities get the best of her and she almost loses it all.Hawke needs to prove to Bea, one last time, how much she means to him, a grand gesture. He's been so patient with her, so understanding. he knows she needs to overcome her past demons in order to move on. He does some amazing things to help her move on.Nicholas is my favorite supporting character, I'd love to know more about him...maybe a spin-off (Hint, Hint). He's a little different, but there is a very caring man underneath it all.You definitely need to read all the other 11 installments before staring this one. It is written from Bea's point of view. There's lots of hot sex (sigh) and no violence. There in no cliffhanger ending.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20P165BVULLBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVLNYDA#wasThisHelpful","R20P165BVULLBH","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! Another great story by a very talented author. I have read all of the Love Series books in the series, but this one is by far, the most emotional. I cried several times throughout the book. My heart just broke for Jaylinn so many times. I just kept thinking that I was so glad she had Cooperto lean on when she needed it.  Together, they can get through anything and their relationship ended up stronger because of it.It was Jaylinn's relationship with her brother Hunter that worried me the most. He was so hurt after he found out what happened to her and he wasn't there to protect her. Now, given the devastating news they have received, Hunter needs to put it all aside so they can be there for each other.It wasn't all sad though. We finally get to see Mason and Hailey get married. I love how the author brings in all the characters from the other books. With each new story, their family changes and grows.You should read the first 4 books in the series before starting this one. There is no cliffhanger, but there is some foreshadowing for the next book. This book is told in alternating POV.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ADBVWYDGCXI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105380DU#wasThisHelpful","R3ADBVWYDGCXI8","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! What an amazing read.  I love how Emma and Jai got together for a one night stand. It took a little push from Emma's friend, Megan, but it was worth it. From there, it just got better and better. I was quickly sucked into the story and didn't put it down until I was finished. Lucky for me, this was a short book.I loved the characters from the very beginning. It's odd for me to feel so connected with the characters in such a short story. But the talent of the author shows. Jai was such a character, I have no words to describe him. Emma's being forced into having some fun for a change, taking that first step to get over her last relationship. What neither expected was the connection they felt.At this point, they have no idea they will be more to their relationship. Part of me says that if you don't like the ""taboo"" relationships of step siblings, you will still enjoy this story. It's just two strangers getting together for a one hot night of lovin'.This is book 1 in a 4 book series. I have been lucky enough to read all four books already and let me tell you, this is one series you do not want to miss. If you don't like waiting, get this today, one-click the rest when they come out, and enjoy them all at once.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14FRDMCBN23UK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQ2WYOM#wasThisHelpful","R14FRDMCBN23UK","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a great conclusion to a wonderful story. Not only was it a story about about Ace and Max, it was a story about their family. It really shows how important family is. Always having people there that want to support you no matter what, people who always want the best for you. Ace needs her family. She needs to heal.This story was almost overwhelming. It was such an emotional read for me. I have grown attached to Ace and I experienced her struggles right along with her. The whole time, I kept hoping that Ace and Max would be able to overcome everything and get the HEA they deserved.

"I really struggled with how to rate this book. I wavered between giving it 4 or 5 stars. In the end, I decided to go with 4 stars for a couple reasons.First, Hadley didn't impress me in the beginning. She kept saying she supported Reed completely, but her actions were telling me otherwise. At times, she acted like the typical spoiled little rich girl. Turning to drugs when things got tough. That surprised me given her career choice. Then she really allowed Reed's leaving to completely destroy her. I just wanted to say, suck it up already.Reed's actions threw me off too. If he loved Hadley so much, why did her choice to leave her like he did? He left her with no way to contact him, he just dropped off the face of the earth. That was completely unfair of him. His actions were just speaking louder than his words... in the beginning.Then things changed for me. Once Reed got his head out of his ass and finally came to his senses, I got so into the book that I couldn't put it down. I kept hoping things would work out for them. Communication is definitely their issue, and one they REALLY need to work on. Both kept secrets about their time apart that ended up hurting their relationship. I knew something big was coming, but I wasn't prepared for the big plot twist.I can't wait to see how all this plays out. I will be reading the next book. Fighting to Stay, as soon as it is available.Contains: Alternating POV, Cliffhanger ending, Violence, Drug use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU2UXA07OX3PC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XD5EIJS#wasThisHelpful","RU2UXA07OX3PC","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely loved this story. I was so caught up in the beginning that I was crying before the end of the third chapter. I was so sucked in and attached to Roman that his life experiences affected my in such I way that I was taken off guard. It's not often that I get that emotional at the beginning of a book. It takes true talent on the author's behave to evoke.Have you ever thought about how the one person you were meant to spend your life with comes into your life. Sometimes fate has to intervene more than once for you to realize your destiny. Sometimes the circumstances aren't the best. but love can conquer all. This story gives you hope. Even after everything that Roman has been through, he has been able to find his soul mate in Melanie. After all the life altering events, he knows that there is someone there that will support him every step of the way.I ended this book with a contented sigh and a smile on my face.

"Nothing prepared me for the start of this emotional book. Zach has recently lost Gina to a tragic accident. Now, 4 months later, he's still trying to pull himself out of his depression and get on with his life. He's been lucky that he has had so much support from those around him. His sister even found a great nanny for him to help with his son while he is on the road.I love a book that pulls you in so much that you can't help but experience the emotions of the characters. This book evoked so much emotion it was hard to contain. There were parts where I had tears gently rolling down my face, but there were other parts that just tore me apart. The alternating POV's made the emotions even worse. By getting both Kate and Zack's POV, my heart broke twice. I knew both were hurting and I just wanted to make everything better for them.Throughout the entire story, we still get to see the characters we have come to love from the series. I love getting little glimpses into their lives. Sawyer Bennett has a to write that allows you to revisit characters of the series without taking away from the main characters story at all. Their lives  intertwine in a way that only good friends and family can.If you haven't started the Cold Fury Hockey series yet, I highly recommend that you do today.This book is written in alternating POV and does not contain a cliffhanger. It is a part of a series, but I feel it can be enjoyed as a stand alone. The characters from other books make appearances, but their plots have very little impact on the story of Kate and Zack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R282RDN84TPLJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04OX5C#wasThisHelpful","R282RDN84TPLJ1","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I was writing my review for my blog post, I went to Amazon to get the book links. Turns out, I forgot a very important detail. When I first saw that this book was a combination of 2 of Molly McAdam's books, I knew I wanted to read it immediately. However, by the time I actually read the story, I had totally forgotten that little tidbit of information.Since I forgot about the combination, I read the story like it was a stand alone.  If you haven't read the others, you will not be missing anything in this wonderful book. I absolutely enjoyed it from beginning to end and I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good romance novel. Just be warned, once you start reading a book by this talented author, you will want to read more of her books. Her writing can quickly become an addiction, as they are an automatic one click for me.This book evoked just as much emotion as I expected. I laughed and I cried right along with the characters. I felt like I was right there participating rather then watching it from the outside.  I even cried for Kira, Kennedy's twin sister. She and her long-term boyfriend Zane had to be separated because of the circumstances. Even though their relationship was a secondary plot, my heart just went out to her. Molly writes in such a way that you can't help but experience the emotions.This book is written in alternating POV and has no cliffhanger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NU69YI4DURDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLM9DAW#wasThisHelpful","R3NU69YI4DURDE","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sucked into this book right from the very beginning. I usually take notes while I am reading so that I can remind myself what I like and didn't like about the book. However, with this amazing story, I never stopped to take notes. I was so wrapped up in their story that I totally forgot to take a break.My heart went out to Dax from the very beginning, His dad is a total uncaring, jerk (not the word I want to use). He drilled his ""rules"" into Dax from a very young age, encouraging all the anger and violence he could. But inside, Dax has a beautiful heart. He just needs to get away from him environment for it to show. Kate has shown him that maybe things don't have to be the way they are. She gave him the inspiration to be better.I""m not sure how I feel about Kate. She's a runner and that personality type bothers me. It seems rather immature to run every time something doesn't go your way. To me, she had a lot of maturing to do throughout the story. To me, it's hard to trust that a relationship will last if one of them is a runner. However, by the end of the book, Kate convinced me that she was in this for the long haul.I loved watching these two grow and mature into an amazing couple. There were so many times Dax could have said ""screw it"" but he always seemed to make the right choices in his live.I highly recommend this amazing story to anyone. It's one of the best reads so far this year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C5G9GJPULD45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XFH0SOI#wasThisHelpful","R1C5G9GJPULD45","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will start by saying that have not read any of the Rock Gods series but I don't know that didn't stop me from completely enjoying this book. If you are a fan of Rock Gods, you get to see more of all the characters of that band throughout this book too.All of the members of Rock Solid have grown up together in the shadows of their famous parents. Lucky for them, they are just as talented and are able to benefit from it now.This book focuses on Annie and Ashton. Annie is the adopted daughter of Colt and Lia (who I thought needed slapped a couple times for poor parenting decisions). She's known all along that she was adopted. It affects her in so many ways, mostly her view of herself. That definitely had an impact on her relationships. Because the story starts when the kids are only 13, you get the opportunity to watch them grow up and mature into young adults.I was able to experience the story not just read about it. On more than one occasion, I had tears running down mu cheeks.

"OMG! I have no words to describe this book. I absolutely loved it. If you haven't started this series yet, you need to go get book 1, The Way We Fall, immediately. You do need to read book 1 before this one in order for things to make sense. This book starts where the other ends.This is not just a book you read, it's a series you experience.

"I love second chance at romance stories. This one caught my eye right away. Not only was it a second chance story, it's also a 2 worlds collide story which I also enjoy. This book lived up to my expectations in so many ways.I expected great writing because I have read some of CD Reiss's books in the past. She has a way with words that has you experiencing the story right beside the characters. I felt like I was right there watching all the action, watching their relationship develop from the very beginning.My heart went out to Laine, She had a rough start to life, being passed around through the foster care system. To escape, she made several poor decision. However, once she realized how lost she was, she became determined to do something better. I really liked her strong sense of independence.  Even though she's in a much better situation, she still has a lot of insecurities to overcome.Michael disappointed me a couple times. He just didn't seem to put Laine first all the time. There were many times that he did, but there were a couple times that he didn't. It made it difficult to feel the connection between the two. I just wasn't sure that Michael was as committed to the relationship as he needs to be in order for it to last.For that reason, I also would have liked the story to be a little longer. I need just a little more reassurance that Micheal is as committed as he needs to be. That, and I wasn't quite ready for their story to end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROOGAYUNHOS9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XSYYB8C#wasThisHelpful","ROOGAYUNHOS9R","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Holy crap! That's the one thought that comes to my mind after reading this book. It has a little bit of everything a reader could like. It's a collection of some very HOT scenes of some upcoming books by some amazing authors. It's a perfect collection to find out which books you want to read more. It's perfect if you are the type of reader who loves to re-read all the good parts of a book.Some of the stories are second or third in a series, where they characters and their relationships are established and we're just following their lives. Some of the stories focus on new attractions, even their first sexual experience together. There's some BDSM scenes, some menage scenes, and some just plain vanilla sex. I was able to get a feel for the characters in the short snippets, others I couldn't quite get a read on. Some of them left me wondering how things were going to turn out for them, while others I just knew things would fall into place for them. The one thing that they had in common was they were all hot.I really enjoyed getting a little taste of so many author's writing styles in one place. It will help me decide which books I will be reading in the future.

"I have mixed feelings about this book.Separately, I really liked Heather and Justin, They are great characters, well developed, and Justin's really likable. Justin is the kind of man you hope to find. He's kind and considerate, always there when you need him. Any man would be lucky to be called his boyfriend.I also like the fact that Heather and Justin have been friends since they were in school. Justin has always been gay and was the focus of a lot of bullying in school. Heather was always there to support and protect him. Given that background, I can completely understand their protectiveness towards each other.However, Heather and Justin's adult relationship drove me nuts. They are so co-dependent that it seemed unhealthy. At times, they can't seem to do anything without the other. She even went as far as to refuse to allow her husband to look at a cut on her leg, Justin and his boyfriend had to rush over to take care of her. Heather was just so needy. How they were ever able to find someone that was willing to put up with their relationship floors me. Many times, they acted more like lovers than best friends. It was just confusing to me. I know I wouldn't be able to tolerate their relationship.Overall, I enjoyed this book. The M/M and M/F scenes were hot, good enough to overlook how crazy Heather drove me. I enjoyed watching them develop and find their HEA's that are willing to accept their relationship as it is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18OKYJ82W49QA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQXMW7M#wasThisHelpful","R18OKYJ82W49QA","A18XA76N0F5DGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18XA76N0F5DGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Be prepared for a rather longer investment of reading time than a book this short usually takes. It's fairly strongly academic in style, and ranges now and then into economics and philosophy. It will reward the interested reader with some interconnections not commonly made. Reader alert: some of the illustrations (all in black and white) may disturb some readers. The author says in the preface that the first chapters are analytical rather than prescriptive, but all the chapters have a detectable bias against industrialized animal farming. The last chapter is prescriptive, offering suggestions to improve what she clearly sees as an immoral, dangerous and environmentally unsustainable industry.The first chapter looks at some history, rather superficially I think. The chapter on industrialization of livestock production (chapter 2) and the chapter on industrialization of slaughter and processing (3) are the core chapters in terms of information. Chapter 4 looks at consuming animals as food and 5 looks at fallout from the process (such as animal manure equivalent to 5 tons yearly for each and every American. Yes, that is tons.).The book is wide ranging. One section discusses employee health--working in the industry is rather more dangerous than construction or mining, and the violence in the slaughter process seems have psychological consequences, which may include increased violence. Another examines government subsidies that allow meat to be cheaper than it perhaps should be, particularly agricultural subsidies. She also covers ""institutionalized forgetting"" which means more of less that meat eaters would just as soon be disconnected from actual animals that they eat, which in the US would be something like ten billion animals per year (a huge number of chickens accounts for much of that total). Then there are the eleven states that have laws (difficult to enforce) against public criticism of agricultural products and recent laws making filming or photography in processing plants a felony (these are the ag-gag laws).So, my point is that while this is not a particularly easy read, and in some senses a disturbing one, it is worth","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17XR3GWKC1NSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611861748#wasThisHelpful","R17XR3GWKC1NSE","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a solid book on an obscure subject. Here's a quote that says what the book is really about: ""First and foremost, American progress was built on the backs of people deemed second class citizens at best. Its dark underbelly was punctuated by grueling labor, low wages, suffering and survival. Not only was railroad building and canal digging physically demanding, but these occupations were inherently dangerous and violent.""  The book falls into several categories, one of which is the history of labor, but also social science in looking at the question of why laborers have consistently been seen in negative terms.Dearinger has some interesting material, but at several points some academic concepts get in the way. These laborers also labored to ""build masculine identity.""  Presumably any such workforce was already masculine in its identity. Certainly workers might find common interests as opposed to managers or the farming communities through which they built and dug, which appears often to have been expressed in hard drinking, hard playing and occasional violence. Throughout this era, the yeoman farmer was valued as the personification of American, and workers in cities and elsewhere seen differently, perhaps because so many were immigrants and perhaps because so few owned property.The book discusses such work generally in Chapter 1, and in Chapter 2 looks at the Indiana, Wabash and Erie Canal, which resulted in state bankruptcy in 1850 (and was paying down debt on it until 1909). Chapter 3 examines both the Illinois and Michigan Canal and the Illinois Central Railroad, in which financial irregularities sometimes resulted in wages not being paid (one can imagine workers being even more surly). Chapter 4 discusses the transcontinental railroad, examining in particular Mormon work crews--who were then considered essentially an un-American fringe group. This is the best chapter, with the portion on the Mormons being outstandingly well done. Chapter 5 looks at the Chinese, being the second best chapter.One major point is that when the projects were done, celebrations celebrated managers and American ingenuity, not the work or workers. The famed photo of the completion of the transcontinental railroads meeting in Utah has lots of people, but no Chinese, who largely built the section from California to Utah.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R185SX035R54KQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0520284607#wasThisHelpful","R185SX035R54KQ","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"C'mon, people, where are the reviews? The subject is grim, but this book deserves more readers. I read it this morning and found I had to pause after each chapter, to reflect on whether it has any resonance for American society today. If nothing else, it makes plain that the view that slaves were happy and that slavery wasn't so bad is a lie.Snyder's book is well-written, with a slight tendency to academic style in some sections. Among other details, she emphasizes that the sources must be used with care, and that slave suicide was a constant element throughout slavery times. There is no way of estimating the toll, save that it was sizable in the Middle Passage--one study she mentions found about 7% of embarked slaves killed themselves during transit. The toll of slave suicides must have been many thousands, but more than that is likely impossible to know. Slaves might kill themselves to avoid execution, to avoid torture, or as a consequence of families broken up for sale (infanticide and abortion is related but not described in this book), or from despair.Her thesis is that suicide was a way for slaves to assert some control, and it forced reactions. For one thing, a slave suicide was a lost investment. For another, suicides were noticed and in the long run served the purposes of abolitionist propaganda well. There seems to have sometimes been a grudging respect for suicides as resistance. There was also anger: a suicide's body might be decapitated, burned or left to rot. Slave owners feared that suicides could be contagious--and they seem to have been on board the slave ships.Chapter 6 examines slave suicide in literature, largely the impact a poem called ""The Dying Negro,"" written in the 1770s about a real incident in which an American slave hoping for freedom in Britain was caught and about to be transported back to slavery in the colonies. This had huge impact in the propaganda wars between proponents and opponents of slavery. Another chapter discusses how slave suicide made a large appearance in fiction and theater of the day, making it seem like a morally proper and admirable act. There's also some discussion of how suicide is regarded in the Federal Writers' project of the 1930s interviewing former slaves; they regarded it as matter of fact and sometimes brought it up without it being asked about.Overall, this is a difficult but important subject.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IHCEEHUW87K0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=022628056X#wasThisHelpful","R3IHCEEHUW87K0","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I expected a much different book, more along the lines of natural history and conservation. Those are covered but rather briefly. The book mostly considers cultural use of orangutans, mostly European and American (the book portrays peoples living near the apes as not particularly interested in them). What I mean by that is the chapters examine the European debate about apes and the relationship of apes to humans, starting early in colonial times (Dutch colonialism in Indonesia--the apes are native to Borneo and Sumatra--began in the early 1600s).There were all sorts of interpretations, some of them using orangs as metaphors for human traits, some using the apes as elements in satires and novels. Science gradually came to a better understanding of them.The story the book tells is largely of human use of orangs, as much the idea of orangs as anything else, especially in popular literature (which continues as ""Planet of the Apes"" sequels continue into the 21st century). Living and dead orangs and dead orang parts were popular in the cabinets of curiosities on the 1700s and the natural history exhibitions of the 1800s, which gradually shaded over into modern zoos, and the sense of show gradually became that of education and conservation. Orangs seem to have been for a time popular figures in plays, acted by men in costume.Among the sections of the book that readers may find of interest are chapters 5 and 6, which examine orangs as characters in fiction, and chapter 7 which does the same for orangs on stage and screen. The chapters can be a little tedious. Chapter 8 looks in a general way at zoos and chapter 9 at extinctions. The latest survey, says this book, in 2004 found about 7,000 orangs in Sumatra and 57,000 in Borneo, but given extensive forest fire events and heavy harvesting of timber, that number is probably considerably less.Chapter 10 looks at conservation, with some pessimism, and also examines the idea of the great apes having legal rights.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U43FFZ9RVVKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0824837142#wasThisHelpful","R3U43FFZ9RVVKP","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a brilliant summary of something like 10,000 years--a long summary, and a bit slow in spots. The sheer length, almost 500 pages, may deter some readers. It took me most of the day today. Readers interested in specific topics might find particular chapters more rewarding than reading the whole thing. Cunliffe is one of the grand old men/ women of archaeology in the past fifty years, so this book brings in some archaeology and other aspects of scholarship. It also has a lengthy guide to further reading.The photographs are very good, though mostly of landscapes to get a sort of mood of them, as well as of some art objects and sites. There are lots of maps, and these are highly readable, and pleasantly, are located in the sections where the text discusses them, rather than in a section at the front where so many works have them. The maps are, well, the best I have seen in a grand survey such as this. In a sense a major theme is also the possibilities posed by environmental parameters, so environment is constantly in the background (as is geography). This is a grand narrative history of the kind not much written these days.The central theme of the book is how the steppe has been a connector between the Europe and the general Middle East/ Persian area in the west and China in the east. There's some discussion of India, but South and Southeast Asia is mostly unmentioned. There's also a little of Africa--Egypt, the Muslim regions of the Maghrib, and Axum, but mostly the continent is unmentioned, too. The focus really is Eurasia. The extensive sections on the steppe are the best I have read anywhere, even if group after group, leader after leader, state after state, empire after empire gets a bit confusing.The steppe has been a cultural highway, and among its passengers have been domestication of the horse, the idea of the chariot, artistic trends, religions, crops, the plague, pilgrims, diplomats and pillaging armies. However, some of the text concerns events in the more developed regions such as the long confrontations between the Romans/ Byzantines and the various empires based in Iran; the book is quite good on these, There's also a lot of Chinese history. Bothe these can be a bit tedious but reading about them in parallel so to speak helps one realize the continuity and connectedness of it all, rather than the usual consideration in isolation of each other.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3572NRHQI6LUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199689172#wasThisHelpful","R3572NRHQI6LUF","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an odd book. The text is well-written, as far as it goes, and the photographs are excellent, some superb. But the whole book has a sort of adult gee-whiz-this-is-so-cool tone. The only secrets are that at magnification and with Gary Greenberg's sophisticated techniques, the sand is revealed to be the opposite of the uniform feeling of sugar granules underfoot. There is every conceivable shape and color. The sand is diverse--from volcanic and barrier islands, river sandbars, desert dunes (and some dunes in the US, such as the Lake Michigan dunes), freshwater lake shores. The creation process of various sands is briefly described--abrasion by wave action, river currents, rain, wind, glacial action and more.I was hoping to read more about the geological processes at work in places like beaches and sand dunes. This book disappoints in that regard. It's really a picture book with fairly good commentary. It's a slender book and can be read quickly. The various sand pictures will remind some readers of modern painters, particularly Jackson Pollock.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24B8LLILCVOZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0760349444#wasThisHelpful","R24B8LLILCVOZ3","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an extremely good book for what it is. It covers a number of fascinating aspects of the ""commons"" and discusses economics and the commons, most especially the work of Elinor Ostrom (who won the Nobel in economics for her work). It's some fairly heavy reading, and the style is rather academic, with substantial in-text discussion of theories and economists, all this in a rather short work. Reader alert: Wall's conclusions will frustrate and perhaps anger people who are in any way free-market fundamentalists.The first part of the book is the most useful for a general readers, examining various approaches to the commons, and concluding that there have been many types and many have worked and are working--such as Boston Commons (now a park and urban greenspace) and the internet--the internet is a global commons and just as in the age of enclosures in Britain, there are attempts to close off the internet commons, too. Wall describes several kinds of commons, and notes that many were common in the sense they were commonly used but subject to agreed-upon rules that were enforced by local custom, with outsiders kept out, eliminating the ""free rider"" problem. A current example would be the Maine lobster fishery, in which locals quite emphatically enforce informal rules, using considerable violence if needed.Wall examines the Garrit Hardin essay ""The Tragedy of the Commons"" and finds it very influential but deeply flawed. The logic was perhaps too elementary, assuming everyone makes choices based on self interest, which Wall says is hardly the case in many commons, such as Swiss pastures (still a commons in the 21st century). He notes that the American native peoples usually regarded nature as a commons (but often limited use to particular groups such as clans or families, and kept others out); the invading Europeans saw the commons as empty and seized it by force, so Wall sees that as related to Scottish lairds throwing crofters off the land in favor of sheep.This may seem to be a small technical argument, but Wall is really talking about the global environmental commons and whether it can survive  extractivist use (a term I have not seem before but a useful concept). Wall is really saying that economics is as much about power and politics as it is about science. For Wall, there is clear evidence of commons management working and quite clear evidence of extractivist economics destroying the commons and causing social injustice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37QPT4804YXGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262027216#wasThisHelpful","R37QPT4804YXGX","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this book when I was looking for information about Bhutan. This is an atlas with a lot of commentary.  It's a fairly fast read--probably 4/5 maps and photos. The maps are excellent and many of the many illustrations are exceptionally good. That said, the problem is that it's not complete, probably due to political conditions. It covers in particular Nepal and Bhutan, India and a little of Pakistan. But where is Tibet and China? The maps do show some of those areas, but the commentary does not. In addition, the material is a little outdated, given China's recent very large programs of dams and road building.There are five sections: The regional setting (which as noted doesn't have much about Tibet); the natural environment; society; exploration and travel; resources and conservation. I'd rate the environment section as the best. The section on exploration has a little on Chinese and other Asians, on pilgrim routes, but is primarily concerned with Europeans, in which folks from the Raj are the major players (including some Indian assistants who did some remarkable geographic work).","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHJ1RXW7CCIRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0813123887#wasThisHelpful","RHJ1RXW7CCIRX","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wahlman has written a book with what are really case studies and a consideration of US military doctrine regarding cities. His examples are Aachen (1944), Manila (1945), Seoul (1950) and Hue (1968). In each he considers the same factors, but if I read them correctly, the critical factor is that US units have been allowed to respond to local situations, and that US troops have done well, with the proviso that US commanders in these cases used firepower and machinery rather than lives. The accounts are well done and informative, but I think adding a couple more would make the book have more resonance in the present: Baghdad would be the obvious, and perhaps New York on 9/11 since defending a city from a major operation seems as likely in the future as storming into one.There is some intriguing detail about weapons and characters of the enemy. In Aachen, the US troops storming into the city were outnumbered 3 to 1 by German defenders, but the quality of those defenders was mixed and Americans displayed exceptional adaptation. In the Manila example, it took two US reinforced divisions to clear the city, with heavy civilian casualties: it is debated but Japanese intransigence and atrocity probably was more at fault than very heavy US bombardment. The Japanese troops were mixed quality but determined. In the Hue example, the city was stormed by North  Vietnamese regulars as well as guerillas, so in a sense the US response was defensive. In the example of Seoul, the Marines were exceptional. I think the example could have been elaborated, because the city was the scene of more than just the 1950 operations (the operations described followed the US landings at Inchon).Wahlman does cite some mistakes. In Achen and Seoul the cities were not completely cut off, so substantial enemy forces were able to escape encirclement. Overall, the book is better written than most military history, and the sections where he writes of doctrine are less dry than is typical.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PYHNOOEKTP8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1574416197#wasThisHelpful","R2PYHNOOEKTP8C","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was library browsing and happened on this book, and am glad I did. I have read a number of books on South Africa, but the San people were not much covered (Note: ""San"" is one of several names for these groups of hunter-gatherers, but is used to avoid negative connotations attached to other words such as ""Bushmen"").There were about 30,000 San in the Cape Province when Dutch colonialism began in 1652; the San had been pushed into the arid interior by Khoikhoi and Bantu peoples arriving about 2,000 years ago. Dutch colonists began venturing into the interior for grazing around 1700, and immediately ran into opposition; the Dutch grazing disrupted the environment (as did their hunting patterns). Dutch ""commandos"" (the word seems to be derived from Cape Dutch, and originally meant armed expeditions, something like a posse) would gather to punish raids by San and this author says, from 1770 through the 1790s annual commandos went out to kill San, forming essentially killing squads; all San men and most women found were killed and children taken to raise up as servants. The chapter on these Dutch depredations is the core of the book. Another chapter concerns the British, who were much less violent but tried to settle the San down and Christianize them, so if not murderous these policies were still aimed at destroying traditional culture. The destruction of the San was not only at the hands of colonists; herding groups such as the Griquas also hunted down and killed San.The book does not go much past the early 1800s. The last chapter is essentially an academic essay on was it or wasn't what happened to the San genocide. Adhikari concludes that it was. Apparently the topic gets little attention (save denial) in South Africa. This is a useful read, particularly on the fairly detailed chapter on the trekboers (the Dutch migrating inland), but the discussion of whether or not it w as actual genocide seems to be to be fruitless. The San way of life, once dominant in large areas, was essentially destroyed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V2A5JDAW5VMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0821419870#wasThisHelpful","R2V2A5JDAW5VMI","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another entry in the ""Animal Answer Book"" series. This is a formulaic short book, but the writing is good and the material interesting. It might be of special interest to teens with an interest in natural history, though the target audience is an educated readership. The weakness is that all the photos are in black and white, even the section of gecko coloration and vision.I knew little about the animals and found out a good deal. I had no idea they can live substantial lengths of time--the maximum known span for a wild gecko is 37 and for geckoes in captivity, 34. There are 1,400 species, ranging from a half inch to almost a foot and up to a pound in weight. I suspect most readers live in zones too cold for geckos, but Floridians like me see them daily--and nightly, as a population of Asian geckoes has come to inhabit urban areas in my part of the Sunshine State. They're cute little guys, and the book says geckos have sharp eyesight, which experience tells me is true.I was aware that geckos can vocalize, but unaware of the variety. The Giant New Caledonian gecko can growl and whistle. Not much is known about many species, apparently. One species is known only from one stuffed specimen, a century old--Delcourt's Giant Gecko from New Zealand. Some seem to have a limited ability to learn, and at least one species is all female, the mourning gecko.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R121J07YUWEBI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421408538#wasThisHelpful","R121J07YUWEBI1","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not a book one loves, given the premise of battle which is to kill other ships. The photos are as promised, unusual (and include some drawings of revisions) and in a way nostalgic. There's not much technical detail, but the photos might help someone making models, as details of decks and that remarkable pagoda control center on most is displayed.The photos are all black and white, some a bit blurry. The fates of many of these vessels is listed, so often sunk by US aircraft or submarines. While impressive, I can't help thinking of the tens of thousands of Japanese sailors who went down with these ships, to be largely forgotten save by historians and people interested in old naval encounters.One interesting detail is that some of the ships captured from the Russians in the 1904-1905 war are shown.

"This is a fascinating read. Charney's writing is clear and lively, and his expertise is impressive. The graphics are well chosen and there's a handy list of up-to-date investigative tools at the end, heavy on technology but clearly explained. My only complaint is that the font is a small size and that makes it harder to read. This book is full of fascinating detail and has some amazing stories about forgers. It's heavy on European art crime, and has rather little on Asia or Latin America--surely there are master forgers in those places, as well.I have a little difficulty in seeing the difference between fakery and forgery. He says that a fake is a period piece falsely and deliberately presented as something other, like a 1700s painting by a minor artist being somewhat altered and presented as a lost work by a major artist. But isn't that also forgery? Charney says forgery is one made up in the present and using the impressive range of fakery technology to be presented as older work. This book is primarily about the art of art forgery, which includes not just the work but forgery of the work's provenance. He gives some extremely impressive examples of master forgers. There's also an element of arrogance and inertia on the part of experts and museums. An expert who authenticates a work later shown to be a forgery loses a lot of his or her reputation, sometimes to the point of career destruction, and museums have strong motives not to admit they have bought a fake--the shame of spending donor money, the loss of professional repute and professional pride. The prime example in the book is the Getty, although there are other museums with similar histories.Among the interesting details are that the most popular artists to forge are Picasso and Dali, and that the artwork most stolen has been Van Eyck's The Ghent Altarpiece, with parts of the work stolen 13 times over the centuries. There are complexities: Michelangelo forged some works and that helped his early career. There's also the point than many old masters presided over studios in which assistants did much of the work; is the apprentices do most of the work and the master signs it, is it a fake?Punishment for forgers exposed seems almost always minimal, and some of the most notorious have written books, including one who wrote a book on how to forge art (the man was later murdered in Rome). Movies have been made of such people, so the usual negative views of crime seem to color art forgery only lightly. My favorite from Charney's  stories is the American forger Mark Landis, who forged many works and, under an alias as a Jesuit, father Arthur Scott, donated them to schools and museums, not in it for money but perhaps for pride or an interesting s ense of humor.Near the end he considers other forgeries of a literary nature, such as the poems of Ossian, the Hitler diaries fake and a Shakepeare lost play discovered,","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EK7GQBH2A38F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0714867454#wasThisHelpful","R1EK7GQBH2A38F","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start by saying that this is Winchester's best book. As in all his books (at least the four I have read) this means a story well told, thoroughly researched and informed by extensive personal experience traveling in the places he writes about. Now, I need to add that some, perhaps many readers, will be puzzled by the structure of the book and by its tone. His chapter on American treatment of Pacific islanders is one that should shame Americans, but may rile some readers because of its rather anti-American policy tone (but not fundamentally anti-American; do remember he is British). The book also powerfully evokes change, in particular what academics might term a loss of hegemony--the French loss of Indochina, the British retreat from Asia, the rise of Chinese power sufficient to challenge the United States. The book is also hopeful of the growth of respect and understanding (the last few pages articulates this sense, using the story of the Hawai'ian ocean-going  canoe Hokole'a. The book is somewhat chronologic, but the intent is to give a sense of complexity and interconnection, because a literal history would be at minimum several volumes.Winchester covers history rather well in a backstory sense, but the book starts with January 1, 1950. This is the defined date for the ""present,"" in the sense that a date of say 3,000 BP now means 3,000 years before 1950. The chapters start with short historical or human stories and segue into larger topics. For example, Chapter 10 starts with the eruption of Mt Pinutubo in the Philippines, destroying two major US bases, then segues into another volcano, growing Chinese economic and military strength, including the extremely effective Chinese strategies now unfolding in the seas adjacent to and extending from China's coast. This chapter, by the way, should be required reading for anyone interested in China's military.His introduction is, I think, superb. Read it and perhaps that will decide you to either read or not read the rest. Chapter 1 concerns the atomic and nuclear era, in particular nuclear testing. This is the section that discusses some quite shameful American treatment of islanders, a shame continuing into the present. It will probably anger some readers. Chapter 2 is more benign, describing the rise of Sony and its famed transistor radio. Chapter 3 may interest readers with little interest in the rest of this book, because it describes the rise of surfing into an international sport.Chapter 4 tells the story of an American officer who used a grease pencil on a map to suggest the 35th parallel as the border of influence between Soviet and American occupations of Korea. This has some wonderful (and quite strongly biased against North Korea) writing about the Koreas and is one of the best chapters. Chapter 5 starts with the burning of the liner Queen Elizabeth in Hong Kong, well past her glory days, and segues into the recession, so to speak, of Hong Kong to China. This has some interesting discussion of European recession from Asia as well, the French and British, especially. Chapter 6 starts with the 1974 typhoon that destroyed Darwin (in Australia) and segues into weather patterns; I really liked this chapter, but readers who do not credit global climate change will be very upset at Winchester's  assumptions. It fits with the rest of the book in the sense the Pacific is an ocean but is also connective tissue, connecting the Eastern nations (on the ocean's western rim!) and the Western nations (on its eastern rim!)--we're all in this climate change thing together, this chapter says.Chapter 7 is largely Australia, and I suspect that many US readers will yawn as they read this section, which is too bad. Chapter 8 looks at the submersible Alvin and the discoveries of what have come to be called black smokers and white smokers, hot deep ocean vents. Something that will surprise many readers--it did surprise me--is that these vents offer a wealth of minerals that will soon be mined, the technology is being developed now, and the ecologic and environmental effects may be huge. But who are we Americans, considering all we have done, to tell Asian nations to cool it on this, asks Winchester. This chapter is a bit pessimistic in tone with the sense that the resource is rich and will be exploited because it will make people, some people, rich.Chapter 9 is more strongly environmental, discussing coral bleaching and other problems--reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef, may be gone in this century. But he also has some encouraging counters that give the chapter a sense of, a small sense of, a positive future. The 10th chapter is as noted above mostly about the rising Chinese power.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HUT1VD7YX519/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062315412#wasThisHelpful","R3HUT1VD7YX519","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book I started years ago and never finished. I just read it all over the last day and am glad I did. Dinerstein's writing is extremely good, and as a scientist with vast field experience he knows what he's writing about. The book's style is participant-narrator, so to speak, rather like much science writing or journalism, but more informed.The book may be somewhat dated. It was published in 2012 so the field experiences he relates are before that, and endangered species can experience huge change in a short period, such as poachers wiping out a reserve's elephants. Each chapter centers on similar species and usually specific locations. I most enjoyed his discussion of Kirtland's warbler, which considers why the bird is rare and why it is so picky where it nests. The warbler is likely to be a ward of the state forever, because only controlling numbers of the parasitic Brown headed cowbird has allowed the population to improve its position somewhat.He writes about the greater one-horned rhinoceros, down to a few hundred animals, with its horn in 2010 worth $100,000 a kilo, and how after mild recovery it was devastated by political turmoil in Nepal--in the absence of enforcement poachers cut deeply into the population.  Another chapter considers Brazil's cerrado, a rather large area being converted to soybean production, with animals such as a giant armadillo, a large anteater and the maned wolf. One aspect I was not aware of is the use of scent dogs to find animal scats, which can then be analyzed for DNA and other contents, to yield a lot of data for species difficult to observe or census.Two other chapters I though especially good. One is on the birds (and some plants) in Hawai'i, and another, the last chapter, on Bhutan. The chapter on Bhutan makes one optimistic, as the country seems determined to protect its natural resources--Dinerstein is also optimistic about Namibia. Another fascinating chapter is on Vietnam, with a focus on the mountains usually called the Annamites (the Vietnamese name is different), which apparently remain storehouses of rarities, albeit under growing pressure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTO7B5F13Z1ER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1610911954#wasThisHelpful","RTO7B5F13Z1ER","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am somewhat disappointed in this book. The selection of posters is excellent, and it really is rather global in coverage (mostly India, China, Iran and Palestine, with a few other locales in addition to the dominant European and American coverage. The writing is good but the overall text is not nearly as good as the posters shown. It starts well but then veers into a bit too much art and design; by this I mean the focus shifts from a history of posers, I think, to a consideration of posters interacting with artists and designers. This isn't all bad, but it's a bit too academic for the general reader.There's more, of course. Guffy does devote a lot of space to the political poster, particularly of the USSR and Mao's China, which found posters a useful media for exhortation--and also apparently displaying posters of Mao in one's home was a wise investment, demonstrating one's orthodoxy. There's interesting discussion of posters in Cuba and also--this will likely rile pro-Israeli readers--some discussion of martyr posters, which desktop publishing has made quite sophisticated. Among other discussions topics in the book is an Iranian artist, Reza Abedina, whose work is really interesting, a theme of which is liberating Iranian posters from Western typography.There's maybe too long a discussion of posters from the 1960s. The book has some striking designs from then, including a very famous Bob Dylan poster, but I think if the discussion had been a bit shorter more space could have been used for the political posters of 1968. I also note that Latin America is mostly missing and that there's no mention of Australia. There's a short mention of US federal art programs using posters, which sounds interesting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ48134VWBAM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=178023371X#wasThisHelpful","RQ48134VWBAM3","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a long time I avoided books in a question-and-answer format, but tried a couple and found they may have lots of solid information that doesn't require reading a tome.

With some 1,400 species the book can mention only a few in detail (the 1,400 is a detail from the book!). The organization is good and the writing is very good. There is a section of color  photos at the end, quite well done but there could be more. There are a number of photos in the text, as well.Here's some things that the book left with me. One bat is known to have lived to 41 in the wild (banded), 6 species to 30+ years old and 22 more at 20+ years. The ""bumblebee bat"" AKA Kitti's hog-nosed bat weighs about the same as a US penny; there are some fruit bats that top the scales at three pounds, and may appear on the dinner menu in some parts of the world. The banana bat lives inside furled banana leaves. Vampire bats need about two tablespoons of blood a day. The African false vampire bat can hear a beetle walking in sand from six feet away--one wonders who found out that detail.Intriguing is evidence that bats can in effect say things to each other (of the same species, that is) and appear to have enough intelligence to cope with changes in their environment. The book didn't mention it in any detail but bats apparently can learn.The sheer variety is wonderful. Some bats eat fish, using echolocation to detect ripples in the water surface--and some bats can swim. The book notes that a fruit bat can peel a mango--and has a photo of a bat enjoying the fruit. Then there are African wooly bats that may live in webs of colonial spiders.Note that this is not a children's book but teens with an interest in nature would probably like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDLEA3X4WHZLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0813545889#wasThisHelpful","RDLEA3X4WHZLS","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book deserves as many readers as possible. I can't believe mine is the first review! Khan's writing is excellent, and the book will help any reader better understand what India (in the sense of British India, including present day Pakistan) and all its peoples went through in the war. What Khan does is remarkable: she establishes that India was vital to the war and that the war is vital to understanding the rapid political evolution that resulted in independence and the 1947 split. I can't emphasize enough that this is a new and highly informative take on a part of the war, one far more complex and far more important than most American readers know.The book covers a great deal, some of it necessarily briefly, and points the way for other writers. In no particular order, this book covers the Bengal famine, two million Indian soldiers abroad, the Burma campaigns, hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing the initial Japanese conquest of Burma, Japanese bombing and fear of bombing, hospitals, recruiting, the Indian National Army (under Bose, nominally fighting with the Japanese against the British), demobilization, censorship and more. The more includes black American GIs (22,000 of 150,000 total Americans in India during the war), white American racism against black Americans and black Americans finding sympathy with Indians.There's some detail I have read nowhere else. About a forth of British merchant sailors were Indian, and scandalously they were paid far less than white sailors. German propaganda aimed at Indian soldiers (in North Africa) and German broadcasts were rather more effective than the usual histories indicate, and Japanese propaganda also more adroit, of course in both cases focusing on quite real facts of racism in the Raj. There was an influx of European refugees, including thousands of Poles, and apparently there were Indians who learned Polish in the course of interactions (and the reverse of course), Thousands of poor white people seem to have acted to discredit the rigid hierarchy of the old Raj, which was shaken during the war. The account of the Bengal famine is superb, by far the best I have read. Then there's Herman Perry, an American black GI serving with troops building the Ledo Road to China, who murdered an officer and deserted; he was sheltered by a Naga family, and married a village girl in the year he was free before he was caught and hanged. There are other individuals who make Khan's history come alive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WIU68NMJIOIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199753490#wasThisHelpful","R1WIU68NMJIOIF","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the Introduction, Norwich writes ""today is my eighty fifth birthday."" This is perhaps the final book by a grand old man who has lived a full life and with a good portion of that life concerned with Sicily. It's popular history, well written and informed by his own half century plus of seeing change in the island. It's a fine introduction to a quite complicated history. The book is best on particular eras; I rate the sections on the Romans and Carthaginians, the section on the Normans (and the related Hohenstauffen kingdom), the Napoleonic era, and the era of Garibaldi as the most informative and most interesting. I read it a few chapters a night over a week.There's more, of course. He rather overdid the Admiral Nelson- Lady Hamilton business, an interesting but sad footnote; Nelson was involved in some of the politics (partly as a force the British diplomats could call in). But the number of pages he devotes to it seems excessive. Another intriguing section is the invasion of Sicily by the Allies, and the American use of important mafia figures in that campaign. The book essentially stops in 1945, although he does note that over the past decades, even while the mafia retains significant, Sicily's condition has improved and life for the mass of Sicilians has never been better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D3KQU8RKDKFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812995171#wasThisHelpful","R3D3KQU8RKDKFC","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Covering primarily the Canadian Arctic, it does consider Arctic conditions elsewhere, including Svalbard and Greenland and some in Alaska. Struzik is primarily concerned with the connected changes posed by energy development and climate change. There have already been significant impacts on the Arctic, including Pacific salmon being caught in Greenland, and killer whales in some numbers feeding on beluga, narwhals and seals (once very rare). The news isn't uniformly bad. He notes that barren ground grizzly bears, Wood buffalo and musk oxen may do very well as a consequence.The most pressing threat isn't climate change, it's energy development, specifically the oil sands in Alberta, which uses a huge amount of water; the Athabaska system, ground waters and lakes. This is south of the Arctic, but polluted water can flow north into the Mackenzie river system, which is Arctic and is huge. Given the likelihood of much more shipping in the Arctic, an energy infrastructure is already developing. Oil exploration, diamond mines, ores and other mineral exploration, and development is coming. Not so many people appreciate the delicate ecosystems, the importance of the Arctic to weather patterns and the complexities of permafrost. The resources soon to be available are huge. The potential problems are, as well.Struzik's book is full of information, and he draws on his decades of what might be called Arctic journalism (he lives in Edmonton). Much of the narrative is a sort of participant narration. Chapters are fairly short and look at largely one topic each, such as birds, polar bears, water, within the general context of the Arctic. He's harsh on the Canadian government (as of this writing the Conservatives he lambasts have just lost an election). As an American used to a prevailing anti-environmentalism in government, it is odd to think the Canadian experience has been worse, with the same blend of energy-sponsored denial of climate change and the same climate of deregulation of corporations. He praises some American aspects, including a large groundwater agreement in Texas. He doesn't exactly condemn the energy industry but seems to think they will cut corners and have done little of the basic research for Arctic development.One detail I had not known about. He writes that in 1949, there was a plan to test atomic weapons in an area west of Hudson Bay--these would have been British devices, based on the understanding that large areas of  land was scarcely populated and had little value.The book is short enough to read in an hour or so, and the writing is excellent, both entertaining and highly partisan. The information is current and solidly researched, but given the pace of change could be outdated in just three or four years. There are some photos that help make the point, but more would help the reader.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38HTCBYSEPWQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1610914406#wasThisHelpful","R38HTCBYSEPWQZ","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I only discovered this series recently. Sanderson has written an interesting book on small cats, defined essentially as not one of the 6 or 7 large cats. The science is easy to understand, and the descriptions good. It is written in a question and answer form, and is appropriate for any interested non-scientist, including bright high schoolers. Some sections are a bit dry, such as the evolutionary relationships and the bone structure. The book describes some species I had never heard of such as the Bay cat (Borneo) and the Flat-headed cat (parts of Africa). The weakness is that all the photographs are black and white, making details of coat patterns difficult to see (but it probably made the book cheaper).One thing I noted is that details on some of the cats are simply not known. A lot is inferred from studies on domestic cats,  The book has a lot of interesting detail. The guigna cat (Chile, parts of Argentina) is at three pounds way smaller than most house cats. Cats have a remarkable sense of smell, house cats 15 time more sensitive than we humans in scent. Cats are dichromatic, having two kinds of cone cells in their eyes rather than three, so they see different colors differently than we do, but they have far more rod cells for night vision than humans do. There is an interesting discussion on vibrissae--whiskers and such hairs in other places, that give cats a remarkable sense of their relationship to space and objects around them.And! The author notes that the world's only cat museum is in Sucheng, Sarawak. Why there must be a story in itself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FT64I69Y9MGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801898854#wasThisHelpful","R3FT64I69Y9MGI","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is essentially a case study in changing human use of a resource. Tanoaks were widespread on the Pacific coast, and acorns provided a mainstay for many tribal peoples. A mature tanoak might provide 200 or more pounds per year and an old growth tree, a thousand pounds. One grove might sustain a village. The arrival of the Spanish changed things some but the tidal surge coming with the gold craze quickly altered the old patterns. White rancher and farmers used the oak as a kind of commons for hogs and cattle, while wiping out the Indians on a near-genocidal scale. Open land seemed to settlers to be an indication they were unused and free for the taking. So, they took. Tanoak bark became a major resource for the tanning industry for ""heavy leathers,"" such things as harness and industrial use. This wiped out much of the resource. Now, tanoaks are being eradicated as weeds by industrial forests, because tanoaks grow quickly after disturbance and outcompete he desired softwoods. A tree has gone from a gift of god for the peoples' sustenance to a hated weed.Bowcutt writes this story beautifully. There are a generous number of photos related to all this, including indigenous people using the acorns. The last chapter, ""Partnerships"" considers whether native tribal peoples can work partnerships with others to help the trees survive. The chapter introduces the concept of ""food sovereignty,"" which I had not heard of before but strikes me as intriguing.The future of the tree is not only in discovering new uses and extending old uses, but survival. Sudden Oak Death is infecting many areas  where the tree grows, and threatens to annihilate the stands (other oaks are also at risk). There is no cure in sight. New uses might include craft furniture and other objects, because this is a useful hardwood, but the cost of processing it into usable timber is excessive.Bowcutt has written in this book a model case of environmental history continuing into the present. To do so in this short of book, with great detail and clarity is uncommon. It deserves a wider readership than it's likely to actually get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH4FMZEDMLMGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0295994649#wasThisHelpful","RH4FMZEDMLMGS","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an admirably short, thoroughly researched and nicely written account of privateers. It's an aspect of the War of 1812 that tends to be thought of in a sort of swashbuckling aura, as if they were upscale pirates, but they were a thoroughly capitalist enterprise on all sides. Navy personnel suffered the same hazardous conditions with the addition of harsher discipline, but had less potential for reward--the luck few privateers made some investors, owners and officers wealthy.There were two kinds of privateers, cruise and voyage. The first cruised for prey, the second were really armed merchant ships that might take advantage of opportunity, but carried on trade. Kert has found evidence for about 600 American privateers who among them took about 1,900 prizes. Her book also looks at privateers from Canada who preyed on American shipping. Privateers obtained letters of marque from proper authorities (the whole business had paperwork galore especially if prizes made it to port to face the admiralty courts for disposition of the ship and cargo). Her chapter 2 has a nice discussion of the origin of the privateering system and its legal situation.More than 100,000 Americans crewed these ships (a ship might cruise more than once with different crews).  Half never took a prize and of the prizes taken, many were retaken and some lost at sea.  A few privateers took dozens of prizes (the top one she lists was Canadian, with maybe a hundred prizes). Chapter 5 details some of the successful privateers, their cruises and some of the cargoes--a couple borderline bizarre.A couple of things had consequences. An American privateer was trapped in the Azores and taken by a British force, but put up a stout fight and caused numerous British casualties. The British force was to have reinforced the invasion forces that landed at New Orleans, so it helped Andrew Jackson. In another case a British privateer took an American ship en route from Italy to Philadelphia, carrying among other things somes crates of paintings for the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. That institution went to the British courts and the surprising result is that the paintings were released, the case establishing that cultural goods belong to civilization as a whole and are not subject to being spoils of war--a principle still important. A few American privateers operated out of French ports, outraging the British, and a few sailed in the Pacific cruising Chinese waters, with the British Navy after them. There are some movie plots here, I think.The privateers collectively were a moderate success, some not recouping the cost of outfitting them, some greatly profiting the people and local ports they sailed from (Salem had more than 40 privateers, for example). They were calculated gambles for profit, that happened to be of use in wartime. Kert notes that the most important effect was a boost in morale and pride.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H5AAFFTF2ZM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421417472#wasThisHelpful","R2H5AAFFTF2ZM3","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Metcalf has a great topic here, but could carry it out better. He divides American history into generations, backfilling from the recent Gen X and all that. These seem somewhat forced. The Republican generation 1742-66; Compromise generation 1767-91; Transcendental generation 1792-1821;  Gilded 1822-42; Progressive 1843-59; Missionary 1860-82; Lost generation 1883-1900; and so on. These are the years people were born and grew up and used words he lists. His selection is quite arbitrary, but interesting and should please anyone interested in words and jargon.Most of his selections lasted a few years to a few decades but some remain. Okay, for example, remains nearly as common as ""like."" Some words change. Pioneer, foe example, originally had a military meaning, something like advance guard. The deadline comes from a line drawn in the sand which, if prisoners crossed at Andersonville they were shot--this one is contestable. Dude goes back to 1883 meaning a foppish young man.This is not a particularly serious book, it's light reading.

"This is an agreeable book on a topic of considerable interest, but it doesn't really have much in the way of answers. Does the moon have an impact on life? The answer in this book is on some species, yes, but on humans, maybe or maybe not.Naylor looks at some cultural understandings. For example, the Maya didn't see a man in the moon, they saw a rabbit in the moon. He also discusses some biology where there is an impact. There's evidence that some fish respond to moonlight rather than tides, rising or descending in the water column depending on the light, and there appears to be a tie-in with breeding in some species. Night hunting activity is suppressed by bright moonlight for some species of predators. And my favorite, African dung beetles cab use moon to figure out direction.That's what the book left with me, some interesting trivia and history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV8PZTWA0KPJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0198724217#wasThisHelpful","RV8PZTWA0KPJE","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read many books on immigration and on Asian Americans. Overall, this is the best. Lee manages to cover two dozen ethnicities over several centuries, and paints a wonderfully informative mosaic. One important aspect is that Asian America is not a single entity; Hmong refugees and Filipina nurses have as little in common as immigrants from Bosnia and Nigeria. One reason this is such a powerful book is perhaps her own family's experience in the complicated history of Chinese immigrants to America over the last century.The focus is the United States, but Lee also explores relevant history in Canada and especially Mexico. The famous Manila Galleon trade over 250 years made a connection between Asia and New Spain that brought tens of thousands of Asians to what is now Mexico, as slaves and sailors, including a wide range of Asians, not just from the Philippines. She covers Chinese labor that built much of the transcontinental railroad, but does not appear in the iconic photographs. There's also discussion of the infamous and little known ""coolie trade"" in which Chinese labor was brought to places like Cuba and Peru, under conditions often little different than slavery. There's some violent history few Americans know about, including a vicious massacre of Chinese in Wyoming, terrorism in the California gold fields and mobs running Asians out of many Western towns. It's not just American racism: in Torreon in Mexico in 1911 some 303 Chinese were massacred.The story has many variants. Some Sikhs came to California a century ago, and with state laws against Asians marrying whites, married into the Mexican American community to found a vibrant community. There were Bengali immigrants to New Orleans, Korean migrants fleeing Japanese occupation of Korea, and many more. For me the most troubling portions of the book were the laws against Asians becoming citizens or owning property, leading into the World War 2 internment of more than 120,000 people of Japanese origin; some of these were from Latin American Asian communities, in effect arrested by US authorities. The story is of sustained effort, enduring optimism and eventually more acceptance.Key events were World War 2 when China was an ally, and the 1964 Immigration and Naturalization Act, which changed our history. Among other elements, tens of thousands of war brides came to the US from Japan, and over the years tens of thousands from Korea. The Southeast Asian War was another huge factor in that the eventual Communist triumph brought hundreds of thousands of refugees. One chapter looks at the experience of the Hmong people, enlisted virtually as a people in the US secret war, and coming to the US as a shattered tribal people. This last is on-going and with successes have come failures. Also fascinating is the story of immigrants from South Asia (India and Pakistan)An intriguing chapter is on transnational and global immigrants, a current phenomenon of what might be called multicontinental families using the media of today to maintain both immigration and background. These are often Indian or Chinese families and may be the immigrant pattern of tomorrow. A final chapter summarizes current trends: Asians are the predominant immigrant group (immigration from Mexico has dropped sharply), and oddly, Asian Americans are over represented at both ends of the economic scale, large percentages are affluent and larger percentages are poor than the national norms. And racism remains a formidable obstacle.The book has an excellent bibliographic essay. The photos add considerably to the text.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ7DOSP4LFQ9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476739404#wasThisHelpful","RZ7DOSP4LFQ9O","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent overall account of billfish (marlin, swordfish, spearfish and so on). It's a ""Wormsloe"" book from this publisher, which seems to guarantee quality (I've read several). Ulanski writes clearly and mixes science with culture in a way that informs both. This book discusses billfish biology, life cycle, prey and migration patterns, along with the development of a major sports fishery--with one chapter on billfish fishing tournaments. Swordfish are treated in a separate chapter, because they have long been fished for food, with other species fished largely for the sport.Two literary figures are important, because both had a mania for fishing--Zane Grey and Ernest Hemingway. Both has a lot to do with the development of the billfish sports fishery, which by now involves many thousands of fishers and quite large amount of money as prizes in tournaments. Catch and release prevails now, and apparently if done with care, most of the fish survive.There's some interesting discussion of long-line fishing and how it impacts these fish, primarily swordfish, as well as discussion of currents, water temperatures and currents, with how the fish use these phenomena. I found the best chapters to be 5, on blue marlin (it has a good section on the mechanics of the fish swimming), and 6. on swordfish. The chapter on swordfish also looks at how this animal is endangered.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AS28NMM8EJ3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0820341916#wasThisHelpful","R1AS28NMM8EJ3V","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just reread this book after reading it several years ago. Environmental history is a major interest of mine, and looking at the Civil War through an environmental lens, as Brady puts it, is interesting. War and the environment is an emerging subfield. I think I better understand her point after the reread. Brady sees nature as an important historical agent, an agent without intent or consciousness but still an agent. This is an arguable point. Having ""agency"" usually means both intent and conscious use of whatever power the agent has to affect something. Brady makes a case for it, not entirely convincing, but interesting. Nature is not static, and this may affect military operations. This would mean rising and falling waters, weather, temperatures, mud, and such, things that change.Brady also posits the landscape is a mix of nature and human activity. It seems to be this rather than nature as a whole that she's looking at. She uses the term ""agroecosystem"" and certainly the North made war on the Southern landscape, notably in Sherman's marches through Georgia and the Carolinas. Structures were burned, crops destroyed, domestic animals killed or carried off, the infrastructure damaged as much as possible. Brady looks at Grant's Vicksburg campaign, in two chapters, Sherman's march, and then Sheridan's campaign in the Shenandoah as case studies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROARTNTNQRRC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0820342491#wasThisHelpful","ROARTNTNQRRC5","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book deserves a wider readership than it's probably going to get. Rogers describes a too-little known ecological crisis by looking at a variety of plants and trees under threat, and they really are stories. The stories include how the plant was discovered by botanists, where it grows, something of its historic range and what that is currently, as what threats there may be. She also discusses efforts to prevent extinction. The overall story is that American forests are in deep, deep trouble, due to epidemics of fungus, beetles, climate change, timber harvest and development. And my own take is that part of the danger is that so few people are aware of the dangers, but we're losing tens of thousands of thousands of square miles of forest in the American West and could lost most of it. This is solid science, particularly botany and ecology, but she has written the book without all the notes that characterize an academic study; she wants to reach a more general public. Rogers' prose is graceful and clear.Chapters include a considerable variety, from Mead's milkweed to the Feikeisen and acuna cactus to the Whitebark pine. Each has been chosen as an example and taken together, give a reader a sense of the problems and a sense of how they are being addressed. As a Floridian, I found the chapter on Florida Torreya to be especially interesting; this tree is rare and native to the slope ecosystem along the Apalachicola river in Florida's Panhandle area. I had never heard of this before and was entirely unaware that the area is a botanical hotspot or that there was such a thing as slope forest.There's much more. The Fraser fir is endangered in the wild, with mature trees wiped out. This is important because 95% of the Christmas tree crop in North Carolina is Fraser fir, the total crop worth in excess of $100 million per year. Then there's the Parachute penstemen, discovered in an area in Colorado only in the 1980s, and it's endangered by development of shale oil resources in its preferred ecosystem. And there's the Whitebark pine, an important tree in subalpine environments, gravely endangered by fire suppression (many conifers are adapted to regular fires), byfungus and beetle epidemics and by global warming--this is important because the tree is a base element of that ecosystem and iconic for hikers.One chapter examines three plants and their associated animals,  in the sense of coevolution; running buffalo clover and bison, for example. Another is fascinating, ""Lost in the Wild,"" referring to plants found in the wild and not seen since; an example is the Franklin tree, found by William Bartram in the 1700s in Georgia and not seen in the wild since (although a widely domesticated species). There's a chapter on northern plants, mostly Canadian and the author reminds us that the North is a carbon sink but could easily turn into a carbon source if warming continues. The last chapter is grim in a sense because Rogers says that while any species has inherent value, inherent value doesn't make it as an argument with any economic impact. Only if a species can be shown to have real or potential value will it be widely seen as worth saving, the value in terms of potential medical use or genes that might be useful in GMO crops.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNU231CBOFU9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0816531064#wasThisHelpful","RNU231CBOFU9R","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coates has written a book that is going to outrage some readers and puzzle others. He's also written a book that I think will become as much of a classic as The Autobiography of Malcom X. Coates' writing is superb, and informed by both passion and tragedy. The book is in the form of three essay letters to his son. There's the tragedy, by the way, no matter how much love or how much promise, all it takes is one moment of sassing an officer or angering some advocate of stand-your-ground.  I fear for Coates himself; he indicts police officers as representative agents of a murderous system, and an officer who has read those comments who has Coates' car pulled over, well, you can imagine the rest. That's what he's writing about. What I have just written may make no sense until you get well into this book.He's writing about more than just the American institutions of structural racism. He describes a visit to Paris where he felt no animosity directed to himself or his family, but notes the French have their own version, with Algerians and others. Whether this is the same level of omnipresent fear inculcated into all American black communities is not clear. At the very end he indicts the ""Dreamers"" (this refers specifically to the people who think they are white, the term he uses in the book--itself derived from a poem) for not just consuming and killing black bodies but the body of the Earth as well. You may not agree with me, but there's something magnificently Old Testamentish about this.Reading reviews or other kinds of comments isn't going to tell you much except that Coates  has touched a nerve and riled a lot of people up including those he says are ""obsessed with the politics of personal exoneration.""

"I wish I was better versed in this fine art--literally a fine art. What looks effortless is achieved by a deep aesthetic and careful gardening over time. The gardeners maintain the shapes conceived by the original designers, painting with gravel, stones, moss, foliage, trees, bamboo, as well as perspective, concepts such as asymmetry and sounds such as water. Rain and snow and seasonal color by flowers or fall leaves also enter the picture. Gardens were and are for contemplation and strolling, but also as a focus of concentration such as raking patterns in gravel, a physical articulation of religious concepts. In a sense they are uniquely Japanese, but as I viewed these photos, I was reminded of photographs of an Appalachian spring.I suspect that for Japanese visiting these gardens, the experience is something like visiting the great Gothic cathedrals in Europe is for others, a calming and contemplative activity (at its best, my guess is tourists with phone cams may sometimes muddy the concepts). Kyoto gardens still have the majesty of time, and this book allows an armchair traveler like me to get a taste.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LG5YH1IJS1Q6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=4805313218#wasThisHelpful","R1LG5YH1IJS1Q6","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an interesting book, although it may be of limited appeal, mostly to readers interested in modern Tibet, the Himalayas, and the Cold War. Khan writes well, and this book is actually entertaining, a marked contrast to the usual book based on someone's PhD dissertation. It's short, pithy and does not have the typical scholarly ""apparatus"" of vast numbers of citations. The book is partly based on interviews, but also on archival material recently declassified (and he notes, recently reclassified). One gripe: the man loves long paragraphs, some of them more than one page. The writing is good, but I'd break up those paragraphs.Khan's thesis is that Fourth World people (nomads, villagers, mountain peoples, not really members of a formal nation) in and around the Tibetan border forced the People's Republic (agents of the Taiwan Chinese are also players in the book) to go from a loose form to a tighter form of control. Khan used the term ""Empire-lite"" to describe the era 1949-1959 when Tibet was not so harshly ruled. He sees China as a real empire (as he does the USA) because it has multiple ethnic groups, some held in by force, and Mao extended control over non-Han Chinese areas that had been part of the Qing empire (the old name was ""Manchu""). I find that mildly interesting but the ""Empire lite"" seems a bit contrived.Tibet has of course long been a nation but one that had only feeble control of much of its spread, and the borders with Tibet, Nepal, Sikkim, India, Pakistan and Bhutan were fluid and people might have roots in more than one place and in effect more than once identity. The intensification of Chinese rule in and after 1959 forced people to choose. The best part of the book looks at these groups of people. Interestingly while the PRC imposed rule on Tibet, the Taiwan (formally Republic of China) regime also acted strongly diplomatically to prevent the UN or other organizations from recognizing Tibet as a nation separate from China.The maps are excellent. A few photos of what the areas looked like and of some of the people would help the reader, I think. One thing the book does is make plain that Tibet did not exist in splendid isolation in a mountain fastness--trade was lively and there was a great deal of traffic in and through the mountains, whether of family or pilgrims or merchants.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23R3VNTGIKP5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=146962110X#wasThisHelpful","R23R3VNTGIKP5U","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The photographs range from excellent to superb. They are a fine evocation of a region, one part of my family has lived in since the late 1700s. I somehow missed this book before, and just read it. There isn't much text, and you can get through the whole thing in an hour. However if you have some association with the region, whether it's family, travel or hiking some trails, the photos may get you going down memory lane.Most of the photos can be described as landscape. Aside from trees, mountains, flowers and streams (a lot of waterfalls), there isn't a human or animal, save for one black bear.

"This is a complex book that really mixes several themes. One of course, and the best one, is the story of how Polynesian voyagers discovered and settled Hawai'i. The second is Kirch's autobiographical story of starting as a young archaeologist in his home state, and gradually becomes an archaeologist of international reputation, and with that, he also tells the story of developing techniques in the field, from digging in a gridded site to sophisticated tools that can tell where a basalt adze comes from. The other story is more or less a case study of Hawai'i, isolated from the rest of the world after the end of voyaging, for several centuries, evolving from thinly populated settlements to densely populated kingdoms. This is what Kirch calls an ""archaic"" state, and the example of the kingdoms (culminating in Kamehameha's united Hawai'i kingdom) becomes an example in such fields as anthropology.There's also a bit of fiction, in the sense several sections describe the creation of a voyage of settlement, including building the canoe, accumulating supplies, and the voyage itself. This is based on the facts of archaeology as we understand them at present, but also on the accounts written of Hawai'ian legends and stories, written down in the 1800s by native Hawai'ians and by others who came to the islands and were in a position to understand the tales--actually more oral history and social memory than legends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17S8D32IIWO8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0520273303#wasThisHelpful","R17S8D32IIWO8Z","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a compelling book, written with passion and understanding. It is partly written in first-person, as Neiwert is a kind of participant observer, living in the same area where the orca pods he describes live. This is primarily about several groups of orcas in the Puget Sound up through British Columbia coastal and island waters. These orcas bore the brunt of a decade or so of capture of orcas for aquariums such as Sea World--they suffered a sizable chunk of their populations lost to these captures, and have not yet recovered. Part of the point to the book is an exploration of whether and how these animals can live in such close proximity to several million people.One thing for readers to note is the small populations, something like 300 orcas in this sizable area. Also important to note is that the population is comprised of ""residents"" who eat salmon and other groups that travel widely, and eat sea mammals; these are essentially subspecies that do not interbreed. The latest studies indicate that there are perhaps ten subspecies in the killer whale complex, with different prey, that do not interbreed and socialize with their own kind. This book focuses mostly on the resident population, which has been closely studied for several decades now; interviews with the people who do the studies is an important part of the book, studies of behaviors, diet, vocalizations. The book does have a short section detailing the differing orca subpopulations.Niewert's book combines natural history, biology and most particularly, relationships with humans, which range from a New Age sensibility through hard science, politics and environmentalism, environmental ethics and a growingly popular whale watching industry that clogs the seaways. His point of view is very strongly  environmentalist influenced by solid science (which includes assumptions of evolutionary process and global warming). He discusses SeaWorld and other such businesses, and is uniformly harsh about them, accusing at least one of outright lies to the public (Orcas, with one rare exception, live much shorter lives in aquariums than in the wild). One fascinating chapter is titled ""Free Willies,"" discussing that particular whale as well as several others, concluding that release of whales born in captivity is probably not good, but the wild-caught ones probably should be released). The intricate politics of the whale ""rescued"" is bizarre, and SeaWorld comes out as the baddie.Near then end an environmental issue intrudes. The huge deposits of energy in Canada's tar sands represent a huge opportunity for exports, and the industry wants to set up a huge terminal near Port Vancouver to export the oil, which would bring large numbers of large tankers through the areas inhabited by the resident whales. Aside from the quite dangerous nature of the oil in the event of a spill, ships make a lot of noise that can interfere with Orca communications and their hunting. The issue has not been resolved yet, but given the very, very large sums of money that would be earned, it looks like tar sands oil 1, Orcas 0. The very strong environmentalist movement in BC may yet stop it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V36YDZLZIFKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1468308653#wasThisHelpful","R1V36YDZLZIFKW","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The sheer number of reviews in just a few months means this book has drawn some attention. Obviously the Civil War still matters to a lot of readers. Rather than add to what must be many thousands of words in other reviews, I'll just put a few notes here. One, McPherson is one of the grand old historians, with a career of more than fifty years.This is not really a book about why the war remains important. It's a collection of McPherson's essays about the Civil War, with only the first (where the book title comes from) written especially for this book. Some of them first appeared in the New York Review of Books, which is the premier venue for book reviews in the US (it also tends to be a bit smug about that fact); these essays are readable and fast to read. There's a lot about Lincoln, about slavery and some about how in this new century the war still reverberates.One detail is that he cites the new accepted total for Civil War fatalities, 750,000 or more, rather than the long-cited 600,000 plus estimate. I'd rate several chapters as best. Chapter 4, ""Death and destruction in the Civil War"" is a good discussion of a grim topic. Chapter 5 looks at the Union and Confederate navies in the light of British neutrality. Chapter 9 discusses Lincoln's growth from a military novice into a superb Commander in Chief.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DR1QHKO50O76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199375771#wasThisHelpful","R2DR1QHKO50O76","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a powerful and sometimes moving book. It intermingles current science with Safina's personal experience and some very strong opinion (Sea World might want to sue, given his comments about their maltreatment and misinformation about killer whales). It is not a systematic exploration of all animals. Safina looks in great detail at elephants in East Africa, wolves in Yellowstone and killer whales in  Washington-British Columbia waters. There are also briefer looks at crows, whales and a few other animals.For me, the book built slowly and packed both emotion and understanding in the last hundred pages about killer whales. I learned a lot, much of it entirely new to me. I did not know that there are essentially several varieties of killer whales (or ""orcas""), which don't mix and have different specialties--fish, marine mammals, sharks, whales and so on. The animals overall have a complex social structure, subtle communication, excellent memory and apparently both humor and self awareness of some kind.Other reviews have sufficiently established the quality of this book. Here are a few of the things that most surprised me. The section titled ""Where the Wolf Birds Lead"" concerns crows and ravens and discusses their tool use--astonishing. A sad and angering detail: hunters in Wyoming outside Yellowstone shoot wolves, but there is a way to eavesdrop on wolves with study collars on, find the radio frequency and then them and then kill them (killing part of a study as well as a wolf). At least two species of grouper recruit moray eels or other fish to help them get prey out of tight spaces.Then there is what US Navy sonar and weapons testing does to whales. Overall, this is Safina's finest and most powerful book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CDB1CTI29NQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805098887#wasThisHelpful","R1CDB1CTI29NQX","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an intriguing book I wish I had read when it came out. Greene examines literal horse power, horses in US cities from the later 1800s through several decades (horses continued to be used in a few urban areas well into the 1930s). The book is well researched and excellently written. Here's a quote that gives the theme: ""Horses were workers as well as machines that labored in partnership with humans. As horse populations swelled,  nineteenth-century America became more than a society that used horses; it became a society of horses and humans living and working together.""It discusses much more than horses doing work such as powering machinery by treadmill. Chapter 1, ""Why Horses?"" discusses the advantages of the horse over other animals such as oxen and camels. Oxen were extensively used but not so much in urbanizing America. This has details of horse bone structure and other details that do explain why horses. Fascinating stuff. Chapter 2 examines landscapes and horses. The connection may seem vague, but horses require food and a great deal of farmland was needed to grow it. The urban horse also needed an infrastructure just like automobiles would later--stables, stalls, harness makers, horseshoes and nails, drivers, what passed then for vets, wagons and carts, as well as sanitation--horse manure could be in hundreds of tons per day for a big city. Chapter 3 is ""Making Horses,"" which looks at horse breeding and how it became more elaborate as the 1800s went on, breeding larger horses for heavy city work.Chapter 4, ""Civil War Horses,"" digresses somewhat, but is fascinating. Both sides relied on wagon trains for supplies, as well as the huge needs for cavalry and artillery horses. The discussion of the ways the Quartermaster Department went about finding and supplying horses is absorbing.  Chapter 5, ""Horses as Industrial Workers"" is really the one closest to the book's title. This looks at the Pony Express briefly, as well as public transport (horse cars and later urban horse railroads), hauling in cityscapes and more. There was increasing technology as the century progressed, but despite what one might assume, the number and size of horses sharply increased, reaching its peak between about 1890 and 1900. Urban transportation was the largest single category (she doesn't mention it much, but horse transport gave rise to synonyms for ""taxi,"" such as cab and hack).Chapter 6 discusses increasing study of horses, what made them tick and how to maximize work from them, including Muybridge's famous photos and engineering design for vehicles more efficiently using horse power. The increasing professionalization of veterinarians is also noted.  Chapter 7, ""From Horse Powered to Horseless"" is for me the most interesting chapter. This discusses the rise of vehicles such as the bicycle and automobile, which dovetailed with Progressivism. This movement is extraordinarily complex, but regarding working horses it gave rise to groups protesting cruelty to animals, which saw the automobile as less cruel. Parts of the movement concerned with public health pushed for cars rather than horses, because a city like Philadelphia had 500 tons of horse manure a day in 1900. Greene describes other phenomena, culminating in the streets changing from, as she tellingly puts it, spaces in neighborhoods to spaces through neighborhoods. The streets were too chaotic for Progressives, and Progressives sought solutions to chaos such as to moving children to playgrounds, and putting police on the streets, and systematizing traffic rules. They also thought cars would be much safer and cleaner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRTCS231O07DO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674031296#wasThisHelpful","RRTCS231O07DO","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had been meaning to read this book for a couple of years, and just got around to reading it this week. It's fairly short, barely 200 pages, so you can read it in less than a day. The writing is excellent, the maps fairly good and the illustrations interesting. I take some exception to the title; it was less an age of exploration than political and military adventuring into the Indian Ocean. These were rather large scale and it is surprising that the Portuguese survived; luck and ruthlessness, perhaps. Much of the story Casale relates concerns Ottoman viziers, appointees in Egypt and naval commanders. It's mostly from the Ottoman point of view, and anyone interested in Ottoman activities in the Red Sea, Yemen and beyond will find this book well worth the read. Casale's major point is that the ""Age of Discovery"" histories are usually told from the stance of European discoverers, with all the other ""Others"" seen as victims; this book shows, as intended, the Ottomans as no victims but a major player in the age.Casale has some discussion of how the Ottomans had little knowledge of wider world geography--not much of a large body of recent works in Arabic were available to them, and he argues that it was indeed an age of discovery rather similar to that of Portugal. I'll leave that aspect for a reader to decide. The book has much to offer aside from that thesis. The Ottomans took Egypt and became responsible for the safety of Mecca and Medina, and were as much pulled into the region of the Red Sea and impelled by an urge to discover. They used the Egyptian port of Suez as an armory and base, and managed to construct a number of fleets there, despite most naval resources (especially wood) having to be imported from rather far off. They found themselves in a contest with the Portuguese, and the confrontation lasted decades, and extended from the Red Sea to the coasts of India and even further, as Aceh on Sumatra was allied.Ottoman conquests included much of Yemen, some of Eritrea, and with their conquest of Iraq, from Basra at the head of the Persian Gulf, expeditions were sent to combat the Portuguese in a number of areas. Casale argues that the Ottomans became principals in the spice trade (heirs to the earlier Egyptian Mamluk patterns). There were a lot of interesting sideshows. There was a proxy war with the Portuguese in Ethiopia, in which Portuguese aiding the Ethiopians fought against Turks in the service of Ahmed Gran, and Ottoman forces went to and some settled in areas in India, to affect local politics for some time. There were a couple of Ottoman expeditions down the Swahili coast, and Ottoman soldiers and artillery were sent to Aceh. Some of these adventures were fairly large scale: Hadim Sulieman Pasha's expedition to India (from Suez) had 10,000 soldiers and sailors and nearly seventy ships.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36TQEE0KER5IW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199874042#wasThisHelpful","R36TQEE0KER5IW","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a superb book. The writing is outstanding, the book is thoroughly researched, the photos are unusually good, and overall it offers a new perspective on Germany and Germans during the war. It's over 500 pages, and Stargardt's ideas take some time to develop, so this is not an easy read. It's another book that the ""I love it"" phrasing with 5 stars is not very helpful; this is not a topic one loves, as a great nation engages in a destructive and evil war, on a course to catastrophe.I find it not so easy to tell why I think this is a superb book, and why it stands out it a category of books that must total in the thousands (I've read scores of related books). Some of it is the wonderful way the story is told. Stargardt uses period letters and journals to follow a number of actors through this story--their story and Germany's story. The author manages to integrate large-scale events with the personal, and the result is a deeper understanding of what it was like for Germans engaged in the war than any other book I have read.  It's also the range of stories. There's a good deal of discussion of how German religious figures related to the war (mostly fatalistic patriotism, for lack of a better phrase). There are some touching stories: a soldier writing home to a deeply loved spouse is touching, even if the soldier is fighting in an evil cause. This last is an important point. Stargardt pulls no punches, and this book in no sense attempts to mitigate German atrocities--he even makes a solid case that knowledge of the atrocities (including mass murder of Jews) was rather widely known. What the book does is humanizes people caught up in a pending catastrophe not really, for the most part, of their own making.Stargardt says that when the war broke out it was deeply unpopular in Germany. There was little of the wild enthusiasm that characterized 1914. Instead it seems most often to have been a grim recognition of the necessity of responding to aggressive enemies, particularly Britain--propaganda helped create this view, but so did memory of the ""stab in the back"" and the second war was apparently widely seen as a necessary correction to reclaim German greatness. The book's analysis of all this, and of propaganda, is superb.The Nazi state was of course coercive, but Stargardt makes an excellent case that coercion was not the main element. The idea of most Germans as victims of a murderous regime, forced into a war, is an old argument that has lost its force. Germans fought willingly, for the most part, not because they were forced to. The regime was admired by some, loathed by others, but until well into 1944 there was little sense that it was an illegitimate government. Hitler was widely admired and the ideology of world Jewish conspiracy was widely shared.Here's one of the many stories contained in the greater story, one I find fascinating. Anton Brandhuber, an Austrian, got tired of fighting and decided to stop. He managed to travel west from the front, 3,000 kilometers to Switzerland and spent the rest of the war there, surviving into very old age. That is not the kind of story one expects from a terroristic police state.Some of the chapters are fascinating. Chapter 5 looks at how German soldiers sent home luxuries from France and Belgium--some plunder, some purchases, aided by clever manipulation of currency. The same chapter discusses more blatant plunder, of apartments and goods taken from Jews sent to the camps. A detail I can't quite comprehend is that it was common for soldiers to have cameras, and the rolls of film were sent home for developing. Many soldiers took photos of executions and murders, and knowledge of these would have been spread to the photo processors and people at home. There was also surprising frankness in solders' letters home, so again awareness of the conduct of the war (and the problems that soldiers experienced in Russia, such as cold, lack of equipment, savage fighting) was common--this in a state I had always thought had a rigid censorship.One chapter is especially touching. Chapter 10, ""Writing the Dead,"" includes stories of wives and family members of dead or missing soldiers continuing to ""write"" them in the form of journals and other writings. Another chapter details in an intriguing way the Katyn Forest massacre of Polish officers by the Soviets, discovered and used adroitly for propaganda purposes by the Germans (in this book, Goebbels is portrayed as a master manipulator).I could add more and more detail, but you'll have gotten the point by now. The master story is partly comprised of a number of overlapping stories of real people caught up in the larger story of Germans at war. Particularly engrossing is the last hundred pages or so, dealing with impending collapse and then catastrophe, how people managed to live with their world collapsing around them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GHZKU3ZM8AYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465018998#wasThisHelpful","R1GHZKU3ZM8AYI","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the last book by an author with a long career; Flood died before this book came out and he was in his 80s, so criticism can be more lax. This is not a good book in the sense it is well written, and the pattern really is jumping around with no real system. It is not a history so much as a sampler of the Americans who flew for France, many of who were not in fact in the famed formation--which seems to have been formed partly for public relations reasons, perhaps to popularize the war in a still-neutral USA.That said, the book is conversational in tone, like a favorite uncle telling stories. And some of the stories are wonderful, from the lion cubs bought as mascots to how a one-eyed man became an exceptional pilot. The dangers of flying those machines comes through, as does the fact that some of the Americans were educated sons of quite affluent (sometimes quite wealthy) families, what once might have been called ""playboys"" who decided that fighting for France was the honorable (or challenging?) thing to do. Some of the men who later became pilots first joined the Foreign Legion (they could that way perhaps not run foul of the American restrictions of serving in a foreign army, because Legionnaires swore allegiance  to the Legion rather than France). Of 269 Americans serving a pilots in French service, 42 were killed in combat or died of wounds, 21 died in accidents, and several from disease or suicide.There is no systematic focus. The many people's stories told in the book include some combat, some training, lots of camaraderie, social exploits, back history before the war, some later lives, some death stories and some somewhat veiled sexual escapades. In total, it does give this famed formation a human face.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EE5TN8TYWH48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802123651#wasThisHelpful","R2EE5TN8TYWH48","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent little book by a Swedish scientist, an odd book full of information, but written with many first-person sections, such as doing research in Tunisia or Nepal. His specialty is mycorrhizal aspects of fungi, especially as symbiotic with trees and plants. The science is current and the writing is very good. There are some diagrams and a number of excellent photos. Typical of the information: one gram of soil from a temperate Swedish forest can contain hundreds of meters of fungal hyphae and more than 10 billion bacteria. There's more diversity of species in a shovelful of that forest soil than the total animal and bird diversity in all tropical forests. Soil really is another world.The chapters are not numbered. They cover what a longer and boring textbook would cover: definition,  description (pore space for example, is important), life in the soil. water, nutrients, erosion and so on. It's done here well, with wit and admirably briefly. He brings in his specialty of course. Here's an example. In Tunisia an acacia species is important and can draw waiter from 40 meters underground, but has mostly been cut for animal feed and firewood. Wallander investigated what changes in the soil are occurring (each species of tree has relationships with fungi and other species so the impact is much more than the loss of a tree.One chapter considers terroir, on wine and tomatoes, that is, the impact of soil on taste; given the vast complexity of soil ingredients, for lack of a better word, this must vary considerably. Another chapter is on ""biological warfare,"" how many species produce substances that discourage or kill competitors, or may increase symbiosis. These substances sometimes have medical value, such as penicillin and cyclosporine. We have barely investigated all the possibilities, so here is a frontier of medicine worth following. Another chapter discusses life in the soil, of remarkable complexity and not fully understood. Another chapter considers soil and climate, that is, the impact of climate (temperature, rainfall and so on).There's all sorts of incidental information. European worms, for instance, are beneficial in European soils, but in Minnesota, have had quite negative impact on the soil ecosystems--admittedly it may be difficult to think of worms as invasive species.

It is extremely well-written history, concentrating on the eastern Pacific, largely from Baja California to Russian Alaska, and focused on the span from Captain Cook's voyages to the starting days of the California gold rush. He emphasizes that the Pacific is a connector not a barrier, and looks at a number of voyages of several kinds of ships--merchants, whalers, explorers, and the US Ex Ex (the United States Exploration Expedition). One theme is how the eastern Pacific becomes the American West. He uses journals and travel accounts (some published well after the actual experiences) extensively, and interweaves a number of lives to form a mosaic of connections.Chapter 1 examines the ""Sea of Commerce."" This explores many aboriginal trade systems, as well as early trade venture to the Northwest coast, the Californias and Hawai'i, linked of course to Canton. Some of this is done through the story of William Shaler (1802-1804). The number of voyages seems to be known fairly well, and between 1786 and the Gold Rush, at least 953 ships from at least 20 states (not all were nations at the time, for example Hamburg)traded on the California coast. Chapter 2 examines ""Disease, Sex and Indigenous Depopulation."" This is the best account of a widespread and unpleasant phenomenon I have read. Much of the sex trade was forced prostitution, and partly through that sexually transmitted diseases became widespread, with baleful impact on native populations everywhere. He also discusses other diseases introduced such as tuberculosis and smallpox. This web of negatives is also part of the ocean of connections.Chapter 3 is about hostages and captives, with some interesting stories about several Russian captives of Northwest tribes. Taking hostages appears to have been routine, but arbitrary and often as a means to get native people to return something allegedly stolen or to return deserting sailors. This chapter has some grimness to it as well.Chapter 4 is on ""The Great Hunt."" This describes the Russian hunt for sea otters, and more general (later mostly American) hunts for whales. fur seals and other furs. They would be sold in China. Again there are many stories, including from the journals of the wife of an American whaler captain, Mary Brewster, a total of six years at sea. By 1850 there were some 700 American whalers in the Pacific, with Hawai'i as a main port of call. The chapter is particularly disconcerting on the massacre by whalers of grey whales in the Gulf of California (although the whales killed some sailors).Chapter 5 is ""Naturalists and Natives,"" and has some fascinating stories of naturalists. In one, a German/Russian naturalist on a Russian ship became close friends of a Micronesian man, member of the crew, more or less. Igler notes that these scientists were in the service of nationalism, of patrons and of international science, but also had some baleful effects--such as publishing accounts that told where resources such as sandalwood could be found. Chapter 6 looks primarily at the US Ex Ex, and the experiences of an important American geologist.Overall, what Igler paints is a picture of exploitation, an excitement of exploration, and of reluctant accommodation on all sides. Crews tended to be complex and the mixing of people and cultures was extraordinary. It also establishes that American whalers, merchant ventures, explorers and missionaries (in Hawai'i from the 1820s) all but made the West coast officially American before the Gold Rush, even while British, Russians and Mexicans were active as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EO46AJF7MEH8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199914958#wasThisHelpful","R2EO46AJF7MEH8","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another book that makes me wish Amazon had a 5-star with something other than the phrase ""I love it."" This is a good book, but the general prognosis for the future is not very hopeful, and it's not something you love, even if you find the information to be valuable.This rather short book is another volume in an interesting series, all written in the same question/ answer format (and all slightly repetitive). I read it straight through, but a reader can choose one or two sections, because each can stand alone as a topic.There's a bit of history, which for Ukraine is complex, located at the historical intersection of Polish, Russian, and Tatar worlds. One thing the book does is discuss how the heart of Ukraine has not been Russian very long--Great Russian, the Muscovite state, so to speak. Ukraine was Polish-ruled for centuries, and the portion called Galicia was Hapsburg until the end of World War 1. This is important because the main Russian narrative is that this conflict is really an internal matter among Russians. Russian rule of all of what is now Ukraine was short, the Soviet period--and, much of what is Ukraine was part of Romania, Poland and the Czech Republic until 1945, so the ""Russian"" rule was really 1945 to the break-up of the USSR. That may seem convoluted but is a main point. It's not Russia trying to recover lost areas of Russia.The current situation stems from a popular sort of revolution that ousted a pro-Russian president. Putin's Russia did not like that situation and the conflict has ensued. A large chunk of Ukraine in the east has a substantial and in some areas majority of Russians, although this gets complicated. There are many Ukrainians whose mother tongue is Russian, so Russian-speaking does not equate with being Russian. The matter of the Crimea is somewhat different; historically Russian (since it was conquered and the Tatars subdued) and given to Ukraine by the Soviet government. The existing Tatar minority apparently faces discrimination whoever runs the place. The author discusses how many, perhaps most Russians see the downfall of the Soviet Union as a disaster, and many are livid that former satellites are joining NATO. There's also the matter that Russian Orthodoxy (church, that is) is newly militant and than historically Ukrainians are Uniates, sometimes called Ukrainian Catholic (Orthodox but accepting the Roman Catholic pope's authority in some matters). So, the conflict has a toxic brew of nationalism, resentment and militancy on the Russian side. Russia's military forces are recovering and are now again formidable and above all, for Ukraine, close. That means that Ukraine may suffer more, perhaps being split into two parts with the east being annexed to Russia. Those areas, conveniently for the Russians, have quite valuable resources.The author pulls no punches. He's strongly anti-Russian but also caustic about corruption in Ukraine itself. Whether a young democratic movement can emerge or whether corrupt oligarchs recover control is not yet clear. Nor is the Russian intent. To paraphrase a Mexican bromide, poor Ukraine, so far from Washington and so close to Moscow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35LTNY8X9RUW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0190237287#wasThisHelpful","R35LTNY8X9RUW9","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not really a history of an epic battle. Rather, it is a history of the memory of the battle over the century since it took place, and compares the differing importance in differing countries whose soldiers fought there. It's minor in Ireland, because there is nothing to celebrate about an English defeat. It's minor in French memory because the French focus on the Western front. Although not covered, it seems to mean little in India (some of the ""British"" were soldiers from India). It's celebrated in Turkey both for the victory and because the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal, was an important commander in the battle, and it's most important in Australia and slightly less so in New Zealand. The book considers the meaning of the battle; clearly ANZAC ( Australia-New Zealand Army Corps) Day predominates in the importance and intensity of observance.The intensity of observation is also important. Macleod discusses how the meaning of the day has changed over the years. One obvious change is that as veterans died, the celebration shifted from personal memory to the more abstract.  She observes that military history is bound up in national stories. Irish soldiers at Gallipoli were part of another country's story (the civil war following World War 1 has something to do with that). The soldiers on both sides were multicultural. There was a 500 man Zion Mule Corps (Jewish). There were Ghurkas, soldiers from Ceylon. The French contingent included Foreign Legion troops, French, and Africans from French colonies. The British soldiers included Newfoundlanders from Canada. The Turkish troops included an Arab regiment, and some Jewish, Armenian, Kurdish and other soldiers.The book begins with an excellent summary of the battle before it starts discussion of the meaning of the battle in different nations. The discussion of the several national memories of the battle could strike some reader as tedious because it includes local politics, most intense in Australia. Australia's memory of the battle is tied up in some complicated understandings of what it means to be Australian. And says the author, Gallipoli is a pivotal moment in Australian nationalism but in New Zealand it is remembered more as sacrifice for England. I liked the overall discussion of national stories and memory. I'm not sure it fits, really, the concept of a Great Battle series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JVGRVJL0FQQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019964487X#wasThisHelpful","R2JVGRVJL0FQQ9","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is notable for very many photographs (the authors seem to be affiliated with the Cornell Ornithology lab). The photos range from there merely good to superb. For those alone the book is worth its price. The text is mostly captions on the photos and some connective text. It's a fast read, but the photos are worth looking through again.It's essentially a look at the family life of 50 species of common American birds, such as the Blue jay, the American crow and others. The photos cover courtship and mating, nest building, egg laying and hatching, and fledging of young. There are some wonderful photos of fledglings, obviously my favorites.There are some intriguing tidbits in the text. Rock doves (commonly called ""pigeons"") have been known to live 30 years. American crows bond for life and the young from a previous year may become helpers with the latest nestlings. And a how-the-hell-do-they-survive thing: In 1996 in Tower, Minnesota, the lowest temperature ever recorded in the state was noted, minus 60 degrees F. Black-capped chickadees, which weigh a third of an ounce, survived nicely. And Red-breasted nuthatches use tools--bits of bark, to spread resin (obtained from conifers) around the entrance to their nests.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDTTQFIVUV951/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612122299#wasThisHelpful","RDTTQFIVUV951","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fairly short, nicely-illustrated and well written book. It is agnostic as to whether there are or are not such things. The chapters are fairly wide-ranging and consider a good range of culture, mostly in the sense of the kinds of conceptions of ghosts that people have come up with in folk tales, stories and religions. One detail I can't get over--apparently Thomas Edison thought there were ghosts and tried to devise a machine to communicate with them. Not much detail is provided on this, but there's an idea for a film.It starts with a discussion of ghosts in the classical era of Greece and Rome and their worlds, and while it's a bit rambly, the intro chapters are full of information, and particularly rich on the movement called Spiritualism. One illustration shows a real estate disclosure form, which asks the usual questions about are you aware of a death or violent crime on the property, but includes ""or allegations that it is haunted."" I suppose that might affect home value (there's another film idea, someone who plays the market by fabricating hauntings, to get caught by a real one).My favorite chapters are these. Chapter 4 ""The Hungry Ghosts: the Eastern World"" discusses ghosts in Asia, mostly China and Japan, and includes legends but also contemporary film. I like the idea of ghost money, fake high-denomination bills burned so that family ghosts in the netherworld can buy some comforts. Chapter 5, ""La Llorena and Dreamtime"" discuss ghosts in Latin America and Australia. Chapter 6, ""The Quest for Evidence"" doesn't provide much in proof or disproof, but does describe what seems to be a thriving phenomenon of people who consider themselves some form of ghost busters, with lots of equipment available online, including lasers, thermal cameras, appropriate aps for smart phones and so on.Other chapters are still interesting. Morton discusses short stories, novels, and film, including both the obvious ones and some less well known.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O1U4WZPLB1P7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780235178#wasThisHelpful","R3O1U4WZPLB1P7","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an intriguing book that really intermixes two different but related stories. One is told very well and one is less absorbing (unless you are a real fan of paleontology). Thewissen is a good writer with wit and a talent for storytelling. The best part of the book is Thewissen describing his field experience in Pakistan and India; this is doing science in the field, and is vivid and in an odd way, fun.The other story is the aspect of doing science by slowly piecing together the fossil evidence and interpreting that evidence. The science story in this book is finding some of the ""missing links"" between land creatures and whales, and establishing a transition phase. This has a subtext in providing evidence that whales did in fact evolve from land animals, therefore providing evidence in support of evolution and ammunition for Darwin's defenders. There are several illustrations of what some of these creatures may have looked like--interesting creatures. This part I personally found to be somewhat tedious. The interpretation of fossilized bones from the ear and aspects of skulls and teeth really is very important in understanding past life, but not compelling for the non-enthusiast. I also understand that these fossils are important. but I thing the book could have better told me just why that is the case.I think Thewissen should write another book, concentrating on his experiences in the field. He does that exceptionally well in much of this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12HTGIFCPKNIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0520277066#wasThisHelpful","R12HTGIFCPKNIO","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a remarkable look at North Korea. The overall theme is that the regime is still in charge, but it has had to tacitly allow a shakily vibrant brand of free market activity in order to survive. The details this book provides show a level of complexity associated with the word ""byzantine"" (the book does not use the word). The official exchange rate is wildly volatile, and bureaucrats make the dollar equivalent of maybe $1- $2 a week, so corruption is massive, otherwise the country would not be able to feed itself. Apparently if it doesn't challenge the regime in any way, the regime turns a blind eye to the activity. Bribes and knowing important people become a form of insurance, and there are sharp differences in urban-rural ability to skirt the laws. The long Chapter 2 in the book details this in absolutely amazing detail. Rather than the faceless and helpless victims of brutal ideology, North Koreans show remarkable creativity and ingenuity,  in a sense giving the lie to some anti-North Korean propaganda stereotypes.The book describes a number of current phenomena, including the creation of a cell phone network by the government, but the phones can also used to access Chinese cell phone systems if the user is near the Chinese border, with major consequences for the economy. The regime is still arbitrary on culture and now and them has rounds of arrests, but a sizable fraction of the people have access to Chinese and South Korean radio and tv (the TVs and radios for sale are supposed to be preset for approved domestic media but this apparently can easily be corrected). In particular ""USB sticks"" as the authors describe them allow access to recorded South Korean tv shows and movies from the US and elsewhere. As for the fashion described in the book's title, there are still quite strict rules against much fashion but often ignored particularly in the capital city. All of this blends together to quietly reshape the country's culture.This is important stuff, not just the story of  people managing to survive with at least a little luxury. The vaunted North Korean army, say the authors, is poorly trained, poorly equipped, poorly led and poorly fed. Consequently there is not the slightest chance they will give up nuclear weapons, it's the only deterrence left. That, and small numbers of special forces. The army is used often as a free construction force for various projects.Just as seriously, the Kim Jong Un described in this book is not the merciless Stalinist dictator of propaganda, he's very powerful but not in total control; in some ways he is a figurehead of a collective leadership made up of family, powerful officials, powerful military and some others. One short chapter describes crime and punishment--North Korea has what are essentially regular jails for regular criminals as well as other systems. This includes quite brutal camps, the extreme of which will work prisoners to death. The system is arbitrary but does not amount to a Korean gulag in the sense that sustained propaganda has led many to believe. There is a sort of collective guilt premise, so that if one person displeases the regime, family and friends and neighbors may be affected. There also seems to be an assumption that family reliability is deeper than just the living; if grandfather was a problem for the regime, the grandchildren may have opportunity for success substantially reduced.A main premise of the book is that the severe famine of 1994-1998 was a kind of tipping point, in which somewhere between hundreds of thousands and several millions of people died of starvation. Their point is that in order to survive, the regime had to adjust, loosen the chains and rein in the ideology, with the practical results the book surveys. They conclude that most people in North Korea do support the regime and that all the changes actually have made it somewhat stronger, so the idea that the state may collapse is likely an error.There's a fairly large section of photos. These show what seem to be confident and fairly happy people, but there also some that seem to show a truer version of the countryside. Readers can make their own decision as to what these show. Overall the book rings true.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H478MB88O75M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804844585#wasThisHelpful","R3H478MB88O75M","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hannnigan explains in his introduction that he set out to write the kind of general history he wishes had been available when he first traveled in Indonesia. That's exactly what he has done. This is one of the best histories of any place in Asia that I have read. The writing is clear, objective (he does seem slightly biased against the Dutch), informative and provides a solid framework for future reading (something else he set out to do, as he explains in an unusually lively introduction). The section of plates is rather good and they have outstanding captions, not something one ordinarily notes. The maps are helpful.Hannigan covers a huge amount of history, but much of the focus, and the best writing in the book, is on Indonesia from about 1900 on, and is especially good for the independence struggle, the Sukarno and the Suharto years. Not so many Americans are aware that this is a huge country, 3,274 miles from east to west and with 250 million people, or that it is the largest predominately Muslim country (in population).The book uses the term Indonesia only after the Dutch began their domination, a process that lasted into the 1900s; instead he uses the term Archipelago, which may be a better term for the wide range of cultures. I found his account of the ethnic origins fascinating--Austronesian, moving from Taiwan, on through the island arcs, and eventually including Madagascar in the west and New Zealand in the east, from about 6,000 years ago.Some of the peoples, especially in New Guinea, have been there far longer, some tens of thousands of years. Hannigan brings in accounts of visitors, including ibn Battuta in the 1300s and Tome Pires in the 1500s. The first couple of chapters describe the influences from India and the variety of political entities.The third chapter, ""Saints and Wanderers,"" is an account of the coming of Islam, and it is a fascinating account. Chapter 4, ""The Spice Islands"" is superb, although many readers will be familiar with much of the information. Chapter 5, ""The Clash of Civilizations"" describes Dutch expansion, the brief but important British period (when the Netherlands was a puppet of Napoleon) and some of the resistance, such as that by Imam Bajid and Diponegoro. Chapter 6, ""Rust en Orde,"" is largely focused on the expansion of Dutch control and the infamous ""Culture System"" imposed on many parts of Indonesia. It includes an interesting discussion of the British scientist Alfred Russel Wallace, and the conquest of fervently Muslim Aceh.Chapter 7, ""Brave New World,"" starts the 20th century, the rise of nationalism and while centered on Sukarno, it's informative about the general sense of what might be described as Indonesian-ness. This sets up Chapter 8, ""Freedom or Death,"" including the Japanese conquest and occupation, and the struggle for independence. This is the best overall account I have read about either the occupation or the independence movement.Chapter 9, ""The Year of Living Dangerously,"" is about the consolidation of the Indonesia state and especially about Sukarno. The title is from a Sukarno speech, in which he used this phrase taken from a speech by Mussolini. This chapter discussed the massive violence in 1965 and 1966 against the communists and ethnic Chinese, in which somewhere around a half million people were murdered (it may have been much higher). This is also the best account I have ever read on this gory era. Chapter 10, ""A New Order,"" discusses the long Suharto era, rising prosperity, near collapse and recovery. Chapter 11, ""Indonesia Rising,"" covers the recent years, and is quite optimistic about the future of the country.Hannigan obviously really likes Indonesia and its people, but the book does not show much bias. He is objective about the mistakes of Sukarno and Suharto, including corruption, the orchestrated killings in 1965, the business in Timor and the difficulties in western New Guinea. The book perhaps necessarily focuses on Java and Sumatra, with not so much about Borneo or outer islands. There is a good deal about Bali.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHDH0A8QNVTUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804844763#wasThisHelpful","RHDH0A8QNVTUY","A3NE9SMVHW37UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NE9SMVHW37UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Joseph LeDoux makes it clear that Anxious is not intended to be a textbook, but in my opinion, it reads like a textbook. I don't mean this as a criticism, because I actually enjoy reading psychology textbooks. This book addresses history, philosophy, animal research, human research, and practice. It contains 130 pages of endnotes plus bibliography. It reads like a dissertation written by an extraordinarily thorough and conscientious author.Unfortunately, I can't recommend this book, either to the general public or to professionals. I think it tries to cover too much territory, and in too much detail.

After reading The Seven Good Years, I am now so in awe of this author that I can not find the words to adequately describe his writing.

"I really like this shampoo. I seek out shampoos without chemicals, and this line of shampoos gets a very good score on Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep database which rates beauty products based on the safety of the ingredients. The fact that it is organic makes it even better. And while I prefer unscented products, the strong pina colada scent is reminiscent of both the drink and of certain suntan lotions, so I enjoy the associations, if not the actual smell.Regardless of the safety of the ingredients and the smell, ultimately a good shampoo has to do a good job of cleaning hair and leaving it soft and manageable. I am very pleased with the results of using Natures Baby Organics Shampoo. I usually have to use a lot of conditioner in order to be able to get a comb through my hair, but this shampoo left my hair relatively untangled, so I was able to use less conditioner. My hair also felt very clean.I deducted one star for the high price, but I did notice that I could use a relatively small amount, so the ultimate cost per shampoo might not end up being too high. If cost is not a major factor, pineapple and coconut smells are not offensive to you, and safety and effectiveness are important, this shampoo is worth a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZC72ULKMHLXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2IN9GA#wasThisHelpful","RZC72ULKMHLXW","A3IXY05D6TVQVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IXY05D6TVQVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an attractive cover for a shower curtain, but it requires a waterproof liner, which must be purchased separately, to serve as an actual shower curtain. When it arrived, it had a bit of a synthetic odor, and I had to air it out for a few days before it was odor-free. I also noticed that the bottom is not finished. It is just cut, which gives it a bit of a raw look. As many others have mentioned, it can be easily shredded by cat claws, and is probably best in residences without cats.

"This book contains a collection of very short essays on various aspects of relationships under the headings Dating, Commitment, Breakups, Weddings, and Making it Last. Many of the couples described are people interviewed by the author as part of her job as a wedding reporter for the Washington Post, although she also interviews couples who have been together for many years. In addition to telling stories about a variety of couples, the author shares advice she gleaned from a small assortment of academic researchers who provide information on the factors that contribute to marital satisfaction and longevity. Finally, the author weaves in some of her own story, which doesn't really add much to the book, but which also isn't much of a distraction. Ellen McCarthy is a good writer, and the book is an easy read.I have been a couples therapist for many years, and I was evaluating this book to determine whether it provides useful information about how to choose a good partner and how to be a good partner. I think this book includes enough good advice to be worth recommending to women under 35 or so. I specify women because it seems to be directed to women, which makes sense because men seldom read books like this. I specify younger women because this book doesn't address most of the issues that middle-aged and older people have to deal with, and I think it might seem simplistic to some readers. It is imbued with the optimism, and perhaps some of the naivete, of a young, happily married woman. There is a lot of advice about choosing a partner, planning a wedding, dealing with disappointments, and making a marriage work. There is very little advice on breaking up (mostly just sympathy and encouragement), and almost nothing on divorce other than advice about how and why to avoid it. This is where the deficiencies of the book became clear to me. While I agree with all of the advice about how to make a marriage good, I disagree with her position that staying in a marriage is almost always preferable to ending it. She urges partners to lower expectations and ""Accept As Is (Unless 'As Is' includes abuse or addiction.)""  But it's seldom that simple. Lowering expectations is helpful, to be sure, but I think most people would agree that abuse and addiction are not the only justifications for divorce.Despite the limitations of this book, I enjoyed reading it, and I think it offers some good suggestions for ways to make a marriage better. I plan to buy a copy for a newlywed in her 20s who I think will find it engaging and enlightening.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUL06BG8AVFSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345549694#wasThisHelpful","RUL06BG8AVFSE","A3IXY05D6TVQVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IXY05D6TVQVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I deeply appreciate the willingness of Henry Marsh to share his experiences as a neurosurgeon. While it is clear that neurosurgeons have to be extremely self-confident in order to do their work, it is the modesty of the author that makes this book so valuable. While he describes many complicated, and usually successful, surgeries, he is also willing to write about his failures, and his feelings about his failures. Woven throughout the book are descriptions of his frustrations with the British health care system in which he works. This provides a context that makes the accomplishments of doctors, and the endurance of patients, poignant as well as impressive. His writing style is modest, straightforward, and imbued with a gentle humor that makes the book very enjoyable to read, even when he is describing the details of removing a brain tumor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A0J1QSS23NDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125006581X#wasThisHelpful","R2A0J1QSS23NDP","A3IXY05D6TVQVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IXY05D6TVQVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is magic in Kent Haruf's writing. I can't figure out how his spare style manages to be so deeply engaging and full of depth. I have not yet read his other books, but after reading this novella I am eager to read the previous works by this gifted author. Since the simple plot has already been described by other reviewers, I will not include a description other than to say that it is about an unconventional relationship between a widow and a widower who are neighbors. The book is full of many seemingly ordinary but compelling moments, as well as some interesting surprises. It is a small masterpiece.

"He had me at the preface. Here is the first paragraph (from the advanced reader's edition):""A Sea change is beginning to occur in the mental health system. An international movement to break down the boundaries among the different schools of psychotherapy to find common denominators is occurring. These common denominators are brain based. The new integrative model subsumes the relevant contributions of the past and discards the purely theory driven cul-de-sacs based only on the tight confines of a particular school.""Here is the close of the first section of the preface:""This book attempts to normalize psychological disorders and their resolution so that you can explain and make more tangible recommendations to your clients. We must leave behind those countertrends that pathologize normal human reactions to life stressors.""I do not know the author, and I have nothing to gain from this recommendation, but I think this book should be required reading for all therapists, from novices to experts. While it claims to focus on helping clients overcome resistance, I don't really see that as the focus, since a client doesn't have to be resistant to benefit from the interventions offered in the book. Unlike traditional therapy training, which usually focuses on a specific approach (psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, etc.), these interventions are based on neurobiological discoveries about the brain that were unknown when most of the popular psychological approaches were developed. Parts of the book are highly technical, with lots of scientific information about brain functioning, but this scientific information is accompanied by simple suggestions for interventions that can be easily explained to therapy clients. The book is peppered with little boxes labeled ""Neuroscience"" and ""Client Education,"" so it is easy for the reader to quickly hone in on one or the other, although I found both very interesting. The text outside the boxes is a refreshing deviation from typical therapy texts because the author is not selling any particular approach. He is simply offering suggestions for explaining to clients the logic underlying change-oriented therapeutic interventions, based on what is known about how the brain works. This book should be valuable to any therapist, regardless of theoretical orientation, who respects science.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R193U2LJL0GYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118756886#wasThisHelpful","R193U2LJL0GYM","A3IXY05D6TVQVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IXY05D6TVQVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a fan of historical fiction, but I am a huge fan of Elizabeth Berg's previous novels, so I couldn't resist reading her latest work. Like some other readers, I enjoyed the earlier part of the book more than the later part. I think Berg did an excellent job of portraying Sands' childhood, and I found many of the descriptions quite evocative. Reading about her life in the French countryside, I was reminded of how I felt watching the early seasons of Downton Abbey. I got a vivid sense of a life very different from anything we know now, and I felt almost transported to that time. I also really cared about the characters and I found them all interesting. As the book progressed, however, I found myself becoming detached in a way not unlike how I felt about the later seasons of Downton Abbey, when the plot had to change to accommodate the reality of various cast members deciding to leave the show. I found myself becoming less involved with the characters, and more aware that there was a writer pulling the strings. I felt the quality of the writing deteriorated. With the exception of Sands' one relationship with a woman, her affairs seemed boring and repetitive, and the writing about these relationships was much less compelling. Perhaps it was an accurate portrayal of Sands' lack of growth and insight, and her unconscious repetition of old patterns, or perhaps she just didn't prefer being with men. If either was true, maybe it was harder to write about these relationships in an emotionally gripping manner. Since I don't know what is historically accurate and what is the product of Berg's imagination, I don't have any insight into the reasons for this change in tone. For all I know, it might have been a book deadline. All I can say is that the latter part of the book did not engage me as much as the earlier part. I might have stopped reading, but I kept looking forward to the introduction of Frederick Chopin. I was ultimately disappointed at how little of the book was devoted to that relationship, but perhaps he just wasn't as major a figure in her life as I thought he was. Since this is historical fiction, there is no way to know what is factual without doing some research. But as a result of reading this book, I am left with no interest in George Sand.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T820XGENHOGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812993152#wasThisHelpful","R3T820XGENHOGN","A3IXY05D6TVQVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IXY05D6TVQVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's hard to rate this first aid kit because I got it for free, and there is currently no price information available on Amazon.

"In my opinion, the key to essentialism is knowing your core values and goals, and then pruning away everything that does not support what is most important to you. This allows you to focus your efforts on what matters most. While this book does a good job of preaching essentialism, it is not a good example of putting this practice to use. It could benefit from better editing and organization. It reads more like a collection of blog posts than a coherent, well-organized articulation of essentialism in theory and practice.That said, the brief chapters, seemingly designed for the busy business reader, offer good examples of how to reduce wasted time and effort. There are lots of good suggestions about how to narrow your focus and devote your efforts to top work priorities. There is also occasional mention of considering priorities other than maximizing work success, although work is clearly the primary focus of the book.I don't think this book has much to offer to people who already grasp the basic concept of focusing on what's important and eliminating the distractions. It also isn't the ideal book for people who have priorities that trump (no pun intended) business success. But for readers who want to maximize their productivity, and who are distracted by external forces, this book might inspire a useful shift of focus.Note: I recommended this book to one of my clients, a young woman who wants to succeed in business. She found it extremely helpful, and she told me she has recommended it to friends.

I have not yet been to Rome, so I can't evaluate the accuracy, but it seems like a good book to carry around while touring the city. In comparing it with other popular Rome guidebooks, I would say it falls between the Eyewitness Guides and the Rick Steves guides. It is less beautiful than the Eyewitness Guide, but, if my other Eyewitness books are any indication, it is much lighter, which is a plus when carrying it around all day. It is much more beautiful than the Rick Steves guide, but it does not have nearly as much practical information. (I would never visit anywhere in Europe with my trusty Rick Steves tour book.) This book includes a small assortment of ""insider tips,"" and ""off the beaten path"" excursions, but most of what I read seems pretty conventional, which is fine for someone who has not yet seen the major sights. There is a subway map inside the back cover, and a street map inside the front one. Both covers have flaps for marking a place in the book.

"I've been putting off spending the money on a battery backup UPS for quite some time. I have a rack with 3 servers running my home and small business network. My web hosting is provided by a 3rd party so my servers aren't mission critical and I didn't want to dump $350+ on a battery backup.This spring we've been having power issues (bad for computers obviously) and I took the dive to protect my hardware.I rack mounted this heavy UPS in under 10 minutes and got things switched over. It has 2 battery packs, each supporting 4 outlets on the back of the unit. Distribute your devices across the outlets so not all are on one side.Con: I connected the UPS to my server, originally using the included serial cable. My Windows Server 2012 R2 system did not detect the battery backup. I did not troubleshoot further. May have been driver related. Nothing was seen in Device Manager.Pro: When connected via included USB cable the system recognized the UPS immediately. No installation issues.Con: There is only 1 USB port. To the best of my knowledge (maybe over the network?) there is no way to shut down multiple servers connected to the one UPS. Maybe best practice is one UPS per server? There is no network connectivity for the UPS so if there is a network shutdown it's got to be done some other way.Pro: The software is now Windows Server 2012 certified and has been working without issue. There are tons of options, few of which I've tinkered with so far.Con: Runtime is 8min with 3 servers connected. Power draw is a total of 280 watts from the 3 servers.Pro: Run time is a whole 8 min! Not bad if you're dealing with short power outages or just waiting for a standby generator to kick in.Con: This isn't true sinewave power. I doubt that the simulated sinewave does much for you.Pro: Costs a lot less than a sinewave supply!Con: costs more than a desktop UPS.Pro: It can be rackmounted OR used on the desk. The desk brackets are very sturdy. Everything that came in the box is quality. It all feels heavy duty and was packaged very well.Summary: For my non-mission critical (and probably for most people's mission critical) needs this is an excellent value. It's affordable and a quality product. It doesn't have every bells or whistle, but it's got most of them. There may still be some hiccups in the software, but at least the software is new and up to date with current operating systems like Server 2012. I'm a big fan of knowing my server hardware is now safe (as it should have been years ago if it weren't for my stinginess).Doug BuchanBuchan Consulting LLCIT Consultant","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E6EHVLVL2ZS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDODQYS#wasThisHelpful","R2E6EHVLVL2ZS7","A28O0F8ZN06NL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28O0F8ZN06NL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I spent a lot of time debating whether or not to invest in Tstak vs Toughbox vs none of the above. When I went about upgrading my DeWalt line to the 20V MAX line of tools I purposely bought the full kits. Not only because I needed the batteries but I wanted the hard kit boxes that come with them. I figured I wanted protection for my tools so every one should have a kit box.As I accumulated more and more tools I realized I was making 4 or 5 trips out to the car every time I needed to load up for a job. This got old quick (5 trips from house to car, 5 trips to unload at job, 5 trips to re-load, 5 trips to unload at house). So I started looking at Tstak and Toughbox systems from DeWalt. I liked my kit boxes because I could grab JUST my drill or JUST my saw and head out the door. The Toughbox system seems large and cumbersome to use. The wide dolly would have its advantages but I thought the bulk of it in my Honda CR-V would not be a great plan. I also discovered that DeWalt is releasing a Tstak Dolly the first quarter of 2014. So I figured I have upgrade potential in the future if I want a dolly.SO I PICKED Tstak. I love it. The base is sturdy with no wobble in the wheels. It's not meant for job sites outdoors in the dirt or mud. So know that ahead of time. But I can roll it over paved terrain or indoors smooth and silent. It's easy to stack boxes on and to move around as well as detach for the car.The DeWalt Tstak system has been excellent for consolidating my tools into kits, putting the accessories with the tools, and getting them from A to B and back again with far less hassle.Strong work DeWalt.Doug BuchanBuchan Consulting LLC","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWHMI3OYJ8YW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBY2I6M#wasThisHelpful","RWHMI3OYJ8YW5","A28O0F8ZN06NL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28O0F8ZN06NL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm loving my DeWalt 20V MAX Oscillating Multi-Tool. It's a great tool with awesome accessories! I bought two packs of this sandpaper for drywall and wood sanding.The sandpaper work GREAT on flat surfaces. That's probably 90% of the use cases for most jobs.My only complaint, and it's a cross-complaint between the sandpaper and the hook & loop pad they attach to, is that on rounded surfaces the edges wear down very quickly and damage the pad. So I was sanding a hole in a wood board to smooth the inside edges of the hole. As I sanded around the inside of the hole, which of course forces you to sand on an angle, the side of the sandpaper really wore down fast because that was the only part in contact with the wood. What I didn't realize until it was too late was that I was also ruining the hook & loop attachment pad as well as the sand paper.So while I shouldn't expect a product to do something that it probably shouldn't do, like sand un-even surfaces, I'm still docking 1 star for it.

"I became a vendor for Ooma Office when the system was first revealed. Theoretically it sounded great. Heck, their old pricing structure was certainly affordable. But from the time I got my Ooma (which yes, even as a vendor I had to pay for), things went downhill fast.Pros:-Costs less than some VOIP /IP /POE phones.-Allows you to use your existing ""normal"" non-IP phones.-Yup, that's about it.Cons:- Changed their pricing structure within months of launch. It WAS $19.99/mo per phone line. Extensions were free. So for my small business I wanted 3 or 4 extensions but only needed 2 phone lines. That's pretty affordable. NOT ANYMORE. Now it's $9.99/mo per phone line AND per extension. Want 1 phone line and 4 extensions? That'll be $50/mo for 1 phone line. That is NOT affordable anymore considering the very limited features offered.-While I could afford that $50/mo if I wanted to, I don't want to because the system simply doesn't work. My auto-attendant stops answering calls after roughly 20 hours. I have to unplug and reset the device to have it work again.-I've called support and opened multiple tickets regarding the above issue. I was assured a call-back and follow-ups and have received none despite my persistence. So I have a no-longer-affordable phone system with limited features that simply doesn't work.-There is no way to call out on your mobile phone. This was never advertised to be part of the system, but it's a HUGE glaring flaw. Almost every other service from RingCentral, Nextiva, Microsoft Lync, etc allows you to call out from your mobile using your business phone number. Anytime I get a call on my mobile (forwarded from Ooma) that I would have to call back, I have to call it from my cell #.-There is no support for 800 numbers-There is no integration with any other service, like Outlook.-Call quality (at least for me) is poor. It pops a lot and people tell me they have a hard time hearing me. I have 15/mb download and 3mb upload internet. I'm the only user. It's not that the internet speed is being taxed, it's got plenty of bandwidth for 1 phone line.I could go on, but I think I've made my point. The system costs nearly as much as the competition now but offers 1/3 or 1/4 of the features. Even with only 1/4 of the features, the glaring issue is that they don't work! On top of that, there is literally no support.At this point I will not be recommending the system or selling the system to my small business clients. Steer clear and invest in something better.-----------------------------UPDATE 2/7/14-------------------------------------------Roy Calvo, the Ooma Director of Customer Operations, made a personal phone call to me the day after my initial review went live on Amazon. He was very concerned with my impression of Ooma and wanted to provide some updates and also gather more feedback from me.First, the major issue I'd had with Ooma from the start was with the Virtual Receptionist not answering calls. I reached out to Ooma numerous times regarding the issue and never heard back. For this, Roy apologized and took full responsibility. He said my tickets had been updated numerous times by higher tiered support but that nobody took the time to reach out and notify me that they were working on the issue. Roy said that they would be reviewing my Amazon Review in Monday's management meeting and implementing changes to assure customers weren't left in the dark. Resolution Pending.Second, my other major complaint was the ""Bait and Switch"" Ooma pulled with their pricing structure for those that purchased the system under their old model. Roy told me that they had a policy in place to honor the old pricing structure for those that signed up under the old model. I had, however, called support and complained about the new model over a month ago and was told that there was nothing they could do. I asked to speak to a manager and was told that one would call me back and they never did. Roy said he was extremely disappointed to hear this and that he would find out why the customer support representatives were unaware that customers were to be given the old pricing model if they signed up with Ooma Office at that time. He asked me to add the extensions (which were Free under the old model) that I wanted and that the billing would be taken care of on their end. Roy explained the reasoning beyond the change in pricing (Both easier to explain and cheaper for MOST businesses). Problem Solved.Third, Roy said they are re/building the mobile application from the ground up. They want to re-do their app for the residential sector first then modify it for the business sector clients. They brought their developers in-house and are making strides for a smoother, better, experience on the app. One of my complaints here was that this was a feature promised to come shortly after launch. Six months later, on the phone with technical support, I asked about the progress of this app. The technician indicated he knew nothing of it and to ""follow the blog for regular updates."" This worried me, as I assumed a support tech should have some knowledge of ongoing projects and maybe even timelines. Roy said he was surprised by this as well and would ensure that techs, especially at higher levels, were more regularly informed of updates at the develop. Resolution pending.Last: 800 Numbers are coming down the road. No plans to integrate with Outlook are in the pipes. Neither are there plans for Business SMS messages.I've raised my review from 1 to 3 stars. I'll wait to see if there is a resolution to the Virtual Receptionist issue and the Mobile App before deciding once and for all what I will tell others about Ooma. For now, I will still not be selling the system to my small business customers. It has potential but also glaring kinks and service issues that need to be addressed. I am EXTREMELY impressed by the customer service that was exhibited over the last 48 hours from a senior member of their management team. As Roy pointed out, Ooma is a small company (in the big scheme of things) and relies on word of mouth. I'm a firm believer in word-of-mouth as I rely heavily on it myself. I'll see if Ooma can resolve issues and maintain open and regular communication in the long-run before deciding to put my business reputation on the line by selling the system to others.---------------------UPDATE 6/30/14-----------------------------I never heard back from Roy or Ooma about the auto attendant issue I had been experiencing. My business has been growing and I find myself needing to make mobile calls more and more. I went looking for a phone service that offered me a mobile app that I could use to place calls while on the go. I have not used Ooma office in almost 4 months now. I am still paying them their monthly fee because I haven't finished transferring some of my Auto-Attendant recording from their service yet. So I really need to get on that.Anyway, there's no progress posted on their Blog about a mobile app. There's really no new features at all that I can see in the past 4 months. I haven't heard from support. It's about time to call it a day on this service.Doug BuchanBuchan Consulting LLC","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R387R5IM1HW0WI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5GDLLA#wasThisHelpful","R387R5IM1HW0WI","A28O0F8ZN06NL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28O0F8ZN06NL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So our dishwasher was making a loud grinding noise and it had been getting louder over a few week period of time. I usually pay no mind to the dishwasher and assume they need little to no maintenance. I failed.To try to get the dishwasher to run quieter I began to dis-assemble it. I found that the drain unit at the bottom was caked in dried dishwasher detergent. I had no idea that the powder dishwasher detergent could do that? After talking to the dishwasher repair folks at our local appliance store we found out that the powder dish soaps that most people use are the #1 cause of dishwasher failure.We've since switched to the Finish brand packets. These were recommended.In addition, the Dishwasher Magic cleaners were recommended. What a difference on the inside of the machine! The machine smelled great, ran quieter, and cleaned cleaner. There is no way one of these bottles would get rid of all the caked on soap (the required manual labor) but it did get rid of residue, stains, and caked on food.The suggestion was to run one of these per month.

"I've been adding to my DeWalt 20V MAX line of tools over the past year, and sometime this summer, I added this to my lineup and I love it!This tool is merely 5.5"" long and fits in tight spaces.It's brushless and runs forever!It's got 3 speeds so it won't tear up your delicate materials. Or it can tear right through the screws driving them as fast as anything I've seen.It's lightweight and well balanced.I've added a belt clip and it's light enough that it hangs on the belt with ease.The lights on it are bright and really do a great job of lighting the work area. They're not just a gimmick.Cons:There's no way to turn off the impact function, so it self-triggers, sometimes when it's not needed.The recessed chuck is nice 95% of the time. One time I added one of those short 1/2"" philips head bits to try to fight the thing into a small space. Well, the bit didn't have enough weight to fall out on it's own. I had to pull it (easily done) with pliers. But how often would anyone really use a 1/2"" bit in this drill? More likely we'll all be using the 1"" or longer bits.Overall, this tool is outstanding and it's now my favorite when it comes to driving and fastening. It doesn't replace a hammer drill but it's certainly a good replacement for a plan old screwdriver.

"I've been picking up all of my 20V MAX DeWalt tools over the past year and trying them all out. This past summer (2013) I picked up the DEWALT DCD985L2 20-Volt MAX Li-Ion Premium 3.0 Ah Hammerdrill/Driver Kit and have been using it since. Then I grabbed the DCF985 brushless impact driver and I love it. So when I saw DeWalt was releasing the DCD995 brushless hammer drill I had to snag it.So here's the deal with this. It's smaller than the DCD985 hammer drill which is OK by me. The 985 was a bit bulky and hard to fit in tight spaces. This guy isn't a whole lot better, but I think they managed to shave roughly an inch off by adding an electronic clutch. The tool is 7.9"" long. Not bad!In addition to being brushless, which in itself adds 58% to the battery life, the DCD995M2 only comes with 4.0ah batteries; no more 3.0ah batteries. That's a good thing as it provides far more run time (technically an hour, but seems like more). So between the brushless motor and the 4.0 ah batteries, of which there are 2 in this kit, this drill runs forever! This drill, like the 985, has a 3 speed switch which allows you to adjust speed to what you're doing. Drilling vs fastening etc are better suited to specific speeds. The switch works well and feels nice.I don't like, however, that they removed the 3 position (Drill, Fasten, Hammer) selector ring that was on the 985. Now those 3 modes are part of the torque selector ring. It's not the end of the world, but it was nice to have the mode selection separate from the torque ring.Overall, it's a solid tool, runs forever, and is an awesome addition to the DeWalt 20V MAX brushless line of XR tools.I'll be using this on all of my home theater and networking installs.Doug Buchan[...]","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TXQBV96ZKOPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FWLC9DI#wasThisHelpful","R1TXQBV96ZKOPL","A28O0F8ZN06NL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28O0F8ZN06NL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the new Logitech 915-000194 Harmony Smart Control with Smartphone App and Simple Remote - Black system. I have 3 of them now and 1 works correctly, two don't. See that review for more details.Each one of those kits comes with one of these IR blasters in the kit. I purchased this item in addition because one of the IR blasters that came with my SmartHub stopped working (again, another issue to see in my other review). So let's review this actual item:Pros- It works with the Logitech hubs.- It's small enoughCons- It's not extremely powerful. I had this about 12"" behind my TV and it wasn't enough to turn the TV on and off. Seems like 12"" regardless of the angle should have been OK.- The cord is short. I think about 6'. That's fine in many cases but in this case I ran the cord behind the wall up to the wall-mounted TV. The cord was not long enough to go all the way up. Had to buy an extension cord for it.- 1 of these (that came in the Logitech 915-000194 Harmony Smart Control with Smartphone App and Simple Remote - Black kit), did stop functioning.Overall, if you need one, then buy it. It'll probably meet your needs. If you're between this and another product that might work as well or better, I might suggest you buy the other product.Doug Buchan[...]","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU5BKW64BD4LR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006CBJO0I#wasThisHelpful","RU5BKW64BD4LR","A28O0F8ZN06NL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28O0F8ZN06NL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"DeWalt is really knocking it out of ballpark with their new DEWALT DCS355D1 20V XR Lithium-Ion Oscillating Multi-Tool Kit, which I've also reviewed as probably the most useful tool I own now.Adding to my blade collection seemed like a no-brainer and I added this blade as an extra to my DEWALT Dwa4216 Oscillating, 5-Piece.I like the blade, it does as it's supposed to, scraping with ease.

This happened when removing the phone from the case, not after a fall or any kind of trauma to the case.-The speakers are left open-Adds bulk to the phone-The headset port is bulked up by the case, making any credit card reader or other device that fits flush on the phone un-usable.

"I don't think it's fair to review a product based on expectations beyond the product's scope, so I'll try to stick to what the product is supposed to do: be a starter kit for the DEWALT DCS355D1 20V XR Lithium-Ion Oscillating Multi-Tool Kit which I think is the best thing since sliced bread.So this kit is supposed to be a starter kit and offer 5 essential blades to get you started. The good news, in the nutshell, is that the blades are great starter blades.The con: The kit that they come in doesn't even fit the one semi-circular blade that comes with the kit.So the blades are good, the case doesn't fit any of the larger blades, including the ""wide"" woodcut blades sold seprately.Still not a bad kit, but it's pretty dumb that it doesn't fit all of the blades sold for the tool, let alone all the blades in the kit.Doug Buchan[...]","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OGB1EE0NUSKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FMHPYSY#wasThisHelpful","R1OGB1EE0NUSKC","A28O0F8ZN06NL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28O0F8ZN06NL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a huge fan of the new DeWalt 20V tools. I've been converting my old 18V volt line one tool at a time (basically as fast as I can sell them off). This DeWalt DCS380M1 tools replaces my old DEWALT DC385K 18-Volt Ni-Cad Cordless Reciprocating Saw Kit.So there's very little difference between the tools. If you've owned the 18V version, this is going to function just about the same but it'll work harder for longer.The tools great features:- 20V battery, newer 4.0ah battery with fuel gauge- Well balanced and powerful- Continues to run, just slower, when battery gets low- 4 position chuck allows 4 different cutting anglesNegatives:- Only comes with 1 battery. Common DeWalt, we're paying enough, give us another batteryThis is still truly a worthwhile tool. A good reciprocating saw is absolutely invaluable for the DIY, handyman and any construction contractor.Just a side note, since purchasing this tool I've also acquired DEWALT DCS355D1 20V XR Lithium-Ion Oscillating Multi-Tool Kit and I love the tool. It might actually be a suitable replacement for a reciprocating saw for SMALL jobs. It would never replace it for agressive sawing needs.--UPDATE 1/9/14--This DOES have an adjustable depth. Use the yellow button on the side to adjust cut depth. Very cool!Doug Buchan[...]","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BKBX8QQQPQ5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DG4MSZM#wasThisHelpful","R1BKBX8QQQPQ5N","A28O0F8ZN06NL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28O0F8ZN06NL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm lucky, I'm in my 20's and as I go about purchasing all of my powertools for the first time, I'm able to invest heavily in the DeWalt 20V MAX line of tools. I own most of the useful ones including reciprocating saw, brushless hammer drill, brushless impact driver, and a few others including their poor excuse for a radio haha.I went to do some work on my car a few weeks ago and bought the 20V MAX grinder / cutoff tool. As I went online to research the tool some more I found out about the 20V MAX Oscillating Multi-Tool. I'd never used one before so I viewed a number of YouTube videos and did my research. It sure as heck sounded like it'd be worth the money. It sure beats buying a sander, metal saw, drywall saw, caulk putty knife, and a jigsaw.So I've but this bad boy to work over the past 2 weeks and it ROCKS!Projects list:- I own the DeWalt drywall jab knife and reciprocating saw. I've used both in the past for drywall repair and not knowing any better, they have done just fine. Well, I just used the DeWalt 20V MAX Oscillating tool to do two drywall cutouts and it's amazing. The easiest and cleanest cut I've had yet with smooth edges!- After drywalling of course I had to sand. I've used a hand sander in the past and it works just fine. But I've really had to sand pretty hard over some areas where I used too much putty on the walls. So I decided to give the 20V MAX tool a try. What a breeze to sand! And it doesn't take off too much either, you have excellent control based on the variable speed trigger and how much pressure you put on the tool.- While I was working in a client's house installing their TV, they saw me sanding their wall with the 20V MAX Multi-tool. My client, a 50ish year old woman, liked the tool and commented on it. Being thrilled with the tool myself I started to tell her about it and all it could do. She brought me to a corner of her living room where the molding had been poorly caulked. She said it'd been bothering her for years. So I handed her the tool, showed her how to attach the putty blade, and let her remove the caulk. It came right off first time, with ease, with a 50 year old woman using it for the first time. How's that for user friendly and effective? This tool is easy to control!I haven't used this yet on hard wood or nails, but I can't imagine it will disappoint.Another note: I'm still on the first charge on the battery. I've been using the tool for 2 weeks and have not charged it after the first charge.My only complaint... I'm a slave to the DeWalt hard Kit Boxes. I like my tools all protected. I wish this had a kit box and not a contractor bag.All in all, this will be my most useful and handy tool to have around. Truly worth the money!-----UPDATE 12/29/13-----------So I went to add the DeWalt belt hook to this model (DeWalt Hammerdrill Driver DCD980L2 DCD985L2 because all of the DeWalt 20V MAX line have the hook slots on the handles. This oscillating tool would be the perfect size and weight for hanging on the belt. Anyway, this tool does not have the nut built into the handle to attach the screw holding on the hook. The hole is there, just not nut in it. I guess I have to go search for one. Not worth deducting a star, but it truly is ""the little things"" that can be annoying.Doug Buchan[...]","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21YNVDZ2T9PF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAU8FOS#wasThisHelpful","R21YNVDZ2T9PF3","A28O0F8ZN06NL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28O0F8ZN06NL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think this was one of the best horror films I've seen. Everything in the movie is logical. What do I mean? Well, if you knew 8 of your friends had just died by walking out of the house, would you follow them? Probably not. But that's how most horror movies go: You find yourself yelling at the screen ""NO!

"I have a 2003 CR-V that had only one headlight lens that was foggy. So I'd been putting off doing a restoration because it wasn't a complete necessity.I decided to go ahead and purchase this kit when I had some downtime one week and completed the restoration after it arrived from Amazon.The kit was easy to open. The instructions were lengthy and somewhat tedious but detailed. Because this process must be completed exactly in the order prescribed, it's important to read the lengthy directions.I had everything set up in a matter of 10 minutes, getting the drill, papertowels, and my DeWalt radio to listen to some music while I worked.I followed all of the steps, repeated some to try to get the cleanest finish on the lens, and wiped everything clean. The lens looks 95% better.The ONLY complaint I have is that there are certainly still hairline scratches on the lens from the sand paper. This is 100% un-noticeable at any distance over a 3' from the car. The lens looks perfect from any distance > 3'. Close examination shows the scratches. This may have been user error but I re-sanded using the finest grain paper and the buffer pad numerous times and still was left with very light, faint, almost invisible scratches.The lens looks good as new. We'll see how long it stays that way. The kit recommends almost $100 in additional 3M products to protect the lenses long term as well as other lens cleaning kits and more. Hopefully I don't need any of it.

"This costume will make you appear slimmer than you actually are...which is great, considering that you're dressing up as a skeleton.  I am 5'-8"" and 137#.  I was conflicted as to ordering the medium or the large.  I finally went with the large, because I was concerned that the medium might not be long enough in the leg and arm lengths.(NOTE:  I ordered and received a Large, but for some reason it shows on this review as a Medium)This suit has enough length in both the arms and legs for me.  It has enough Spandex to be form-fitting without being too revealing in the crotch and rear areas.  It is slimming and comfortable.  I've purchased some gloves with the bone shape, and will apply some temporary face tattoos to complete the look.I dock one star in the rating because it only has the bones in the front.  I also wish that the neckline was higher so that the pattern would show up to the jawline--as it is, I'll have to use body paint to keep all my skin from showing.  But I'm very happy with this purchase and am anxious to wear it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KNTIIA4K6OS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JSJR1SS#wasThisHelpful","R3KNTIIA4K6OS5","A2G45Q8V20R779","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G45Q8V20R779?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was time--it was old, and terribly discolored.  In fact, I think it was older than I am, since my mother passed it along to me.This is a good kitchen necessity.  I like that it has the option of a flat side and a nubby side.  I like the weight, and the handle provides a good grip.  And best of all, it's SO shiny compared to my old aluminum mallet.  I wish that the nubs were just a tad bigger,  but I can live with it.  I'm a  little disappointed that it is seamed where the flat and nubby sides meet the main head, as I worry about food hiding in the seam.

"This first Book in the series had a good plot premise, with nice romance and some decent action scenes.  I was intrigued enough to read to the end, which was resolved enough to not leave a reader hanging.  There is obviously more to the story, though.The writing is a little young for even the target audience in regard to dialogue.  It seemed more tween than college.  The writing needs polish and editing.  Overall, though, it was an OK read for me.  I'm not sure if I'm hooked enough to read the next book, but this one was moderately entertaining.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VDDIAR4H6MPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFNO4ZE#wasThisHelpful","R3VDDIAR4H6MPP","A2G45Q8V20R779","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G45Q8V20R779?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In spite of this, I'll admit that I did enjoy it.  There are some problems with sentence structure and wrong word errors.  And it does read more like a YA than it should, considering some sexual scenes.  But it has potential, since the action scenes are good and the World is interesting.I believe that this author's other series on Dragons should be read before this one.  I did read the first of that series, but did not continue it due to the short lengths of the books.

"Which is my mistake--never hit that ""Buy Now With 1-Click"" button without double checking.I've read many of the J.D. Robb Dallas books and really enjoyed them.  I've only read a couple of her others.  So maybe this is written in her style, I can't be sure.  But this was only an OK read for me--nothing special.The Hero was just not that appealing.  He should have gotten himself out of his tricky situation in some manner, considering his background.  The Heroine was a little shallow, constantly feeling insecure even though she was wealthy and pretty.It just read more like a long Harlequin romance to me, and I quit reading them when I was young because they were basically all alike.  But it was a decent read and written well, so I don't consider it a waste of time.

"I'm not really into pearls, but when wearing a dressy white top,  I wanted something that would look elegant.  Two comments made me hesitate:1.  Somebody said that they were forward heavy (so I thought that they'd be too large or saggy)2.  Several made statements that the backings were either small or insufficient for the earrings--in fact, a couple people said that they had lost or almost lost them due to this issue.I did not find either problem with the earrings that I received.  Although a tad larger than I would have preferred, they still sit flush against my ear, and there is still room for tiny diamond studs in my second piercing.  The posts are quite long, which surprised me.  The backs are also larger than normal, giving sufficient stability.  I was prepared to replace the backs with some large circle plastic backs, but I don't have to do so.The pearls are lovely and larger than I expected.  The diamonds are very small, but I could see that they would be from the illustration.  The raised sides are quite detailed and well created, giving the earrings beauty from all angles.In conclusion, they are exactly as advertised and I am quite pleased with the purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17O149GYG39KQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004R1R6UK#wasThisHelpful","R17O149GYG39KQ","A2G45Q8V20R779","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G45Q8V20R779?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And this one didn't leave a reader hanging quite as much as the first book.  I still wish for a little more background on this world.  And the writing could be a little more polished, especially the dialogue.  Sometimes it's hard to determine who is speaking, and the conversations and actions seem a bit YA to me--but the sex scenes are adult.I selected this as my monthly Prime Kindle Lending Library selection because the first book was interesting.

"First things first:  This is listed as a ladies watch, but this is truly a unisex watch.  This is a substantial timepiece.  It's constructed of solid stainless steel, including the strap / band.In terms of face size, this 36mm face is on par with an 80's / 90's men's Rolex or Girard Perregaux.  In fact this dwarfs my 1971 men's Rolex and Omega watches.Still, it is a 21st century unisex; my wife has more than one watch this size and one more that is larger (38mm).The strap can be adjusted to fit anyone with a wrist up to 8"" around.While it looks like a chronograph it actually uses those subdials to indicate the day, the date and there is even a 24hr second time zone.The movement (internals) is a Swiss made ISA that runs on a type 371 (sr920sw) battery.Overall, she's a good watch that will keep super accurate time that can resist water damage to well over 300 feet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D7IMUHYJPUH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JMKV1M#wasThisHelpful","R1D7IMUHYJPUH9","A1SXCGBJ9JW2MO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SXCGBJ9JW2MO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have generally been quite happy with Black & Decker tools over the years.  This chainsaw does not disappoint, in any way.It has plenty of power, provided you use a 14-gauge extension cord or better, and will handle any cutting work the typical home owner is ever likely to encounter.I used it to cut a 12"" diameter oak tree that was too close to the house.

"What else can I say:  This adapter worked on the first try on my recently upgraded to Windows 10 Acer Ultrabook with SSD.

"I'm just so impressed with De'Longhi.  This is my second indoor grill from that company.  The first one is still going strong and is a regular part of our cooking life.This unit features a non-stick ceramic coating on the cooking surface.  It feels like a Zirconium based ceramic.  Of course, that means that it is super hard... you could sharpen our knives on it, but it also means that it is brittle and can be chipped by hard impact with steel, etc.  It's best to use plastic or silicone utensils, just to be safe.  If you do that, this thing will probably live forever.It functions perfectly:  Heat-up is super fast and clean-up is crazy easy (just wipe with a wet towel).  I especially like the included splash protector for the sides and back (it stores neatly inside the unit when not needed.  Oh, you can store the power cord inside the unit too... there's lots of room in there.Overall, this is a great cooking surface.  It works great, it looks great... this is a great option.

"I have had this case for 3 years and it is a life saver. Despite stuffing and I mean STUFFING this item with electronics the zipper shows no signs of wear and this case has expanded to fit much more than one would guess when just looking at it. It is the perfect thing to organize all your cords and chargers and to hold all those extra cables that comes with electronics. It can honestly hold a ton of items with ease. I probably have around 50 cables of varying sizes in this thing along with other wall chargers. The case is very well made and meant to withstand abuse and the material it is made out of is thick and sturdy. The elastics inside have also been pulled on and many cords have been put under them yet they have not stretched out or gone limp. If you have tons of cables lying around with no where to put them this is the answer.I hate to say this because I love amazon but this case is much better than the amazon basics cable case.I recently purchased another cable organizer case from a different brand and the quality just doesn't compare and am back to purchase another one of these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IUYZ200JV0G0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003D0ID8U#wasThisHelpful","R3IUYZ200JV0G0","A36997O7SYAV62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36997O7SYAV62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this for my 2.5 gallon beta tank. I wasn't really pleased with the filter that came with it and this filter is a large improvement with some modifications. First off the filter must sit completely flat to function best and have a fair amount of gravel over it to keep the current down for your fish. I also put a small plant on top of the base. The plant that comes with this is cheap, tacky, and will rip your fishes fins, throw it away. The base has a diameter of about 6 inches so make sure you have room for it. I put 2.5 pounds of gravel in my 2.5 gallon tank to make sure the base was completely covered and held down. The carbon that comes with the filter is junk and needs to be replaced. Pop the black lid off, take out the moss, dump the carbon, fill it with your own carbon I use (Marineland PA0373 Black Diamond Activated Carbon, 40-Ounce, 1134-Gram), replace the moss and snap the lid back on and run water through it. I cut the clear tubing down by an inch so that it would be the proper height in my tank.

"At the price these are, which is ridiculously expensive for a no-name company, I was expecting the Mercedes of bluetooth headphones. I hate to give these 1 star but I seriously cannot recommend them.Pros:-Stylish as hell. These look and are packaged like something Monster designed.-Very comfortable. Three pairs of earbud tips allow these to stay in your ears very securely.-Neck collar style is very convenient as it allows earbuds to not get caught on anything or get pulled out of your ears.-Sound quality. Probably the clearest I've heard from any bluetooth headphones where the sound quality is normally compromised but this is a very impressive and clear sound with no obvious distortions. I own over 100 headphones/earbuds and I am picky about audio quality.Cons:-BUILD QUALITY!!!! Oh my goodness I cannot believe how flimsy and thin these headphones are. These are waiting to break any second and I take extremely good care of my technology. The neck band is a very thin plastic that bends back and forth so easily, an infant could snap this in a second. This is just waiting to break. The cords to the earbuds are also SO thin, earbuds from a dollar store would have a thicker cord. These are going to break or at least defect so quickly. They also come with no case so I have't a clue how people protect or travel with these.-Volume. I do not in any way listen to my headphones loud or am out to damage my hearing. What is so confusing is that there is a voice that says ""pairing successful"" and a ""beep"" that signifies when you have hit the lowest or highest volume (on the headphone controls) that is MUCH louder and annoying than the volume of the music ever gets. I find myself frequently hitting the highest volume and the headphones are in no way very loud.-Now the defect. While this pairs easily to my ipod the headphones frequently skip and distort. There is no loss of connection but when changing songs or when skipping to the next song the headphones will not play music for about 5 seconds. The headphones also fall behind when skipping many songs. In the middle of a song the headphones will also occasionally drop the song. There is NO loss of bluetooth connectivity, the headphones simply have a defect. I originally thought it was my one pair but no, I returned that pair and ordered another one and it does the exact same thing.-Battery life. A six hour battery life is fairly short though some people seem to think it is long lasting in this price range the battery life should at least be ten hours.- Sneers customer service. I contacted them about the defect and while they responded they simply told me to order a different pair of headphones from them and return these. What? It seems they know this defect exists but they don't wish to do anything about it. Terrible.-Price, not even close.These headphones should never have been released with their connection defect and build quality.

"First off if you are a half size size down. Due to the high setting of this ring it fits looser.I simply couldn't resist buying this ring. I have never ever seen a tiara setting like this and it is so pretty. This is by far my favorite ring setting.The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The CZ cut is perfect and there are indeed so many facets that it just sparkles and the clarity is amazing. The CZ is the amazon curated collection is the best CZ I've ever seen.The issue with this ring is that the stone is so SO HUGE. I purchased this to wear on my middle finger and if I had purchased it to wear on my ring finger the stone would literally take up the entire width of my finger. The setting is also very high so it protrudes out a lot making the stone look ever larger. It is simply not possible to ever wear this ring without virtually everyone noticing.....which could be a good or bad thing. If you are fabulously wealthy and dress extremely well then this ring probably could look real on your finger and it will blow people away. However if you are an average person (like me) then this ring is simply too huge to ever be believable. Also, many diamonds unless they are high high grade do not have extremely clarity so the size plus the clarity of this ring makes it really not believable. A ring around this size and clarity would honestly retail for around $30,000 so on the right person this would fit.However I do still love the craftsmanship here and the ring is undeniably beautiful. I will just be wearing it around the house for guilty pleasure. I also purchased the Platinum Plated Sterling Silver Round Cubic Zirconia Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow 3-Stone Ring which, in my opinion, looks much more believable on the average person.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26SVBH0M38369/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FWZ08Y#wasThisHelpful","R26SVBH0M38369","A36997O7SYAV62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36997O7SYAV62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These headphones deliver some of the best sound in *closed back* headphones in the under $300 range. They are a classic set of cans from the legendary Koss that have been around for decades. But these haven't aged that well (they haven't changed at all) and some changes would be highly beneficial.Pros:-Excellent sound stage as mentioned above, becomes much better after about 50 hrs of burn in. A very flat and clean response, requires a lot of power to get it though (see later).-Closed back so sound does not leak (though closed back vs open back is a matter of preference).-Build like a tank. Pretty sure these were intended to survive the apocalypse. If you ever see an army general wearing headphones it would likely be these.-Superb noise isolation. Though these are not active noise cancellation they are so thick and so tight to your head you can be barely hear any outside noise.-Koss's excellent lifetime warranty!-Really amazing price considering the sound and build quality and power impedance.Cons:-EXTREMELY HEAVY! Brace yourselves. Do not hang these from your neck!!-Very dated in style...probably the most dated headphones of all time along w/ the portapros (still love those).-Extremely bulky and awkward sitting on your head. Not very comfortable as the weight of the headband pushes down on select points on your head.-Maybe the ugliest headphones ever? The color is not appealing and should have been changed long ago. (if looks matter to you).-Earpads. I find the earpads so uncomfortable. They do not breathe whatsoever (they are not leather or velour) and they collect sweat against your skin even in very short periods of time. Apparently they are also filled with a liquid and will eventually puncture?....I didn't wait around to find out and replaced them with the Brainwavz velour replacement pads.-Cord is not detachable! Although I have heard some people can take these apart and replace the cord, all the power to you but it's beyond me.-This is made worse by the fact there is little strain relief on the 1/4"" end. The cord is also coil and not very long. But you can get an extension.-Boom mic option is still there, another thing that could have gone as these are never used anymore.Other points:-These are not portable!! They have a 250 ohm impedance and need a good amp. The sound on these is very very laid back. I have the HD 650s which have a 300 ohm impedance and these headphones require more power. I personally love Fiio amps but there are loads of amps here on amazon that will work.-This is further emphasized by the 1/4"" end that is intended to plug into a desktop amp. No adapter included.So there you go, my thoughts on these legendary cans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C36MKN9AZCU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004Z7G9#wasThisHelpful","R3C36MKN9AZCU9","A36997O7SYAV62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36997O7SYAV62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had originally purchased the peridot headphone stand by brainwavz for my Sennheiser HD 650s but I didn't like how bulky it was, how much room it took up, the enormous logo, and the way it stretched my headphones so I returned it. I originally bought this stand for a different set of headphones as I thought it would be too small to hold the 650s but it is PERFECT! The gap in the center of the head band padding on the 650s sits perfect on the top of this stand and the stand is the perfect height. The base isn't very large however the stand isn't going anywhere. Unlike the gypsum and quartz styles this has raised edges on the sides of the top to keep the headphones from going anywhere. There is no assembly required and the stand is very thick and solid. It does not take up too much room and is the perfect size for my crowded desk. The only two cons I see:-the very large brand name. I'm not sure why they feel the need to do this, I think putting the brand small and off to the side would be perfectly fine. That being said the headphone covers up the brand name very well on this.-Fingerprint magnet. I wish there was some sort of fingerprint resistance coating Brainwavz would consider putting on their headphone stand. A microfiber cloth with a screen cleaner cleans this off best though!

"I have never been a fan of sigmas brushes for the most part (they shed and lack quality control) that being said this is simply the BEST spoolie in the world and is worth the extra money. It has a thin, sleek design with a solid ferrule but what sets it apart is the stiffness of the bristles. If you take just about any other spoolie and press the end between your fingers it is very soft and will collapse. Not this one. It is very very stiff and holds it's form making it perfect for separating eyelashes and combing out the curl. The difference between this and my MAC spoolie is actually night and day...and I can't believe I'm saying that?!Simply the best spoolie ever.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROJ2Q4B9YIXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5O1Q44#wasThisHelpful","ROJ2Q4B9YIXB","A36997O7SYAV62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36997O7SYAV62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems to be completely impossible to find a quality dual headphone stand. Headphone stands are so simple yet seem impossible to get one of good quality with the best quality ones being by brainwavz yet are covered in their label. On top of that headphone stands in the stores are way wayy over priced so like usual amazon is your best bet.I was looking for a dual wood stand as I like the clean look of wood and as Cosmos stands are of terrible quality this seemed the best option.Pros:Nice look, fairly clean though the wood isn't totally blemish free that's okay.Holds heavy headphones well without tipping over. I've put Sennhiesers, beats, audio technicas, etc. and never worried about the safety of the headphones.Price is ok.Cons:When taken out of the box it is covered in sawdust that got everywhere and I wasn't expecting that. You need to wipe it down yourself.The holes on this are not sanded at all and again you really need to sand them yourself.The slight ledge on the top where the headphones sit is rough on the edges. This bothered me as it could possibly damage headphones so again I carefully sanded these parts down.I have found self assembly headphone stands are disasters. Not because I'm lazy but because the screws never tighten or fit well. These tighten okay but when screwing together (using a Philips head screwdriver, the one that comes with this is junk)  when you feel resistance I would stop as you could easily crack the wood. Mine is ever so slightly loose but it doesn't move when I take headphones on and off. I fear however that the screws are gong to become loose over time and not hold up very well.One thing that REALLY bothers me. The top of the stand has the exposed screw head sitting into the wood. It would be so SO simple for the company to include a rounded wood end to pop in the hole to finish the top. Would look 10x better and cleaner.As far as the grips go on the bottom. Scotch makes clear, small, circular grips that stick to any surface and are extremely easy to use and can be found at any craft or office supply store.All in all okay but I will be looking for a better one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NR9QE50WT08S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008F4YKCW#wasThisHelpful","R1NR9QE50WT08S","A36997O7SYAV62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36997O7SYAV62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"FIRST OFF: The volume controls do not work with apple products (this product was not made for apple) but the play pause and answer call button does work. Also, if you have trouble getting these to stay in your ears the Acoustibuds and EarSkinz (available here on amazon) fit these perfectly and will provide more noise isolation if that is what you're going for.If you like apples earpods and want a second pair or broke your pair and don't want to pay apples price/risk getting a fake this is your answer, although better.These are design to sit in your ear in basically the same way apples do. There are no gel tips and covers just the plastic earbud that sits outside your ear canal. I have medium sized ears and these sit perfectly fine, they actually fit better then apples as they are tapered so as to sit better. These are not noise canceling/isolating!!! And they are not designed to be. The earbud sits outside your ear, there is no plug or rubber tip to create an air tight seal, so you will hear plenty of outside noise. This is perfect for your everyday, on-the-go use. On the train, on the bus, where you can hear your stops and you don't have to fuss with getting the earbuds in and out of your ears.The build quality is excellent. They have volume buttons and play/pause or answer call. The cable is wide and tangle-free with a matte finish. Best of all there are magnets on each earbud on the end that allow them to snap together and keep everything tangle free! You don't have to fuss with pushing the headphone straightener up the cord the magnets automatically snap together and keep the ear buds together.The sound quality is satisfying, it is not audiophile-$150+ quality, but it isn't meant to be! These are 100% designed as on-the-go convenient headphones and they are excellent at that. Music sounds good, calls sound good, they are tangle free, earbuds snap together, quick to put in your ears, and you can hear everything around you without unplugging. Excellent design and features for what they are meant to be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6A78HM2CUJ55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HX0SRXW#wasThisHelpful","R6A78HM2CUJ55","A36997O7SYAV62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36997O7SYAV62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have owned way way too many makeup brushes in my life. Ranging from drug store to make up stores to online companies to department stores to popular high end brushes like MAC I have tried just about any brushes I can get my hands on. These brushes are, hands down, some of the best brushes you will ever find and are on par with ANYTHING you will buy from a high end brand (MAC, Bobbi Brown etc.) and IMO are much better than experiences I've had with Sigma brushes. They are better than brushes at sephora (!!!), Ulta, Walmart, and other popular makeup stores.The brushes are incredibly soft high grade synthetic hair. I normally like a mix between natural and synthetic brushes but you won't be able to tell the difference between this synthetic hair and soft, natural hair. These brushes are universal as they can be used with powder and also liquid as they won't adsorb it. They pick up make up so well and apply it just as well.The look to these brushes is gorgeous. They have correct length handles, not too long, not too short (about 6 inches including the ferrule). The handles are rock solid and very sleek and have a sort of matte finish which adds to their beauty. The handles of the face brushes are thick and sit very well in your hand. The ferrules are very secure. The brushes are incredibly soft and very dense yet they are incredibly fluffy and each is labeled (I particularly LOVE the powder brush! The stippling brush is also amazing and it is a genuine stippling, easily comparable and as good as my MAC 187). These brushes also come packaged individually and the face brushes have BRUSH GUARDS!! Not the cheap plastic but actual mesh netting brush guards that are very long and fit each brush exactly.On top of the excellent quality of the brushes is the case. The case is amazing!! It is a rectangular box that splits in the middle and is held together by a very strong magnet. There is plenty of extra room to add other brushes and the case is rock solid and matches the brushes in color. They gold stitching is secure and the case, whether or not it is real leather, could fool anyone.These are not cheap brushes and it is clear a lot of thought and effort went into these brushes to make them the best they possibly could be. These are professional make up brushes and no matter what brushes you have owned before, whether drug store or MAC, Sigma, Bobbi Brown, you will be impressed with these brushes. The only difference is with these you are not paying the exorbitant amount for a brand name. Guaranteed. Highly recommended. On top of that these brushes have a lifetime guarantee, can't go wrong.On a side note, in the instructions I really appreciate that the company says you do not need to buy an expensive brush cleaner but can just use a mild shampoo (I use baby shampoo) as I have had several moderate to higher end brushes that companies insist you buy their pricey brush cleaner so it's very nice the company here isn't trying to sell you on that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ICYS0COOVYP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVOFOCY#wasThisHelpful","R3ICYS0COOVYP5","A36997O7SYAV62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36997O7SYAV62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off if you are going to purchase these purchase them shipped AND sold by amazon to ensure you get an authentic product and the warranty is valid.I was casually browsing headphones and came across these inexpensive monster headphones. In the low $40 price range I thought I had nothing to lose to try them.They come professionally packaged but the packaging isn't as extravagant as many of monsters products but still would make a nice gift. There is a small booklet on them earbuds, about 5 pairs of tips, a hard small black monster carrying case, and 3.5mm extender right angle cord (totally pointless). I am not sure why this cord is included as the jack to the headphones should just be a right angle and it is only about 4 inches long and just adds weight to the earbuds (which is problematic). It is not an adapter, they are both 3.5mm. Microphone and volume controls function well for music and answering calls.Sound: Typical monster sound that they are known for. If you are a fan of the beats tour then you will likely like these. A tight and slightly warm bass that is very present along with clear mids and highs. Either you will like the sound or you will want something less bass-y and more neutral (which you will pay more for).Build quality: Monster is not known for bulletproof build quality so I knew this when I purchased them but the actual look to these headphones is very cheap. The cable is not of the same material as the beat tours or gaga's heartbeats or any other of their flat cable headphones. The cable is narrow and has lots of kinks in it and is definitely not tangle-free. All this looks rather cheap which is disappointing. I wouldn't test the build quality of the cable or the ear pieces because they likely won't hold up.Comfort/fit: These earbuds do not stay in my ears. I have tried all the tips and they fall out as they extend far out of your ear and have very large ends that weigh them down. As said before the right angle jack extension also weighs them down if you choose to use that. I have resorted to using these with comply foam tips to keep them in.The look to these headphones is not nearly as stylish as some of monsters others but these are on the lower end price wise. If you enjoy the sound quality and can get them to stay in your ears then they are probably worthwhile just don't have too high of expectations.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R111UGT28NI3UY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074F5DKG#wasThisHelpful","R111UGT28NI3UY","A36997O7SYAV62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36997O7SYAV62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the five set kabuki brush which I'm realizing now was a little overkill (how many kabuki brushes can you have?) but I was highly intrigued by the set and the companies dedication.First impression. The packaging is great. The brushes come individually packaged and the brush holder all come in a box filled with pink confetti and a very cute sticker (that I won't spoil for you:), this would make a perfect gift for any makeup lover.When I opened the bags for each brush they emitted and awful smell. Seriously they smelt awful which was an initial turn off. I immediately washed them my preferred way, with baby shampoo, and the smell was gone. I am still not fan of the idea that the brushes came loaded with chemicals but this is the only con.The brushes are AMAZING. Incredibly dense and full yet incredibly soft and pick up makeup so well. These apply effortlessly and really give your skin an airbrushed look. So easy to use yet so effective. These brushes are far better than Sigma's kabuki though somewhat different, Sigma's have a slightly larger head and are fluffier however these are denser and equally as soft as Sigmas and I find the denseness gives a better application. I won't be using my Sigma again any time soon. These brushes also have a great weight to them. Very heavy duty wood handle with a sturdy metal ferrule, you can tell the quality just by holding them.On top of this Beauty Junkees has some of the best customer service I've ever experienced. When I received the kit the leather tube was too small to hold all the brushes and I was very confused. I contacted the seller who responded right away and said they had made their brushes denser which in return caused them to be larger and they no longer all fit in the tube. She told me they were in the process of making a new larger tube and offered to send me one when they were completed in a few months. Well during this time the seller kept me up to date on the production of their tubes and sure enough I received one via priority mail wrapped in pink tissue paper. This tube is perfect for holding all the brushes and is a beautiful leather and very very solid. Beauty junkees truly cares about their customers satisfaction and was extremely kind and prompt in their response. I have since bought several of their other products because I value their great quality and great customer service.Can't go wrong with this brush or this company.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CL3B9FS7DJ80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F008GFQ#wasThisHelpful","R3CL3B9FS7DJ80","A36997O7SYAV62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36997O7SYAV62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off I'd like to say that Crave Naturals is a wonderful company with amazing and fast customer service and that I highly recommend their products.This is great argan oil and it is 100% pure and highly concentrated. It comes with a dropper and lid pump that screws right on the bottle. The bottle is darkened glass to preserve the oil.The way I use this oil is using the lid pump I pump ONE DROP into my hand and rub it into the ends and lower half of my hair. I have thin, dry, shoulder blade length hair and one pump is all I need. This stuff is extremely concentrated and using too much with cause you to look like you bathed your hair in lard. Seriously use very very little. I use this in the morning before using heat products on my hair and this is by far the most effective heat protection available (forget CHI). Your hair style will last all day and any frizz or dryness is taken care of 100%. Liquid gold for you hair. Any leftover in your hair can be rubbed into your nails and cuticles.The reason I knock off a star is that this oil seems a little overpriced. It is definitely high quality argan oil but it is only ONE 2oz. bottle (I was confused by the photos as it seemed it came with 2 bottles but I contacted the company afterwards and it is only one). I have purchased bottles double this size for less than the $30 cost of this one. I am not sure whether I will purchase it again but I love the quality plus crave naturals always includes a 25% off amazon coupon for their products:).","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RACUOV3QHVONJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUQ5MUO#wasThisHelpful","RACUOV3QHVONJ","A36997O7SYAV62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36997O7SYAV62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are good quality brushes and are definitely well crafted and made of high quality materials. First thing though is these brushes are TRAVEL SIZED. I put this in caps because this is not listed anywhere in the title or description. The brush handles are only about 4.5"" long. I was really really surprised by how small the whole set was (including the case) but this doesn't take away from the quality of the brushes. I am personally not a fan of the shorter handles as they make the brush harder to hold. I will be posting photos of the set.The case that comes with this set is amazing. Genuine leather and rock solid. It is slightly larger than a red bull can. This case is literally bulletproof and these brushes are perfect for travel as this can easily get banged around in a suitcase without any damage to the brushes or case. I have owned a lot of great makeup brush cases and none are as thick and solid as this case. It has to be held to be believed.The brushes are beautiful. Sleek, heavy duty, wood handles and copper ferrules. The brushes are natural and synthetic and I have experienced no shedding. No cheap materials here. Here's my rundown of the brushes.Eyeshadow brush-appears to be pony (sable) hair. AMAZING BRUSH! As good as anything MAC has ever made. Very very soft but firm enough to get a great application and picks up and applies make up flawlessly.Eyebrow brush-appears to be synthetic. This was the brush that initially led me to this page and I decided to get the whole pack because it was so intriguing. This brush is pretty good. Very firm and allows you to fill in your eyebrows well. It isn't quite as dense as I might have liked but still good.Eyebrow and eyelash comb-plastic and synthetic. Nothing special here just your very basic drugstore comb.Smudge brush- appears to be goat hair. This brush tends to be used for getting the small creases of your face like around your nose. This brush isn't great for blending which is what I tried to use it for but still very soft natural hair.Contour brush-appears to be made of goat hair as well. This brush is angled and good enough for blush but again not the best blender unfortunately.Foundation brush-synthetic-I am not a fan of foundation brushes and prefer to use my hands or a sponge but if you do like foundation brushes you'll love this one! Very firm but very soft and it's synthetic so it won't absorb your cream, also very dense. Great brush.Powder brush-appears to be goat hair-This brush as mentioned before like them all is travel sized and I'm not really a fan of the smaller sized brush as I prefer large powder/buffer brushes. My favorite is Real techniques. Eco tools also makes a very large bronzer/powder brush. But that's just my preference.Overall a good brush set just make sure the size is the size you're looking for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FYS80U3RT3YA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HO2XYEQ#wasThisHelpful","R2FYS80U3RT3YA","A36997O7SYAV62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36997O7SYAV62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very straightforward amp. It has no buttons and no settings. It also doubles over as a headphone splitter with two headphone jacks if you choose to use it that way. The amp does what amps should, amplifies the music. You'll notice a drastic increase in volume and in the bass though it isn't quite boomy you'll notice it can be slightly overpowering. The highs and mids are still present so that isn't anything to worry about. With certain types of headphones this works wonderfully. I noticed in particular a drastic improvement in my Brainwavzn R1 dual driver earbuds which I had not been that impressed with before. I also noticed an improvement in my beats studios and monoprice over ear headphones to name a few others. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this with warm sounding headphones as I don't think the amplification would be an improvement.As I said there are no buttons on this amp, it automatically powers on and off in response to music. When it is on there is a blue light in the middle and when it is plugged in and charging (with a basic micro usb) there is an orange light on that shuts off when it is finished charging. This little guy has a fairly long battery life and about 2 hours of charging gives it around 10 hours of music playing. It's well built I haven't noticed any scratches or damage to it despite a fair amount of use thus far. If I had one improvement I would add a little slot onto the amp or a clip on the back so that it can either be hung or clipped to something.The cable that comes with this is TERRIBLE. I believe I received a defective one....if not they are very poorly and cheaply made. I am still waiting to hopefully receive a replacement from MP4NATION though I have not heard back from them yet and will be back to raise or lower the star rating depending on whether or not I hear back from them. The cable sends very loud static though the amp and headphones whenever it is touched or moved and makes the amp unusable with the included cable so I have been using my own.As stated this is a one feature amp, there is no neutral or mid boost setting. It also does not come with any instructions at all so that should be a sign of how basic the amp is. Just a plug in and listen. I greatly enjoy this amp and the simplicity of it and I love the something extra it adds to certain headphones.UPDATE*** Okay so I returned this amp awhile ago for a whole new replacement and the cable that came with the replacement was equally as bad so the cable is just very cheaply made. I splurged on a short cardas cable found here CARDAS HPI Audiophile Interconnect Cable Adapter Male 1/8"" 3.5mm TRS Mini-Plug that can be used with any amp and the cable fixed all problems with static, any distortion etc. Overall I give the amp 3.5/5 because the cable really needs to be changed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW74CPWT05MC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P901EBK#wasThisHelpful","RW74CPWT05MC7","A36997O7SYAV62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36997O7SYAV62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE******** Okay so after reading some reviews for these on head-fi and other blogs (I had just read amazon reviews before purchasing) these earbuds NEED to be paired with an amplifier to get the full sound range. HOWEVER you do not need an expensive amp. FiijO's wonderful E6 works perfectly set to the neutral setting (no light on amp) or Brainwavz has their own newly launched amp that works well too.I own the Deltas made by Brainwavz and was so impressed with them that I starting seeking out other earbuds made by them. At double the price of the deltas plus the fact they were dual drivers and the extremely positive reviews I had very high expectations of these, maybe too high. Here is my opinion of them.Out of the box. I HATE the cord. The cord is a reasonably thick sort of cheap plastic that has a ton of memory and permanent kinks in it from being wound up, it also tangles easily. At this price I would have preferred a cloth covered cord which has no memory and avoids tangles, the memory in this cord makes it feel kind of cheap. Oh well.It comes with 3 sets of basic earbud sizes, a single triangular shaped earbud pair and medium comply foam tips (the best) and two adapters (very nice). It also comes with a hard case. I love this hard case and it is rock solid and protective and so few earbuds nowadays come with a hard case most just come with a little baggy.Aside from the cord the build quality feels okay, it is entirely plastic with no aluminum or metal casing like the deltas but not cheap feeling plastic. The earbuds sit in your ear and a bendable wire strings over the back of your ear and is adjustable to tighten and hold the earbuds in place. I have smaller ears and this has been as issue for me. It is difficult for me to tighten these enough to hold them in place and often they are rather loose. I have experimented with the different earbuds but a tighter fit does not seem to make a difference.The sound quality for these is good for their price but I don't think I would be willing to pay more for them. I burned these in for close to 100 hours before truly testing the quality. As others have mentioned they are not neutral and are warm in sound. I don't mind warm headphones as they can sound beautiful and natural especially when listening to acoustics but these headphones are very veryyyy warm. I would never call them ""muddy"" or bad in sound but they are kind of murky and one reviewer described them as ""dark"" which I think is the perfect word. They are more biased toward the mids especially bass wise and the bass tends to overpower most everything else making the highs nothing really special. If you are looking for a clearer, more leveled sound TTPOD makes some outstanding earbuds in this same price range.I think these are nice dual driver earbuds for the price but I'm not sure I would equate them to those by shure or westone (or even some of monsters) but the price reflects that. I think these are a bit over hyped but worth checking out if you're looking for an inexpensive pair of IEMS.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31VYN6W0Q353B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009UO26B8#wasThisHelpful","R31VYN6W0Q353B","A36997O7SYAV62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36997O7SYAV62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these headphones to use with my iphone as a means of a backup pair. As far as talking and answering calls goes they have clear sound quality and I have never had anyone complain of not being able to hear me clearly. While numerous earbuds nowadays come with microphones I wanted to save my nicer ones and buy a cheap pair just to use for calls.I would not recommend these for purely listening to music. They are lacking in clarity of the highs and the bass is not very present or tight. Overall not the clearest or best listening experience, somewhat tinny sounding and lacking big time in range. Monoprice makes a lot of great headphones so if you are looking for purely listening to music check out the 108320, 108322, 109396, all great and at a great price.Also, the build quality to these headphones is ultra cheap plastic.I take very good care of my headphones but still don't see these lasting long. No metal casing like on the other earbuds (except the 820's but their build quality is still a lot better). So in short, only buy to use for the microphone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NZ5CSUHCWHIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DIGD3TS#wasThisHelpful","R1NZ5CSUHCWHIQ","A36997O7SYAV62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36997O7SYAV62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these brushes based on the very positive reviews and that they were recommended by many beauty gurus on youtube. Having had them for a little while they remind me very much of my Coastal Scents 22 Piece Brush Set which I've had for a couple years now and I love. Having said that I don't really think these brushes are worth $50 when compared to Coastal scents brushes for $35 but I will go over the pros and cons to see if these brushes are for you.Pros:Nice metal ferrule and wood handles. The black and red of the brush set is also attractive. The wood handles are pouras to the touch, not sleek just to be noted.You have pretty much all the different types of brushes you would need here to create a nice look. This is a good set, especially for beginners.Nice, long full sized handles for easy and ergonomically correct application.All came nicely and individually packaged.Cons:The case is a nice, stiff pleather however the red sewing looks very cheap and tacky and in a few places is coming undone on my case so I was a bit disappointed here.The vast majority of these brushes are synthetic with about 3 goat hair brushes and 1 pony hair eye brush. At this price I would have liked more natural hair brushes, especially more in the eye brushes. Coastal scents brush set has many more natural hair brushes and they are all listed in the description of the product.When I first washed these brushes a few hairs came out here and there on some of them (no big deal) however the face brushes and especially the large fan brush had a decent amount of shedding that surprised me. There has been no shedding when using the brushes however.The synthetic brushes (most of this set) are very stiff feeling when applying makeup, They pick up makeup well but you apply a fair amount of pressure to apply the makeup to your face.Overall I think it is worth checking out Coastal Scents brush set before purchasing this as I think it is a better value for your money.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EM10FEH3EEQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LGYVWS8#wasThisHelpful","R2EM10FEH3EEQ9","A36997O7SYAV62","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36997O7SYAV62?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Breaking Bailey‚Äôs Rules is another excellent addition to the Westmoreland Series. I‚Äôve always wondered what kind of man would win the heart of the youngest female Westmoreland and now I know.

She‚Äôs sassy, curses like a sailor, and isn‚Äôt afraid to step up to the plate when needed. She also loves her family and where she comes from very much.

"Naughty, exciting and legendary. Those are the words that I would use to describe the Seven Sins anthology. This box set has something for everyone. An arousing doctor, a sensual CEO, a sexy bartender, desirable biker, wicked stepbrother, tempting billionaire and a very hot baseball player. Even though each of the seven stories is a quick read, they each leave an impression. This is one of the best anthologies I‚Äôve read and will recommend it to anyone who likes their romance on the wild side.Blaze for Me is the first book I‚Äôve read from Natalie Andersen and it won‚Äôt be the last. In fact, I‚Äôve just added her Beg for Me series to my tbr list! To say I was impressed with her writing is an understatement. I loved her characters!!! Austin and Nicoletta were two characters that showed a great deal of passion and that passion came through the pages. A 5 star read!Glutton for Punishment by Amy Andrews made me laugh more than once. The banter between Darcy and Mitch was amusing and playful. I immediately fell in love with the two spirited characters. 4.5 stars!Burned by Lust from Michele de Winton definitely earned its title! Both characters were sizzling hot. I especially enjoyed Lee‚Äôs character. She is such a spitfire. Doesn‚Äôt take nothing from nobody and knows how to handle her business. She knows what she wants and takes it. I only wish we had more of a backstory with her character. 4 stars!Sleeping with the Enemy is everything I love about romance. Robin Covington definitely knows how to write amazing characters who are genuine and can make you feel something. Derek and Kat had chemistry in spades and I adored their story. 5 stars!Princess Sin by Avery Flynn had me rooting for Cyn and Hunter right from the beginning. This story is packed with emotion, but don‚Äôt worry there are plenty of sexy times. I only wish there was little more to Cyn, apart from her rich, party girl persona. Princess Sin is fast paced and completely enjoyable. 4 stars!Falcone kept my eyes eager and my cheeks flushed with excitement as I devoured Accidentally Sinful. I‚Äôll be honest, I was leery going into the story. I‚Äôve read more than a few of the stepbrother romances and I‚Äôve never really enjoyed them. Carmen Falcone has done the unthinkable‚Ä¶she made me LOVE this stepbrother romance! This was hands down my favorite out of the set. Accidentally Sinful has it all‚Ä¶angst, hunger, secrets and plenty of sin to keep you yearning for more. Carmen Falcone shines with this brilliant 5-star read!I love my heroines strong and accomplished and Talia Hunter provided me with exactly that in How to Seduce a CEO. Angel knows exactly what she wants and only Marcus can give it to her. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Angel and Marcus and I am so happy how the end turned out.

Bram and Ry have been in love with Lacey for a while now, both agree not to do anything about it, because it would damage their friendship. Lacey is a good girl and when someone calls her boring she decides to make a list‚Ä¶yep, she makes a naughty list.The list includes some really sexy things, including a threesome. Suffice to say the scenes are hot and Bram and Ry do their best at checking everything off on Lacey‚Äôs list.I really enjoyed the emotion towards Lacey between the guys. You could tell how much they loved her and how much they wanted to fight for a relationship between them. Overall this was a quick yet satisfying read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DI3REB2AFWTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005F0WR88#wasThisHelpful","R1DI3REB2AFWTM","A708MRPXR6W4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A708MRPXR6W4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The final book in the Hard Ink Series ends with a bang. All loose ends are tied up and the men get what they deserve‚Ä¶the good guys and the bad! Redemption has never felt so good!!! If I had the power to give this book more than 5 stars I would.Hard to Let Go revolves around Kat and Beckett. HOLY MOLY‚Ä¶these two are hot for each other. The chemistry between these two just keeps building, until they have no choice, but make a move for each other. There are definitely reasons why a relationship shouldn‚Äôt be pursued. First, she‚Äôs Nick‚Äôs sister. Second, nobody is safe and third, they both have issues. They both understand this, but when love is involved, all bets are off!The thing with Laura Kaye, is that she writes real emotions and her characters deal with real issues. Serious issues that aren‚Äôt glossed over, but faced full on. This is one of the reasons why she is an auto-buy author for me.This book is filled with steamy scenes, romance at its finest, and pure action that will keep you GLUED to the pages.This whole series is beyond amazing and I will definitely be re-reading it all over again, when I get the chance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33QD2O40AU53P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062267949#wasThisHelpful","R33QD2O40AU53P","A708MRPXR6W4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A708MRPXR6W4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Flirting with Disaster is a quick read that was entertaining at times. I enjoyed the storyline and the dual point of views provided a great insight into the characters heads and their hearts.Barbara comes back to her hometown a changed person. She‚Äôs successful and she‚Äôs made something of herself. She uses a different name, so no one recognizes her. The reason Barbara is in town, makes her an enemy to most of the town, especially Ryder and his family. Barbara and Ryder‚Äôs relationship isn‚Äôt smooth much of the time, but when they realize how much the other means to them, there is no stopping them. The love they have for each other trumps anything else going on at the moment.The only thing in the story that bothered me was Ryder in the beginning. He kept concentrating on Barbara‚Äôs looks a little too much, especially about her jiggly butt. We hear all about how he‚Äôs used to small women with firm butts and how he doesn‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôs getting turned on by Barbara. He gets better though and I love how he falls hard for her, jiggly butt included.The drama in the story will keep you interested and readers will be invested in the outcome of Barbara and Ryder‚Äôs relationship.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DFUBVB16J475/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01131TEW4#wasThisHelpful","R1DFUBVB16J475","A708MRPXR6W4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A708MRPXR6W4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sworn to Protect is an amazing addition to Katie Reus‚Äôs Red Security Series. I can honestly say that this book kept my attention from the very beginning. It has everything you could want in a story. Hot romance, action, suspense, and characters that you will fall in love with.Quinn and Athena‚Äôs relationship started off great until she dropped the V-word and what did Quinn do‚Ä¶he ran away. Don‚Äôt worry they meet again, but unexpectedly. Turns out Athena‚Äôs new job will bring her straight to Quinn. As they work together their attraction gets hotter and this time there is no running away.I really liked Athena. She was a strong heroine. What I really loved about her was how she turned Quinn down initially, when he wanted a second chance.Quinn is sexy and protective. When he realizes he wants a second chance, nothing will stop him. He definitely makes up for leaving Quinn in the beginning!I love Katie Reus and love this series!

"The Seals of Summer 2 Box set is incredible. Readers will not want to miss out on such a good deal!! So many amazing stories packed into one awesome box set!!!For this review, I will be concentrating on Fall Dark by Zoe York and A Seal‚Äôs Chance by Cora Seton. Both of these stories are hot, amazing, and truly worth your time.Fall Dark revolves around Vince and Larken. I loved both of these characters. To be honest, I haven‚Äôt found a character created by Zoe York that I haven‚Äôt liked, but that just proves what an amazing author she really is. Vince and Larken are given a second chance in this book, but only if they are willing to put the past behind them and move forward. Can they do it? Vince and Larken are great characters and I loved how I felt when they were together. Second chance romances aren‚Äôt my favorite trope, but Zoe York made me believe in her characters and made me love this story!A Seal‚Äôs Chance revolves around Ben and Caitlyn. This was a really sweet story that really captured the emotions of a single mother and man who believes he‚Äôs damaged. The attraction between the characters is strong, but is it enough for the relationship to really work out? I really enjoyed this story and couldn‚Äôt stop reading until I knew what was going to happen with Caitlyn and Ben.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PN73J2G9DCK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X6GYA6A#wasThisHelpful","R3PN73J2G9DCK8","A708MRPXR6W4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A708MRPXR6W4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Romancing the Alpha Box set is full of action and adventure. It‚Äôs also a very good deal! You get 10, never before published books for one low price!! It‚Äô a STEAL!!!For this review, I am going to concentrate on my two favorites. Fall Back by Zoe York and Her Treasure Hunter Ex by Zara Keane. Both are amazing stories that you will want to re-read over and over again.Readers will fall in love with Cade and Mel from Fall Back. These characters keep you on your toes from the start. Cade has his work cut out for him, but this SEAL knows how to get things done. Zoe York is a favorite author of mine and her stories shouldn‚Äôt be missed!Katy and Dex from Her Treasure Hunter Ex are such fun characters that will keep you entertained. The story is well-written and will keep you interested from the very beginning. The second chance romance is done right and the characters are ones you will be rooting for.This box set is a must buy for anyone who loves a good romance, especially ones with hot alphas that make you drool!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RML21D9FPDXZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WOU6INC#wasThisHelpful","RML21D9FPDXZF","A708MRPXR6W4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A708MRPXR6W4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this book as a gift in exchange for an honest review.Leaving Me Behind by Sigal Ehrlich is a very deep and soul searching read. I believe many people can relate to wanting to get up and leave their mundane life and try something new. Liv does what many people only wish they can do. She leaves her comfortable life behind and moves to Spain for a year.Eventually Liv makes new friends and connections in Spain. Speaking of connections, she meets Sebastian, this very hot guy, who she accidentally flashes. Sebastian keeps turning up where Liv is and the attraction between them is unstoppable. They have to have each other and they do‚Ä¶.repeatedly. I really enjoyed Sebastian as a character and I wish more men acted like him. He said what was on his mind and called out Liv when she needed it.The sex scenes are well done and very hot. The emotions between the characters are noticeable, to where readers aren‚Äôt left guessing why they should be together. You can definitely tell that Liv and Sebastian belong together. The storyline is intriguing and will keep you entertained. The secondary characters only add to the story and I think the cover of this book really nailed the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good romance.

"The storyline is intriguing, the characters are fully developed, and not once did I want to put this book down. It‚Äôs not very often that a story captures my full attention, but Take Me, did just that. The twists and turns in this story will have you on the edge of your seat.Peyton and Gabe have a complicated history and when they meet up again, it only becomes more complex. It turns out that both Peyton and Gabe have some secrets that need to come forward. Peyton finds out Gabe has a twin brother, one who he shares women with, and Gabe finds out that their one night together, seven years ago, produced a son.There is so much emotion to this story that it will take you by surprise. I felt what the characters were going through. Abandonment, failure, uselessness‚Ä¶just some of the gripping emotions going on.‚ÄúWhat about forgiveness? Can it always be worked out? Because some days it feels possible, and sometimes it feels like a mountain I just don‚Äôt have the strength to climb.‚ÄùBut then you also have moments where the characters are filled with passion, heat, and most importantly, an overwhelming love that people would do anything for.Peyton is some instances is very lucky. It doesn‚Äôt seem that way in the beginning, because all the heartache and grief she‚Äôs had to endure, but when Sam and Gabe step up and decide that she is theirs‚Ä¶.well, like I said she is one lucky lady.If I had the option of giving this book more than five stars, I would. Take Me is definitely a recommended read and is one of the top reads I have read this year!

"Once Upon a Cowboy is book three in the Whisper Creek series and just like the previous two books this is a must read. Maggie McGinnis created yet another five star masterpiece, that leaves me anticipating her next book. Each book keeps getting better and better, to where I am in awe of her talent. Maggie McGinnis is definitely an author to add to your must read list. Once Upon a Cowboy will keep you turning the pages with the detailed descriptions, the well-written scenes, and the emotional detail that went it to crafting this book. Speaking of emotions, this reader will admit to needing a few tissues to get through the not so fun times, but if you've read from this author before then you can expect a happy ending. The flashbacks in the story are completely gut-wrenching and will leave you saddened for the character and wishing you could take away their pain, but when the story comes back to the present, you will once again feel the warmth and excitement that comes with a Maggie McGinnis novel. The characters are strong, capable, and will have you engrossed in their life in a matter of minutes. To the author....if you are reading this, the ending was absolutely perfect, thank you for writing an amazing series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GE5VQOZIFREF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OEXM778#wasThisHelpful","R1GE5VQOZIFREF","A708MRPXR6W4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A708MRPXR6W4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every night before I shut my eyes, I make a wish that I would wake up in Sapphire Falls. Sadly, my wish never comes true, but that‚Äôs okay because this author has the ability to make me like I am a member of the town. I feel close to these characters and couldn‚Äôt imagine the fictional world without them.This series is amazing and each story seems to get better and better. Erin Nicholas is extremely talented and she‚Äôs definitely an auto buy author for me. Don‚Äôt miss out on TJ and Hope, their story will leave you satisfied with a big smile on your face, as you watch them fall in love.Hope is such a great character and I loved how she was really into essential oils. I am starting to get into essential oils myself, so I found myself relating to Hope easily. As for TJ, it‚Äôs his turn to find love and does he ever.

"LOVE coloring lately! And what better than a great set of colored pencils! This set from Color Gallery is awesome. What I noticed at first, is that they arrive nicely boxed and my favorite.....this comes with a sharpener!  This set of 36 colored pencils gives you such a great variety of different colors. The pencils are 7 inches in length and are easy to draw with.These Color Gallery pencils have a hexagon shaped barrel which makes the pencil not roll around!  They draw smoother and easier than others. You do not have to apply pressure to get them to draw well. The colors are highly pigmented. I really like these and found no problems with sharpening them. I like that all the pencils are packaged in the box in a tray. All you have to do is take the tray out and use them. Much more organized and less messy.  Overall, I highly recommend these Color Gallery Colored Pencils as I think they high quality and a great variety of colors.Color Gallery gives a 60 day money back guarantee so you have nothing to lose!I received this product at a discounted rate for my unbiased review.

"These twisted headbands are wonderful to use for workouts as well as out and about. I really like how soft and comfortable these are on my head. They really do keep my hair away from my face and stay put on my head. I do not know how many headbands I have had in the past...that after 5 minutes of Zumba they have just popped right off my head. These really stay!!I like that they have a stretch to them and the gathered bands in the back. These measure 10 inches around but I do notice that if you stretch them too much they do not return their normal shape until you wash them again. These headbands are simple to clean in the wash. I put them in my delicate bag and wash on a normal cycle and had no issues at all. I like that there is 6 of them in this set as well. You can keep a few and give a few as gifts.

"I am a huge fan of compression shirts. I wear them often and love that they give you a more smooth look under your clothes. This Lupo Long Sleeve Compression shirt fit true to size for me. I bought this in a size medium and it fit perfectly. I am usually a size 10 and a medium or large on top. I prefer getting them snug since that is the point of them.Here are a few more detailed measurements, hopefully this will help. Remember these measurements are for a size medium. The shirt measures from top to bottom approximately 25 inches. So for me its a perfect length since you want it to be longer to cover more and if you want you can tuck the shirt into your pants. The measurement of the sleeves from wrist to armpit is approximately 20 inches long. I love the length too since it goes all the way down to my wrist with no problem. The bottom hem unstretched measures 13 inches.This compression shirt arrives in a nice professional looking box. The material is very comfortable and breaths well so you do not get overheated. The muscle mapping design of the shirt is awesome and you can feel that it helps keep you supported in the correct places. I really love to wear this shirt when I am lifting at the gym too.

"This Rexing Dash camera has a great design that hides nicely behind the rear view mirror. This camera comes with an extra long cord which allows it to be ran above the headliner and down the A-pillar for an out of view installation. Camera records good quality video in 1080p. NOTE: This camera does require a CLASS 4 MicroSD!! Any other MicroSD card will not work!Very easy to set up using the built in menu. The camera has loop recording and can record in 3-10 minute loops. There is a built in G-force sensor that senses an accident and automatically saves the last 10 minutes of video. Video can be set up with date stamp and license plate of the vehicle to be displayed in the actual video.  We really liked this camera and the best part being that it is very discreet.

"Great essential oil gift set from Essentially Botanics. It comes nicely packaged and you can tell they took great care in how it is presented. I really am a huge fan of this set.Essential oils are a huge part of my life now since starting using them about a year ago. They are so beneficial to your body and mind. This set gives you the opportunity to play with 6 different oils (Lavender, Peppermint, Eucalyptus, Lemongrass, Orange, and Tea Tree). Each bottle is 10ml or a third of an ounce. Even though they are small, there is still enough oil to use them for a few different applications as well as many uses in your diffuser.I use Peppermint and Eucalyptus for flu or cold symptoms. They seem to open up my sinuses well. Peppermint is also great for headaches. I always take a few drops straight but you can add a carrier oil like coconut and apply it directly underneath your nose or the top part of your chest. Orange just smells great and can be used in the diffuser to make your house smell fresh. I use tea tree in my shampoo to help with my dry scalp and it makes my hair look great. Lavender is perfect for relaxing and inducing sleep. Put a few drops mixed with water in a small spray bottle and spray a few sprays on your pillow every night.You and your family can feel good about using these oils from Essentially Botanics. No additives, Is not diluted and no ingredients you cannot pronounce! Christmas is coming and this set of 6 oils would go well with a great diffuser!

"Awesome Canvas Tote Bag that can be used for almost anything as well as make a perfect gift bag! This large canvas bag measures 21"" x 15"" and the best part of this bag is that it is ZIPPERED! I own a few(that is an understatement) tote bags but none that are zippered. This makes the bag perfect to be an overnight or weekend bag that can fit a few changes of clothes and some shoes.The saying ""And so the adventure begins darling"" would be perfect to give a new mom and fill it up with diapers, wipes, pacifiers, etc.... Also the phrase lends itself to give as a gift to someone starting college and fill it with goodies and supplies for school.

The set of 4 spoons come nicely packaged and would make a great baby gift.  The spoons are approximately 6.25"" long. Personally, I have went through a ton of different brands and types of spoons. My daughter is wheelchair bound and special needs and deals with many feeding issues......I have used these spoons with my 12 year old special daughter that has sensory issues and problems eating. The silicone makes it wonderful for her to pick up and try to use herself. I know that she will not get hurt or hurt her gums at all even when I feed her using these spoons. I showed her speech therapist and they really loved them too. ALL edges of these spoons are soft.

"Super cute Christmas Tumblers that can be used year round. These Tumblers arrive in a 4 pack with 4 different themes so each child can claim their own...snowman, santa, penguins, and a christmas tree theme. The best part of these cups are that the paper insert can be removed and easily traced on another paper to make your own design and used all year round. I know that these say that they are childrens cups, but honestly I love them because 11 oz cups are perfect for hot cocoa, which I am a huge fan of.As a former scrapbooker, I definitely looked at these travel tumblers and saw the potential of placing photos and a mini scrapbook page in the cups. What an awesome present for a grandma or grandpa, a travel tumbler with their grandkids pictures on them. Just an idea of what I think I might do with one of them at least.

"Quality Barbell Clamps from LIFT Fitness Solutions! I was excited to get these since my husband and I lift alot. My husband is actually training for a powerlifting competition. We were impressed with the quality of these and how well these work.All you have to do is open the clamp, slide it on the bar, and clamp to close. Make sure your weights are nice and tightly together before you clamp and you will have no problem at all!!I was so glad that this set came with a drawstring storage bag. I love having a place for everything. It makes it easier for me to be organized and know where they are. These clamps are made to fit on any 2 inch bar. So, we bring these to the gym with us since the barbell clamps they have at our gym are not as nice and well made as these are. I highly recommend this set of Barbell Clamps! A must have for any lifter for sure.I received this product for free for my unbiased review.

"Cute little Butterfly Tealight holder. This measures about 6.75"" including the handle. It is a matte black color that can easily be painted if you wanted to. The metal that it is made with is sturdy and well made. The lid itself moves up and down along the handle so that you can put in the tealight. It does not come completely off. You can use this inside on your table or hang it from a shepherd's hook outside for a special look and ambiance. I really liked putting in a LED battery operated tealight and seeing the butterflies glow and show up on my walls. This would make a cute gift for someone who loves butterflies or whimsical things.I received this product for free for my unbiased review.

"High quality Salon Model Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron by HSI Professional! I have owned a few of their products as well as irons and have been very pleased with everything they make. I have owned a variety of flat irons over the last 25 years~expensive high end ones as well as the generic brand that you can find at your local Drug store. This HSI Professional Salon Model iron is great and does not disappoint!Here are a few highlights:*DURABILITY~1 1/4"" Ceramic Plates that will last for years*HEATS up in seconds~Temp goes up to 450 degrees!!!*Rounded shape~Allows you to not only straighten but curl and flip too!*Rubberized and ergonomic~Better grip and handling*Digital LCD Temperature Control inside iron*Auto Shut-off and SLEEP MODE!*Swivel cord that does NOT tangle and get caught while in useI am really impressed with this iron as it gets super hot REALLY fast!!  The iron does not lose heat like some others and is always ready to use. I wanted to mention that I like their argan oil that is included in the box and I use it often on my hair to tame the frizz and to keep my hair healthy.Since this is the Salon Edition, it does not come with a storage case or a glove. Also, the LCD screen is inside the iron, which honestly isnt the best place for it.

"This would make a terrific baby shower gift. This Eco-Friendly Certified Organic Cotton Receiving Blanket is 40"" x 40"" size and I bought it in pink. The cotton has a ribbed texture and the cotton is soft. This blanket could be used for swaddling as well as a blanket that you use in the stroller or on the changing table.The box itself measures 11"" x 7"" and is the cutest box that would be perfect to give. Since it is 100% cotton, it does shrink just a little bit. It says on the box that the shrinkage will be around 7-10%. I washed it on cold and a gentle cycle and had no issue. I also keep it out to air dry instead of putting the blanket in the dryer.Great product, nicely made as well as good for the environment!! 5 stars!I received this product at a discounted rate for my unbiased review.

"Handcrafted by a family business!! I encourage everyone to buy from a family business and handmade products. So much time and effort goes into these book cuffs...you can see the quality as soon as you receive them!! I absolutely LOVE handmade items. These dark grey crocheted boot cuffs are so well done and will go with any color boot really. The style is so versatile.The acrylic yarn that is used to make these is super soft and comfy on your legs. I love the added style and texture you can have with these leg warmers without all the bulk if they were full length.  I also like that these are cuffs that you can just pull up your leg. Personally these are much easier than the ones with buttons. This set measures approximately 6 1/2 inches in length. I ordered the large size (calf size 15""-17"")  and they ran true to size. Remember that with this yarn, there is a stretch to it. I love the little added card that says Tina Crochet Studio and has the little red crocheted heart! These are made by a family owned and run business. They make these boot cuffs with love for sure since so much time goes into handcrafting these that the money they are asking is as if it is a gift of love. I really do love these and love the fact they are handmade. What a perfect gift for the holiday season!I received this product for free for my unbiased review.

"These Silicone Cupcake Liners~Baking Cups from Craviy are a must have in every kitchen!

For this price, you can't beat the value and should get a few sets even for gifts! I have used these already to make my ""egg"" muffins. I place egg whites and a mixture of meats and veggies such as turkey bacon and sausage.

"I am a HUGE fan of coloring lately. I bought a few coloring books and have been looking for quality colored pencils to color with. These Arespark 48 colored pencils are a wonderful set to have. I LOVE the variety of different colors. Many sets here on Amazon have what looks like a good variety however, there are alot of colors in the sets that are so close in color that they are not so useful.These pencils are a better quality pencil. They draw smoother and easier than others. You do not have to apply pressure to get them to draw well. The colors are highly pigmented. The pencils are also numbered!! The other sets I have, none of the pencils came numbered. So this is a huge plus for me. You can remember what numbered pencil you used for what area of the picture. Lastly, the shape of the pencils help them not to roll around like traditional pencils do.I really like these and found no problems with sharpening them. I just wish they came in a better box, maybe one that opened so you can see the pencils better.

"Great quality Sentey Tyon Headphones. These come professionally packaged and would make a perfect gift! At this price point, these headphones are a great deal.At first, I was a little confused how these were supposed to fit well in the ear. I quickly figured out that the speaker (ear piece part) goes in your ear almost upside down since the wire is to go around your ear and not down your body first. Hope that makes sense. If you look at their stock pictures it shows you. Any other way of placing them in your ear, will NOT work and they will not hold well. When you place them in correctly, they fit like a glove! I absolutely LOVE that feature! The wire has the appropriate stiffness to be able to mold it around your ear comfortably.The wire is long and is about 4 1/2 feet! This gives you enough room to attach it to your phone while you are working out. I usually put my phone in the cup holder and this long cable gives me the needed length! The silicone earbuds are included in 3 different sizes so you can find ones that work well in your ears. These headphones give you good noise cancellation and help you have a better listening experience. The in-line microphone allows you to answer and hang up a call if you have it connected to your cell phone. The button on the cable can be used to pause and play your music when listening.As for sound quality, Sentey does not disappoint! I really think they give such CLEAR sound. The treble and mids are perfect but the bass could be better. I prefer a harder hitting bass but that is my personal preference and does not take away from the great sound these do have.  I also like that these headphones are sweat resistant since that is important when working out with them. The cable does detach if you want to clean the earpiece by itself. These Tyon Headphones are durable and lightweight and really cannot be beat for this price.I received this product as a sample for my unbiased review. I try and test each product and give my honest opinions in hopes to help other buyers make informed decisions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REG6L8Z38245H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMZ746#wasThisHelpful","REG6L8Z38245H","AV6P3RQNDLG1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV6P3RQNDLG1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"LOVE these socks! These Bemaystar Nordic Wool Socks are so great that I have 2 sets of them that I wear often.  Wool socks that are NOT itchy!! They are crazy comfortable and soft. They are lightweight enough that you can really wear them year round. Even in Arizona, we can use a good warm sock in the winter! These are high quality well made socks!!Super good deal at $3.12 a pair! Not that I will... but you can keep a few of them and give a few. Its a family tradition in my family that we get new socks for Christmas every year.  So really who can have too many socks??!! They make perfect gifts...I am going to stick a pair in each teachers gift bag for Christmas along with some other goodies.You will not be disappointed in these at all! I am a size 7.5/8 in shoes and these socks fit perfect on my feet and even the top of the sock is not too tight on my calf. I personally hate knee high socks since they are always tight on my calf. You will not have that issue with these socks. The toe box and the heel are reinforced so they will last longer.

"I am completely impressed with these Cave Tools BBQ Grill Tools Set! It is super Heavy Duty and is not flimsy at all! I have received a few sets in the past months and all of them I sent back because the quality was so poor. This set has large tools that are thick enough that you will not be able to bend them in half. Seriously, some sell BBQ tools that are so thin, you touch them and they start to bend. Cave Tools for sure are the best!In Arizona, we grill all year round and I love the taste of meat grilled. That being said, my husband is picky with his tools. Whether it be tools for his car or tools for the grill! He loved these and put them to use right away.This set comes with 3 tools that are made entirely of stainless steel. Easy to clean and air dry. The spatula is slotted and is thick enough to hold the meat and flip it without the meat or fish breaking apart. The spatula also has a serrated edge that you can use to cut your food. The fork is well made also and will not bend easily at all. The tongs are great and have some weight to them so that it makes it easier to hold the meat. All 3 tools have nice handles that work well for a woman as well as a man and all 3 tools have loops on the ends so you can hang them up if you choose to.Overall, Cave Tools makes a good looking, great quality BBQ tool set that will last MUCH longer than the average set that you buy here on Amazon or at a big box store!!

I do LOVE these Earthy Fall Colors as they are perfect for fall themes and Thanksgiving too!When you first get these markers, you will have to prime them the first time you use them. In order to do this, you will need to take off the cap and with the tip upright and then you will press it gently to release the pressure and you can usually hear the air release. Next, you will put the cap back on and shake with the pen upright. Then you will press the tip all the way down onto a piece of paper until the tip fills with ink. Once it fills with ink you are ready to go. This took no more than 20 seconds for me.Here are a few highlights:*Set of 10~comes nicely boxed!*Smooth and easy to write with*Non-toxic and water based!*No smell~Great to use with children*Can be used on all non-porous surfaces~please test each surface in a inconspicuous spot first!*Reversible tips~chisel and a rounded tip*More details and shading you can create than traditional chalk*Easy to wipe off with a damp clothWhat makes Chalk Markers better? No dust like traditional chalk so NO MESS!! When you are writing lettering comes out so much better and easier to read. I love to have these handy to write encouraging quotes on my fridge so that everyday I am reminded of positive things. I had no problem at all taking mine off from any of the surfaces that I have tried. Highly recommend these!I received this product for free for my unbiased review. I try and test each product and give my honest opinions in hopes to help other buyers make informed decisions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ESGP1DKPLEG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011KQVRAY#wasThisHelpful","R3ESGP1DKPLEG6","AV6P3RQNDLG1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV6P3RQNDLG1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 100% Pure Copper Moscow Mule Mug makes every drink colder and better! It does not have to be just alcohol, I put my Diet Coke in my mug and I love it. This comes nicely boxed so it would make a terrific gift for the Holiday Season.Here are a few highlights:*WELL MADE~Strong solid copper to last a lifetime!*Polished nicely inside and out*Handle is 100% copper and riveted to the mug*NO Nasty Taste of Metal*NO nickel, tin, or any metal liningI really like this mug and actually like the way they riveted the handle on the mug. The other mugs that I have purchased before did not have that feature as the handles were always welded on. The rivets make the mug look more expensive and well made in my opinion. My drinks stay much cooler and in Arizona that is important in the summertime! 5 stars!I received this product as a sample for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IY6WW04TJPSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0169DX40O#wasThisHelpful","R1IY6WW04TJPSV","AV6P3RQNDLG1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV6P3RQNDLG1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Can I say AWESOME?!!! Flu and cold season is upon us and this product will be the answer for me and my family!! I honestly never even heard of essential oil inhalers before so I was so excited to try them.I have recently been using essential oils and more natural products this year and have noticed that they are so much better for your health and usually more effective. mEssentials has created an ALL NATURAL 100% Pure Essential Oil Inhaler that is comprised of 7 different oils. Eucalyptus, Helichrysum, Lavender, Peppermint, Pine, Tea Tree, and Ravensara. So I was curious what Helichrysum and Ravensara was since all the other oils I had heard of.Helichrysum is a flower and the oil is often used to provide quick relief from coughs. It is also an anti-inflammatory oil that helps soothe your body as well as help you if you have a fever. This powerful oil detoxifies your liver, relieves congestion and can help uplift your spirit and mental function!Ravensara is a big tree from the rain forests of Madagasar. It is praised in Madagasar as the ""Cure All"" oil. It has been used for centuries for fighting infections. Ravensara is a powerful antiseptic that can help kill bacteria and inhibit its growth. Also Ravensara is necessary in cases of coughs, congestion and asthma & breathing problems as it helps open up the bronchi in your lungs!Hope that helped....I am really impressed with these and how they work. The description states that each inhaler is shrink wrapped however that is not the case. The box was shrink wrapped when I received them, but the individual inhalers are not. Just wanted to clarify. Honestly, I do not think it would effect the freshness....as each inhaler is open and closed by screwing the bottom part.I love that this is natural product that is made in the USA!! I love that this can be used by the entire family and is safe for kids! You can take one inhale and you can see right away that these oils are powerful. I feel like my family is armed for the flu and cold season for sure. You will not be disappointed with these...they are great!I received this product as a sample for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLFUHGJPEY3B6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015TOVKW8#wasThisHelpful","RLFUHGJPEY3B6","AV6P3RQNDLG1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV6P3RQNDLG1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked this 2 different pieces of DOB Bakeware. As you can see in my pictures, they come nicely boxed. The red silicone mold is on the smaller side. I took a picture so you can see it in relation to the size of my hand. The mold measures 7 inches round. I am a HUGE fan of silicone in general since silicone pieces of bakeware last literally FOREVER! They clean easily and all your food pops right out with no mess and perfect everytime. It will not hurt to spray a little Pam in the mold since it has so many crevices. I plan on using this heart mold for waffles, brownies, cakes and chocolate!!Onto the tart pan...It is 9 inches round and is well made. This pan has a removable bottom which makes life SO much easier especially when making a small cheesecake or tart. I like the scalloped edging, it adds a fancy touch. I think I will be making a large cookie in this one soon for my daughters birthday that is coming up next week. Its a perfect size for her small class at school.Oh, and I can't forget the red lifting tool that is included as well. This will help you take those waffles out when they are done and help with other baking needs also.Overall, I think these pieces are quality bakeware pieces and will be enjoyed for years to come. I think that this is not really a traditional ""set"". The do not really go together in my opinion. However, they are great on their own and I am glad that I purchased them.I received this product at a discounted rate for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I0WRU1WOWM70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0157RQM2A#wasThisHelpful","R1I0WRU1WOWM70","AV6P3RQNDLG1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV6P3RQNDLG1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Everyone needs good dish towels and this Fabresh set are high quality ones. My only wish is that they could make some larger ones. These towels are 12 x 12 and are smaller than the dish towels I am currently using. That being said, these are soft and very absorbent.Here are a few highlights:*LIGHTWEIGHT~Makes them dry faster!*DURABLE~65% Microfiber/35% cotton blend*Washes well~Remember NO FABRIC SOFTENER!*Fabric is soft and absorbs well!*NO LINT!!*Cleans well with only water or a little spray of natural cleaner!*Material does NOT fray or tear!These Fabresh Kitchen Towels are super for drying dishes as well as cleaning up messes. I prefer microfiber towels since they are reusable so in the long term you save so much money. They also wash well and stay new looking longer. I am always amazed how well they clean when using just water. Just always remember to never use fabric softener when washing them since the fabric softener does effect the way microfiber absorb and deteriorates the fabric faster.

"Love this pack of 4 Hot/Cold Ice Packs from IceWraps! I have owned a few of their products and have been pleased with all of them.

The camera easily connects through wifi to any android power device. The camera records high quality. high definition video and is similar to his GoPro. In my opinion, it is a far less expensive alternative with identical features.This camera came with a Waterproof case, Skeleton case, 2 batteries, Wrist, Head and a Handlebar Mount, Suction Cup Mount and additional 3M surface mount plates.

"So I have tried this VIIcode Oxygen Eye Mask for 2 times now and have seen some positive changes. First of all, I was contacted by the seller and was given the opportunity to try this mask out for review purposes. However, this listing is for 6 boxes and I received 1 box and a very small tube of the eye cream. This was ok since it was enough to try it out and see what results I could have with this product.I was skeptical at first since this product is to be worn ALL night long. I do sleep on my stomach and on my side so I was concerned about whether this eye mask would even stay on. Well, the eye mask did stay put and so that was good....however, it does feel weird to have something around your eye sockets all night long. Both times I used this, I had the eye mask on for about 5 hours until it annoyed me and woke me up and then I just took them off.So the good part....The eye masks are very cooling when you put them on. When I did remove them, a little of the gel remained under my eye but I just patted it in and everything was fine. When looking in the mirror in the morning, I did notice a smoothing of the fine lines that I do have (I am 41 so they are starting to be evident). Also on a postive note, the feeling of the under eye skin was super soft and hydrated looking. All of this is very good, however a few days later there was no real change until you would put the mask on again.Overall, I really do like what it did for my eyes. I think it would be great when you have a special event the next day or pictures that need to be taken. Long term, I am not sure what it really is accomplishing and for this price point it needs to do more. I think that they need to come up with a better, more efficient application process since wearing the masks all night is not working for me.I received this product as a sample for unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q5ZB0526NJ51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111NPLSA#wasThisHelpful","R1Q5ZB0526NJ51","AV6P3RQNDLG1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV6P3RQNDLG1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"DALSTRONG did it again! This is the second product from Dalstrong that I have purchased and I am impressed once again. This ceramic knives set has exceeded my expectations hands down and I think it will for you as well. You receive this set in a beautiful professional magnetic closure box.  When you open the box, you will notice that Dalstrong paid attention to every detail by even showing you how to properly use a ""pinch grip"" for when you use the chef knife. Underneath that, they go over slicing techniques to help out an amateur like me. I thought it was super helpful. Lastly, Dalstrong has included a full color booklet that talks about the set of knives, how to take care of them, and the technology behind what makes Dalstrong different from the rest.Here are a few highlights:*3"" Pairing, 4"" Slicing, 5"" Utility knife and 6"" Chef Knife~Makes for a perfect set!*SUPER SHARP!

"Italian candies at their finest! I wanted to buy these so that I can eat a few and give the rest to my grandmother. She is from Italy and loves these. She would always have them in her purse for as long as I can remember. She is going to be thrilled when I give them to her.This set is awesome and comes with 8 different flavors...Lemon, Orange, Strawberry, Raspberry, Tangerine, Mixed Wild Berries, Blueberry, and Mixed Flavours. Leone Pastiglie is one of the oldest confection companies in Italy that specialize in pastilles and candies. These candy boxes are super cute and come nicely packaged in old fashion paper and are sealed with a gold sticker. They all have expiration dates on them as well. What you will notice is that the dates are at least a year or two out, so you have plenty of time to eat them or give them as gifts.These Italian pastilles from Leone are flavored and colored with only the pure essence of plants.  They are meant to be dissolved on the tongue. So don't bite them and let them dissolve! Even though they look like that would taste chalky, they are tasty and smooth and a treat! Great set!I received this product at a discounted rate for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTWSPU620KG2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZH5L7U#wasThisHelpful","RTWSPU620KG2D","AV6P3RQNDLG1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV6P3RQNDLG1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Darts that really do stick! I wasn't sure if this Magnetic Dart Board was going to be better than the average ones that I have owned or seen in the past, but this one is. My husband and I played as soon as it arrived. The Dart Board comes in a nice cardboard tube that it is rolled up in. When you take it out, it will take a little time to flatten out completely. So, just place a couple of heavy books on it and that will help.The magnet is strong on this board and not one time did a dart fall off! My husband went to see if the dart board would stick to the refrigerator, but because of the weight of the rod on the top, it did not stick. So, we hung the dart board on the wall and had an awesome time playing. This would make a perfect gift for that person that has everything. I would highly recommend this magnetic dart board as it was definitely made well and works well.I received this product at a discounted rate for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P130U785BUEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01294K5L8#wasThisHelpful","R1P130U785BUEL","AV6P3RQNDLG1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV6P3RQNDLG1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great lightweight Foot Cream by LeliaSea! Foot Cream is a MUST HAVE especially when you leave in Arizona. My feet are really bad. I walk barefoot everywhere and have dried and crack heels most of the time. That being said, I have tried my fair share of foot creams.This Foot Cream by LeliaSea is a lightweight foot cream that does not require alot of product to be used to be effective. I find that a little bit spreads well and covers the whole foot.This Foot Cream instantly gets absorbed!! Seriously! Probably the best in absorption that I have tried in a long time. I couldn't believe my foot was dried as quickly as I finished the other foot. I usually apply the foot cream at night and cover my feet with socks. By morning on the few days that I have used this cream so far, my heels looked much better and smoother.  I also want to point out that the smell is a light floral smell that does not last long...so if you have any issues with fragrance...the scent is not overpowering.Overall, this is a high quality foot cream that needs to come in a bucket size for me. You will not be disappointed with this one.I received this product at a discounted rate for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1206JEFVEVII1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0156RBC6M#wasThisHelpful","R1206JEFVEVII1","AV6P3RQNDLG1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AV6P3RQNDLG1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, I would like to extend a heartfelt ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù to Melissa Jagears and her publisher for sending me a copy of ""A Bride At Last"" to review for them. I am truly grateful for this generosity. I really appreciate the time, effort and expense it takes to make a reviewer copy available to me.'A Bride at Last' by Melissa Jagears starts as an emotionally charged work of fiction from the very first page which transports the reader back in time where life seemed very different than it is today.  Kate Dawson adores her student, Anthony, and has been caring for him during his mother‚Äôs illness.  Now that Lucy is gone, Kate is expecting Anthony‚Äôs father to arrive in town to take the boy and make a home for him.Silas Jonesey shows up and puts Kate on edge as she confronts the fact that Anthony is going to live somewhere else, but when Richard also shows up and lays claim to the boy, Kate aligns herself with Silas even though Lucy had less than stellar things to say about both men.  Silas and Richard were both summoned by letters from Lucy, so they both believe they are the boy‚Äôs father.This is a touching love story of a man, a woman and a child with lots of humor.  I laughed out loud as the story played out in my mind‚Äôs eye.  I was also choked up by the touching sentiments expressed in the building of a family.  But the story dragged in spots and there was more conflict than I usually like in a book I‚Äôm reading to be entertained.  Still, ‚ÄúA Bride At Last‚Äù contains valuable life lessons about love and forgiveness.  I do recommend it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37DIVN8IHRC78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764211706#wasThisHelpful","R37DIVN8IHRC78","AMLA0B6EHD4OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMLA0B6EHD4OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"EAS 100% Whey Protein, Chocolate Flavored, is a convenient powder supplement to aid in the building of muscle.  I love the packaging.  The shape and size store more easily than the big, bulky round protein powder containers.  I love how the scoop stores inside the lid.  No more getting lost and having to dig through the powder if it gets shaken up.  The flavor is okay.  It's on the bland side for my taste, so I mixed it with coconut-almond milk and a banana to make it a bit tastier.I do think this is a good way to end a workout.

I am truly grateful for this generosity. I really appreciate the time, effort and expense it takes to make a reviewer copy available to me.'Thriving in Babylon' by Larry Osborne is an inspiring read.  Twenty packed chapters will educate and encourage the reader to be influential in whatever environment we are planted.  Using the prophet Daniel and his time in captivity in Babylon as the setting to parallel our own pagan-ish culture, the Bible comes to life and begs to be applied to daily existence today.Larry Osborne has filled these pages with humor and frank honesty about how Christians can influence a non-believing environment by blooming where we are planted.  Daniel‚Äôs God-given characteristics of hope, wisdom and humility enabled him to influence kings.  Those same qualities can be developed within us today and be persuasive in the name of Christ.  The reader will come to see trials and testing as beneficial happenings that mold and shape us and make us more usable for God‚Äôs kingdom.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10SQVX4A6FF14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKTCXEU#wasThisHelpful","R10SQVX4A6FF14","AMLA0B6EHD4OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMLA0B6EHD4OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Melissa Spoelstra's ""Jeremiah - Daring to Hope in an Unstable World"" is a potentially life-changing Bible study that can be done at several different levels.  I am using this guide as part of my daily quiet time.  I don't have the Leader Kit, so I am not watching the full-length videos, but I did watch the short clips of each session at Melissa's website and I believe that the video teaching will add a lot to the study.  I am also taking on the challenge to read through the book of Jeremiah over the next six weeks.  This is a challenging study that I will refer to over and over again.The one thing I've noticed that I will need to put some effort into investigating is the fun facts in the margins of the study.  The first one says that Jeremiah is the longest book in the Bible, but I actually believe it is the second longest.  Psalms is the longest.  This aside, the Biblical teaching appears to be solid so far.

"he book by Wolraich is a compilation of interactions between Teddy Roosevelt and LaFollette. It is in a sense a tale of some of the competing views of the early 20th Century Progressives. Two individuals who were almost single minded in their views, often unable to compromise, yet from totally different worlds.Now a great deal has been written about Teddy yet little extensive work has been done on LaFollette. Teddy was brusque and not known as a deep thinker. He often acted first and then tried to develop a strategy for his acts, a justification. As Chief of Police for New York City he did manage to set a pace for organization and reform. His move into the Progressive side of politics has been analyzed as both a politically astute move as well as a move precipitated by his lack of acceptance of the moneyed cadres of New York. Teddy was also an ‚Äúaccidental President‚Äù. After his ascendancy his ideas and style was formed as he moved forward.Now Wolraich has focused on these two individuals and their personal battles. LaFollette was a mid-western Progressive who saw the industrialized and financial element of the capitalist society at the turn of the century as the antithesis of American values as he interpreted them. He viewed, as did Teddy, the Government could proactively intervene and correct the perceived imbalances.The style of Wolraich is one of day by day tales of this series of interactions. They are almost akin to reading newspaper blurbs as to the high points on what the author considers the key days. It is purely chronological and it lays out the ongoing conflicts between LaFollette the true believer and Teddy the pragmatic patrician.The author starts with the events on May 18, 1904 and continues sporadically by various days until November 5, 1912. In effect it ends with Teddy‚Äôs defeat in the 1912 election. This election led to Wilson being ushered into the White House and resulting in a Wilsonian Progressive movement. Whereas Teddy thought the Presidency imperial, it was Wilson who actually made it so, for the first time in peace and then in war. The Progressive thought of Wilson was that of Croly and New York Progressivism, and not that of LaFollette. This interplay of Progressive thought is not made evident in the book.There are also many ironies such as Senator Aldrich was the grandfather of Nelson Rockefeller, the centrist Republican from New York, and in a sense one of the last if not last Progressive leaning Republicans.On the positive side the text is quite readable and the use of the day by day paradigm does assist the reader in seeing the progression of the relationship.On the negative side the book lacks a real discussion of the Progressive movement and the extent to which it was accepted. There are many excellent books on Progressives at this time and it would help if he had been steeped in them before attempting to read this text. The further conflict between Progressives and Socialists is also a key factor in grasping what was occurring. In a sense the Progressives were more classic ‚ÄúAmericans‚Äù whereas the Socialists oftentimes were more the immigrant class, a generalization more often true than not. LaFollette was the classic Progressive, seeing the Government as the vehicle to remedy the takeover of the American society by the moneyed forces from the East. For Teddy this was a bit of a bumpier road since he owed much of her very identity to those circles.The book by Sidney M. Milkis  is a valuable academic contribution to the development of Teddy as a Progressive. That of the current author is interesting but it often reads as a gossip column report rather than a well-developed explanation of Progressive thought and the two players. In addition the presence of Herbert Croly made Progressive thought an element of what we see today and it was Croly who managed to plant the seed in Wilson who defeated Teddy in 2012 .Overall the book is reasonably well written, the style gives structure and it tells the ongoing battles between these two individuals. Yet it lacks the depth necessary to understand Progressive thought then and of course now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PWYHCTGSKGZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=023034223X#wasThisHelpful","R1PWYHCTGSKGZM","A24VVPS1D44TY7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24VVPS1D44TY7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The text by Gere and Goodno is a current version of the study of Strength of Materials, that element of Statics and Structures which considers the effects of loads on structures and ascertaining the maximum carrying capacity.There are three main elements in understanding the subject:1. Understanding the basic elements of statics; namely i. the sum of forces and moments equal zero, ii. stress is a force per unit area, iii. strain is a multiple of stress unless it is no longer so.2. Applying geometry and trigonometry to static systems. This means having a good grasp of angles and distances so as best to allocate loads.3. Paying attention to units. There is often a plethora of mixed units from lbs, N, kg, g, Pa, etc thus must be equated and often lead to either over or under stating the results.That is it. There frankly is not much more. Like books covering this material for well over a hundred years this text does so as well. The coverage includes:1. Stress and strain principles.2. Applications to beams and cylinders. This is where getting the geometry correct starts to become important.3. Bending of beams. This is the classic analysis of beams and determining maximum stress and seeing if one‚Äôs design is well within limits.4. Columns and similar structures.5. Indeterminate structures, the ones where there are an excess of givens.6. Collapse and breakage.These topics are all classic ones. The text is targeted at the undergraduate market.I first took this material some fifty five years ago using a text by Shanley. The difference is striking. Let me list them:1. Cost: The price then was in the single digits yet accounting for inflation the current text is 3 to 4 times more costly.2. Pictures: Like so many texts this is filled with color pictures driving up the cost and actually distracting from the pedagogical approach. One wonders why the authors allow the publisher to embellish the text with a plethora of unrelated materials. Do the students today demand this entertainment?3. Cohesion. The text covers the material expected but does so in my opinion in a somewhat confusing manner at times. This issue is enhanced at times by the layout of examples where the color and presentation make them unreadable and confusing.4. Problems. In today‚Äôs environment there are many computer based approaches and tools that having hundreds of rote problems is questionable. Back in the late 50s and early 60s all we had was a slide rule. That in a sense reinforced structure. An engineer used engineering paper, paper with many small squares, to write down the problem, then draw the structure, lay out the approach to a solution and then step by step go through the process carefully checking units and calculations and finally underlining the answer for the grader. The process of doing this reinforces the concepts. Today there is a loose amalgam of back of the envelope calculations, spread sheets and even some home brewed programming. Thus perhaps the problems should be changed to reflect the design approach and not some set of PE Exam questions.5. Focus. As one progresses through the material one jumps from a concept to an example to a set of questions. There is in my opinion a confusing jump from principles, extensions, and examples.Overall the text does present the material, it is complete, and it can be obtained, albeit with some difficulty. I suspect that if one works through the problems one will do well on the PE exams. However there may be a disconnect from the academic and the practical.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F6F7537ESE6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1111577730#wasThisHelpful","R1F6F7537ESE6B","A24VVPS1D44TY7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24VVPS1D44TY7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The problem with this cot is that there were initially no instructions and then the end assemblies were near impossible to install. There were two end units required and to get them attached you needed two people to rotate them over the knobs which would hold them. The design and the instructions left you wondering what best to do. With two people one could, after about 30 minutes, get them attached. Disassembling was not as difficult. I suspect that if one did this in the field that it would be near impossible.The cot does seem to function well after assembly, however the assembly is a key factor in its use. If the pins on the end were spring loaded and retractable perhaps it could improve assembly but it would still leave dis-assembly an issue.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34U5I8NS3WBCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009S3BA4K#wasThisHelpful","R34U5I8NS3WBCY","A24VVPS1D44TY7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24VVPS1D44TY7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to replace a Troy tiller. The Troy one had several design flaws such as a gas line that rubbed against the hot engine and would continually split and gas would leak. The Earthquake looked like a better design. It is.1. It starts quickly and seems to have little problems there.2. The on-off switch is encapsulated so that it does not suffer from the Troy problem of getting dirt in it and breaking.3. The tilling is more than adequate and the depth bar is easily manipulated via a spring mechanism.4. It was easy to assemble, took about 5 minutes.5. I have used it over the small field we have and it does a great job.On the negative side my only concern was the need to adjust the wheels so as to transport and till, it needs to go from one extreme to the other.

"Yes, it is a massive text, but so too is the topic. It has been a couple of decades since I had studied this in such a broad context but in reading this so much came back. The text is of the highest quality and the color photography is one of the best I have ever seen. The authors have presented a comprehensive overview.Each time they get to a new Division they provide a great summary of how each reproduces. The subtleties of the meiotic/mitotic process is a key part of understanding the evolution. All too often I have found amongst physicians especially is that all they know is human mitosis and meiosis. The wonderful complex of plants opens a whole new world.The authors start with the art and science of collecting, and this is quite useful if one has any interest in following through. They then proceed from fungi through angiosperms. Each path is complete and explained fully.My interest has been in the Ginkgo which I grow perhaps in excess. Their discussion is one of the best I have seen. Their discussions on conifers is also superb. Angiosperms as ""Johny Come Lately"" get coverage but limited by their recent presence.The book has a superb set of references, almost a text in itself and a great deal of support materials.For anyone interested in the evolution of plants this is truly the best I have ever seen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ACPKAWI3N803/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0123739721#wasThisHelpful","R1ACPKAWI3N803","A24VVPS1D44TY7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24VVPS1D44TY7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Comparative Effectiveness Research by Ashton and Wray is an exceptionally well written presentation of the issues and politics behind CER through the current time. As the authors state, there are many definitions of what CER or its implementation as Comparative Clinical Effectiveness (""CCE"") is. A simple but reasonable definition is that CER is the process of examining various modalities of medical treatment for some specific disease state and the determination of what one may be the most effective according to some metric (See pp 122-123 for various definitions). CCE is then the dissemination of the results of the CER and its use in day to day clinical practice. An additional condition on CER is that unlike FDA randomized clinical trials the CER is conducted in ""real life"" clinical environments. In the current ACA the CER has been embodied in a non-Governmental entity called PCORI. This book ultimately is a justification of this entity, its purpose and goals and the very nature of its embodiment. Fundamentally the authors make presentations which covers the need for CER/CCE and then provide an exceptionally detailed and well written expose of how it was ultimately implemented in the ACA and why.Let me first summarize the material presented and then I will provide a critique on it and the approach taken by the authors.Part I of the book covers the principles of evidence based research and practice. Part II presents the political story of the development of PCORI and the institutionalization of CER/CCE under the ACA. Part III is the authors' presentation of their views on the politics and the implementation and usefulness of CER/CCE.On p 23 the authors use the prostate cancer (""PCa"") studies as a vehicle to discuss CER. This relates to procedures which are used to treat PCa. PCa can be treated in a variety of means, ranging from surgery, radiation therapy, nuclear implants, proton beam, and the cheapest, called watchful waiting. The problem with PCa is that about 90% of it is indolent, namely the patient will never die from it and the treatment is worse than the disease. However some 10% or so, we really do not know the number is aggressive. The typical case goes from a PSA of 4 to 40 in two years and 40 to dead in another two. The challenge is how do we save the 10% while not making the 90% have a higher morbidity? The therapies all too often depend on who the patient see and not based upon any clinical evidence of efficacy or patient satisfaction, the Patient Reported Outcomes (""PRO""). The problem the authors have here is that the problem is more complex than how they present it and it is that complexity that the physician does or should intermediate with.On p 51 the authors again come back to PCa. Now they address the issue of robotic surgery. It is costly, is advertised, and results in less than clear advantages. Now for clarity purposes the robot is not really some autonomous entity. It merely allows for better controlled movements under the total control of the surgeon. Prostatectomies are difficult because of all the nerve involvement and one prostate is not necessarily the same as all others. The intent is to remove all the malignancy while retaining nerve functions. Frankly a superb surgeon can do this without any ""robot"" and usually do. The problem is that the patients may not have a clue and somehow want the ""robot"". Thus the authors make a good argument for CER/CCE being targeted at not only the physicians but the patients.Chapter 3 is an excellent expose of FDA assessment of therapeutics. The FDA has over the last half century developed a set of scientifically based procedures to ascertain the safety and efficacy of drugs. This is the randomized placebo based clinical Trials. There generally are three phases before approval and hopefully by the end of Phase III we can rely on the therapeutic doing what is says and not having any morbidity or mortality effects. Sometime that is not the case since the Trials are small and may not be large enough for some of the negative effects. The authors explain this in superb detail.Chapter 4 will make all surgeons happy. Not really. It is a discussion on the fact that all too often surgeons perform procedures for which there may be little if any clinical evidence. To take the authors back even further, in the 40s and 50 tonsillectomies were almost a child's rite of passage. The Table on p 82 is a good example of the many surgeries performed where there is little if any evidence of efficacy.P 103 discusses the problems with imaging. I remember in 1972 when the second CAT system was introduced to MGH. It allowed a neurologist to ascertain a block of bleed stroke. It was quick and saved lives. The problem now is that when a CAT is performed, along with massive amounts of radiation, one can find ""incidental"" observations which then demand follow up despite no clinical evidence of necessity other that shadows.On p 113 the authors commence discussing the creation of clinical guidelines.  The problem, however, is that all too often medical knowledge changes so quickly that the physician is incorporating this knowledge in the way they treat a patient. On the other hand the compilation of CCE procedure such as that proposed by the USPTF is based upon oftentimes decade's old data which was predicated on now outdated medical practice. This is the fundamental flaw of CCE guidelines. They are outdated and often too static. If then developed by Governmental entities they may also often end up becoming the least common denominator.On p 130-131 the authors make the attempt in discussing the concept of ""producing a public good"" as the basis for arguing that only the Government can be the creator and manager of CER/CCE. Frankly this is the weakest part of the book and would best have been left aside. However it does provide a vehicle to understand from whence the authors come at this issue.The Part II discussions are quite interesting. The authors clearly present the Washington drama behind the development of the PCORI side of the ACA, pre current Administration and in the current Administration. For anyone interested in Washington politics this compares well with Woodward and his presentations. The influence of the various stakeholders is discussed and for those not familiar with Washington the key role of Congressional Staff is portrayed effectively.On p 193 as I comment on later, the authors go off on Rush Limbaugh. Clearly the ACA was a political issue and received not a single Republican vote. Yet the Limbaugh discussion has a question of relevancy. They continue on p 195 regarding the death panel issues etc. Inflamed words are all too often used in politics and one must ask; what was the basis of this phrase? To some degree, being part of the discussion at the time, it related directly to CCE, and the NHS use of QALY measures in the UK. Namely if one examines the PCa problem, then using a USPTF result and the recommendation to no use PSA on any many over 75, and also mammograms in women over 75, despite what health they may be in and despite any family predispositions, was sending a chilling effect to those affected.Chapter 10, p 208 and on, is an excellent presentation of PCORI, the non-Governmental entity set up to do CER and assist it to be converted into CCE recommendations. Any reader interested should go to their web site as well. It is too early to determine what they will accomplish but with a $500 million a year budget paid for by the taxpayers they should have no excuses. However when one looks at the FDA, it took then a good half a century to reach the point where they are today. The FDA still has some issues but it is the sine qua non entity in the world. It has developed methodologies and procedures which albeit costly had led to better safety and efficacy in devices and pharmaceuticals. PCORI lacks many of the elements of the FDA and furthermore it is not clear that it can draw on the competencies that exist in the field. The author's speak of what it can do but fail to discuss just how it will go about it.As the authors reach their concluding comments they seem to go into niches that may or may not be warranted. On 248-249 there is a discussion of the public and scientific evidence. They return to their attack on the ""political Right"" and its ""anti-science"" philosophy. The problem they are discussing is that of educating patients as well as physicians. Again take the PSA issue. What should a general physician know and what should a patient know? Here we have the problem that PSA management is recording test data over significant time spans. Assume starting at 40 years of age baselines should be take and then data analyzed periodically. It is thus not any single reading, as is the case with BP or fasting blood glucose, but the temporal behavior. However physicians do not have the data and patients do not understand it. It is not because patients are politically influenced to not believe it, the Press oftentimes has a stronger confusing influence, but because they do not get the information. Thus the discussions on these pages warrant attention but not the way the authors provide it.On pp 250-251 the authors sink into the Medicare swamp. First to make some statements of fact, more than 45% of those on Medicare have or will have paid in more than they will ever receive in benefits. 55% of participants will have paid in substantially less and will have received a dramatically greater share. Medicare is an insurance plan and not a Government benefit, albeit a bit poorly managed. On p 251 the authors say, ""Medicare is a federal health insurance program, tax-supported, that was established in 1965"" It is tax supported only for that portion of subscribers who have not made enough in their lifetimes. It is subscriber supported by those who have made enough and who continue to make money after 65. This is a distinction and a difference that many fail to understand. It also colors the perception of Medicare of many.One topic that seems not to have been discussed is that of Patient Reported Outcomes (""PRO""), as an integral part of CER. PROs are complicated testing methodologies to ascertain what the patient felt was the result of a procedure. It should be an integral part of any of the CER efforts. I was disappointed that they failed to focus on this area.To examine CER/CCE in some specific detail, let us consider the Prostate Cancer debate. The key observation that one should make is that what we understand in Medicine is changing almost daily so what we think today is common practice will be unacceptable in short order. In 2009 there were two papers published in NEJM, one American and one European, which stated that there was no significant different in death rates between men who were PSA screened and those who were not. Now one can examine the data and see some fundamental flaws, after the fact. The study regarded a PSA level of 4.0 as the point at which one should take action. That was acceptable in 1995 but by 2009 we knew that velocity of PSA, % Free PSA, volume adjusted PSA, as well as age adjusted PSA were more critical. Thus, the reports using a 1995 standard presented results that were devoid of 20 years of information. More importantly, the question posed was: ""Using a PSA of 4.0, and using a PSA testing methodology on a biennial basis, did such a testing procedure have an effect upon mortality?"" The question which should have been asked was: ""Is there a PSA screening methodology which when adjusted for patient classes results in a material change in patient PCa mortality?"" The first question was good for 1995 with the limited knowledge available then. The second question opens the door for expanded insight into temporal PSA evaluation. The problem with many CCE trials is that they fixate on the wrong question and thus produce potentially deleterious rules of treatment.Furthermore as the reports were published a plethora of genetic markers were being developed. Disregarding all of this, the USPTF then graded PSA testing as a D, a level which would prohibit Medicare patients from receiving its benefit. This type of CER/CCE demonstrates the fundamental flaw in CER/CCE in toto. It uses clinically collected data which may be flawed based upon the significant changes in medical knowledge over the time frame of the study and thus potentially inflicting a lethal sequella upon patients. This may not be a death panel but it is flawed medicine.Overall the authors present a clear picture of CER and its positive benefits. However there are two basic flaws in their presentation. First they fail to fully discuss and disclose the fundamental flaws that may be part of CER/CCE. Second, they fill their presentation with comments as regards to conservative opponents which may add some color but on the other hand actually colors their own attempt at a professional presentation. Frankly the book would have been much better served without references to Rush Limbaugh and the negative comments regarding conservatives as a whole.Finally one should more carefully examine PCORI. It is a non-Governmental entity like Ginnie Mae and Fannie Mae, albeit not a financial entity, but it has a $500 million annual fund taken from taxes on insurance plans. Recently PCORI awarded NIH a $5 million contract to study their PRO, patient reported outcome questionnaire, which has been around for a while. What is especially strange is why the Government did not fund NIH directly. In this case the taxpayer pays a tax to the insurance company, which hands it to the IRS, which gives it to The Comptroller of the Currency, which hands it over to PCORI who awards it to NIH who now has to manage the contract as external funding. One estimate is that the $5 million funding may result in $4 million of work at a costs of $12.5 million! Only a Congressionally mandated schema like this would produce such a result. That perhaps is a dark side of the PCORI effort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVXBMI634ZTX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019996856X#wasThisHelpful","RVXBMI634ZTX4","A24VVPS1D44TY7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24VVPS1D44TY7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book by Levin, The Great Debate, is an excellent contribution to the studies of Burke versus Paine. Although their debates are over two centuries ago, they ring true today as well. The questions explored by Levin center around the ""conservatism"" of Burke and the ""progressivism"" of Paine. Although this alignment is attempted, that is much of the text deals with trying to understand both authors in a context interpretable today, in many ways there is a bit of current day ""conservatism"" and ""progressivism"" in both Burke and Paine. There is not one a to one alignment.Levin presents his arguments in an exceptionally clear and concise manner. The book is quite readable and the structure of his argument is built in sections presented in each chapter. One does not have to dig to any depth to see where he wants to take the reader. Levin clearly understands Burke and also has a good grasp of Paine.Burke was the conservative, born in Ireland and raised in the Church of England and a Member of Parliament. His career was highlighted by his writings as compared to any Legislative prowess. Paine was class wise a step or two below Burke, leaving England and starting anew in what was to become the United States. His skill as a pamphleteer was extraordinary and in so doing he absorbed and even created the sense of his times. Paine personally paid for his major work, Common Sense, which in many ways ignited the Revolution.Levin begins by providing a brief overview of the lives of the two men. It is well done but it in some ways fails to dig deeper and understand what may have made a Paine and a Burke. Paine was in a sense an entrepreneur, he abandoned England and his ""place in that society"" to travel to American where he could create the person he became. Paine was the risk taker, seeing the need for change, albeit with risk, and taking the chance. Burke in total contrast knew his places and sought ways to maximize the best as possible his position in that place. Burke not only accepted the system as is but proselytized that system as the sine qua non of how things should be. Paine rejected that system and saw in the individual the path to change.The reader should have some knowledge of the times to best understand some of the content. Let me provide a first example. On p 31 in discussing Burke there is the statement ""Praising the gradualism of the English constitution ..."" First, there is no document in existence which one can call the English Constitution. Second, when one looks for the English constitution one starts with the Magna Carta and then proceeds forward with an amalgam of Laws, Parliamentary proceedings and the rulings from Common Law courts, namely precedents. In addition the English constitution assumes that English society is built around three classes; the Crown, the Aristocracy, and the Commons. Namely, one always knew one's place, and one must act accordingly. It was this theme which flows throughout the book and also was essential to Burke's thought. In contrast in America one could be whatever one wanted, and class was essentially non-existent, thanks in many ways in which the English ruled.There is a second theme that flows throughout the book, individualism. Levin comment on p 29 as follows: ""Burke laid out an argument against radical individualism,"" A major issue which needs clarification is; what is the definition of individualism? This terms in in Burke and it returns a few decades later in de Tocqueville as a major characteristic of America in the early 19th century. Individualism was in many ways a rejection of the Burkean conservatism, namely of a society with an immutable class system, a society of strict structure. On p 36 the author states the core set of points upon which the battle between Burke and Paine rested, namely;""...what makes a government legitimate, what the individual's place is in the larger society, and how each government should think about those who came before and those who will come after.""This question then flows throughout the book. Levin does a splendid job and going back and forth from Burke to Paine and exploring the details of the answers thereto.Chapter 2 presents the two varying views of Nature that each had. These world views become the platforms upon which they build their ideas of government and society. To Burke there is formality and structure. Burke was a traditionalist, a royalist. On p 61 Levin presents the famous quote from Burke's Reflections where he states:""We fear God; we look up with awe to kings; with affection to parliaments; with duty to magistrates; with reverence to priests; and with respect to nobility.""This as Levin note is the totality of Burke's world view. The irony is that Burke, as an Irishman by birth, with a Catholic mother, see reverence to priests of the English Church but death to the priests of the Catholic or Irish Church. Again one must read de Tocqueville's comparative journey through Ireland in the mid-19th Century to best understand this comparison. The question is; is this conservatism or a dogmatic slavish following akin to Stalinism?In contrast Levin ascribes a ""radical liberal thinker"" to Paine (p 57) and these types of thinkers, says Levin, ""leave the human sentiments and role of the imagination out of the understanding of human nature"". This was an Enlightenment battle between reason and custom.In Chapter 3 the author begins a discussion of Justice and Order. He states on p 69, ""For Paine, the appeal to nature is primarily an appeal to justice."" One must ask; what definition of justice do we use here? On p 71 Levin presents an excellent discussion of the integration in Burke's conservatism of utilitarian ideas, a ""procedural conservative"" mind.Chapter 4 is a key chapter wherein the issue of individual choice and obligations (duties) are discussed. This chapter alone is worth reading. As Levin states on p 92; ""The idea of rights sits at the core of Thomas Paine's political philosophy. Rights are the organizing principle of his thought and the prime concern of all his writings about government."" But what is most important is that rights refer to the individual, each individual, qua individual, has the rights. The rights are not group rights; they are rights to the person. Burke vied society as an amalgam, he rejected the individual qua individual. Burke believed in classes, groups, because English society was so structured. Paine understood most clearly as a result of the discussion of the Bill of Rights that they accrued to the person, each and every person. In contrast Levin speaks of Burke on p 101 where he states: ""As Burke sees it, each man is in society not by choice but by birth. And the facts of his birth - the family, the station, and the nation he is born into - exert inescapable demands on him, while also granting him some privileges and protection ..."" One need go no further to understand the difference. To Paine the individual is unbounded in potential, to Burke the individual is molded by eons of history and genetics. England had its Aristocracy, a core element in its English constitution; America had the individual, and the Bill of Rights.Chapter 5 the author discusses Reason and Prescription. Reason is the core to the Enlightenment, namely by reason we can come to truth. Prescription is term defined by Levin on p 1`40 as; ""The term prescription originated in Roman property law, where it referred to ownership by virtue of long-term use, rather than by formal deed."" Simply put, the battle between Reason and Prescription is the battle between what we think NOW is best as compared to what tradition had determined as best. It arguably is what many think is the contrast between liberal and conservative in current day America. I would argue that perhaps that is not the case and that the battle is truly between the individual versus the group. But here in two adjoining chapters Levin lays out the principles as advocated by Burke and Paine, and as battled today.There is an undercurrent discussion in Chapter 5 as well, the discussion on equality. On p 151 there is a discussion of equality and the individual. For Paine one should be allowed to open the discussion up on the laws at least in every generation, for Burke he sees a slow representative government. The issue is the individual and equality. This theme comes again when Paine enters the fray of the French Revolution. The Liberty, Equality, Fraternity motto was focused on Liberty in the Americas and Equality in France. One can see Paine struggling with this issue. Whereas Liberty is consonant with Individualism, Equality may be taken to an extreme and destroy the individual. The resolution is left unsaid.On p 153 the author makes a most important observation; """"He (Paine) argues that every individual is capable of employing his own reason to discern the truth or falsehood of a political question ... Paine believes that every individual has the capacity to begin from scratch, rather than beginning where others left off.""In the Conclusion the author makes the following statement on p 237:""The fundamental utopian goal at the core of Paine's thinking - the goal of liberating the individual from the constraints of the obligations imposed upon him by his time, his place, and his relations to others - remains essential to the left in America.""I would argue that Paine placed power in the individual and not the group and that the left empowers the group often against the individual. Progressive ideas are ideas of group culture and are often opposed to individual culture. Paine I would argue is the champion of the individual and it is Burke who empowers the group. But Levin does a superb job in bringing these issues to the fore. His book is an essential read for anyone who wants to understand the differences in our present day culture and more importantly the bases from which they sprung. What makes a conservative or a progressive? This book helps one think through that process better than any other.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM9282O1Q3H9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465050972#wasThisHelpful","RM9282O1Q3H9A","A24VVPS1D44TY7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24VVPS1D44TY7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Clinical Trials have evolved over the past few decades in multiple dimensions. There are legal, regulatory, statistical, procedural, and clinical dimensions which tend to structure them in ways which were not prevalent to anyone who entered medicine decades earlier. The book by Hulley et al, Designing Clinical Research, is a wonderful overview of most of these dimensions. It brings the reader up to date with many of the key factors which have become part of Trials and give an excellent amount of depth so that the book stands on its own.The book is divided into three major sections; (i) Basics including sampling, trial hypotheses testing and statistical analyses as well and general trial types. (ii) Designs which examines the various types of trials from randomized case control, cross-sectional, and other such classic trial methodologies, (iii) Implementation, including the ethical issues and data management.The Basics provides a reasonable overview of the randomization, sizing, and the establishment of the statistical plan for a Trial. The approach is classic with the null hypothesis approach and the metrics necessary for properly sizing a successful Trial. The presentation is in a summary nature and the reader is either expected to be familiar with the development of the mathematics or just to use the Tabular approaches as presented. There are excellent discussions on various approaches such as continuous versus dichotomous and the material is useful even for those well experienced in the area.The Designing sections go over the details associated with various Trial approaches and discuss the implementation, and the advantages and disadvantages. Again, even for someone already familiar with the material the authors provide added insight well worth the reading. Again when discussing such elements as likelihood designs and Receiver Operating Characteristics the material is of a summary nature, adequate for both understanding and application but not of any material depth. Yet that was never the objective of the book.Finally in implementation the authors present an excellent discussion of the Ethical Issues that are frequently found in many Trials. There are other elements here as well but the Ethical discussions have become more prevalent to current day Trials.The challenge that this and other works on Trials will be facing are the Trial involving genome based approaches. For example in MDS and the use of demethylating therapeutics such as azacytidine and others one may ask the ethical question; if this is demethylating and methylation is both the cause while also being a control in other cells, how long should one wait to see long term effects? In cases such as the BRAF inhibitors in melanoma, what import is the extension of life if the costs are so great? Also how aggressively should one approach multiple drug therapies? Finally, as we see more genetically specific drugs on a patient by patient basis, can Trials like those discussed herein still be considered a gold standard and if not what then would take their place. Therapeutics targeted at a specific genome type will be difficult to analyze as we have with large Trials discussed in the book.Overall the book is a superb overview of Trials and is worth a read by finishing Med Students, Resident, and even those experienced in Trials. It is well written, logically laid out, considers almost all the key questions, and presents information adequate for most.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVZP5XOU6MOPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608318044#wasThisHelpful","RVZP5XOU6MOPK","A24VVPS1D44TY7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24VVPS1D44TY7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book by Dale, Von Schantz and Platt, From Genes to Genomes, is almost perfect. It is a 350 or so page exceptionally well written book describing all the introductory materials one would need to become current with genomes and genomics efforts. As with many of the other books I had around I first looked at this and at a glance set it aside. Then came the moment when I wanted to re-understand something and I opened this book up and I was hooked. It in a clean and clear manner takes the reader from basic DNA principles and through all of the key techniques used in genomic studies today. It avoids getting to complex into any one area and it reads in a straightforward and consistent manner. It is a superb asset for ‚Äúcatching up‚Äù and I suspect for first learning the materials.Chapter 1 is the basic introduction to genes and genomes. It is DNA 101 but it contains little tidbits of essential materials that are all well integrated. One thus starts with a clear understanding where the authors are taking the reader.Chapter 2 is the material on basic gene cloning. It uses the plasmid approach with bacteriophage and does so without burdening the reader with too much overhead and history. This Chapter discusses technique and technology and the reader is given a logical approach to the basics of cloning. Restriction enzymes are introduced and the material is adequate to have enough depth to see how they can be applied. There are, of course, a lot of implementation questions that are left hanging but that is typical of this study. There is a section on ligation and I would like to have seen this carried over a bit when discussing gene knock-outs. We can understand how the genes ligate but the question is how well does this carry-over the later processes.Chapter 3 discusses DNA libraries. This is a wonderful summary of the concept. The graphics supplement the text without over powering it. One example of what I call the cook book facts is demonstrated in p 95 when discussing hybridization. Here is the curve showing how as temperature increases the DNA starts to break apart. This is the denaturing of DNA, a concept again used with the PCR analysis. This is less a theoretical or structure issue but one of those cook-book facts that have been added to the tool chest of the Genome builder.Chapter 4 is the PCR process. Simply it is the separating of DNA, then tagging one end and the other end and going through a temperature sensitive denaturing and rebuilding until what is left is millions of copies of a desired DNA segment. My only complaint here is that the graphic, good, albeit it could be made a bit better with color.Chapter 5 discusses sequencing and it gives a superb discussion of the Sanger approach. Namely ddNTPs are used with segments and then measured in a gel electrophoresis. I assume that the reader may have had some understanding of the physical details but overall it is clear and exceptionally useful.The text continues developing other elements used in current day genomics. Chapter 9 is an attempt to provide an overview of microarrays, SNP, and even GWAS and phylogenetics. My problem here is that they are trying to stretch it a bit too far. These are reasonable summaries but to do microarrays justice it may take a bit more detail, and yes color, and the phylogenetics is much too much just a high level summary.Finally the Glossary is fantastic and worth every page.The strengths and weakness of the book are simple. On the strength side it covers all the key issues superbly. On the negative side, and this may be perhaps me, I find that almost like Organic Chemistry, in Gene manipulation there still are many cookbook rules that are scattered between the facts and logical constructs. If somehow there could be a clarification of the cook book rule and the well understood logical steps that would be a help.Overall I would highly recommend this book for almost anyone, from beginner to professional. My focus is clinical and theoretical modelling and analysis, and I have avoided bench work as much as possible. But by reading this book I can see again how much work has been done over the past few decades.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HE84FGJNNMX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0470683856#wasThisHelpful","R2HE84FGJNNMX3","A24VVPS1D44TY7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24VVPS1D44TY7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To read ""Lovers at the Chameleon Club"" is to enter the decadent world of Paris in the twenties, moving through the sad changes of the Nazi Occupation of Paris during World War 2. The focus is on Lou Villars, a cross-dressing, female athlete, race car driver and Nazi collaborator, and her eccentric associates at the Chameleon Club, Gabor, a Hungarian photographer, Lionel an inpecunious journalist from New Jersey who has abandoned his wife and child for Paris, Yvonne the owner of the Club and Suzanne, Gabor's lover, to name just a few. The novel is based on the real life of Violette Morris and I would suggest you look up her photo and story online before reading this.The novel is told in an epistolary style based upon memoirs, letters and journal entries. Because of the format it takes a while to get into the story. Whether you enjoy this novel will depend upon whether you like this style of writing and care about this assortment of odd ball characters. While I had no problem with the epistolary style and found the writing quite fine, I only had moderate interest in these characters and what happened to them. But because Ms. Prose handles the complex style of the novel so well, and portrays the time period so vividly I must give it four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT8XSD7KHM3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061713783#wasThisHelpful","RT8XSD7KHM3J","A3O62OXYDS44UX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O62OXYDS44UX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"'Vanessa and Her Sister' is yet another addition to the fictionalized canon about Virginia Woolf and her Bloomsbury circle of family of friends. It concentrates on the period from 1905-1912. This time the story is told mostly through the prism of Virginia's artist sister Vanessa. Everything unfolds through Vanessa's diary entries, and the letters, postcards and telegrams from the other famous members of the Bloomsbury Group - Leonard Woolf, E.M. Forster, Clive Bell, Duncan Grant and Lytton Strachey. This period of time is before they are famous, except for E.M. Forster who was the first to have success with his first two novels. As the novel opens Vanessa is 27 and Virginia 23.Telling their story in this epistolary way brings it to life in a painterly fashion, each brief diary entry, letter or card like a bushstroke through which a larger picture emerges. This seems quite fitting since the novel makes painter Vanessa central.  Much time is spent on art critic Clive Bell's pursuit of her. At 27 she worries about being a spinster, yet enjoys her family circle, her friends and her freedom, and is conflicted about her feelings towards Bell. Virginia emerges as self-centered, arrogant, quarrelsome, difficult and jealous. If your image of Virginia is different you will be disappointed.If you aren't already fairly well-acquainted with the members of the Bloomsbury Group you will find yourself at a loss, despite a list of characters at the beginning of the novel. At the end of the novel there is a list that tells you what happened to each member after the novel's end. You'd probably do well to read that first. The first chapter in the novel drops the reader into a party at which most of the protagonists appear. This might be a tough go for readers unfamiliar with these folks. But persevere soon you will be familiar with the cast of characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15Z9X66J2SJID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080417637X#wasThisHelpful","R15Z9X66J2SJID","A3O62OXYDS44UX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O62OXYDS44UX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Arctic Summer' is a fictionalized account of the life of writer E.M. Forster which focuses almost exclusively on his struggles to come to terms with his homosexuality in repressive early 20th century Britain.. It particularly chronicles his time in India, after befriending a young Indian man whom he tutors in England, and with whom he falls in love, and his time in Eqypt during World War I when he has  a romantic relationship with an impecunious Egyptian tram conductor. Over 350 plus pages, the novel's sole concern with his sexuality becomes tedious. How much masturbatory fantasy and unrequited longing can one reader deal with without tiring. I would have preferred more time exloring the writing of his novels and his relationship with the members of the Bloomsbury Group. Author Damon Galgut reduces a brilliant writer to nothing more than a bundle of repressive sexuality. While it is sad, it does a disservice to a fuller picture of Forster and his mileu.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J25S15M7HR3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609452348#wasThisHelpful","R3J25S15M7HR3C","A3O62OXYDS44UX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O62OXYDS44UX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lakshmi a young immigrant Indian woman is trapped in a loveless marriage to a domineering abusive man. After a suicide attempt she is treated by Dr. Maggie Bose married to an Indian professor of mathematics. Maggie is quite taken with Lakshimi's vulnerability and good heart and soon Maggie allows the patient/client boundaries to be breached with disastrous results. This book has all the earmarks of a 'woman's' novel - two female main characters, burgeoning friendship, child abuse, adultery. Unfortunately I found both main characters unlikeable. Maggie is cold and a downright bad therapist lacking in self-reflection. Lakshmi is irritating in the extreme-too good to be true. She is everyone's doormat. Even more off-putting is the fact that her chapters are written in pitable broken English which almost caused me to give up on this book.However, when Lakshmi reveals her 'secret to Maggie I knew this was one of the stupidest novels I have ever read.

"This is a brilliant adaptation of Salman Rushdie's novel of the same name. With fine acting and beautiful cinematography it tells the story of India's 'midnight's children-those born in the hour after midnight when India and Pakistan were partitioned in 1947.

Raised as a wealthy Hindu child his life encompasses the history of India and Pakistan from Partition through Indira Gandhi's State of Emergency.I had no problems with the picture or sound quality of the DVD.

"Hemingway must be one of the most over-rated writers in the English language. Back in middle school I was required to read 'The Old Man and the Sea' and hated it. In my twenties I read 'The Sun Also Rises' and hated that. I waited quite a while to re-visit Hemingway again and read 'To Have and Have Not' a few years ago. Again I loathed it. Now in my sixties I decided to try yet again and have just read 'A Farewell to Arms'. I won't say I loathed it but it left much to be desired. The ending of the story is obvious from early on. The characters are one dimensional and the dialogue has to be the worst I have ever read - wooden and deadening. I consider myself well-read but just can't comprehend the accolades heaped on Papa Hemingway. This was my last attempt. I am now saying au revoir to Hemingway for ever.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KOILJ513034N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684801469#wasThisHelpful","R2KOILJ513034N","A3O62OXYDS44UX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O62OXYDS44UX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He has just been dumped by his mistress of seven months and is feeling sorry for himself, when his wife discovers his infidelity. Anne-Lure kicks him out.

It is touching and funny but at the same time I was always aware that this is a woman writing from a man's point of view.  Something just does not ring true in the portrayal of Richard.

"In 2008 I read O'Neill's previous novel 'Netherland'. In my Amazon review I called Netherland 'one of the finest books I had read in the past several years. Its prose beautifully crafted. Its story deep and meditative'. For six years I looked forward to reading Mr. O'Neill's next novel. Well I waited in vain. His new novel, 'The  Dog' is a dull disaster set in Dubai. The novel is a post-modern mess. I can only advise you to avoid it at all costs. In fact it is difficult to believe it was written by the same person who wrote 'Neverland' a meditation on the American Dream in the post-911 world.I knew I was in trouble with 'The  Dog' when I read the first sentence, a convoluted mess. But it only got worse as I persevered. 'The Dog' tells the story of a middle-aged attorney from Manhattan who takes a job offered by an old school friend from Lebanon. The friend comes from a super wealthy family with vast holdings in the Middle East. His new job with the Batros family is to be a 'family officer' supposedly overseeing the  family's fortune. Our 'family officer' is only known occassionally by the name X. He understands little of what is going on and is soon saddled with babysitting the oldest  Batros' brother's son, a teenage slacker whom he decides to teach Sudoku. As in 'Netherland' we have a disaffected man in a foreign country, but this time who cares about X or any of his cohorts. All this takes place in Dubai a somewhat surrealistic city of immense wealth and taller than tall skyscrapers. There is little plot. What there is in abundance are impenetrable sentences full of parenthetical clauses. More than one sentence actually has four parenthetical clauses in it, concluding with four close parentheses marks!X spends most of the novel communicating his thoughts about scuba diving, the virtues of his expensive pedicurist, his massage chair, his car and his prostitutes. Apparently this is supposed to pass as humor, but nothing about it is funny. If this all sounds excruciatingly bad, it is.

"I am not usually a fan of short stories. I prefer the more intense character development of a novel. However, when I read a glowing New York Times review of 'The Frangipani Hotel' I decided to give it a try. Ms. Kupersmith who is part Vietnamese American is quite young. In fact she is just out of college and several of these stories were written as her senior year thesis. However, these vivid and often poignant stories set in Vietname show a level of maturity well beyond her years. The ghost story is apparently a venerable tradition in Vietnamese folklore and Ms. Kupersmith ably uses that tradtition, as most of these stories feature a ghost of sorts.In the title story, a beautiful ghost inhabits a room in the hotel. In another a truck driver encounters a ghost inhabiting the body of a dying young man. The Vietnam War itself hovers over these elegant stories ghost -likeeven though it is well in the past.

"At age 23 with a master's degree in English in hand, Ms. Rakoff gets her first job at an august literary agency which represents the reclusive JD Salinger amongst others. This is 1996 and The Agency, as she calls it, is a bit of a dinosaur operating without computers with all correspondence being typed. Ms. Rakoff is an innocent in the work work, basically a secretary who knows little. She humorously describes her difficulties turning on her IBM Selectric (for you youngsters that's a typewriter). She is soon given the task of sending individually typed form letters in response to the piles of Salinger fan letters that The Agency receives each days. Reading these emotionally charged missives moves her. It shows her the power of literature to affect people and she wants to dump the form letter responses in favor of something more personal. Soon she finds herself actually talking to JD on the phone when her boss is unavailable.This book however is not about Salinger despite the gripes of some here claiming she is trying to profit off the Salinger name. It is about a young naive woman coming to terms with the adult world of work, relationships and money. She beautifully describes NYC and the changes taking place in the publishing industry at the time, as well as struggling to come to terms with an obnoxious boyfriend.

"How this dreadful book received not one but two good reviews in the august New York Times can only be a testament to 1) how low the Times has fallen in literary standards or 2) that the fix was in because Ms. Straub's father is a best selling author. The novel takes us on a two week summer vacation with an elite Manhattan family. They decide to leave their multi-million dollar limestone in the City for gorgeous Mallorca, Spain. This is a family in trouble. The mom, Franny is a well known writer, part Joan Didion part Ruth Reichl. The husband, 60 year old Jim, is the editor of a men's magazine and has just been fired from this job because of his dalliance with a 23 year old magazine intern who just happens to be the daughter of a member of the magazine's board of directors. Also on vacation is Sylvia, their 18 year old private school daughter, about to leave home for an Ivy League university and her 28 year old brother who is into real estate in Miami and is living with a dim witted older woman who is a personal trainer. Rounding things out are Charles, Franny's gay best friend and his husband, the younger Lawrence. Of course for interest sake a gorgeous, young Spaniard Joan (pronounced Joe...ahhhn) is thrown into the mix to give the virginal Sylvia Spanish lessons.

"In 1632 26 year old Rembrandt was commissioned by the Amsterdam Surgeon's Guild to paint 'The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp'. The painting catapulted him to fame. The painting depicts Dr. Tulp dissecting the arm of a criminal who had just been hanged. By focusing on Rembrandt, Dr. Tulp, the criminal and an array of other characters on the day of the hanging author Siegal seeks to bring to life the world of early 17th century Amsterdam. Unfortunately the results are mixed. The acknowledgments tells us the author spent 6 years researching this book including time living in Amsterdam. While the knowledge gained should be a positive element in the novel it in facts acts in large part as a negative. While the author undoubtedly has a wealth of knowledge about the period her attempts to show off this knowledge leads to a pedantic tone that stilts the plot at every turn. How much detail do we really need to know about the preparation of paint and canvas in the 17th century, just two of the many tangents she goes off on. Sometimes less is more. For me this accretion of pedantic detail rendered the novel lifeless","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIQUEBQBI8KOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538367#wasThisHelpful","RIQUEBQBI8KOL","A3O62OXYDS44UX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O62OXYDS44UX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Part memoir, part fiction, ""Cambridge"" takes us into the unusual childhood of Susanna, the eight year old daughter of a well known Harvard economics professor and a beautiful mother. Into this rarefied childhood comes an exotic cast of characters, Vishwa a talented Indian conductor smitten with Susanna's Swedish nanny Frederica; Jagdeesh, Vishna's brother who is juggling two love affairs; young Roger, a neighbor and his two psychoanalyst parents and George a Greek friend of the family.Although billed as being about the special lures of home in Cambridge the most compelling parts of the book take place elsewhere -London, Cape Cod, Italy and Greece as we are allowed to explore these places through the precocious eyes of Sussana who falls in love with Donatello's statue of Saint George in Florence and faints at the feet of a kouros statue in Athens. It made me wonder about the choice of title.There are many magical moments but occasionally Susanna's precociousness can wear a bit thin and we are aware of the adult Susanna behind the child.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXRG749DE89GQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385350252#wasThisHelpful","RXRG749DE89GQ","A3O62OXYDS44UX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O62OXYDS44UX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rebecca Winter, 60 years old, divorced, once a well known photographer has exchanged her tony Upper West Side apartment for a drab cottage in the boondocks of Upstate New York for financial reasons. Her feminist photos no longer bring in the money they once did so she has had to sublet the luxe apartment for the shack in order to pay the bills. There she will make 'friends' with the locals, acquire a dog and take more photographs. If this sounds like you have read it before, you have, as it hits every elite Manhattan cliche in the book. Her former husband is a domineering, know it all jerk. She has an emotionally cold mother who is a self-hating Jew and is suffering from dementia whose nursing home fees she must pay. Her agent is abusive and no longer sees value in her work. And she finally comes to the realization that what she sees through the lens of her cameria isn't necessarily real life. What a revelation!Along the way there is the obligatory romance because lonely 60 year olds never wind up being really lonely in this type of book. And we are asked to commiserate with the financial fears of this woman who paid $6000 for a stove, when the sale of her apartment would solve all her money troubles. Ms. Quindlen appears to be completely out of touch as everything in this book is a cliche right down to the ending.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38QQ3O8QQJT9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400065755#wasThisHelpful","R38QQ3O8QQJT9I","A3O62OXYDS44UX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O62OXYDS44UX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have read all of Ms. Vapnyar's books with pleasure and found her to be a superb prose stylist. Consequently I looked forward to reading her latest novel 'The Scent of Pine'. Lena, a Russian emigree and academic who is unhappily married finds herself at a dull conference in upstate New York. There she meets Ben a fellow academic, artist and specialist in graphic novels. The two strike up a friendship and while driving together towards Ben's cabin in Maine their intimacy grows.Much of the novel is taken up with flashbacks to Lena's summer as a camp counselor in the Soviet Union twenty years earlier where something mysterious happens. We have been promised a unforgetable twist ending which is supposed to keep us reading. But what is revealed is more of a whisper than a bang and the result of such a ridiculous coincidence as to strain credulity. I found the camp flashbacks tedious and dull, a real effort to get through. The novel doesn't redeem itself somewhat until the last chapter when the old Lara Vapnyar reappears and the luminosity of her prose returns. Too bad the entire novel couldn't have been like that. What a disappointment. It's only for that last chapter that I give it two stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RBZ8T9LASRZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147671262X#wasThisHelpful","R1RBZ8T9LASRZH","A3O62OXYDS44UX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O62OXYDS44UX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Set in Nigeria, the United States and Great Britain 'Americanah' follows two young Nigerian lovers on what will become separate paths to adulthood. Ifemelu will travel to Princeton University to study.  Obinze will try to make his way in Britain. The novel is an odyssey of the immigrant experience in the Western world with the hardships, the identity confusion, the difficult relationships with natives and the racism encountered. This is a world where Ifemelu's hair will become a metaphor for racial identity. However, the novel's obsession with race and its lecturing tone in the end takes away from the power of what is ultimately the love story of two fascinating individuals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNL4D68LP58ZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307271080#wasThisHelpful","RNL4D68LP58ZV","A3O62OXYDS44UX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O62OXYDS44UX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the outset let me say that I have never read 'Middlemarch' although it remains high on my list of books to read. Rest assured you need not have read the novel to thoroughly enjoy Ms Mead's literary memoir. Having felt ensnared by any great novel as a young person, having seen your soul revealed in it's pages (in  my case it was 'Tess of the D'Urbervilles') will suffice. Ms. Mead sets out on a journey that reveals not only Eliot's life, but her own life as entwined with the novel. What in Eliot's life made her create the different characters in 'Middlemarch' as she did? In exploring this Mead takes us into Eliot's relationships with friends, lovers and family. A great deal of research went into the writing but for me it never feels dry and academic. Now I'm off to begin reading 'Middlemarch'.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ET10804LOWOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307984761#wasThisHelpful","R3ET10804LOWOP","A3O62OXYDS44UX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O62OXYDS44UX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This USED TO BE the best water bottle I had ever used. Better than bite straws. Better than wide-mouthed Nalgene bottles. It does get water in your mouth FAST and I loved it until I noticed this problem: It leaks.It began some months after receiving it. The button on the back that you press to open the mouth part for drinking leaks just a little bit of fluid. This leaves the bottle and my hand wet. It took me months to really figure out why it was wet. I thought that I had let some dribble from the front mouthpiece after taking a sip, but even when I was really careful the problem persisted. So, after close inspection, it appears to be the back button part that is leaking. You can see water building up when you depress the back buttonReally disappointed.

"I have owned what I think is the previous model of this O-Cedar Angler Broom/Dustpan set for several years. I absolute love it and have decided to get this updated model so that I can store a second broom/dustpan set in my basement because I like the old version so much.I just recently received this updated model and so far I like it just as much as the previous model (the old and new brooms are just different colors but otherwise seem identical). The bristles aren't too big or too small, providing roughly 12"" of sweeping surface area. The design of the dustpan (with the rubber lip) is PERFECT and ensures all dust/debris sweeps up easily into it. Emptying things out into the trash and snapping the dustpan back onto the broom is a breeze. The top of the broom handle comes with a little loop to hang it on, which makes storing it out of the way very easy by hanging it on a screw/nail in the wall. Overall, everything seems just as high quality as the old O-Cedar that I've owned for years, and it's just as sturdy and light-weight.Summary: This is the absolute best broom/dustpan set available for the price!!I have read the only other review on this O-Cedar broom and it is quite negative. If I experience problems with the handle screwing out of the broom, I will come back and change my review, but so far it is working beautifully. I am willing to take the risk on this broom/dustpan set because the dustpan on this O-Cedar, as well as my old O-Cedar, works SO DANG WELL, and the whole kit is just very easy to use and store away. Even if the broom handle unscrewing were to become a problem in the future, I will likely fix it by drilling a hole in the piece that connects the handle to the broom and sending a screw through there to keep things snug. However, for the time being, it has been working as great as my previous O-Cedar without any modifications.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KU4PT0636JQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001229JC0#wasThisHelpful","R2KU4PT0636JQ7","A1UEILMFX6GROB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UEILMFX6GROB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought THREE of these sink hole covers in order to fill three sink holes upon replacing my 2-handle style faucet w/ a separate sprayer for an all-in-one style faucet that has a single handle and an attached sprayer nozzle which pulls out from the head (LOVE this Moen and happen to own two) - Moen 7175CSL Level One-Handle High Arc Pulldown Kitchen Faucet, Classic StainlessI'm glad I went with this rather expensive version of sink hole cover. It's very low profile and looks great. Quality is very nice and the Brushed Stainless finish matches my sink and faucet perfectly.One thing that does bother me: The black rubber seal that came on two of these is quite thin and low profile and does the job perfectly. However, the black rubber seal on one of them is fatter than the other two and this causes the circular stainless piece on top to stick up just a little higher than the rest, and the black seal protrudes out a little more than the other two. This is disappointing. For the high price of this simple little piece, they should all be identical and of very high quality. I know Amazon would issue a return/refund quite easily, but these were being installed in a second-hand utility sink in my basement and looks aren't of high importance, so I won't go to the trouble of returning it.Overall, 5 stars.

"I'm a Bose fanboy, and I've had trouble finding an earbud that I like for dedicated workout/running sessions because nothing seems to compare to my Bose MIE2i earbuds, but I wanted to get a (cheaper) dedicated workout earbud because I kept wearing out my Bose earbuds from frequent exposure to sweat and other rough conditions.These Yurbuds fit my ears so well and are really durable (25-year-old guy who is 5' 10.5"" tall and about 145 pounds)! The fit is actually similar to the Bose MIE2i earbuds. There's no way they could ever fall out of my ears because they really do lock in there. The sound quality is good overall in the Yurbuds and there is some pretty solid bass, but they're not as good as the Bose overall in terms of sound quality. However, the Yurbuds provide plenty good enough sound quality for workouts in my case, and in the case of other people, I could see them not being as picky as me and liking the Yurbuds for everyday use and not just working out.The Yurbuds are great for running and working out.

"After many hours of looking at cat water fountains, I settled on this one, and I'm glad I did.-No filter necessary. Any debris will stay at the bottom and fresh water will circulate to the top.-Easy to clean. I can make it about 3 weeks before needing to clean it because eventually it does get slimy in there, build up debris, and finally require a good wash with soap.-Affordable.-Durable. Motor has been making bubbles for 6 months now without a problem. It runs 24/7.-Quiet. It took my new kitten a few days to warm up to the little hum that it makes, but now she drinks SO MUCH water!!!-Keeps cat hydrated. She drinks roughly 16 ounces (two cups) every two days. (I only have to refill it every two days and not daily, which is convenient.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37IM9XCT6R572/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004L4XR3I#wasThisHelpful","R37IM9XCT6R572","A1UEILMFX6GROB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UEILMFX6GROB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're using the stock transmitter that came with your heli, you should upgrade to this instead.

"I did a lot of research before making the plunge on my first 4-channel heli. I ended up getting the Blade mCX2, which was a great heli to learn on, but it got boring after only a few days. Shortly after that, I ended up getting a Blade MSR and binding it to a Spektrum DX6i transmitter. The MSR is A TOTAL BLAST hooked up to this transmitter because it allows for finer control over the heli's flight characteristics. It can be tamed way down for beginners or dialed in to be a very fast but stable heli. It has also proven to be quite a durable little heli.Despite some reviews that I've read, I can speak from experience when I say that this makes for a great 1st helicopter that you can grow into. The Blade mCX2 was just too easy and got boring too fast. The Blade mSR comes with a beginner mode and a more advanced mode built into the stock transmitter, so even with the stock transmitter (instead of the DX6i), you've got some room to grow in terms of flying a heli for the first time or whether you've been at it for a while; in which case, it will still keep you very entertained.For the value, this is a great choice for a first or second heli. Another great aspect of getting a Blade heli like this is that the batteries are interchangeable with other similar Blade helis. Because I have 4 batteries and a charger that can handle all 4 of those batteries, it's a huge plus for me to not have to get 4 more batteries and a new charging station when I upgrade my heli, as I simply plan on upgrading to a Blade Nano cPX. If I were to get a different heli brand, I would have to buy new batteries and a new charging station. Also, all blade helis will bind to the Spektrum DX6i transmitted that I bought because it is recommended all over the web as a good transmitter, so it's tough to go wrong with getting a Blade MSR and DX6i transmitter and progressing through the hobby without spending too much money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WTDP0BI4EMUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009WQFKMQ#wasThisHelpful","R2WTDP0BI4EMUI","A1UEILMFX6GROB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UEILMFX6GROB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These things are no gimmick. Having such fast access to Pandora one app away on your smartphone is unbeatable. Sound quality is beautiful too.I did have some interference issues with a lot of Wifi networks nearby, but my issue of sound cutting out only occurred when I was using the Line-In function because the signal that is traveling between speakers apparently requires a lot of data when you use Line-In and is more susceptible to interference (even though I have fast cable Internet via Comcast). That was the excuse Sonos made on the phone for why it was happening. Anyway, at their advice, I resolved any and all cutting out by connecting the two speakers that I use for my home theater set up, which are connected to my projector and frequently use Line-In, by connecting them with a Cat6 Ethernet cable. (The speakers were ONLY cutting out using Line-In and not for Pandora.) I also moved the Bridge from the Basement (where my wireless router is located) to the same floor as the speakers and this improved the signal strength between the Bridge and all of the speakers. This was an annoying problem when I was troubleshooting it with Sonos because these speakers are marketed as WIRELESS speakers, but this could have just been an issue in my specific situation and I'm just happy it was subsequently resolved by connecting those two via Ethernet because I love these speakers so much.Overall, I don't know what I'd do without these speakers. I feel like I'm walking around a retail shop when I'm at home except that music *I* want to hear is always playing. These can also be set up to use AirPlay via an iPhone or iPad and an Airport Express base station. I've been doing this for about a year and it's pretty nice, but I find myself either just using Pandora or streaming music from my iPhone directly from the Sonos app for iPhone to the speakers. It's pretty seamless and impressive.Sonos tech support is also excellent. I wouldn't hesitate for a second to recommend these speakers. Sound quality is outstanding and very rich/full sounding for all types of music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36YL9VAOSO5CY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003CP0FUU#wasThisHelpful","R36YL9VAOSO5CY","A1UEILMFX6GROB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UEILMFX6GROB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I researched personal size coffee makers for WEEKS before settling on this one.We were extremely happy with everything about this one except for the fact that it broke after 6-12 months. Then, we got a free replacement through Hamilton Beach and 6-12 months later THAT ONE BROKE AS WELL.More specifically, it would turn on to make coffee and then make the coffee fine, but instead of automatically turning off when the chamber had no water left in it (like it's supposed to), the coffee machine stayed on and continued to heat up the interior of itself, which created smoke/steam and lots of noise until I pulled the plug from the wall. The only buttons on the machine are Bold and Regular, which turn it on, so unplugging it from the wall is the only way to stop the coffee maker from endlessly heating up when it malfunctions like this.We will be looking for a more reliable coffee maker to replace this one.

"I was worried that it would bother me not having a handle on the lid(s) so that I could throw something away without using the foot lever if I felt like it, because I used my hands sometimes and my feet other times with my old SimpleHuman trash can. It turns out that I've gotten used to only having the foot lever and it's easily the ""perfect"" trash can when it comes to style and function.I like that it hides the bags inside itself and the inner plastic bin rests just slightly at an angle so that you can change the bag easily.

"I'm VERY happy with this purchase. I bought three of them to use in my outdoor porch lights above my garage and by my front door. I actually bought these two-stage brightness motion-sensing porch lights on Amazon and the bulbs work really well in them and look outstanding: Heath/Zenith SL-4144-AZ-A New-England Carriage-Style 150-Degree Motion-Sensing Security Light, Antique Bronze - I frosted the glass just like the first reviewer recommends and it looks really classy that way.The light that this bulbs gives off is bright! This white/neutral shade of light provides great visibility at night and works well for my purposes as a security light. It's very crisp and clean and not blue at all. It's obviously by no means ""warm"" either. It actually looks a little bit modern, in fact, while not being too ""florescent"" looking.Like I mentioned before, these seem to work well as of Day #1 in my two-stage brightness level motion-sensing porch lights. The LED lights get brighter (really dang bright!) when motion is sensed by the porch light and dim just like the previous incandescent bulb did (to a very pleasing level of brightness, not too dim and not too bright). I'm hoping these new LED bulbs will last 6+ years based on the listed 25,000-hour predicted use rating in the description, being on from dusk to dawn each night. Only time will tell.VERY happy with this purchase. Great $ value for a nice shade of light that's really bright. The energy savings are a huge plus in addition to the hopefully very long bulb life. Plus they're DIMMABLE.

"Taking the Bose MIE2i, the most comfortable and best sounding earbuds for extended use (8+ hours daily in my experience), and adapting noise cancellation to them has left me so impressed with the QC20i earbuds that the high price tag actually seems pretty fair IF having noise cancellation built into an earbud is an absolute necessity for you. However, there are some drawbacks to the QC20i earbuds, which, after several months of ownership, have left me reaching for my MIE2i earbuds more often than the QC20i set, with the rare exception being when the environment absolutely REQUIRES noise cancellation (skip to the end and read my 09/06/2013 edit for a summary of the QC20i vs MIE2i earbuds, or skip ahead to paragraph 7 for details regarding sound isolation and comfort of the newly redesigned tips on the QC20 earbuds).I do have some insight in regard to the characteristics of the QC20i earbuds that hasn't been mentioned in other reviews yet, but first I'll touch on what everybody keeps bringing up. When comparing the sound output with the battery (i.e., noise cancelling) on and off, there is initially a difference in the color/tone that your ears will pick up. In short, these QC20i earbuds sound brighter (more high-end frequencies) with noise cancelling enabled and perhaps less bright, or for lack of a better term, ""muddier"" (more low/mid frequencies) with noise cancelling completely disabled (not talking about AWARE mode here at all). HOWEVER, it should be noted that your ears adapt extraordinarily fast to noise cancelling being enabled/disabled, and the intricate nuances of any genre of music are highlighted by the outstanding technology built into these Bose earbuds. What I'm saying is that the soundscape from low to high range is represented in a very clean and pleasurable way whether noise cancelling is on or off, but the initial difference in tonality when turning noise cancelling on or off could come across as off-putting or strange for a few seconds until your ears adjust and get lost in the music.If compensating for the characteristics of these earbuds is something you might be interested in, I've found that the app for iPhone called ""EQu"" is quite effective and easy to use if you're nitpicky and prefer to balance out a hint of too much ""brightness/muddiness"" with a little EQ. With this app, you have much finer control than the built-in EQ settings for your iPod/iPhone, and you can access your iPhone music library directly from the app. I've been playing with EQu for a couple of days and find that you can subtly add a little brightness to an EQ and then save that as a preset, which you can then use when the sound cancelling on your QC20 earbuds is totally off. Or, I also have another preset that minutely decreases the higher frequencies (roughly 1kHz to 16kHz) to compensate for when sound cancelling is enabled. To sum up this whole EQ business, I find that while it's fun and interesting to adjust the EQ to enhance these earbuds, it's really not all that necessary. Your ears will adapt to the slight difference in tonality with sound cancelling on/off and you'll just appreciate the full frequency spectrum of the music playing within a minute of listening. For the bass junkies out there, these earbuds offer a very clear and full sense of low end/bass without being pushy. The built-in lows and highs of these earbuds are just very pleasant overall and can adapt to any style of music you choose to listen to. I found that to also be true of the MIE2i earbuds that I have owned for years (that do not have noise cancelling at all). So, these do have ""bass,"" but it's not overpowering. It's just.. there where you need it.When I first tried the QC20 earbuds on in the store with a LOT of background noise, my jaw hit the floor. I've been using the QC2 and QC15 totally-over-the-ear headphones for a long time and thought I was accustomed to the degree of noise cancelling that Bose was able to achieve, but something about this technology being in an EARBUD completely took me by surprise.Now, what I've been building up to here and the point I want drive home is that these excel in the cancellation of low-roar type sounds like you'd find in an airplane, riding in a car, or even ambient city background noises. The level of cancellation of ""low-roar"" type sounds such as these is quite astounding. Furthermore, an impressive amount of other high-pitched sounds like the human voice are also filtered out to an extent, although I wouldn't by any means consider this their forte. So, with all of this in mind, the fact that these work wonders on cancelling most types of annoying sounds around you does not translate into an EVEN QUIETER silence. What I mean is that these are not ""silence enhancing"" earbuds that make quiet places even quieter, as I naively thought might be the case. Nope. These do a great job cancelling outside noises and quieting outside noises for you to focus on music/spoken word in your earbuds, but they DO NOT make quiet rooms even quieter or make music sound better in quiet rooms. I've found that in these situations, I typically just leave noise cancelling off and enjoy music that way, which has the added benefit of prolonging the battery life anyway.So overall, in many respects these QC20i earbuds are an excellent upgrade to an already high-end earbud (the MIE2i). However, after owning them for a month, I find myself frequently grabbing my MIE2i earbuds unless I really NEED noise cancellation. Some notable drawbacks of the QC20i earbuds such as the battery/controller unit getting in the way, the thicker/bulkier cord, the redesigned and slightly less comfortable earbud tip, and the different placement of the mic/button controls aren't TERRIBLY bothersome and are worth putting up with for the outstanding noise cancellation they provide, but when it comes down it, the MIE2i earbuds win out as a more effective practical earbud for daily use. If you're new to Bose earbuds and aren't sure whether the MIE2 or QC20 is for you, I would recommend spending the extra cash on the QC20 earbuds ONLY if noise cancelling is of extreme importance to you. The classic MIE2i earbuds are simply easier to wear and provide great sound quality for use in any environment. I've owned the MIE2i earbuds for years and have now owned the QC20i earbuds for a number of months. As irreplaceable as the QC20i earbuds are when it comes to blocking out unwanted sound, I find myself using my classic MIE2i earbuds for most all situations because of the reasons listed above. They're just fundamentally EASIER to deal with in every way.With regard to the rubber earbud tip, the rubber tips of the QC20 are slightly updated and different than the MIE2 and SIE2, although they still follow the general rule of thumb with all Bose earbuds in that they rest in the bowl of your ear for the most part and don't get stuffed deep into your ear canal like other earbuds. I find myself liking the QC20 earbud tip overall because it's *fairly* comfortable and has a very good seal between your eardrum and the outside world, but I also really like the old fashioned style Bose earbud tip that doesn't have a little winglet (you can still find these online or order them from Bose). This old style (and this also applies to the newer StayHear tips with the little winglet for the IE2/MIE2/SIE2) applies noticeably less pressure on the inside of the ear. This results in some more ambient noise from the outside world, but it's also MUCH easier to forget they're in your ears after several hours because this design/shape creates less of a tight seal from the outside world than the QC20 tips. They're also better for using the built-in mic on the headset because the QC20 tips block out so much sound that it sounds funny to hear the person on the other end of the phone perfectly clear and then your own voice in your head REALLY muffled (put the palm of each hand over both ears simultaneously and begin talking aloud to simulate this). I wasn't expecting this to be an issue until I made my first phone call and it turned out to be very distracting to me (taking one earbud out remedies this somewhat). However, call quality using the QC20 earbuds is very clear and the person on the other end seemed to hear me without a problem. This muffled sound in your head during phone calls isn't an issue at all with the older style MIE2i/SIE2 tips because they don't create the same tight seal that the QC20 earbud tips do. I actually still use this old version of earbud tip on my MIE2i earbuds when I don't need sound cancelling and prefer a relaxed, comfortable fit for many hours without a break. The QC20 tip provides more isolation from outside noises, but a side effect of this is a feeling of minimal discomfort/pressure over extended use of 1+ hours. With my old fashioned (non-StayHear) tips without the winglet (and probably even the newer StayHear tips w/ the winglet that come on the IE2/MIE2/SIE2 earbuds), I can and have worn these for 8-12 hours a day on most days of the week without any ear canal fatigue or pressure whatsoever. I wouldn't recommend attempting this with the QC20 tips. You probably won't make it that long without taking them out every once in a while for a short break, which has been working for me. I let my ears rest with the QC20 tips out of my ears for about 5-10 minutes, and then I can put them back in and make it another hour or so without feeling discomfort/pressure in the ears. Luckily, all earbud tips made for Bose earbuds can be interchanged with any and all different Bose earbuds, so you have some options when it comes to size and style, although like I said, all of them do, more or less, rest in the bowl of your ear as opposed to relying on getting shoved deep in there to stay put. Even the less comfortable QC20 earbuds can be pulled out of your ear a tad bit if you want to relieve some pressure, and then pushed in a little farther when you want to focus on music. So to wrap this up, for less noise isolation and vastly more comfort, go with the IE2/MIE2/SIE2 earbud tip (and I prefer the really old style w/o the winglet personally). For less comfort over extended use but considerable more noise isolation, go with the QC20 style earbud tip. I'm tempted to knock off a star because a set of earbuds should honestly be comfortable for any duration, be it 1 hour or 12 hours, but because the tips are interchangeable and this issue can be remedied cheaply and easily with a purchase of the older style tips, not to mention the QC20 earbuds are really intended to be noise cancelling earbuds that keep outside sounds to a minimum, I feel it apt to let this gripe slide and keep this rated as a 5-star product.I'd like to point out quickly that the QC15 over-the-entire-ear headphones are great in general but have the tendency to make your ears/head really hot after any kind of extended use. They're pretty dang comfy, but after a while you still want to ""get these dang headphones off of me!"" With the MIE2i earbuds, I think I've made it clear that I could wear these for a year straight and still be in complete ear comfort bliss. So if the debate is between choosing one of two Bose *noise cancelling* products, the QC15 headphones or QC20 earbuds, as much as I LOVE the compactness of earbuds, I would have to lean toward recommending the QC15 headphones in lieu of the QC20 earbuds for anyone who needs really extended-use noise cancellation. If, however, you buy a set of old style Bose earbud tips to put on your QC20 earbuds when you don't need sound isolation and strong noise cancelling, then I reassign the winner of this competition to the QC20 earbuds because I highly prefer earbuds to headphones 99% of the time due to the fact that earbuds are just much easier to be mobile with and look much less conspicuous when walking around with them in, but for ALL DAY use, the QC20 earbud tips just aren't going to be as comfortable as the QC15 headphones.When it comes to the Bose SIE2/SIE2i sport earbuds, as much of a Bose enthusiast as I am, I have to say that I didn't really care for them and returned them. The cord is very short and intended to be used only with the included armband. Sure, there's an included extension cord, but using that all the time is annoying. I would advise everyone to steer clear of those and just get the IE2/MIE2i earbuds if you're in the market for a non noise cancelling earbud with or without phone controls, whether you're going to be active or not. The MIE2i earbuds with the mic still hold up pretty well to some moisture and have a better location for the mic/button controls than the SIE2, along with the normal length cord. The QC20 earbuds, however, I wouldn't use for any kind of prolonged exercise that is more vigorous than mowing the lawn because there's just too much tech in them, which I assume wouldn't hold up well to excessive moisture. The IE2, with no mic or button controls, would be the ideal workout earbud in my opinion because there isn't a place for moisture to leak in and cause problems, you still get excellent comfort/sound quality, they'll stay put in your ear during activity, and the cord is a normal length - not to mention they're the cheapest Bose earbud on the market.Another thing worth mentioning is the outstanding warranty offered on all Bose products. I have worn out my MIE2i earbuds several times because I had used them literally all-day, every day, in addition to working out and exposing them to sweat/moisture frequently. As a result of this, one of the control buttons stopped working. This happened more than one time to me a little before the 1-year warranty expired, so I was given the option of replacing them for free through the mail and just paying $8 shipping or going down to a Bose store and swapping them out for a new pair for free. This was a very easy process every time. I'm glad they wore out within the year (if they were going to at all)! If your earbuds/headphones happen to wear out or break AFTER the 1-year warranty, you can still bring those in or send them to Bose and pay half-price for a new replacement pair, which is better than nothing. I can hear all the naysayers out there thinking a set of earbuds should last forever under any circumstance (I mean, especially for this high price, right??!), but with heavy use every single day and with frequent exposure of the mic/control buttons to sweat/moisture/tension, it's unrealistic to think the buttons won't eventually malfunction, or for the cord to show some wear at its connecting points to the 3.5 mm jack and the earbuds themselves. The MIE2i earbuds can take A LOT of abuse and will serve you well for a lifetime if used for regular mild activities that do not include working out, but keep in mind they aren't completely ""indestructible."" If really used to the max for working out on a regular basis, there's a fair chance that they will eventually defect at some point and not last forever. However, I find the level of durability of the MIE2i earbuds more than acceptable for everyday use and they are officially my favorite multipurpose earbuds of all time (I've owned them for about 4-5 years). The QC20i earbuds are great too and overall do seem highly durable with their somewhat thicker gauge cord that feels very sturdy, although they have been handled with relative care since the day I brought them home, and I obviously will never work out in them. I expect the QC20i earbuds to last a very long time because the build quality really feels quite solid.To conclude: as much as I like the QC20i earbuds, they aren't quite as ""multipurpose"" as I would like with the battery control unit always being ever so slightly in the way, the thicker gauge cord giving them a hard to describe ""heavier"" or ""bulkier"" feel, and the earbud tips not being entirely comfortable for all-day use. The MIE2i earbuds will remain as my ""go-to"" earbud for most purposes, but the QC20i is an absolute godsend for blocking outside noises. I've spent some time wearing the QC20i earbuds with noise cancelling enabled while riding in the car and I was in absolute relaxation HEAVEN. You have to try it firsthand to know what I mean. Also, even simple things like listening to a podcast while you flush the toilet and wash your hands proves no match for the sound isolation and noise cancellation of the QC20i earbuds, which allow me to hear spoken word through all of that nonsense going on, whereas spoken word is totally lost in my MIE2i earbuds when I give the toilet a flush and then wash my hands. This may seem like a strange example, but when you spend a great deal of time listening to spoken word through earbuds and find yourself visiting the loo often, it's wonderful to have spoken word entertainment like a podcast or audiobook be uninterrupted by these day-to-day background noises.EDIT (08/20/2013): I'm impressed with the QC20i battery life. After two weeks of ownership, I'm still riding the initial 2-hour full charge that is recommended upon first opening the package. Noise cancelling has been getting enabled roughly 30 minutes to an hour each day. The light on the control unit hasn't even started blinking to indicate it needs to be recharged soon. Nice.EDIT (08/21/2013): The light finally started blinking tonight, indicating 3 hours or less of battery life left. Time to recharge.EDIT (09/06/2013): My summarized thoughts on the QC20i vs MIE2i earbuds after one month of use (copied from paragraph 6): In many respects, these QC20i earbuds are an excellent upgrade to an already high-end earbud (the MIE2i). However, after owning them for a month, I find myself frequently grabbing my MIE2i earbuds unless I really NEED noise cancellation. Some notable drawbacks of the QC20i earbuds such as the battery/controller unit getting in the way, the thicker/bulkier cord, the redesigned and slightly less comfortable earbud tip, and the different placement of the mic/button controls aren't TERRIBLY bothersome and are worth putting up with for the outstanding noise cancellation they provide, but when it comes down it, the MIE2i earbuds win out as a more effective practical earbud for daily use.

I've owned the MIE2i earbuds for years and have now owned the QC20i earbuds for over a month. As irreplaceable as the QC20i earbuds are when it comes to blocking out unwanted sound, I find myself using my classic MIE2i earbuds for most all situations because of the reasons listed above. They're just fundamentally EASIER to deal with in every way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSUMUTB2BQE7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D429Y12#wasThisHelpful","RSUMUTB2BQE7U","A1UEILMFX6GROB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UEILMFX6GROB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Kensington Expert Mouse is a high-end trackball mouse that I'm tempted to call my favorite mouse on the market (when it's working!) - However, I cannot recommend it.I have been using this mouse eight hours a day for 2-3 years as a medical transcriptionist, and unfortunately it has been replaced three times (for free) through Kensington's warranty on account of the left click and/or scroll wheel breaking.The left click button will work fine anywhere between 1-4 months, but then it slowly begins to function incorrectly. For example, I can try highlighting a paragraph from the top left to bottom right while holding the left click button down, and unfortunately the mouse acts as if I have released my finger from the left click button when in actuality I have not. This issue affects any type of clicking and dragging of icons on your desktop, and any event where you are intentionally holding the left click button to move something. Once the problem crops up, it persists and worsens. From there on out, holding the left click button will be interrupted and the mouse will ""drop"" whatever you're trying to highlight or click & drag EVERY TIME it's attempted.The other issue I had with this mouse was with the scroll wheel simply deciding not to scroll at all for a minute or two and then it would resume scrolling as usual. This happened repeatedly for about two weeks before I decided the mouse needed replacing.Both of these issues persisted after turning the computer on and off, reinstalling Kensington's ""TrackBall Works"" for Mac, and before/after upgrading to OS X 10.7 Lion operating system. I also use Windows by way of Parallels and all of these issues persisted in both operating systems.Although Kensington provided great support by replacing this mouse three times for free, it's time for me to move on and find a mouse that will function correctly long-term. I will be avoiding Kensington products from this point on.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36C9942AOVGZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009KH63#wasThisHelpful","R36C9942AOVGZC","A1UEILMFX6GROB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UEILMFX6GROB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a medical transcriptionist who has been using the Kinesis Freestyle keyboard for Mac with the Freestyle V3 Accessory (adds 5, 10, or 15 degrees of tilt without a palm rest) for about a year now. I spend eight or more hours typing every day, so a quality ergonomic keyboard is essential for me.Overall, every aspect of this keyboard suits my needs. The keys are very responsive, so very little effort is required to activate each key. The huge delete button above the regular backspace is really convenient and easy to hit. It removes text that is located on the RIGHT side of the cursor, which is very handy.The fact that this keyboard is split into two sides is the defining feature worth highlighting. My first impression before buying the keyboard was that this feature could be a gimmick. After a year of typing on this thing, it's the opposite of a gimmick. The design is highly beneficial in finding a uniquely comfortable position for any set of hands. My preference is to connect the keyboards using the little attachment at the top that comes with the keyboard, as I found it more difficult to type quickly and accurately with them totally separated. With them attached at the single hinge, I can easily position the left and right keyboard in a way that is comfortable and stable so that it's easy to predict where the keys are going to be when looking at the screen. With the rubber grips on the bottom of the V3 Accessory, the keyboard stays right where it's supposed to.I'm not using either accessory that comes with palm rests. I'm glad I didn't buy them honestly. The Freestyle V3 Accessory that snaps onto the bottom of the keyboard and adds 5, 10, or 15 degrees of tilt to the left and right keyboard is fantastic, and it's the only add-on I purchased for the keyboard. I personally like the 15 degree angle the best, but I'll admit I had to work my way up to it before that much gradient felt totally natural. (Side-note: This accessory is listed under the PC version of this keyboard on the Kinesis website, but it works on the Mac version too. It comes in black only.)The function buttons on top of the keyboard are really nice too (volume, brightness, play/pause/rewind, etc). They're laid out similarly to the Apple keyboard. I don't really use the Internet buttons or dedicated copy/paste keys on the left since CMD + C is so much faster, but they're there if you want them. I should mention that I've had some slight trouble with the brightness function keys not working (located above the number keys). This was remedied by disabling the brightness keys in Mac System Preferences and downloading the free application, BetterTouchTool, which easily remaps all sorts of keyboard commands, touchpad gestures, mouse clicks, etc. for free. (This keyboard is still fantastic! Don't let this small thing that's easy to fix affect your purchase!)I am more than satisfied with this keyboard in every way. I would definitely recommend it to a friend and absolutely plan on buying the exact same keyboard in the future if this one ever stops working. The keyboard just has a great feel to it. (Kinesis customer service was also very helpful in the past!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ4AMLAFDA9ID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EPIJ4Y#wasThisHelpful","RZ4AMLAFDA9ID","A1UEILMFX6GROB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UEILMFX6GROB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These sports sunglasses surprised me not just by how well they worked, but the attention to detail from Ponosoon in packaging them. They come in a hard case a little over six inches long. The case zips shut easily, and provides solid protection for the glasses. The cloth pouch and cleaning cloth that come with the set are also a nice touch. At the core of the glasses however, is the set of five different colored lenses that can be changed in and out as needed, and the frame that they come with. The glasses themselves are unisex, and the different lenses are a great option - with one of them polarized. There is also an adjustable strap that it comes with so you can secure the glasses firmly into place on your head. They are meant to be high activity glasses, so the strap makes sense, though you can easily use them for every day walking around or driving as well. The fit is snug, but comfortably so. They do not move around but they are not so tight as to be uncomfortable. The lenses were clean and easy to see through. Basically, everything you're looking for in a set of sports sunglasses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQKS6AE2FCZV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOAMULY#wasThisHelpful","RQKS6AE2FCZV9","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say, this proved to be an excellent little device at a really attractive price. There are some cool features, such as the ability to answer a phone - I'm not sure I'd make use of that while taking a shower, but this little fella has come in very useful for my kids. Why? Because all three of my kids insist on listening to music when they are in the bathroom taking a shower or doing their hair or whatever else lands them in that room for a half of an hour (or more) at a time.It charges using a cable that comes provided, and that charge holds for about nine or ten hours it seems. Basically the kids recharge it on the weekend and it lasts throughout the week for them. It works on a variety of devices, from my oldest daughter's Kindle, to my son's iPad to my youngest daughter's MP3 player, all of which have a bluetooth option that easily syncs up to this speaker.I don't know if the suction cup is just really strong, or if it is because the device itself is so light, but when polled, none of the kids have had any issues with it falling off of the wall. It is in fact waterproof, with some buttons on it for obvious actions such as volume control, but less obvious actions as well (such as holding the volume button allowing it to skip tracks on the device). The sound quality is solid, if unspectacular. It's a small plastic device, so you should set your expectations accordingly. That being said, the enclosed space of a shower or bathroom helps volume to not be a concern. All in all, a really great option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KDX9I7BCRF3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0118XPV9M#wasThisHelpful","R1KDX9I7BCRF3Y","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The recent deluge of visual novels has me very excited. It is not necessarily one of my favorite genres, but it has been so under represented here in the west for far too long. Norn 9: Var Commons was actually a PSP title that never made its way over here, but now it finds new life on the PlayStation Vita, and the game works wonderfully.For one, the Vita has really become something of a go-to format for visual novels. This makes a great deal of sense actually, since it is portable and fits so easily in one's hands - much like a book. The vivid screen helps the artwork to pop, and Norn9 is no different on that front. I adored the art style that was used, full of vibrant color and detailed characters, and it looks great on the Vita's screen. Add some earbuds or headphones for the lovely music (though those who were hoping for spoken English will be disappointed - Japanese voice work only).The idea with any visual novel is that while the art and the music help to enhance the experience, you hope that the writing will be good enough to stand on its own to feet. By and large, the writing here is quite good, if not consistently great. The story beings in somewhat wacky fashion as we follow a young man named Sorata, who sees himself thrust into a strange past time with technology and powers that seem out of place. Before long he meets a trio of young women named Koharu, Nanami and Mikoto along with a bunch of different males.The story then shifts as you move from Sorata to one of the three women of your choosing. Right off of the bat this is quite cool, because there are some different storylines that can be experienced based on who you choose. This is another otome game, similar to the recently played and reviewed Code: Realize. All in all I actually liked the characters and scenario in Code: Realize slightly better, but the ability to choose one of three girls in Norn9 is a great reason to replay the game once you have seen the story through to its conclusion. There are also other opportunities to make decisions along the way. Some of these are timed, adding a bit of tension to what is otherwise often a very slowly paced genre. These different choices and characters really give Norn9 a nice amount of replay value.While the science fiction trappings are entertaining, really they are not the focal point of the story in Norn9. There is a grand world and sense of scale to the overarching tale, but in truth Norn9 is really a much more intimate affair. The story is at its absolute best when dealing with the nuance of relationships and characters who grow not only to trust one another, but also show nice development and growth throughout the tale.You can spend several hours on any one storyline, but another great addition to the game is the ability to skip through scenes you have already played out. This makes replaying the game a more streamlined experience for those who (like me) just want to see what can be different on subsequent playthroughs. The characters really carry the story, and because I was so invested in them, I was more than willing to dive back in multiple times.Being an otome game (you play it through the eyes of a female protagonist) and its heavy emphasis on romance, it is quite likely that Norn9: Var Commons will not appeal to everyone. That being said, fans of visual novels and more intimate stories focusing on a couple of characters should enjoy the setting as well as the ability to replay and see alternate stories. The game mechanics found within are somewhat limited by most gaming conventions, but are actually an improvement over most of the visual novel genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11U9R5VSVZCSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YC7DZT0#wasThisHelpful","R11U9R5VSVZCSM","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Until Dawn works despite a handful of fairly significant issues. If you have ever watched a horror movie and thought (or shouted aloud): ""Why would you do that?!"" - well now you get your chance to see if you would fare any better within the confines of the story. The end result is a tense experience with excellent production values that is worth playing this Halloween season.Until Dawn actually reminds me of several games for various reasons. First, it was supposed to be a PlayStation 3 title that made use of the janky Move controls, but thankfully it was given more time to develop and the experience is no doubt better for it. It kind of reminds me of the Xbox 360 title Alan Wake, and the slow start that title got off to after its initial introduction.Until Dawn really does a solid job of capturing a cinematic experience and putting you in control of it. As the player, you will move from one character to another at predetermined times in the narrative, controlling the choices that they make. The introduction does a great job of not only setting the groundwork for the story itself, but also explaining the controls. Initially Until Dawn reminded me of the narrative-heavy Telltale games. It is an adventure title that has you moving around the environment, interacting with other characters and objects of note in your surroundings. In truth, the story itself is only so-so, which should have been a death knell for a game like this, but there are plenty of saving graces built in.For one, the environments are generally gorgeous, and I found myself wanting to explore every nook and cranny. This in turn added some supplemental narrative that helps to provide a crutch for the story itself by adding context to everything. Additionally, the music and the voice acting are terrific, helping to sell you on the characters if not the tale. I was invested in trying to keep the characters alive. Well, most of them. There were a couple I disliked and could not have cared if they met a grizzly end, but in a sense - that is a sign of success as well as I cared enough to dislike the characters, right? By and large the characters look great, though their animations and facial expressions are sometimes a little stiff. They look good, but for a game like this where they focus is so heavily thrust onto characters who have to emote and get the player to feel something, I suppose I was hoping for just a bit more on the expressions.However, the more I played Until Dawn, the less it reminded me of a Telltale game and felt more akin to a game like Heavy Rain, due to the greater variety of controller and button manipulations. The feedback from the game felt somewhat more organic, making the use of buttons and sticks complement the onscreen action better. However, I do hope you like QTEs - because you will be seeing a number of them. For a game that seems like it should have a fairly low barrier of entry (this is not after all, a quick twitch shooter or a sports game where you are regularly using all four face buttons, a shoulder button and two triggers all in the same three second span), the QTEs can be pretty rough. Of course, elements like this are meant to add challenge and make a game out of things, but for someone like my wife or oldest kid who are for more interested in the story and the experience, having to be really fast on often random QTEs could be frustrating. That is not to say the QTEs are a deal-breaker. By and large they are well-implemented, and like some of the other controls, feel appropriate when they occur in the game. My favorite control mechanism was the 'don't move' one, which has you holding the controller still while you are being stalked. It pays to have steady hands when you are hiding from possible death.One nice twist on the gameplay are the various totems you encounter along the way. Picking these up and turning them over provides you a short bit of insight - a scene that plays out before the player's eyes. For the character, it is usually just a strange, unsettling moment. For the player however, these are usually clues that can help you succeed. They often show a worst case scenario coming up, and being aware of that potential situation, the totems give you a chance to avoid that fate. This mechanic of the game reminded me of the Final Destination movies.The branching narrative is interesting. The popular Butterfly Effect is touted heavily in this game, including its introduction, which I included a video of here. In theory, the Butterfly Effect can cause significant changes, and while the lives of the characters are in your hands, sometimes these changes feel more like ripples than waves. They are a great idea with only good execution that provides replay value for those who enjoy the game, however. I would have enjoyed some additional options to skip content on subsequent play throughs. Perhaps the concern was that would drain the tension out of the game and lessen the cinematic quality, but from a practical standpoint it would have been nice.Until Dawn is a very cool experiment that gets more right than wrong. It has a heavy reliance on jump scares and the story itself was a bit of a letdown. Despite the fact that most of the characters feel like stereotypes, they are brought to life in convincing fashion and I found it easy to get invested in their well-being. That emotional attachment cannot be understated, because it helps to carry the experience even when other elements of the game might not reach their full potential. Until Dawn is a treat for fans of horror movies and should be played by anyone interested in a tense experience during the upcoming Halloween weekend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VMXP70OE5ENV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MV7KVP4#wasThisHelpful","R2VMXP70OE5ENV","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Corpse Party: Blood Drive is one of those titles that will undoubtedly get sold short because of its middling visuals and sometimes slow pacing. However, that would be selling short the generally excellent writing and sense of tension that permeates the atmosphere throughout.Corpse Party, like so many horror movies, has developed quite a cult following over the years. This is a series that I often wondered if it would be localized here in the US, and over time the installments have been. I thoroughly enjoyed Corpse Party: Book of Shadows and have been looking forward to Blood Drive ever since. The music, the characters and the dialog work to create a series of titles that I would describe more as creepy than outright scary.The events of Blood Drive start a couple of months after the last game. Characters are trying to move on, survivors of a horrible fate as they and they alone seem to understand who and what was lost. Or are they? Some new figures get introduced that seem to know far more than they should, and the mystery begins to ratchet up rather quickly.The corpse party titles are of somewhat two different minds. On the one hand, there is a lot of narrative - so much so that they can feel somewhat akin to visual novels at times. Thankfully the localization is quite good and the writing and visuals that accompany the plot are suitably excellent. The rest of your time is spent in a somewhat top-down 3D view as your characters try to navigate dangerous halls filled with traps and cranky spirits to be avoided while managing through darkness with a light and limited batteries. Not the most original of concepts, but it works well. Encounter a dangerous spirit and you either have to spend a talisman or take off running - which comes with a pair of drawbacks. First running burns through stamina, which can leave you vulnerable if it runs out. Additionally - you have the other aforementioned traps to worry about dashing headlong into. This leads to a lot of trial and error replay, which can make progress feel very start and stop.Visually this title is a step forward from its predecessors, which had an old RPG feel to them that would have felt right at home on the Sega Genesis or SNES. Characters are larger, almost bubbly and cute, though the lighting and environmental improvements help to serve the creepiness factor nicely. Still, the entire design at times feels just a bit 'too cute' for the horrors that take place, and the engine itself is not optimized as there are many instances where things begin to slow down, despite the somewhat simple graphics on display. Also? I could have done without the numerous lengthy load times. Character models are not edited as things happen to them. Indeed, they should be scarred at times, but still walk around with both eyes and a smile on their faces, despite the horrors they have seen or physically gone through. That feels like a cheap bit of corner cutting to save time and money, but it absolutely should have been addressed by the development team.I really don't want to delve into story specifics, because the narrative twists are turns are really the primary appeal here. There's certainly gameplay to be had, but not as much as some games, and it serves as a vehicle to deliver more story - not necessarily as a primary gameplay hook in and of itself. Wandering around is tense because bad things can (and will) happen along the way, but the story itself is what I came for. It was convoluted at times and just like a typical horror movie, there were certainly times when I questioned the judgement of some of the characters. That being said, I was invested in the characters and found the tale to be an interesting one, if occasionally murky elements. It is also safe to say that this is a title best played by those who have ventured into the prior PSP titles. It is not necessary in and of itself, as the plentiful exposition does an excellent job of setting the stage, but there were many moments in the game that I would not have fully appreciated had I not experienced those two previous titles.While the visuals are an improvement but still a mixed bag, the sound design is still outstanding. Sound effects are subtle and creepy, and while they are not leveraged to quite the same extent as some modern horror 3D games on PC and consoles, the design is still smartly managed. Also? That soundtrack. Gloriously moody, dark and atmospheric. I could write a compelling horror novel just listening to this for hours.For me however, Corpse Party: Blood Drive is all about the survivors of the earlier games. They came away from Heavenly Host Academy damaged shells of pain and remorse, and watching them try to take matters back into their own hands and make matters right was compelling for me. The returning characters were ones I was already invested in, and the newer introductions grew on my steadily as they were explored by the story. I found this to be a satisfying conclusion to the saga. It may not bring new fans into the series, but it should suitably satisfy returning ones despite its flaws.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RF59K83UGBSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YMIQTII#wasThisHelpful","R3RF59K83UGBSM","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Halo 5: Guardians brings an intense level of 60fps action to a beloved franchise not seen in years. After the struggle that was the story in Halo 4, Halo 5: Guarding tries, and largely succeeds at bringing some semblance of order to one of the most beloved gaming franchises on the planet. Combining blazingly fast action with challenging gunplay, Guardians is a high-octane adventure that is all climax which spills brilliantly over into the new Arena and Warzone game modes. Hold onto your helmets folks, because you are in for the ride that you deserve.When Bungie announced its departure from the Halo franchise after their masterpiece, Halo: Reach dropped there was a lot of speculation about the future of the series. Microsoft then put together a development studio, 343 Industries (playing off of 343 - Guilty Spark from Halo: Combat Evolved) there was some trepidation. Prior to Halo 4's launch, Microsoft released the stunning and wonderfully written miniseries Forward Unto Dawn which helped drive the hype machine. Unfortunately Halo 4 dropped and it was just so-so. With a new enemy, (the Prometheans, warrior servants of the Forerunner) Master Chief was tossed onto Requiem in a story that felt shallow and piecemeal. These new enemies lacked the obvious and brutal intelligence found in the four previous Halo FPS titles' Covenant enemies, instead using gimmicks like an ultra-fast juke to sidestep your attacks or simply teleporting from one point to another. They were relatively boring as an enemy and more frustrating than not. The Prometheans (and the Covenant) return in Halo 5: Guardians but with improved AI though their intelligence is still not up to the same level as those found in Halo: Reach. The gimmicks are still there but the Prometheans retreat, flank, and work to overwhelm you (and often succeed). On high difficulties like Heroic and Legendary the combination of speed and smarts can be downright disheartening; I count myself as a better-than-average FPS player yet found myself dying more times than not when on single-player. Co-op for Legendary is strongly recommended, if not required.Speaking of ""dying"" in Halo, it has changed greatly. Previously once your shields dropped and your health bar was depleted it was back to the last checkpoint you go. In Halo 5: Guardians 343 has changed it up to act more like Gears of War where you ""take a knee"" due to your ""armor locking up."" You can then call for assistance and one of your command-able squad mates will come rushing in to ""revive"" you. If they do not get to you in time then you absolutely will die but more often than not at least one, if not two will immediately break contact and rush to your (or your downed teammate's) aid. Even after two completely campaign play-throughs I am unsure how I feel about it but initially I felt that it lessened the danger and took out the concept of ""consequence"" when dying in game. It no longer mattered if your health dropped because you could just call upon your teammates to come revive you. Adding to that is the fact that there are no real negatives to letting your squadmates ""die"" as they will simply go prone with an ""X"" through them if you do not revive them fast enough. They will then just respawn after the room has been cleared and you can continue on as normal. 343 should have taken a cue from the Gears franchise in the aspect that if a squaddie goes down then it is game over yet they did not and took a relative cheap shortcut of just respawning. Disheartening to say the least.On the subject of teammates I cannot speak enough of Spartan Buck (better known as the utterly awesome Nathan Fillion). In Halo 5: Guardians you can direct your three squadmates to a particular advantage point or you can assign them, as a group, an enemy to take down. Buck and his trusty shotgun will literally bumrush the opponent, leading a devastating charge and often single-handedly taking on enemy combatants before Vale or Tanaka (the two other Spartans making up Fireteam Osiris) can even catch up. I will fully admit that I was not all that excited for Halo 5: Guardians until I saw the teaser with Fillion's telltale voice chirping in via the coms unit stating ""Spartan Buck reporting."" Even *after* playing Halo 5 I still get chills when I hear or think of that line.This brings me to an interesting segue; Guardians has the same storied soundtrack found in previous entries and is accompanied by a stunning voice cast. Ike Amadi, the voice of Jameson Locke, as well as Jen Taylor and Jennifer Hale are great, but Nathan Fillion steals the show (as he is wont to do with nearly every role that he takes on). What really confused me was the bizarre mix of super-stellar sound effects (oh man do I love the rumble of the Assault Rifle) and oddly-quiet ambient audio. In some levels you can hear the distant rumble of artillery or the sounds of nearby gunfights yet in other levels it is oddly quiet. Disturbingly quiet and not always befitting the particular environment that you happen to be standing in. In addition to the strange mix of ambient effects some of the weapons sound great, others should horrid. Example, the Assault Rifle has this loveable hum as it spews out rounds and the SMG absolutely rocks as it empties a magazine. The Promethean weapons? Yeah, they sound horrific. Flat, plain, and uninspiring. I spent a ton of time hunting the map for UNSC weaponry or a Covenant Carbine rifle just so I did not have to use Promethean weaponry; if I could not find any Carbines or UNSC weapons I simply punched and assassinated my way through a level. Promethean weapons are the worst.Throughout the 15 campaign missions there was one recurring thought that I had and that was ""I want The Flood."" The Covenant are a great enemy but their story has been winding down since Halo 3 and the Prometheans are flat and full of suck with no real depth. Admittedly the Flood were also flat, they had a certain devastating and monolithic presence; after all The Flood was why the Forerunners *built* the Halo rings. They appear to be all but extinct now and are no longer a threat to the universe (or something), even though the Forerunners constructed life-ending super weapons to deprive them of their food. The 343 entries into the Halo franchise lack this looming, destructive entity which takes a certain something away from Master Chief, the UNSC and the plight falling upon mankind. The void left behind by the Flood has me struggling at times to truly feel Chief's old catchphrase of ""Finish the fight.""When I first finished Halo 5: Guardians I was unsure of how I felt about it to the point that I went back and replayed a few cherry-picked missions to try to get a better feel for the campaign. Unfortunately it did not help, however this is not a bad thing as it was not until I replayed the entire campaign start-to-end that I began to realize the magic that is Halo 5's single-player. Though it is all action and felt more like one long climactic journey, Halo 5 is best viewed as a whole experience, not 15 individual missions comprising a singular story. The fluidity with which the missions fit and the overall arc found in Guardians is a fitting evolution to one of the unquestionably best universes in gaming today.Author's Note - You will notice that there is a distinct lack of multiplayer information in this particular review and that is due to the fact that I will be following up with a Multiplayer-oriented article in the near future. I am waiting to see if there are any particular launch woes associated with Halo 5: Guardians similar to those found in the Master Chief Collection and will report once we see how the launch goes. Given my copy of Halo 5: Guardians was made available prior to release by the good folks at Microsoft/343 Industries, my experience with the multiplayer was anything but typical and I would rather comment on how *you* will experience the multiplayer game rather than how I experienced it with a limited number of reviewers. This meant that servers were crisp, if sparse, and gameplay was fun and fast, but not indicative of the true experience. As mentioned I will put out another, more in-depth article covering Halo's Multiplayer but you can rest-assured that the below score includes my experiences with the limited multiplayer I was able to get into pre-release.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AF1XZWQI407B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB9JV5W#wasThisHelpful","R2AF1XZWQI407B","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dragon Ball Z has managed to be maintain its popularity for quite a long time, with numerous movies, television episodes and games. The quality of the games has been all over the place in terms of quality. Dragon Ball Z: Extreme Butoden falls somewhere in the middle between the best and worst extremes, establishing itself as a solid if unspectacular fighting experience.Arc System Works knows its way around 2D fighting games, and they have a long history of delivering on multiple platforms. The 3DS seems like a curious choice for a game like this at first glance, but I quickly came to adapt to it on the smaller screen. Fights do not last terribly long, lending themselves to the portable nature of the 3DS system. The story mode is really a lightweight version of the tried and true Dragon Ball Z story. There is nothing wrong with it, but the alternate unlockable storylines were of more interest to me. Still, the focus of this game is on the combat and not the story itself.To that end, Extreme Butoden is a technically solid experience. There is not a great deal of depth to the combat. How one character controls in dealing combination or ranged attacks is pretty much how all of them do it. This helps with roster balance, but it makes the gameplay itself a somewhat dry experience. It feels good early on, and the combat is easy to pick up, but by the end of the game you realise that the difference between characters really boils down to some speed and strength differences and the different animations associated with the same button presses you would have made if you were using a different character.Now, as someone who did not find the arena style combat of Dragon Ball Xenoverse all that much fun (despite doing a good job of recreating the one against many scenes that occur in the Dragon Ball Z universe), I can appreciate the 2D approach here better. There is an element of team play, as you construct teams of characters that can swap out for one another or lend a hand through 'assists'. The action is fast and it feels appropriate to the Dragon Ball universe, it just never really adds much in the way of depth as you spend more time with the game. The roster of characters is also somewhat annoyingly limited. There is a much bigger cast of characters the game could have drawn from, and if so much of the combat was going to have a cookie cutter feel to it, I find myself wondering why they did not at least add to the roster for more visual variety.Visually, Extreme Butoden is actually pretty stunning. It is pixel art, but it is bright, colourful pixel art that does justice to the anime. Characters move very well, their animations (especially on super attacks) are entertaining almost every time. I would go out of my way to build up for a super attack, simply because of how much fun they were to watch play out. Add to it detailed backgrounds that looked ripped straight from the universe, and you have a pretty good visual show. The music and sound effects fit the bill, making the experience feel a bit more authentic, even when the story mode itself is little more than still artwork with text rolling on by. There is no voice acting to speak of, so for those who like the American voice actors for characters, you will come away disappointed as you hear 'slightly off' (at least to my ears due to my familiarity with the US cartoon) versions of the characters grunting and shouting.Another miss for a game like this is the lack of online multiplayer. You can play locally with a friend, but I am really surprised that they did not include any sort of online component. With what feels like a lot of time and effort going into the balancing of the roster, it seems as though multiplayer would have been a major consideration. In this day and age, there just are not many fighting games that release without an online multiplayer element, and given the pedigree of Arc System Works, I was quite surprised by this omission.In the grand scheme of things, Dragon Ball Z: Extreme Butoden looks the part, and the combat plays out well on a technical level. Unfortunately it is hard to get excited about the overall product. While the gameplay and graphics are good, and the alternate storyline unlockables were actually really cool, the biggest problem is the relatively shallow depth of the experience. The controls for combat are almost simple to a fault, and it lacks the extracurricular activities and character progression found in Dragon Ball Z Budokai 3. The end result is a fun enough game to play, but it will not prove to be a memorable one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N72BBHANBBGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIW9A94#wasThisHelpful","R1N72BBHANBBGY","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Headphone microphones are nice for when a person is sitting alone playing online or recording within the comfort of their living room or study. But when there‚Äôs more than one person involved it can get mildly awkward to setup multiple headphones on a console or even on a computer or laptop for everyone to be heard properly without massive feedback. It‚Äôs in times like these that an actual dedicated microphone comes in handy and the SnowBall iCE USB Microphone from Blue is more than up to the task.First off, the main advantage of this giant ball of a microphone is how sturdy it is, there‚Äôs no fear in breaking it. It, however breaking something by falling on it is a different story with its hard plastic and metal mesh build. The microphone is simply a ball that could fit into a tiny slot or alcove of a computer desk making it quite easy to hide out of the way of mice and keyboards. For others worried about it rolling away or would prefer it to be much closer and standing on a desk or table, there is a tripod that comes with it which simply screws into the bottom of the mic. This tripod not only allows it to sit comfortably, but it also allows for the mic to be vertically adjusted to better hear the person speaking.Coming with the microphone is a thick USB cable that is designed to fit into the back of the mic. Unlike a lot of newer USB 3.0 cables, this one is not only thick but sturdy with no worries about it tearing if it accidentally gets caught on something. Simply plugging the cable into the computer gives it the power it needs to run and it is instantly available to use. That was one of the key highlights for me, in a day and age of everything requiring specific software or drivers to be installed, this was a true Plug and Play device that delivers clear sound through both voice chatting and recording software.The SnowBall iCE USB Microphone from Blue is a great device for when headphones are not needed or if you have multiple people sitting down to a recording at once. With clear sounds, sturdy build, and an easy setup, the SnowBall iCE easily justifies its price tag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18NQUQFYDPGCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006DIA77E#wasThisHelpful","R18NQUQFYDPGCH","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sublevel Zero is an interesting mix, because it takes the action genre and plugs in some very familiar roguelike elements to create an experience that stands out from the crowd. While this helps the experience to stand out from other action titles, there are still some aspects of the title that I found somewhat lacking.Sublevel Zero hits you with a handful of impressions right off of the bat. The music is outstanding, but the visuals - while colorful and interesting - lack detail and substance. You are immediately presented with a story about making your way through mines to harvest resources that can be used to help craft upgrades, but the narrative never really evolves from there. The controls are really awkward in the beginning, but over time you adapt to them and they feel more natural and make sense. All of these things made for something of a mixed bag initially.The roguelike elements are most notable in the level design. The mines are procedurally generated, meaning each go is a new experience. Sublevel Zero is not an easy game, as it continually forces you to measure risk versus reward in an almost Dark Souls-esque fashion. Encounters and exploration have the potential to yield some very cool rewards - but do you risk death for a new schematic? Or do you push on towards the end of the level, looking for that exit that will take you to the next stage? This continual tug-of-war serves as the primary gameplay loop, and it works wonderfully.Besides the awkward initial controls, the interface is a bit cluttered for my liking as well. Just a bit too much 'junk' on the screen that really does not serve a purpose half the time and just obstructs the view. More modes or options, such as a multiplayer, would add even more depth and replay value to the title as well. Already you have the randomly generated stages, but those who recalled the multiplayer from Decent will be sad to know that while this game feels like a spiritual successor to that title, you won't be playing against others.The upgrades really help Sublevel Zero remain relevant, however. New weaponry is almost always a treat to try out and getting to try out new ships with differing speeds, armor and capacity is also fun. Because this is a game that supports all directions of movement, the tunnel design is very important. Some of the more claustrophobic passages spell certain doom if the wrong enemies make their way down the passage. Because of the simple visuals, I admit to having lost my way more than a few times due to the overwhelming sense of sameness from one region to another. So while piloting is actually a great deal of fun once you get the hang of it, and new toys to play with in combat can be engaging, the levels themselves are more a means to an end and seldom all that interesting.My one last gripe is that you can only save between levels. Not unheard of for the roguelike genre, but it feels like an outdated mechanic in the grand scheme of things. Sometimes you simply have to get up and go do something right then and there. Because levels can be lengthy affairs, it would be nice to have the option to come back to it later. I realize that there are probably technical concerns since these are procedural levels and there might not be a good way to save the current 'state', but it just feels like a bit of archaic design to limit saving in such fashion.All in all Sublevel Zero succeeds because it feels unique. The music fares better than the visuals, the upgrades are more interesting than the levels and some of the mechanics could have been polished - from UI to saving options. Yet somehow it all comes together, making Sublevel Zero more fun than the the sum of its individual parts might suggest.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TYI4YTXZNV7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016C4AYP8#wasThisHelpful","R3TYI4YTXZNV7O","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PlatinumGames knows action gaming and their latest offering with Transformers: Devastation is arguably their most entertaining yet. Admittedly, the experience is not as long or as deep as some other titles out there, but the look and feel of the show shines through and the end result is a title that I found impossible to put down until I had won. And then I started to play again.I have heard Transformers: Devastation called ""Bayonetta with robots"" from several people, and it is easy to see why they would make this claim. Like Bayonetta, there is a ton of action taking place all over the screen as you control robots that look large and lumbering through combat that is actually quite spry and varied. Other similarities such as ""Witch Time"" versus ""Focus"" with precision combat tempered against flashy over-the-top scenes.You take control of some familiar Autobots such as Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Grimlock, Wheeljack and Sideswipe to battle an army of Decepticons. Of course some of the more memorable names in the villainous roster such as Megatron, Starscream and the Devastator make their appearance, but the majority of the time you will be taking on foot soldiers that might as well be red shirts from Star Trek - their only real purpose is to slow you down along the way before they die. That is not to say these more generic enemies are boring, because they come in a variety of different flavors that will continue to challenge you as your Autobots grow more powerful through the stages.What makes this game sing for an older guy like me who grew up loving the first generation cartoon is how well the team at PlatinumGames nails the personality of the franchise. Optimus is of course the leader and powerful hero with words of wisdom, while Bumblebee is quick both as a fighter and with his joking remarks. The visuals are just amazing, with the right use of color, but even greater detail than those of us watching the cartoons got to experience. Explosions happen all over the place as gusts of turbine-powered wind move things in the background or mechanical objects grind and churn in the scenery. There is a shimmering sheen to the characters, giving them a more modernized metal look that adds detail and flair to the visuals while still paying respect to the source material.Combat is, as one would expect from PlatinumGames, a frantic affair. You have a block button, and the Focus slowdown mechanic certainly is handy once you master it, but generally speaking the best defense is an even better offense. Mix in ranged and melee attacks and then shift into vehicle mode for an extra flashy finish. If that last bit sounds weird, that is because it kind of is - and it is also kind of great. You can fight as a robot or a vehicle, something that far too many Transformers games over the years just never really got right. Additionally there are stages where being a vehicle helps you to navigate timed traps in passages or to make leaps over large chasms due to conveniently located ramps along the way.The combat could be accused for being shallow, as you can use a handful of different weapons and thankfully each of the robots not only sports a unique personality but feel during battle as well. Still, by and large you will be performing the same basic combos and strings of button presses along the way. The action is so good that I never really minded, and at higher levels of difficulty it certainly behooves you to master some of the more intricate timings, but Transformers' combat is fun yet a little shallow. Thankfully between stages you have access to upgrades that help to keep things interesting and give you a sense of progression as you make your way through what is admittedly a pretty thin story of stopping the evil Decepticons from seeing their plan through. These between chapter purchases include things like weapon synthesizing and skills, but they do make the frantic later level combat easier to navigate.For as much fun as the combat is, I admit that the driving sequences and somewhat odd 'stand alone' moments with brief, new mechanics did not sit as well with me as the rest of the game did. Thankfully these are more the exception than the rule, but they really do mar the game's otherwise excellent pacing. It is also worth noting that this is a game that is meant to be replayed, as the core story experience is only about eight hours long. The challenges are a nice touch and going back and replaying chapters with different characters is a good time as well. All in all Transformers: Devastation is exactly the kind of experience fans of the original cartoon have been waiting a very long time for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYNS5SPPE6IY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGRLJJS#wasThisHelpful","RYNS5SPPE6IY0","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Almightree: The Last Dreamer is a good example of how well a mobile based title can perform when being ported to something like a PC. Using either a keyboard or a controller, fast thinking is going to be required in this puzzle platformer as there is no time to sit around smelling the flowers with the entire whole world literally crumbling around you.The world of Almightree is a 3D one viewed in an third person isometric style that allows for a proper bird's eye view of the current surroundings. Using this view is going to come in a lot of use in order to guide our Last Dreamer to the seedlings of the Almightree. These seedlings are the only remaining things that stand a chance in order to save the world from the destruction that is currently on-going. While the concept itself may not be a complicated one, the practical application however can be as there are no straight paths at times leaving it up to our Dreamer to make one.The controls used to move our Dreamer along are simple yet elegant in their own manner. The world of Almightree itself is designed in blocks that can be moved around if they are within the possibility to do so before the crumbling settles in. In order to move left, right, up, or down, tapping on the direction twice or simply holding that direction down will execute that movement. If only selected once then our Dreamer will instead simply turn and stare in that direction which will come in handy with the power that he receives in order to translocate anything of a living matter in order to move on.The platforming itself is simple enough with the ability to run in any direction in which there are blocks present. This holds true for moments in which there are multiple altitude levels either raising higher or lower from the current position. As long as there are blocks then everything will run smoothly. What if there are no blocks? That‚Äôs where the power to move living matter comes into play in order to create a path. This will need to be performed swiftly enough however because the crumbling of the world is stopping for no one and our Dreamer is not yet ready to throw in that towel.Moving matter from one location to the other is easy enough. All that needs to be done is to select an empty space, run to a block that is accessible, select it, and it will instantly move. This is pretty easy and the first few stages smooth players into this notion in order to get them comfortable with this idea. Any empty space may be chosen in order to move a block to either create a new path or simply remove obstructions from a currently existing one. As the stages pass by however, things become increasingly more difficult in order to figure out which is where the puzzle elements really start to shine. Metal blocks are introduced that cannot be moved just as flowers that can shock you will slow down your progress if you are not careful enough. Already is there little time available and these distractions will require some quick thinking at times in order to make it through.Mistakes will happen and thankfully our Dreamer has access to one other neat tool. The Undo. The Undo function allows backstepping up to three actions prior in which an action will be described as moving matter around. Why not just move it back to where it was? Sometimes after having moved one thing moving backwards is almost all but impossible. It is in these moments that players will be happy for this function. The only thing to be kept in mind during this time however is that the Undo does not give players back the time that they‚Äôve already spent but instead will have to move even faster to make up for what was lost while they redo their actions in a proper manner.Almightree: The Last Dreamer is a great puzzle-platformer that offers lots of different challenges through various difficulty modes. This makes the experience feel just right for players of various different skills levels instead of simply targeting one specific group. Merging in a timer like system in the form of a crumbling world was a nice touch as while it does force one to hurry, it was less stressful than a ticking clock counting down to your doom.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBXMW7ZE83PSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZFY94HG#wasThisHelpful","RBXMW7ZE83PSH","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's Super Mario! I would have killed for something like this when I was a kid. I always had a tendency to latch onto games with creation elements, and that really has not changed over the years. Super Mario Maker is almost exactly what I wanted thirty years ago. Better late than never!I have to work in the word 'almost' with that above sentence, because there are a handful of things that were still missing that really would have completed this particular package. Still, the way things begin is great. There is a wonderful sense of humor on display as you guide Mario until... you can't anymore. Then it's time for the game to start giving you guidance.Nintendo has always been the best about using their unique interfaces for the Wii and Wii U, and that remains true here as well. This is the sort of game that could not have been properly made (despite what my ten year old self wants to believe) without a touch interface. It is so much faster and more intuitive. It also provided us with one of our biggest laughs as my oldest daughter was drawing in some terrain, and happened to look up at our television for the first time in a while. The Wii U simulates a hand on the television that represents what is happening on top of the tablet controller. After that, my daughter just kept said it was freaking her out.It is the little details like that, or the musical sound of stringing together large chunks of terrain, or the wide range of tools you unlock to help build levels that really resonates with this particular package. It is a game, and a game maker. Super Mario Maker gives us the keys to the car, teaches us the basics and then lets us drive and see where we go. My family has had this game in constant rotation since it came out - including my wife, who hardly plays video games but once she realized what we were doing? Well, she wanted a turn as well.The number of levels you can create as well as the ability to share and download those made by others gives this title an almost indefinite shelf life. Nintendo has included many of their own levels, and some of them are incredibly creative - a great form of show and tell as it lets players know just how good a finished level can be. Of course, with anything like this, there are plenty of duds out there in the internet to download as well. In truth I had far more fun with our family's levels than worrying about what other people strung together, but I did find quite a few that were still entertaining.For all of the things that Super Mario Maker does right, there are a handful of small things it gets wrong. Finding content from friends is a chore. Having to unlock items seems like a good way to keep people coming back for more, but it also feels very restrictive at times. Lack of sloped levels was a minor bummer. Lack of checkpoints was a huge bummer. I really did not expect a Super Mario 2 system to be in here (after all, it is so very different from the rest of the series - no surprise given its non-Mario origins) - though I was still a little disappointed (I always enjoyed the game).However, for all of these minor missteps, Super Mario Maker generally gets it right. The interface is incredibly intuitive. Making someone beat their level before being allowed to upload it is a nice check and balance. The way you can bring in elements from newer Mario games into older ones really opened my eyes to the numerous possibilities before me. Super Mario games have never really been about the narrative - but they are wildly imaginative, with beautiful visuals and enchanting sounds. Here you get to harness those characteristics for yourself.Super Mario Maker is arguably the best use for the Wii U tablet controller yet. It is quite literally fun for the whole family as well - ranging up from you youngest daughter through my son, other daughter, wife and myself. We have had no shortage of fun designing levels for others to play, constantly trying to one-up each other in clever designs. This is an amazing toolkit that is both polished and approachable. There are some shortcomings, but on the whole this is the game I have been wanting - for thirty years now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AQV20RNYYJO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWFCSB2#wasThisHelpful","R3AQV20RNYYJO2","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amnesia: Memories is a beautifully drawn visual novel that is a bit of a departure from Idea Factory's standard lineup of game types. Fortunately for those of us that enjoy a solid visual novel, they knock this one out of the part. Amnesia: Memories thrusts you into the role of a young woman who had been minding her own business as she wandered down a busy street where she was then struck by a Spirit which in turn causes the protagonist to suffer from amnesia. As Amnesia: Memories is a dating sim/romance visual novel there will be plenty of laughs and tears as you woo your way into a romantic relationship with one of five suitors in this spectacular  game.Imagine walking down the road with your mind off in la-la land, enjoying the crisp, clear night when suddenly *bam* you are out cold and you ""wake up"" in a dark room. You do not know who you are, where you are, or what you are doing; when you try to think back on all that you have experienced you can remember nothing, just blackness. This is what happens to the protagonist in Amnesia: Memories and you are then forced to recount your steps as you make your way into the future.There are two things that you will immediately notice upon starting up the game; first is that there is a ton of voice acting and second is that the art is gorgeous. Given that visual novels, especially dating sim/romance types, do not have much in the way of action (or any at all really), the art, story and audio are crucial to the game's success. While the art is stunning and true to the source material (a manga, visual novel, and anime), where Amnesia: Memories really shines is in its story, presentation, and audio.When I first started the download for Amnesia I was confused and surprised at the sheer size; nearly 3GB. Most visual novels that I have come across range in the 200-400MB range and I was not quite sure why Amnesia was so large. Once I started the game though, I understood; this is a fully-voiced visual novel. The voice acting is fully Japanese with no option for another dub but that is alright by me as I prefer the original audio over dubs. The various seiyu (Japanese voice actors) are as always, top-notch. Though the writing is excellent, the various characters that you will come across really come alive with the works of the seiyu. From pleading to disappointment and anger to adoration and joy, each seiyu brings something slightly different.As I mentioned previously the writing is stunning; rarely do I come across a visual novel that has as much replayability as Amnesia: Memories. There are five distinct ""paths"" that you can choose (essentially choosing one of five love interests). Depending on how you treat each particular love interest you can have more than 20 different endings and given that the writing is so good you will actually *want* to go through and play it a second or third ‚Ä¶ or fourth ‚Ä¶ or fifth time.Choice is the name of the game here and whether you want to choose the honest yet blunt Shin as a love interest or you are more into the idol Ikki who is alluring yet a bit of a playboy, the choice is up to you. I personally worked on building a relationship with Kent but am considering going back for another play through, focusing on the protective Toma. With as many options that you have in the game (which, pending your reading speed, could take 10 hours or so, possibly more, likely less to get through) going back for more is encouraged as you are awarded with various interactive extras/bonus content that helps expand the characters.My first exposure to Amnesia was in the form of a touching and romantic anime and I enjoyed it greatly, however Amnesia: Memories in visual novel form is stunning. Following the path of a nameless heroine who has no recollection of who she is or where she is at as she navigates through the difficulties of love and fear. Gripping, if not overly exciting, each of the various characters will grow on you, in part due to the gorgeous art style, the fantastic seiyu, and the solid writing. Amnesia: Memories is enchanting and worth every second that you spend reading its lovely writing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EZ06WN28U0BQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0159ET4JO#wasThisHelpful","R3EZ06WN28U0BQ","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whispering Willows is a different kind of horror game, because it is not trying to nail you with cheap jump scares, but in fact is trying to craft a haunting story - a supernatural tale of suspense. The visuals are charming, the story is well written and this is an adventure game worth playing for fans of the genre.It seems almost like an odd thing, to call Whispering Willows a horror game. The genre has become a mixed bag where games often rely on startling someone, over trying to build up a true sense of dread or writing a good story. The de-evolution of popular series like Resident Evil and Dead Space exemplify this trend all too well. It is therefore a pleasure to play something a bit different, and Whispering Willows is just that. When Pierre-Yves had a chance to review the title on PC upon its initial release there, he was enchanted with it. How does all of this hold up with the transition to console? Quite well, actually.Our protagonist is a girl named Elena Elkhorn, who is trying to unearth there whereabouts of her missing father. Embarking on this journey leads her to discover Willows Mansion. Through the magical amulet she received from her father, Elena is able to project her spirit into another plane of existence and interact with the dead. What emerges is an interesting tale that is neither gruesome or reliant on cheap thrills, but sets up a story that touches on Native American history in some very memorable ways.The spirit mechanic is not wasted here - as it allows Elena to traverse through openings she otherwise could not, or to posses items or interact with other spirits. If we were simply following Elena's exploits however, we would be missing out on some key elements of the story. Most notable re the various notes and diaries that Elena can find and read. They offer up multiple perspectives on events that took place and in the process succeed in fleshing out the story more fully than it could have been told simply through Elana's adventure.In terms of the game's presentation, the music and sound effects are often soft and subdued. From the game's startup screen and throughout, the music is more about setting the mood than being particularly catchy or memorable. The visuals however, are gorgeous and immediately very memorable. The use of warmer tones for so many of the rooms, such as browns and oranges really sets the spirits apart. These characters use shades of blue and green tinged with white that creates a beautiful, detailed world with stark contrasts that work well withing this 2D world (an inspiration the team drew from A Boy and His Blob as discussed in our interview with them).While there are plenty of puzzles built into the environment, the actual gameplay is not what I would consider a challenge. There were a few moments where I lacked for specific direction, but the game is more about exploration and discovery than quick reflexes. Nor is it a terribly long game - I beat it in roughly four hours, and having done so I do not believe it would take me as long to get through it a second time.Still, the experience offered by Whispering Willows is one that adventure fans should experience. It is gorgeous, with a nuanced audio and a compelling story that are worth your time. There may be some who would prefer to have a few more stages and powers to help extend the experience and give it greater variety, and I can appreciate that point of view. However, Whispering Willows succeeds at the goals it has set out to accomplish, and it is a memorable experience that was well worth my time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XNTSEEW12IQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGHAOXS#wasThisHelpful","R2XNTSEEW12IQR","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With anxiety bubbling up in the pit of your stomach you step off the rickety, lean-to ferry into the faint light of Hong Kong. Your companions await you at the dock, socked to the bone by the near-constant drizzle and obscured by the sickly grey-green smog that washes over the lower quarters of Hong Kong. As you make your first step out onto the dock your stomach lurches, upset by the refuse of Hong Kong's seedy underbelly and the ""complimentary dinner"" of instant noodles full of who-knows-what that tasted like it was well beyond its expiry date ‚Ä¶ ""Welcome to Hong Kong"" you grumble to yourself as you move towards those waiting for you‚Ä¶ Welcome to Shadowrun: Hong Kong that is; a throwback to classic turn-based roleplaying games. Set in the same universe/timeline as the previous games, Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall, Shadowrun: Hong Kong leaves its wildly successful Kickstarter and Early Access campaign and strikes out with more vigor than anyone could have hoped for. Shadowrun: Hong Kong is without a doubt the best in this rebooted series as it is positively dripping with atmosphere, characters, a deep story of corporate greed and societal dysfunction.The cyberpunk setting is oft-overlooked and when a game does attempt to enter into the style they are hard pressed to go beyond *the* absolute pinnacle of cyberpunk lore, Blade Runner. Most tend to fall from being truly ""cyberpunk"" and land more closely to ""steampunk"" or just plain ""grunge."" In a few cases, such as with the Deus Ex titles, you find some bits of ""cyberpunk"" throughout the story, though it is more firmly set in the high science fiction genre than it is in cyberpunk. One of the key factors in the cyberpunk setting is that it is high-tech yet ""low-life,""  meaning that technology has indeed become advanced to the point of cybernetics or uploading your neural system to a digital network, yet the quality of actual organic life, and thus society, has broken down so much that the various classes in society are broken into the ultra-rich ""one percenters"" and the rest of humanity.In cyberpunk, the ""rest of humanity"" survives in crime-ridden holes full of disease, both of the physical kind and the societal kind, with life simply plodding on where people live meal-to-meal hoping that their small scrap of the world will not be taken from them by the big, cybernetically enhanced, talking meat-grinder of a man down the way. In this respect Shadowrun: Hong Kong is absolutely cyberpunk, more-so than its predecessors as the depiction of Hong Kong that Harebrained Studios paints is so blisteringly low and depressing that you feel it in your gut. The majority of the beginning of the game is spent wading through the midden-heap that is Hong Kong with a few forays into the more well-to-do neighborhoods being a shock to your senses as it is so completely foreign and cold compared to the stinking, steaming heat of the underbelly of Hong Kong (which sort of grows on you after a few hours).While you are struggling through the spite and hatred found throughout the deepest, darkest corners of Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong you will be aurally assaulted by some of the best mixes of traditional Chinese music overlaid with an intense and highly technical audio track on top of it. The clash of cultures that you experience via the background soundtrack is utterly mesmerizing and rarely does it ever begin to come close to being annoying. Add in the constant hiss of steam, the back-alley chatter, rain drumming on shanties and lean-to's, the sloshing of the Bay as it smacks up against the numerous dilapidated boats that dot the docks, and you have one of the most ambient soundtracks you can find in a game.What voice-acting that can be found in the game is suitably gritty with the characters sounding roughshod and weathered which lends credence to their struggles in the world of Shadowrunning. Various spells that you, or your companions, or your enemies, will fire off sound violent and chaotic which is often befitting the atmosphere. In calmer climes you may hear a wind chime or the hum of everyday life as you speak to the various denizens, both of the dark and light variety, to discover your next clue or find your next target. Shadowrun: Hong Kong, even without an abundance of voice acting still comes away as one of the most character-rich games that I have played in years, far surpassing the phenomenal Shadowrun: Dragonfall and the original (and far too short) reboot, Shadowrun Returns.Environment art and ambient audio can only get a game so far; ""how's the game!?"" you cry? The game is fantastic. Stop, end conversation. Thirty-plus hours in you begin to barely scratch the surface; side quests a-plenty will have you helping (or stopping) drug dealers and addicts or investigating murders. Rather than atypical fetch-quests you will find that each diverting side quest adds more to the story of the characters that make Shadowrun: Hong Kong so special.Like the previous Shadowrun titles, and really any homage to cRPG titles that you can find these days (Wasteland 2, Divinity: Original Sin), voice acting is minimal and you will find yourself reading often. The amount of lore and extra content that you will find is dizzying in its complexity and depth. Naturally though, with any text-heavy adventure you will run into grammar and spelling mistakes and Shadowrun: Hong Kong is no different. In fact there are quite a number of grammatical errors that when I came upon them I could feel my teeth being ground to dust. On the other hand the story and world that said text builds is so rich and entertaining that it is incredibly easy to forgive the first few transgressions.Hong Kong, though, is not only assaulted by grammatical errors as I experienced fairly regular stuttering when loading into some areas though after a moment or two everything would right itself. The load times, though, are absolutely horrific. In some cases going as long as five or six minutes just to load from the central hub town into one of the numerous side areas (you will spend an awfully long time looking at the load times; fortunately each loading screen is full of text to help you in the adventure or as a recap from the adventure that you just took). Given the format that Shadowrun: Hong Kong uses, it is strongly recommended that you first play Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall, though it is not required; you will simply have a better idea of the world, the various classes, and you will have some insight to off-hand comments made throughout Hong Kong so be sure to check those games out first.Shadowrun: Hong Kong is the best of the three Shadowrun titles that Harebrained Studios has released and if they continue developing the series, in which I most dearly hope they do, then there is nothing but promise for the storied franchise (even with the lore that is provided in game, I would love to see Shadowrun: Tokyo ‚Ä¶). With what I believe to be one of the best instances of melding your environment with the characters and the background tracks, tied together with a rich and far-reaching story, even with its grammatical errors and technical wonkiness, Shadowrun: Hong Kong is the best cRPG that we have seen in many years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KMZ8LXSE34K6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147TC106#wasThisHelpful","R2KMZ8LXSE34K6","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SteelSeries is a well-known name in the gaming world as it provides some of the best gaming gear for a competitive price. While we have covered a number of different pieces, the Siberia Elite Anniversary Edition headset really set the bar as it was Chalgyr's Game Room's first ever perfect score and since then each new piece of gear has continued to impress. We were recently able to try out the SteelSeries Rival, a very competitively priced gaming mouse powered by SteelSeries Engine 3 with all the bits-and-bobs one has come to expect out of *the premiere* peripheral manufacturer. What we found was a well-priced and feature-heavy mouse that did more than just ""get the job done."" Ergonomics are key for mice, as are durability and its ability to glide along numerous surfaces and the Rival is engineered in a way that satisfies those three main points. Ergonomically the mouse is slightly larger than its comparatively-priced competition which allows a gamer's hand to rest on it comfortable without having to hunt-and-peck for that ""perfect"" feel; just plop your hand down and you are good to go.Each of the fully-programmable buttons that you can assign standard actions or even use Engine's Macro Recorder to record special actions to buttons, are within easy reach and have what I believe is the best click-action out of any mouse I have ever touched. The level of satisfaction on the click of a mouse button on the Rival is right up there near the level of glee that one gets out of using a mechanical keyboard; it is fast, easy, and effortless without like it will break when you get into wicked-click fests like Diablo III or any of the numerous and wildly popular MOBA's that are out there. This mouse is solid and built to last.Though the ergos, durability, and the click action are great I found that the glide was a bit rough at times. I started off using the SteelSeries Qck soft gaming surface and the mouse seemed to drag a bit. Switching to a slightly rougher mat, the Mionix Sargas 320 I found that it was even worse, the mouse felt harder to move than normal and after only a few short hours I tossed the Sargas 320 to the side and replaced it with my PC Gaming Race Gaming Mat and it improved dramatically. The Gaming Mat is a bit smoother, having a silk-like surface, and the Rival was able to glide and track wonderfully across the oversized mat. On a whim I removed the mat / gaming surface altogether and gave it a go on the bare wood of my desks and found that the Rival absolutely flew over the hard surface with no resistance whatsoever. This mouse feels born-and-bred for hard surfaces and it truly shows when you give it a spin on a hard gaming surface.As mentioned previously you can reassign each of the buttons to various tasks if you are so inclined with the Engine, though you can also tweak various other options. I for one spent quite a bit of time setting the sensitivity up and, I admit, even more time playing with the various colors that you can change the mouse's LED lights to. I had to have them match perfectly throughout the various SteelSeries pieces that I have (which is easy to do, as the Engine handles all SteelSeries gear customizations).  Having a single repository for all of my SteelSeries gear makes life incredibly easy, especially since you can tweak each piece of gear to your liking and if you are like me and have numerous peripherals, it is so very convenient to not have to reset your various settings with each piece of gear you swap out.With the functionality of SteelSeries Engine taking full advantage of the Rival's hardware added to the comfortable ergonomic feel and the best click that money can buy, the Rival is a powerhouse contender for the best, most affordable mouse on the market. With a gorgeous matte finish, easily-reached buttons, wonderful glide, and a click-action to die for, the Rival is one of my favorite mice to date.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZJKAOHPZWQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6IJ5QK#wasThisHelpful","R1ZJKAOHPZWQ1","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To me, the mark of a great game it one that delivers a unique experience that stays with you. They‚Äôre the ones that make you fall in love with the characters, dish out emotional trauma with their story lines, give you that arm hair raising moment of awe, or make you think. There are of course times where you just want to wreak utter havoc and destroy things in a blood soaked haze for a few hours without much thought as to why you‚Äôre storming a creepy ruin waving a comically large meat poker; and there are some good games that give you that. However, the ones that truly stand out are the games that tug at your heart strings in some way. Shelter 2 doesn‚Äôt just tug at the heart strings though; it gives them a good yank then plays them like a cello. Shelter 2 has a simple concept; you are a female lynx named Inna who‚Äôs about to become a mother in what looks like Canada during the winter (so white with lots of naked trees). Unlike the original Shelter where your story begins with the birth of your babies, this story begins with a harrowing escape. Your very pregnant lynx is searching for a den in the dark of night, but wolves have picked up your scent! As you careen through the forest dodging snapping jaws the game gives you a rapid tutorial on controls, how to jump, run etc. Once you've managed to leave the howling wolves behind you, the heart string symphony begins and the stars lead you to your new den.When your cubs are born you must provide for them by hunting rabbits and eventually deer. At first your cubs are too small to venture out into the cold and you have to bring food back to them. My first play through the game already had me emotional invested, especially since you get to name the damn kittens, and I felt like the worst person in the world when I went to far and forgot where I hid my kids. The in game map is just a bunch of symbols with no legend which I did not understand so it was not much help. I kept running around like an idiot listening for their little cries and generally feeling awful. After a while the game prompted me to ‚Äúscent for prey‚Äù which gives you an x-ray view of the world around you. It highlights living, huntable creatures in red and your kittens show up as animal sketches. Using this power I eventually found my den and didn‚Äôt venture out of sight of it for quite some time. I might not be a great candidate for motherhood.After a while your kittens become strong enough to leave the den and begin following you. It takes more and more food to feed them but as they mature, they begin to hunt things for themselves. You lead them from place to place to find food while avoiding the occasional wolf attack. If you don‚Äôt feed your cubs enough they collapse from starvation and if you‚Äôre unable to bring them food in time they perish. Trust me it‚Äôs not a great feeling when one of those little guys goes missing. I said this game yanks your heart strings and I‚Äôm not kidding! You go through all the effort to feed them and care for them that when one collapses you‚Äôre willing to carry them as far as possible and woe betide the first rabbit that hops into view.In the end, the circle of life continues, your surviving cubs grow up and leave to start their own lives and Inna returns to the den to start the circle over. You can choose to continue with Inna or chose one of the cubs to continue the family tree and see how far you can get. It‚Äôs the kind of ending you get from a good book, where you‚Äôre smiling and happy about how things ended, but you‚Äôre also sad it‚Äôs over. In all it took me about three hours to finish one cycle and I highly recommend playing from start to finish in one sitting for your first go through.Some people might see the price of the game and the play time and think it‚Äôs not worth it. I think they‚Äôre wrong. Like Journey, the experience is more than worth the $17 asking price on Steam and there is some replay value. It‚Äôs kind of like skydiving or running a marathon. Many people think you‚Äôre crazy to pay to jump out of a plane or torture yourself with physical activity but what you‚Äôre buying is the experience.The hand drawn art style is phenomenal. It feels like you‚Äôre walking through a Group of Seven painting (Canadian artists, I recommend Googling them), or painted origami. As your cubs age and you explore new areas of the map the seasons change from green, fertile summer to white, cold winter. It manages to capture the bleakness of the Lynx‚Äôs home along with its beauty.The game seems to require a fairly strong rig to run it properly but overall the mechanics and play are smooth. Occasionally it would lag at the most inopportune moment, like when I was pouncing on a deer but that‚Äôs the fault of my computer not the game. The only mechanic I would like to see improved is the map, it needs a legend for us directionally challenged folks.One thing I found disappointing in this game (and the reason it doesn‚Äôt have a 10/10 score) was the lack of threats to your lynx family. Starvation is the only real danger as the wolf attacks were infrequent and easy to dodge or avoid. I thought I was going to have to fight to protect my little fur balls but the wolves ran right past us. There are no hunters, no blizzards, no avalanches, nothing. Lynx in the wild are not top of the food chain and are fair game to cougars and coyotes as well as wolves. It feels like a missed opportunity in an otherwise very well thought out game.I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm quite ready for that level of emotional walloping yet but this is a game I will go back and play again. It‚Äôs a beautiful story told without words and an experience that will stay with the player.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IHEYKP4OKSCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PIFVII#wasThisHelpful","R3IHEYKP4OKSCT","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mionix has come out of nowhere to become one of the more prestigious computer peripheral manufacturers that we at Chalgyr's Game Room have seen. With a strong focus on ergonomics, incredibly high build standards, and some of the best-performing gear we have seen, Mionix is continuously surprising us with their newest equipment. Our previous review of a Mionix mouse could not have been better as it scored a perfect ten and we managed to get our hands on the latest performance mouse from Mionix, the Castor and have taken it for quite the spin.Where the Naos 8200 was an ergonomic wonderland that had the performance chops to run with the best of them, but at a price, the Castor comes in at significantly less in terms of cost, and has a different design. I likened the overall feel to the SteelSeries Rival, an excellent mouse, though a bit more compact. The Naos is relatively large but comfortable for those with small, medium, or large hands due to the ergonomic grooving on the mouse. The Castor though, is more of a traditional mouse and is a bit less ergonomically-comfortable than the Naos. However, comparing the Castor to the Naos is a bit unfair since the Naos is their flagship mouse; the Castor is more ""sports-car-for-a-compact-price"" and thus does not compare well to the Naos.Setting the Naos aside the Castor in its own right is both unique and exemplary in a few things. Firs the design of the mouse works for a multitude of gamer grips; from the odd ""claw"" grip to a full-on-palm grip, as long as you have small hands that is, most small-to-medium sized hands can and will find a decent grip that works for them. I for one have a bizarre grip with the Castor (see it at: http://screencast.com/t/41LrClXX and http://screencast.com/t/Ov1eV62v5qh8) yet it suits me just fine for strategy games, simulators, and classic cRPG titles. For more involved or high-octane gaming I adopt a more stable full-palm grip that allows more control of the mouse. Being able to position yourself comfortably around a performance peripheral is key and that is one of the benefits to the Castor. However those out there that simply want to put their hand on a mouse and go may find some discomfort in the small size.Once you establish your grip you will find that the slide action is smooth, especially when you run it along one of Mionix's gaming surfaces (in my case, the Sargas 320), and does not catch regardless of the surface you are using. The lens used for the optical sensor is quite sensitive and can be used on most surfaces, though I hazard trying to play anything more robust than a cRPG like Shadowrun or Wasteland 2 when you are using your couch for a surface (trust me, I tried). Though each of the 6 buttons are programmable I found that the default settings were more than adequate for most games, but if you so desire you are capable of reassigning each of the buttons to a different task/macro.There is a center button just below the mouse that alters your capture sensitivity through a few speeds (fast and really fast). In its base for the Castor feels set up for first person shooters, more specifically twitch-based shooters like the old Quake 3: Arena or CounterStrike. In my old age though, I found that lowering the impressive sensitivity helped with general every-day tasks as well as the particular style of games that I tend to play.With its small size and ultra-sensitive camera the Castor can be a bit like riding a wild bull at first, though once you get the hang of it you realize that you are resting on a powerful beast that can take you wherever you need to go, plus some. Given the price of the Castor and its generally chameleon-like use, the Castor does have a bit more to it than its competitors do (such as the Rival) given that the click action is extremely nice, mechanical, and quite durable. Additionally the smooth nature of the mouse as it glides over various surfaces is stellar, however the biggest drawback is the relatively small size of the mouse.With its petite frame, the Castor cuts out a fairly large portion of the gaming population as there is no real way to get a solid, comfortable grip on the mouse. I count myself fortunate in my small size as it fits me fairly well, though with a bizarre grip (as you see above). That said, the Castor is a solid entry into the main product line and fits nicely above the Mionix Avior line while falling just short of the entry-level Naos line.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33VSA6YCL9RYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJZ59Y0#wasThisHelpful","R33VSA6YCL9RYA","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There‚Äôs an expression out there that the third time‚Äôs the charm. One Piece Pirate Warriors 3 takes that charm and uses it as a special weapon to decimate everyone that dared rush the field that out Pirates are out on. Back for the third time in a Warriors style, the cast of One Piece return for the best version yet with faster paced combat that its predecessors and tweaks to the system to make it stand proudly on its own as a Warriors entry.It isn‚Äôt until several hours in that the scope of Pirate Warriors 3 settles in. This entry is honestly huge with the amount of content available. Not cutting corners and instead following the main plot points one by one, each stage takes upwards of a good half an hour in order to complete at times. Fans of the series will truly appreciate the direction that was taken as there are stages and story segments introducing each and every member of the crew. Between these introductions and other larger plot points, it wasn‚Äôt until over ten hours in that I realized something fundamentally mind shattering. I wasn‚Äôt even close to the halfway point nor had I touched anything other than the Main Storyline that follows the Anime and the Manga. Having so much fun with revisiting the early story chapters and the smooth and refined gameplay that I didn‚Äôt even care that it would be hours more before acquiring my favorite character or even reaching the end of the story mode which finishes with a custom level as by the time this was being created the Manga had yet to finish that particular arc. That being said, the ‚Äúhow they got there‚Äù wasn‚Äôt all that far off but hopefully some new patch will introduce the real chapter and its characters because that would be well worth experiencing.Story lines aside for a moment, what made things even more interesting was that each character plays fundamentally different than the others. It can come as no shock in this kind of style if some characters play similarly enough especially when being based on historical entries. When it comes to Pirates and Devil Fruits which grant awesome powers at the expense of swimming and pretty much sinking to the bottom of the ocean however, the crazy and sometimes wacky moves that follow are more than enough to allow for some pretty incredible move sets. Following along that logic, if any can be found at times with these crazy people, there are characters for everyone‚Äôs style of play even if they need to be leveled up and upgraded a bit first for their moves to truly start showing their true colors.Where things truly start to form a path and style of their own is within the new Crew Strike system. Instead of selecting a single person per mission as the previous entry, Crew Members especially during the storyline are added and removed depending upon the situation. This simple modification alone adds for some interesting combos as no more does a gauge need to be filled in order to use a partner in combat, but instead the chosen partner will aid in battle at the end of just about every combo after the first level of the partnership meter has been filled. The previous iterations gauge however is still effect but for a whole new reason.Now instead of filling it up to use the the currently selected character as a partner, the gauge is now present in order to unleash some rather epic leveled destruction to hundreds of foes at a time when used in a special form of musou attack that packs an incredible range. If that alone was not enough to change the name of the game, when this gauge is in use prior to unleashing the Super Musou attack, the character‚Äôs abilities are boosted allowing for some fairly decent rampaging of their own. Adding in the last portion that truly makes this system incredible, is that for every Crew Member that this move is performed with, they will perform this move along with the next partner selected. Happen to have performed this move with fours others already? Then there are five people performing one super musou attack and there is no remorse at the satisfaction to see two or three hundred KOs simultaneously happening! Sadly the limit is at four extra partners because by that point it may have been extremely too overpowered and each new crew strike member replaces the earliest one added in a rotation format.Another feature making a return but in another fashion are coins to power up our various characters. Unlike the first two entries, coins now used to unlock the various stat upgrades instead of being equipped into slots. In the first coins were used like parts in the Gundam spin off that could be swapped in or out depending on which ones the players preferred. In the sequel instead of working on the swap method, more of the same coins would upgrade that coin but it still needed to be equipped into a slot. Now as mentioned are coins that work in conjunction with one another to level up a stat. For example a health upgrade could be five of the main character Luffy and ten of one of the Marines Smoker. Once these fifteen coins have been put in, which can be done as the coins are acquired and don‚Äôt all need to be done at the same time, then the health upgrades and a new set of coin specifications must be fulfilled.While playing alone is great, having a friend to lay into the enemies either alongside you is so much better. Coop plays just as smoothly as single player allowing for two separate players to act independently of one another with a horizontal split screen. What was interesting was that the second player could choose any of the characters left after the first player‚Äôs choice but it would not affect the CPU running around with that same character. For some reason the second player‚Äôs chosen character was not removed from the equation essentially putting the odds even more so in the player‚Äôs favor as there were more of them than the enemy running around in certain cases. The only issue that ever came up with playing locally, other than getting out KOed, was that certain character‚Äôs musou attacks could cause one hell of a frame rate drop for the first two seconds of the attack. I‚Äôm looking at you Chopper.Another available possibility for coop if a partner is not available is the SOS option which will pair the player with another online. This will appear anytime that the option is available during level selection. Before starting up if a second player is not found will be a warning stating that if you wish to proceed then level progress could be lost once another player joins in. Any experience or coins gathered however are all yours. This feature runs rather smoothly with only one tiny issue that would only arise if it‚Äôs the player‚Äôs first time playing the level and have no idea as to what is currently happening. If either player decides that they do not wish to view the cutscene or dialog then that‚Äôs it. There is no vote system but instead the scene is simply cut off to continue. With that in mind, the SOS pairing system is a great one as long as things such as dialog and cutscenes do not matter.Finally there is the Dream Log. Unlike Pirate Warriors 2 that called its main mode the Dream Log and took an interesting spin on events, Pirate Warriors 3 uses this mode for something much more sinister. The Dream Log is the only possible way that players can access the first time usable, and long time awaited, Shanks. Shanks is essentially our main character Luffy‚Äôs reason for everything. This character has been seen since the pilot chapter, the first chapters, and is a certified badass as he is one of the Four Emperors. The Dream Log itself works in a manner of islands that must be conquered in order to move on to the next ones. Each stage increases in difficulty with a rising level requirement truly putting players to the test to continue moving on to the next. Shanks is on the very last and very hardest island. Sinister? More than just a little bit but we wouldn‚Äôt want it any other way. This is a Warriors Game.One Piece Pirate Warriors 3 is simply incredible in scope of size and content. Adding in the craziness factor of the types of skills that characters can have regardless of using Devil Fruits or being ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù (which really should not be a word for these sailed seas), not only does Pirate Warriors 3 set the bar for the One Piece sub-section of the overall Warriors Series, but it sets a bar for some incredible added features that would be awesome to see again even outside of One Piece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AO7E4SEMWJ1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RHI62GY#wasThisHelpful","R2AO7E4SEMWJ1Q","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gears of War Ultimate thrusts you into the role of Marcus Fenix where you will lead the Gears of the Coalition of Government's (a.k.a. Cog) Delta Squad. Accompanied by Dom Santiago, Damon Baird, and Augustus ""Cole Train"" Cole, you will battle for mankind's survival on Sera against the Locust Horde. Sporting 1080p textures and running at 60FPS, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition comes exclusively to the Xbox One with additional content, dedicated multiplayer servers, matchmaking, new game types, maps, and character skins. Seeing Sera in all of its true high definition glory is riveting, engrossing, and downright fantastic. Spin up your lancers, folks, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition returns you to the world of Sera with a vengeance and is one of the most thrilling rides on the Xbox One that you can find.Gears of War was originally released for the Xbox 360 in November of 2006 to critical acclaim and it was only a matter of time before it was remastered and brought to current generations. Fortunately for those of us that were hooked from the very beginning, the experience is dutifully recreated on the latest generation of the Xbox platform. While nostalgia is a powerful feeling that the Ultimate Edition certainly preys on, the experience as a whole is improved upon due to the more atmospheric lighting and higher-quality textures that the remastered edition brings to you. Slowly moving through an immulsion plant on your way to the next objective is at times, downright creepy with the rain beating down on you, the thunder in the background, and the blood-curdling screeching of wretches mixes spectacularly in 7.1 surround (a new addition in the Ultimate Edition) with the creaks and scrapes as your Gears move through the plant.The chilling echo of Marcus's boot-heel as he roadie runs through a giant cavern filled with immulsion (Sera's fuel substance) or the sound of firearm failure as you miss an active reload thus causing a slight jam and a delay in your ability to return to the fight. Sound plays a huge role in setting the tone in Gears of War and the remastered audio proves its worth when you first encounter a Berserker. I will wholeheartedly admit that even though I knew it was coming and I was mentally prepared, I was in no way expecting the rush of adrenaline and fear that I felt when the Berserker first appeared. The audio alone, pushed through my PDP Afterglow AG7 headset, was explosive and haunting all at the same time and set the mode for what is easily one of the most difficult parts in the entire series.Driving along haphazardly in a Junker while alternating between driving and firing the UV-powered lighting to keep the Krill at bay is as hair-raising and exciting as ever and with the increased textures and updated lighting, the whole endeavor looks fantastic. The real winners are the Gears though. Marcus, Dom, Cole Train and Baird all look spectacular in their higher-resolution models/textures and the sharper graphics show off the rippling muscles, facial hair, and downright gritty appears of the Cogs finest. Match impeccable facial mapping/lip syncing up to the burly characters' armor and weapons and you have a last-gen title that truly looks and feels current-gen which is a feat few can hope to master. Revisiting the Tomb of the Unknowns (where it is that you will come up against your first Berserker) be sure to pay keen attention to the shafts of light that show through the ash-covered skylights, though it will be a bit tough to do since you will have a hulking Berserker trying to sniff you out and destroy your face; still most of these levels are downright gorgeous and combined with the exceptionally well-crafted audio you run the very real possibility that Gears of War: Ultimate Edition will be a Game of the Year contender.Though I spent my fair share of time marveling at the beauty of the sights and sounds of Sera, I did run into a handful of technical hiccups. The biggest, by far, was with the Gnasher shotgun; every single time I bent to pick up ammo/grenades the entire screen would twitch and jerk, simply not using the Gnasher addressed the problem, but let us be real here, who does not want to use the Gnasher? It is a spectacular weapon, though that twitch is certainly annoying. On the subject of picking up gear/ammo there were a number of times that I would simply hold the X button down and nothing would happen. At first I thought it was battery-related so I switched controllers only to find out that the issue was the same; thinking that it was a mechanical issue I pulled out the Energizer rechargeable battery pack (from PDP) and dropped in some trusty Duracell AA's yet I still ran into the issue. When you are running through waves of Locusts, shooting everything you come in contact with, having to stop and run circles around an ammo box until the game actually recognizes you pushing the X button, well, bad things can and will happen. Beyond those two issues though, I found no serious technical flaws (though maybe once or twice the framerate could have dipped a bit, it was quick and hard to tell so I wrote it off as a one-off).The Ultimate Edition is not just a graphic and audio upgrade; additional content that was originally released for the PC-only has been added to this particular version so players will get near-on 90-minutes worth of additional content that they may not have seen. I for one fell in absolute love when the original Gears was released and I purchased it for both the Xbox 360 as well as the PC (when it launched) so I am no stranger to the new content but given I spent far more time playing the console version than I did the PC version it was certainly a nice surprise. On top of the additional single-player content you get numerous skins (including skins from Gears of War 3) and weapon paints to choose from while playing the much-loved classic multiplayer modes as well as a few new modes. With Team Deathmatch, King of the Hill (akin to that found in Gears of War 3) and 2v2 Gnasher Execution I found that I kept coming back to Team Deathmatch as my favored mode. This is likely due to the Matchmaking functions of Gears of War.I for one detest matchmaking as there are days where I am very good and days where I am very bad; the matchmaking will place me in groups that will utterly destroy me and have me at 0 - 9 for the level (or higher), or they will place me in a match were I go 8 - 1; it is a crap-shoot and very seriously breaks the experience of multiplayer for me. Mind you this is a sentiment that I feel across the board, not just with Gears of War, but with every title that implements it. On the bright side the multiplayer matches were relatively lag-free, especially after I found out that my Windows 10 machines were seeding Windows updates to other Windows 10 computers; once I turned that off I rarely ran into anyone with a hitch in their step. It was also nice to see modes introduced in later titles added to the original title, though I will fully admit that my love for the series stands with the single-player experience as the story is fantastic.Remastering last-generation games for the current generation has become something of the norm these days. In some cases, like those found in The Last of Us Remastered and Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, the re-release fulfills more than simply bringing a great game to a new audience. In both of those games, but especially in Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, the experience is both nostalgic and new at the same time. With new graphics, new game modes and to some users, even new content, you get to revisit the world of Sera as you work to defend humanity against the Locust Horde but you do so in a manner that is deep, fulfilling, and incredibly suspenseful at times. Minimal technical issues and fantastic improvements allow gamers to relive old experiences in a new platform while still feeling fresh and exciting. Gears of War: Ultimate Edition is the perfect homage to an already storied series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCH5LUFLJCWTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZMBLKPG#wasThisHelpful","RCH5LUFLJCWTG","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HDMI splitters and switchers are incredibly useful - but while they sound similar, the two devices have very different purposes. For those looking to take a signal and rout it to multiple locations, a splitter is what you want - and if you are looking for a splitter? Well the OREI HD-104 is going to be exactly what you are looking for.First, a lowdown on the specs. This particular model is an single input to four outputs. The use case I had for it was taking my PC, which also serves as a video station in one of my rooms, and running that signal to other rooms in the house. It might be used in a sports bar if you are looking to split signals to multiple televisions as well. Duplicating a signal in this fashion is easy and with a good splitter, you suffer absolutely no quality loss.The back of the unit has the input and outputs, while the front consists of the power switch, and some red indicators to let you know which ports are in use. For being a small unit (three inches deep, half a foot wide and only about an inch tall), the build quality is excellent. The box just feels sturdy and I have use other HDMI units that have loose ports where the wires shift around a bit while connected. There was none of that here as each cable nestled in snug and sound. Additionally, this is a powered unit and it comes with a 5V AC adapter, which is great as I have had some hit and miss luck with passive HDMI devices in the past.Hooking up could not be easier, and operation is also quite straight forward. Everything you need to know is in the enclosed manual, but really there is not much to it. Now it is worth noting that the unit can get a little warm. I know it is common practice to want to stuff something like this up into an attic or a ceiling, but I do not recommend that. I do not think that the OREI is any kind of a fire risk, but in general those are spaces that get hot and have little to no air circulation. I used to do audio/visual installation in the past, and while running cables through those spaces is fine, I generally found that having actual devices like this crammed into those regions leads to them getting warm or even hot - and that can burn them out more quickly. It is small and sleek-looking, so I just have mine on a shelf right beside my PC.Another thing worth noting is that the signal will try to adapt to the lowest device it is hooked to. While it is perfectly capable of carrying a 1080p video signal and 5.1 audio with 3D, if one of those devices is lower resolution quality, it will scale for all of the devices. I strongly recommend that you use similar devices - this is not a problem specific to this unit, every splitter I have worked with does this, but it is just something else I wanted to put out there for you.An added benefit for gamers who like to capture content, though it doesn't show up in the marketing materials, this splitter seems to strip out HDCP. For those of us who like to record game content from our PS3s, you know what this means: no more blank screens or having to use the component cable adapter. In this example, I ran my Xbox 360, PS3 and PS4 into my switching device. I then took the output HDMI from the switcher into the OREI HD-104 splitter and ran one output to my television and the other to my capture card.All in all the OREI HD-104 offers a slick, convenient way to split off your HDMI signals to multiple sources. The box is small (though the red lights might annoy you depending on your setup), it remains relatively cool, and it comes with an adapter to power the unit. All in all, a great little device that does exactly what it is supposed to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BOLLQBM6QK1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007NKOC2W#wasThisHelpful","R3BOLLQBM6QK1D","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frozenbyte have come a long way since the original release of Trine. The newest entry into the series once again sees the return of its holy trinity of fantasy heroes Pontius (The Warrior), Zoya (The Archer and Thief Extraordinaire), and Amadeus (The Non-Fireball Casting Wizard) as they are once again whisked off into adventure by the mysterious Trine that shows up when it wants them to complete a task.Trine 3 is a first for the series as it makes the transition from a traditional 2D side-scrolling platformer into a 3D one. Having always sported incredibly detailed backdrops, these are now much more explorable as our three heroes are no longer bound by an invisible straight line that runs right by them. One issue that can generally come from this kind of move is that it loses itself in the transitions and becomes something less than its predecessor. In a lot of ways I can say that this hasn‚Äôt happened as our trinity‚Äôs adventures have become something more with the open spaces to run, jump, swing, swim, and glide through.Being tied to this mysterious artifact does have its benefits as each of our heroes are essentially immortal which comes quite handy when attempting to traverse some fairly dangerous areas as some mishaps can happen. What makes Trine unique is that all the characters are required to make it through a stage as each stage is not simply a platforming level, but also a puzzle. Each character holds the keys to certain aspects such as Zoya being able to latch a rope and swing across a ravine while Amadeus can create boxes and float other objects into place. Add in the fact that rope can be tied to boxes in order to pull or drag over levers and our group may not even need to use what is lying around. Not to be left out, compared to the other two Pontius is the might behind the magic and cunning as he is there to hack, slash, punt, charge, or simply block anything that could do them harm.Having moved into 3D has somewhat changed the name of the game when it comes to the puzzles. In some ways things have become somewhat less elaborate while in others it has become so much more. Depending on the situation certain aspects may just not have worked out the way they used to while being two dimensional so adjustments were required. Previously our Wizard could create multiple boxes at a time as well as straight boards in which were used to create ramps and platforms. Amadeus can now only create and manipulate one box at a time however there are generally loads of other items for him to grasp a hold of in order to make a path for everyone to make it across.When this is used in conjunction with Zoya‚Äôs ropes there are many possibilities that can open up in order to make a path forward in which is where some of the charm stems from. Zoya has also seen a change in abilities as she now only has access to standard arrows instead of elemental ones reducing her effectiveness in combat leaving it generally up to Pontius who remained rather unchanged to take care of business. This being said however, just because her combat effectiveness has gone down, there is a lot more platforming awesomeness to be had as Zoya is much more agile than the other two and it shows when wall jumping as she does it much smoother than the other two. Combine these moments with pulling levers and jumping only to spider-woman her way across and it evens itself out on overall usage.One thing that was done and not quite for the better however was how the world map was implemented. Major levels have larger purple circles while smaller one can be colored in green and orange depending upon if they are puzzle or combat based. This worked out great as the smaller level contain no checkpoints and are easily moved through in a quick session while the larger ones allow for the selection from any checkpoint that has been passed. What doesn‚Äôt work out as well is that the major levels can stay locked if not enough of the collectables have been amassed. While this could be understandable for the what are generally the bonus levels to have these restrictions upon the main levels can really slow everything down as careful examination of each older level for ones missed can be tedious at times especially when they were very cleverly hidden.The one thing that ended up being interesting in its own right was length. This applies to both full story levels as well as the smaller ones both individually as well as in regards to the total amount of time that Trine 3 takes up. Trine 3 does not feel short but in reality it is much shorter than its predecessors. The smaller combat and puzzle levels shouldn‚Äôt take up much more than a good five or so minutes depending upon the player‚Äôs skill at making it through the events while the larger stages are in a ballpark of their own. Each larger stage flows rather well into each of their checkpoint subsections but at the same time a lot of these could have been stages of their own. With this in mind it can feel like a stage takes a lot longer than it really does. This is not a complaint as it flows well enough to forget about the time spent but when the available stages are done, that‚Äôs it. There are no difficulty levels, post stages, epilogue to come, Trine 3 really is a shorter experience with the move to 3D.Trine 3 makes a wonderful jump over into the realm of 3D from its previous 2D iterations. While it may be shorter than those that came before it with some features leaving it feeling a bit lacking in terms of what our heroes can or can longer do, the level of polish more than makes up for it in the smooth controls. Now that Frozenbyte know how to do things, here‚Äôs hoping that Trine 4 is longer!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U31XXBGHFGF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I7KJ5O#wasThisHelpful","R3U31XXBGHFGF8","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another season and another Madden game. You could be forgiven for having a cynical standpoint on the series, given that it has yearly releases and is the only NFL game in town ever since EA signed an exclusive deal for the NFL rights. It is completely understandable if you feel that every season is a generic roster update and nothing more. However, you would be wrong if you held these opinions about the newly released Madden NFL 16, which has moved the sticks forward more than ten yards this season.Often times people get hung up on a single aspect of seasonal sports titles. Take NHL 15 for example. A lot of people got hung up on its lack of modes and in the process they overlooked the fact that the game's engine was absolutely astounding. We loved the game itself and did not find the modes to be so barren as to knock down the entire score of the game. Some games make the transition from one generation of consoles to the other more easily than others. FIFA made the move to PlayStation 4 seamlessly.The thing about Madden NFL 16 is that it does not just tweak one feature or simply provide a roster update. Almost across the entire board, this year's game is better than last year's for multiple reasons. I will admit that the presentation has hit a bit of a plateau. The color commentary is somewhat out of sync with the action on the screen at times and it has sort of a been there and done that feel to it from too many years of the same guys in the booth saying essentially the same things. The graphics, while often spectacular, are also largely similar to last year's game. Little touches interjected into the presentation such as updates on a player's performance have a solid television feel to them (even though at times they are somewhat obtrusive to the action on the screen and can slow down the no huddle offense).However, we get a new mode (Draft Champions) this year that should appeal to fans of fantasy football. In it you can draft one of three players every round, over fifteen rounds, to help create a roster that you can then play with. It is a quick, effective form of the fantasy draft and it is a surprising amount of fun while proving to be a quicker investment than doing a full on Franchise Mode that uses the fantasy draft option.The Madden Ultimate Team (called MUT for short) makes its return, and while it is not my favorite of the modes out there, I know it has its fans. It meshes card collection with fantasy football as well, though you have considerably less control over your team. Instead of having to agonize over which of the three quality players you want to choose for your time like you do in the Draft Champions mode, you instead build a team literally based on the luck of the draw. This mode is a bit too much grinding for my tastes, as it is constructed almost like one of those free-to-play CCG games on the PC where you can get off to a reasonably fast start, but before too long if you want to keep collecting cards at a fairly rapid pace, you will either have to spend a ton of time playing that mode or drop some extra dollars on it.Franchise mode is where the most fun is at. Whether you like to take your favorite team, or simply enjoy trading for particular players, developing younger talent and trying to make Hall of Famers out of the older players is a lot of fun. The draft with its story lines, the way you progress players using experience every week and more show how far this series has come since its inception. It is hard to believe that once upon a time sports games used to have a handful of playoff teams thrown together in a randomized playoff format and nothing more to sink your teeth into.All of the modes, bells and whistles and online options don't mean much if the product on the field suffers or feels stagnant. I am happy to report that the actual gameplay is better than ever. The impressive tutorials help teach everything from basic concepts such as running or throwing to ball to more advanced ones, such as special moves for running backs or how to attack certain kinds of defenses in the passing game. All of the while, the interface does a really good job of providing tips and context without getting in the way. There is a new fight for the ball mechanic in the receiving game that takes some getting used to, but it is a welcome addition. It is more viable if you are throwing the ball higher into the air (lob or touch passes - the latter of which can be more easily executed this year with a double button tap as opposed to trying to press and hold it just so) than zipping bullets four yards from the line of scrimmage.Defense is still tricky to master. To be honest I usually control a defensive lineman and let the AI manage my other ten players. I am not very good at pass defense, so using the secondary seems like a bad idea. I will take over on a long, deep lob and try to do an aggressive catch/pass breakup, but I start those plays on the line trying to jump the snap and kill the QB. Blocking is somewhat inconsistent in the offensive line play, but it seems to come in waves. I will go several snaps getting penetration each time and then get completely stonewalled by the o-lineman for another six plays afterwards. This makes the running game a bit more of a crap shoot than the passing one, because a QB can get by with spotty line play using quick releases and smart hot routes, but most of the time the running back has no prayer if the defense breaks through almost right away.Games have an excellent sense of tension. While it is still possible to blow things out against an AI opponent when you learn their patterns and tendencies, I have to say that this year's madden is harder to pick up on these things than years past. In prior games of Madden, I usually had the AI completely figured out by about midway through my first season of Franchise mode, but I do find myself surprised by run selections, play actions and defensive alignments and adjustments than I used to be, and that lends a nice level of authenticity to the proceedings.There is a game within the game now on the field of play as well. For over a decade now, players earned experienced in some fashion or another based on the kinds of seasons they had. Over the last year years, this has become a more pronounced item as player progression has evolved from a mysterious boost that happens at the end of the season to experience points that you can spend on specific stats. Want to turn that wide receiver into a burner? Spend on speed and acceleration, but be prepared for some drops. Want to make your left end nimble with finesse moves to slink past that right tackle? That may help you get to the quarterback, but you might also get dropped onto your backside if you are not strong enough to push back.Now there are dynamic goals posted throughout the game. To be honest, some of them feel incredibly random, especially on the defensive side. You might be asked on offense to throw the ball to your receiver three times on that drive to help establish him. You might be asked to run the ball four times to grind out clock. On one play, my halfback had fumbled away the ball on the prior possession, so my new goal was to finish this drive without fumbling. However, on defense it makes very little sense to get an objective for something like holding the opposing team to twenty yards or less if you are in the tail end of the fourth quarter and they are down by a ton - ensuring that they will be airing the ball out a great deal. You can see some of this in the video below, which is one entire game, or the video above, which is a handful of highlights assembled for quick viewing.Completing these objectives earns you not only experience, but confidence. This was a somewhat new mechanic that got introduced last year, and it serves to add a temporary boost to the player. If the player's confidence is high enough, they might have the stats of an 89 overall player instead of the 86 they are at their core. These kinds of things, when blended with the rookie scouting, retirements, contracts and more of the Franchise Mode make for an engrossing experience. I played through my first season in about two and a half days. That is a lot of Madden concentrated into a short period of time, but it was an absolute blast. Given that there are other features like updated rosters and weekly challenge updates with the MUT mode, there will be ample reason to fire up Madden throughout the NFL season.Certainly Madden NFL 16 does in fact have a roster update, and it has seen a handful of visual touch-ups, but there is a lot more to it this year than most. There are a few rough edges that could still be smoothed out, but the experience is still an entertaining one and the development team has found a way to move the series forward further than in the last few years.

"Amnesia: Memories is an excellent entry into the growing visual novel genre, with solid writing, enjoyable art and interesting characters. Many of the recent visual novels I have played recently felt very linear, but that is not the case here. Those looking for game qualities in their visual novel will likely come away pleased.The first thing that stood out to me with Amnesia: Memories, is that it was something of a role reversal from the norm. This is an otome game, so we are focused on a female protagonist. I have played a couple of others recently that had female leads as well, but they are certainly the minority in this format. Our protagonist wakes up with... you guessed it: amnesia.While this particular trope is done to death in RPGs, it is not as common in visual novels. Here it is used to clever effect as the amnesia is not of the medical variety, but the result of a spirit named Orion that has taken up residence in our protagonist's mind. He is blocking out all of her memories up to this point in her life, but she can actively seek to regain those sparks through interactions with people and places that were once a part of her past.Orion made a pretty poor initial impression on me, but as the story continued and he was better fleshed out, I grew to care about his motivations considerably more. Orion is hardly the only important character you get to interact with. Interact is something of a key term here. As I mentioned in my introduction, a good number of visual novels are little more than audio and visual experiences with a great deal of linearity. Some provide choices - but they tend to wind up somewhat short in length as a result. Credit to Amnesia's team for finding a happy medium between both extresmes.Right off of the bat, you choose which of the worlds you want our protagonist to visit - each 'world' is representing of a man in her life. However, unlike a lot of games with dating simulation aspects, the script here gets flipped. You are essentially learning in reverse - you are already in a relationship with said person and you need to figure out why you two are together. You are attempting to figure out who this person is, what you found interesting about him in the first place and if it was indeed love - can you find that same spark all over again?Each of these experiences is its own path, with its own branching options. These can lead to a variety of different endings as well. You can easily spend a couple of dozen hours playing and replaying Amnesia: Memories - and that is a good thing. To say that the artwork was anything less than stunning would be incorrect. Visually this story is about as good as it gets. For those who were hoping to have an English dub, they will be disappointed. I have actually grown used to the fact that many visual novels just do not get an English translation at this point, but hopefully if the genre continues to grow, we will see that as part of their evolution here in the US.Moving on from the presentation values, it is worth noting that there are several instances of interaction. Some are of the simpler variety, playing air hockey or rock/paper/scissors with another character, but there are so many places where you can make choices along the way. Some have little to no effect, but just seem to help you solidify your character's approach and mindset. Others can have a profound effect. I was stunned at some of the bad endings that seemed to come out of nowhere at times, but the choices that impacted the longer view were often more subtle, but also more satisfying. The parameter system is a means of trying to gauge progress with certain characters during the course of the game. Like some of the Agarest War games that I have played the heck out of in the past, sometimes the choices you make have odd, unexpected consequences. This can make the parameter system a bit difficult to judge at times, and can lead to those bad endings as a result.While the different story lines and how their events unfold prove to be both unique and entertaining, I do wish the male characters were a bit more likeable at times. It is not as though they are all constantly boneheads, but there were times when their remarks come across cold or callous for no real reason. Aside from those moments, the overall story writing is excellent. There is a sort of breeziness to most of the story that is quite charming in its own way, sort of how I felt about Ni no Kuni's story when I played it a couple of years ago.Amnesia: Memories does a great job of creating a visual novel worth reading and experiencing, but it includes enough gameplay elements to give it an unusually high level of replay value. Not all of the characters resonated with me, but the way their individual stories were crafted and how it all comes together makes for some excellent reading. Amnesia: Memories is definitely worth a go (or five, if you want to see as much of it as possible) for fans of the genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XV5R2KB92H0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149HRMX2#wasThisHelpful","R1XV5R2KB92H0C","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deep, robust, engaging - all of these and so much more could be used to describe Nobunaga's Ambition: Sphere of Influence, and they somehow still feel lacking after the substantial number of hours of my life put into this game. Prepare to spend a lot of time and effort - but if you do the experience you receive in return more than rewards the investment in what is so far, this year's best strategy game.I had a chance to kick the tires on Nobunaga's Ambition just about a month ago when I previewed it on PC. The early returns were promising as the game showed a great deal of polish and it was clear that this was no early access build - but a game that was fully fleshed out and being fine tuned for its final release. I am happy to report that now Nobunaga's Ambition has been released, strategy fans should find a lot to like here.Things start simply enough, with a beautiful introduction followed by the first of many menus you will be presented with. From there, I strongly recommend going straight into the tutorial campaign. I have played a strategy game or fifty over the years, but the best ones have their own systems and mechanics that make them unique, and Sphere of Influence is no different. In the tutorial, you play the part of a dimwit who really has no idea how to lead - which is the perfect setup for rolling out the basics. Early on, you are tasked with menial jobs like increasing crop productivity and making nice with your neighbors. These things are all important for establishing the game's more intricate systems, which come into play once you set your sights on expansion.Expansion is the name of the game - all for the sake of unity. Feudal Japan is at war with itself in this historical simulation, and you can choose from any number of rulers and their clans to try and bring the country back together under one leader - you. There is an interesting blend of turn-based and real-time mechanics at play here. Sphere of Influence operates on a month-by-month basis. Each month you set your generals to task on everything from fortifying your castle to recruiting other generals and diplomatic missions. When the month ends, you meet with your council and get an update on events. There is a speed option in the upper left that allows you to make the time go by fast or slow as needed. I generally kept it on fast progression unless there was combat taking place that month. Next month, the generals are refreshed and ready to be assigned new duties.The combat that I mentioned before is where the real-time strategy comes in. This is a dramatic departure from some of the really old school KOEI games of yesteryear, but it works well. Combat factors in several things, from generals to sheer numbers to terrain and equipment. Thankfully if it gets to be a bit too much - some of the larger scale battles can be a supreme test in multitasking - you can pause time to issue commands as needed. Usually in games like this, the combat is where it is at, and while it is still important, I was impressed with just how balanced Sphere of Influence is. I enjoyed everything pretty much equally, whether I was at war, working on some diplomacy, improving my region or simply watching historical events unfold.As the name of the game would indicate, diplomacy is actually quite important. Too many strategy games bolt diplomacy on to little or no effect, but here it feels completely relevant. Alliances are key, but subterfuge is also critical to success. Keep your generals happy, because they will make or break your region - and you would rather not have one turn on you at a critical time. The generals are a robust system in and of themselves. There is a tremendous cast of characters at play here, and they have their own ability scores as well as traits. There is a nice bit of RPG goodness baked in as generals and rulers can earn improvements through completing tasks.Another amazing aspect to the game that kept things fresh throughout were the quests that popped up from time to time. Some of them were easier than others, but almost all of them felt important when they occurred. You might have a simple quest such as raising your crop, market and conscription levels in a region to a specific amount, or for making allies out of nearby unaligned tribes. Not only do these quests give you some sort of benefit (often a new trait for your leader), but they unlock (or conversely lock you out of) future related quests in the timeline.The PlayStation 4 might have seemed a strange place for a game like this - there is nothing else like it on the console currently. It is perhaps not as ideally optimized for a controller as a mouse and keyboard are. At its heart, using the direction sticks or the touchpad like a mouse to move things around on the sides should be the same, but it lacks the clean precision of a mouse interface. This is the only real setback to an other clean and efficient UI, but as someone who personally prefers a mouse and keyboard to a controller, I do feel like that is the ideal control scheme for this game.Now, if you are not a fan of a slower burning strategy game, odds are Nobunaga's Ambition will not convert you. It is everything that makes a strategy game great. It makes you pay attention to detail, it is slow and carefully thought out, it requires some failures before you figure out the best way to play - it is not a game for the casual player only looking to sink in an hour or two here or there. There is a lot of meat on these bones and you could gnaw on them for over a hundred hours without difficulty. Not only is the game itself deep, but multiple campaigns and a large number of settings (that influence everything from troop damage, to crop production to creating customer warlords and more) mean that you can tweak the experience to suit your tastes.Nobunaga's Ambition: Sphere of Influence is a fantastic strategy game and the best of the year so far. There is a huge learning curve here, but it pays off wonderfully as you start to take over lands, delegate to your commanders and wage epic battles in an effort to unify Japan. KOEI has an extensive library of older strategy games and if this is any indication of what they can do with them, I am hopeful that we will see more in the near future here in North America.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NL1A2CXLODRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y0CIZNI#wasThisHelpful","R1NL1A2CXLODRK","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Risen series has always had a somewhat comfortable perch in that sort of middle tier of action-RPG games, clocking in beneath revered series such as The Witcher and The Elder Scrolls, but never falling into the muck with titles such as Two Worlds. Risen 3: Titan Lords - Enhanced Edition attempts to bring the franchise to current consoles with largely solid results.It was almost a year ago exactly when Risen 3: Titan Lords released on PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Of the three platforms, it held up the best on the PC, where the title simply felt better optimized. We enjoyed the game in our review then, and are happy to say that while this port probably was not needed, it was handled rather well.One could argue that these remastered editions of games should only happen if the game was an absolute hit or several years have passed and there is a groundswell to see it again on a new platform. Since Risen 3: Titan Lords really does not fall into either one of these categories, this latest and greatest edition feels somewhat unnecessary. That being said, if you did miss this title the first time around, this is the best way to experience it now.First, the things that unfortunately weigh the title down. The combat in Risen has never really been my favorite. It has a slightly floaty feel at times, where my strikes really do not feel like they carry substantial weight. The combat feels somewhat clunky as a result, especially initially. Adapting to it is not terribly hard, but considering just how much time you spend fighting, it would have been nice to see this series improve on that front. Additionally, new generation of consoles or not, the voice acting in Titan Lords was not terribly good a year ago, and it is not much better now.The next thing I want to touch on is more of a mixed bag - and that is the visual presentation. Animations are somewhat choppy, causing for some quirky character movements. That said, the way characters interact with the environment has come a long ways. I still remember playing the first Risen on Xbox 360 years ago, and finding characters who were regularly trapped in the environment. On the one hand, those glitches made combat far easier for me. On the other, they took away any hope of immersion I had at the time. Here the animations are rough, but at least they are not broken. However, once you move away from how the characters themselves move, the characters and environments are actually quite stunning.Quite often these enhanced editions do very little to really improve the visuals. You might see increased textures in them, but the improvement between the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation 4 versions is substantial. The world is a gorgeous place absolutely worth taking some time to look around. There is still some texture pop-in here and there, but even that seems better than I remember it on the last generation of console.Speaking of the world, that is easily the best thing about Risen 3: Titan Lords - Enhanced Edition. There is a vast world to explore, and the environments are a good deal of fun to trek around in. This is of course helped by how pretty they are, but the level designs are solid as well. There is a lot of content to be explored because true to the series' lineage, the story and world are very open world. While the story itself has a few oddball moments in it, by and large it was entertaining. It certainly benefits from the pirate theme, which is something that we have seen a bit more of over the last few years in gaming, but has (thankfully) not over-saturated the market the way zombies and guns have.Touching on the pirate theme without delving too deeply into the story, your character is the son of a famous pirate named Captain Steelbeard. Our protagonist meets an untimely end, but since that would make for an unreasonably short game, he is brought back to life some weeks down the road. Of course, just waking up from the dead would be a bit too easy, so you embark on a quest to free your ensnared soul from the Underworld. All in all, the story was pretty entertaining and while some characters certainly fare better than others, there were some memorable encounters that took place.The progression hooks in Titan Lords are nothing earth shatteringly new as your protagonist earns experience and gold while going to trainers to improve in a variety of skills. It all works well enough, allowing you to tailor your style of play how you would like. The good news is that there are a substantial number of skills, and this makes developing your character fun. In the early going, options are quite limited, giving fighting a somewhat simple, repetitive feel - but before too long you are learning new things that help to infuse the action with some greater variety. I just wish the combat itself acquitted itself better, because you do spend a good deal of time fighting, and while it is serviceable, it really could have been better. I love exploring the open world of Titan Lords, but this holds the title back.Risen 3: Titan Lords - Enhanced Edition is a solid action-RPG that actually could have been better were it not for the combat holding things back. The world is lush, full of imagination and worth exploring, aided by the still-fresh feeling pirate theme. The music is often lovely as are the visuals, and there are a ton of side quests out there to be done while exploring the vast world that has been crafted. If you played last year's release, there probably is not enough meat on these bones to come back again, however. If you missed it though, and were thinking about playing Risen 3, this is the form to pick it up in.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYY00TCC2TXZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149HRHJQ#wasThisHelpful","RYY00TCC2TXZU","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you have something that works, it can be a risky proposition changing things up. You risk alienating your core fan base. When you keep things the same, you also run the risk of boring gamers with each similar iteration. Credit goes to Spike Chunsoft for managing to find the delicate balance between the two extremes and find something that is still absolutely worth playing.Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc and is sequel Danganronpa: Goodbye Despair are two of my favorite PlayStation Vita games to date. The initial title caught me completely by surprise, striking a near-perfect blend of gameplay elements with the visual novel format. The characters were distinctive, the writing was sharp and the story was incredibly memorable as you tried to navigate Hope's Peak Academy. Goodbye Despair was more of the same - but that was a good thing. I was impressed with how the tone managed to persist despite a new cast and location. Equally impressive was how quickly that game got turned around and localized for North America.Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls is nestled between the two games in the timeline, and at first I was a little apprehensive. The first two Danganronpa titles were released quite close to one another, but they were very similar in structure, meaning that the team did not have to reinvent the wheel. Here Ultra Despair Girls is a completely different type of game - more of an action title as strange as that might sound to those who have played the other two titles.The story here features Komaru Naegi (if the name seems familiar, that is because she is the little sister of our protagonist in the first game) and Toko Fukawa (also a familiar face). These two characters are exceedingly different from one another, yet their circumstances force them together when they would likely otherwise want nothing to do with one another. While this is hardly the most original idea for a storyline, it works beautifully here as both characters actually grow and develop a great deal throughout the run of the story.The fact that you control two different characters throughout the game is one of the three most notable changes in direction for this series. The second is that you see much more of the world and what it has been going through. No longer isolated just in Hope's Peak Academy or stuck on a remote island, our protagonists are wandering the streets. The other is in the actual gameplay, which is not the smoothest of shooting experiences. There is a puzzle-like feel to it all, because of the different types of ammo the girls can use and how they deal with the oncoming Monokumas (I love/hate those deranged things). So now instead of a visual novel where you move about the environment searching for clues in the style of old school adventure games, you have a fully realized 3D over-the-shoulder shooting experience.The controls are a bit clunky during combat, and the pacing is sometimes just a bit off. Thankfully the different kinds of ammo really help make the experience more fun than it would have been otherwise. Letting those psychotic robot bears get too close can lead to all sorts of trouble, since your characters are generally meant to deal with them at range. However, Toko's alter ego (if you do not know what I am referring to, hurry up and play the first game) helps to level the playing field in those situations and leads to some delightfully chaotic carnage.Admittedly the new format took me some time to adjust to. In a game that takes about eighteen hours to beat, it is asking a fair amount of the player to spend an hour or two getting adjusted to the gameplay. The controls never really fully acquit themselves as well as they should have in a shooter, but the game was still a good deal of fun and I could appreciate the team doing something new outside of the prior visual novel format.As a game with a ton of text, I can appreciate all of the work that goes into localizing not only the text, but the numerous voiced scenes as well. It was great hearing some of the returning voice actors reprising their roles and the voice acting, like the music, is outstanding. Both of the prior Danganronpa games had outstanding soundtracks, and this entry of the series fares just as well. As for that aforementioned text? Let's just say that Ultra Despair Girls did not completely ditch its visual novel roots. There is a lot to read here, and I am okay with that, because the writing is just as good as ever and it really adds life to the dark story.As for the story, it is worth mentioning that the Danganronpa games are dark. They always have been and I certainly hope they always will be. They deal with themes such as despair, the value of life and examines relationships from several different angles. They make for outstanding if grim reading, and amazingly Ultra Despair Girls ramps these themes up even further than ever. Some of these topics, especially given the ages of the characters involved, are unsettling. They work because there is a great deal of depth to the story and it certainly helps to make the characters who they are, but the topics and tone will not be for everyone. All of that being said, perhaps most exciting for me personally is that there is very clearly the foundation for a Danganronpa 3 (if not more). The story told in Ultra Despair Girls feels complete and satisfying, but also as though it is part of a much larger narrative.Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls managed to surprise me yet again. While the second Danganronpa was more of the same excellence found in the first title, this episode does something quite different. While admittedly the action sequences are a bit stiff and not my favorite aspect of the game, it becomes more fun with time and does not take away from the experience. For those who might have been growing tired of the visual novel format, it is certainly a breath of fresh air. Everything else about Ultra Despair Girls exudes the same qualities that the rest of the series has to date and it leaves me hopeful for more to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q20KKTSX628U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXCBT1A#wasThisHelpful","R1Q20KKTSX628U","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sword Art Online RE: Hollow Fragment takes place immediately after the end of the first arc of the Sword Art Online anime and follows Kirito and gang as they navigate the dangers of the ""death game."" Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment was originally released for the PlayStation Vita here in the West in August of 2014 and just shy of a year later Bandai Namco released the ""Director's Cut"" version under the moniker ""Sword Art Online RE: Hollow Fragment.""Prior to moving forward I would like to toss in a bit of a service announcement; Sword Art Online RE: Hollow Fragment takes place immediately after the events of the first arc of the anime, Sword Art Online. While the game does go through and bring players up to speed, RE: Hollow Fragment is far more meaningful and fulfilling as a title for gamers that have seen the anime (or read the manga). It is strongly recommended that you head over to your favorite anime streaming sites to watch the first season (both Crunchyroll and Netflix currently have Sword Art Online available for viewing) prior to playing. Trust me, it is worth it.As Sword Art Online RE: Hollow Fragment is a port from the far less powerful Vita (when compared to the PlayStation 4) one would hope that there would be few technical issues however that is not the case with RE: Hollow Fragment. While walking through some spots in Arc Sophia, the primary hub town where you will spend the majority of your time, you will happen upon dozens of other NPC players which will absolutely kill the framerate. In some cases I would hazard that the game runs closer to the 15 FPS mark rather than 30. In truth, the framerate is all over the place, as using skills can also trigger a drastic drop in frames, forcing the game into an unnecessary slow motion-esque appearance.Whether that is planned or not is hard to tell, as you will have various Event Missions that are timed and during these slow-mo periods the timer will do one of two things, either freeze completely then reduce the time by a handful of seconds. The other thing that will happen is that the timer will continue on in real-time while the rest of the game will move at 10-15 frames per second. On top of the framerate loss in combat and Arc Sophia, you will find sudden and incredible boosts in game speed and framerate in a handful of locations. When you clear out an area, or you are heading up to the boss room, Kirito will suddenly get a massive boost in speed and that is when it appears that the game is running close to 60 FPS and it is a very odd behavior, though oft-repeated. Needless to say the port is not all that optimized for the PlayStation 4, which is a shame as it is without a doubt otherwise a fantastic game.Technical issues aside where RE: Hollow Fragment excels is in its storytelling, character development, and for those of you like me, wish fulfillment. When the anime was first released I was in a very dark time in my life and on a whim I selected Sword Art Online out of the recommended anime on Crunchyroll.com and began watching it. The story of Kirito and his band of friends touched me and gave me hope and helped me through troubled times. To me, Kirito, Asuna, Lisbeth, Klein, Silica, Yui, and the rest of the SAO cast became close friends that I watched grow from struggling adolescents to young adults standing against overwhelming odds. It truly touched me and when RE: Hollow Fragment was released I was able to rejoin my old friends and struggle with them as they worked to clear the hundred floors in Aincrad. This time though, I was directly in charge of their fate and able to direct them through the various dungeons and provide them guidance and compassion (this is where the wish fulfillment aspect comes into play). RE: Hollow Fragment also allowed me to change relationships to a point, which was both titillating and terrifying in some ways, though I will elaborate more on that in a moment.RE: Hollow Fragment stays true to the anime and manga that spawned it in the fact that it is grounded in MMO rules. While the PlayStation 4 version has a more in-depth online play function that the Vita version did not have (though you could play up to 4 player ad-hoc matches), RE: Hollow Fragment offered true online play but between massive framerate loss due to technical issues and constant lag spikes, I found that playing during non-peak hours (middle of the week during the day or on the weekends in the morning) resulted in the best play though it was still not quite up-to-snuff. In all honesty the single player experience simulates the MMO feel perfectly via its 100+ recruit-able NPC players that all have their own personalities just fine. I would recommend sticking with the single player experience unless there is a specific friend that you wish to experience the game with.Though the multiplayer experience left a bit to be desired due to technical issues, the single player experience is where the game can shine. Even though you will experience framerate issues, the storytelling in SAO RE: Hollow Fragment is just as fulfilling as the original source material, if not more-so in some cases. Combat, while repetitive (sort of like an MMO‚Ä¶), is fun, fast-paced, and very true to how you would see it in the anime or manga. You can choose your partner from over 100 recruit-able characters including the original characters from the anime/manga, with the addition of two familiar faces that appear in later arcs (each one has a believable reason for being sucked into the world of Aincrad) and in doing so you can grow the relationship between those two characters. Some characters, like Asuna will start with a higher relationship level (due to the experiences from the anime) which will allow you to do things like provide them with new armor and weapons, hold their hands, or even pick them up (like, physically lift them off the ground).The more that you work with a character the more relationship points you will get and you can do this by heeding their advice in combat (like Switching when they call for it or using a Sword Skill when they do) and using the ""Good"" button which lavishes them with praise for doing something well. I personally used one of the characters from a future arc throughout the majority of the game due to the fact that when she was introduced in the anime/manga I went bonkers for her and being able to carry her along through Aincrad was, for lack of a better term, magical.Combat as mentioned is quite repetitive and as you battle through both the not-so-secret Hollow Area as well as levels 75 through 100 in Aincrad it will become quite dull at times. In the first ten to twelve floors I found myself combing over every single aspect of the level to gather as many items as possible (which are crucial since there is no magic in SAO so healing is done via items) and as much experience as I could get, however after I hit floor 88 or so, I stopped that behavior. I found that I was at least a dozen levels over the recommended for the floor and I was getting quite tired of the same grinding fetch quests (huh, just like in an MMO‚Ä¶ ) and eventually just started pouring through levels. Between the first few Hollow missions in the Hollow Area and the first 12 levels I spent near on 45 hours clearing rooms and completing quests; continuing at that same pace would have put me around that 130-150 hours to completion mark.For a game that has incredibly repetitive levels it was hard to swallow. The shining light though, is what happens between missions. You will spend more time simply growing your relationships with the various party members, running on little quests, going on dates, heading out for training or hunting for a particular ingredient and each interaction makes all the repetitive gameplay more than worth it. I eventually leveled enough to simply plow through the upper levels just so I could get to the next between-mission scenes. The writing for each of the characters is spot-on and is extremely faithful to the source material. There is no difference between the Asuna or Yui in SAO RE: Hollow Fragment and the anime or manga and the development of relationships is simply brilliant.I have mentioned a few times the various areas, such as Aincrad and the Hollow Area. Each particular location has its own agenda, though fans of the series will know what the end-game is for Aincrad, but the Hollow Area is a wildcard; nobody in game (or out of game) knows what to expect. Where the Aincrad missions are solely geared towards clearing each level, similar to the anime/manga, in an effort to clear the game (which will hopefully end the death game and allow its players to log out), the Hollow Area is more about leveling and item discovery with other perks, such as ""research"" that will open new skills or outfits or purchasable items. Grinding both the Hollow Area as well as the regular levels in Aincrad will yield numerous ingredients that you can use to craft new weapons or upgrade existing gear. The crafting component is great and in some ways, extremely addicting. I did not craft my first weapon until I was around floor 80 and when I did I took all of my gathered reagents and put them into this singular spear and wound up with what I would consider a near legendary weapon (I still had it equipped in floor 94, when I finally switched to a sword-and-board style) given all of the pluses the various items I used in the crafting process gave it.Each ingredient will increase the chance of a crafted item getting a boost to a particular attribute (such as Agility, Evasion, Strength, or more active enchantments like Paralysis or Poison) so the more of that ingredient you put into the crafting process the higher the chance you will get a rare boost to that particular trait. I spent six or seven hours grinding materials just to be able to outfit my entire party with super powerful weapons (which then lead to ""easy mode"" until the later levels) and it was time well spent. By the time you complete the various Hollow Area missions (progressing the story in one particular arc that leads to some pretty surprising resolutions) and then completing the Aincrad missions you should be a walking powerhouse with dozens, if not hundreds of extra skill points that you can spread across numerous weapon skills. You will be able to sink points into a particular weapon track of your desire, for me it was 1-handed swords and spears, each with their own unique sub-skills, though others may prefer the rapier, daggers, dual-wielding swords, two-handed axes/swords, or hammers depending on their play style. Needless to say, there are a ton of options to choose from; just be careful as there is no way to re-spec your character.Sword Art Online RE: Hollow Fragment is a dutiful director's cut port of the PlayStation Vita original that struggles with technical issues. Players that push through the framerate hiccups and are able to overlook the mundane fetch quests will be rewarded with an exceptionally well-written story that branches intelligently from the original source material. Questions about why some players are where they are or how certain things came to be are neatly answered with little ""fluff or filler"" and work to allow gamers the chance to explore Aincrad with their favorite characters in the Sword Art Online universe. You will relive tragic moments that will tug at the heartstrings as you see now-deceased characters one last time, you will live out new fantasies as you bring two characters together while splitting others apart, and most of all, those fans of the anime will get to spend a few more precious moments with the characters they came to know and love. Technical issues aside, Sword Art Online RE: Hollow Fragment is a love story to the fans of the series and it is an experience to behold.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZOY4PDMVIABN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012PRO97A#wasThisHelpful","R2ZOY4PDMVIABN","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We recently reviewed both the Turtle Beach Stealth 500X as well as the Turtle Beach 420X and found both to be utterly fantastic. There is good reason that Turtle Beach owns the market share and as they continue to release hardware as solid as those two units there are no signs of them losing that prestigious place in gamers' households. While both the 420X and 500X are stellar units, Turtle Beach aims to outdo itself with their latest offering, the Elite 800X for the Xbox One. Does their latest flagship headset carry on the trend of  Turtle Beach headsets that set the bar for usability? Read on for our review. For those of you that have read my other reviews you will know that I am something of a fan of audio devices. Music, ambient audio, environmental sounds, clarity of voice, and the depth of the sound effects of a game can be the coup de grace for a game. An otherwise average game can be instantly transformed from a middle-of-the-road experience to a title worth remembering and more often than not audio is an afterthought (see: Destiny), something to simply fill the void. When a headset can take and amplify that aural experience and bring it to you in a compact and attractive package while still giving the end-user near, if not total control over the settings, you have a winner. A must-buy really. The Elite 800X gives you that control and faithfully reproduces 7.1 surround sound audio in a crystal clear manner. There are no bones about it, the 800X is the best sounding headset available for the Xbox One.When the 800X arrived I took a moment to soak it in; packed tightly into the box was this beautiful compact headset with a cushioned band that ended in two solid cups that house the drivers and controls. The cups as leatherette and plush and they breathe quite well. The soft leatherette cups are comfortable and even after long stints of gaming or binge-watching a TV show I found that they were still comfortable to wear with relative-to-no discomfort or sweat. Along with the ultra-comfortable headset, the wireless receiver/transceiver, a toslink cable, micro USB cable, and an analog cable are packed tightly together beneath the headset. At first I was a bit concerned as the shipping box was quite small and I thought that perhaps the receiver was sent separately (given that other similar headset come in boxes that are half-again as large), however that was not the case. Instead it was just ingeniously packed to create a small shipping package. Turtle Beach took every measure to ensure the headset and its peripherals were taken care of during shipping.In my review of the 500X I mentioned that there was a clicking sound that appeared when the battery neared the end of its charge however the 800X showed no such signs. In fact I was quite surprised with how long the battery lasted just shy of 11 hours on its first full charge (Turtle Beach claims up-to 10 hours), though subsequent charges lasted about 9 hours of straight use (while constantly alternating between the handful of input and output profiles). For as solid and powerful as this headset is, I expected 6-7 hours tops yet was pleasantly surprised at the length of each charge. Once the battery dies simply place the headset on the receiver and an hour or so later I was back to playing Rebel Zombie Army, Destiny, and the Rare Replay through the headset.There are a number of different audio profiles that you can choose from, from an enhanced environment audio designed for FPS games to enhance footsteps and other queues to something called ""Pure Audio"" which is a straight representation of the audio as the developer intended. Each mode is designed for a general genre (sports, FPS/action, etc.) and faithfully recreate the audio in a fashion that I would even consider as ""perfect."" The lows are surprisingly deep while the mids are wonderfully rich and the highs are crystal clear with no crackling. The biggest downfall is in the embedded microphone, but given I live alone, it is not all that inconvenient. The microphone is hidden within the left ear cup and is a directional microphone meaning it is imperative that you put the headset on the correct way.You might scoff and laugh, but the headset is easy to place on your head in the wrong direction (right-hand cup on the left ear) which directs the microphone the wrong direction. If you do that then you will literally have to shout for people to hear you (not to mention your audio will come out ""backwards""). The embedded microphone is nice as it provides a symmetrical appearance but the biggest drawback is that you do need to speak clearly; soft-spoken gamers or those that are gaming late into the night (where spouses/roommates/parents are sleeping) may run into difficulties. However I did not run into those troubles and for the most part the microphone picked up my voice just fine. I do have to say though that with the way my living room is set up that when the air conditioner turns on it tends to provide quite a bit of white noise-sounding background audio that was commented on a number of times. With some repositioning (my AC vent blows down on the one spot on the couch) I was able to minimize that issue and as long as I spoke clearly, the microphone did what it was designed to do; minimize background noise while projecting my voice to my fellow gamers.Some gamers may take issue with needing to speak up a bit to be heard via the microphone which then minimizes the target audience for this relatively expensive headset, however its prime market should have no issue being heard while speaking into the headset. Tie together the clean microphone, extremely attractive aesthetics, and the best audio that a console headset can provide, then stick the name one of the most trusted brands in gaming peripherals on it and you have the Turtle Beach Elite 800X. Everything about this headset is elite and places it in a class of its own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VZX0DLLYZEZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RU5M6FK#wasThisHelpful","R1VZX0DLLYZEZ2","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For whatever reason, it seems as though a large number of visual novels have been getting released lately. The genre is quite popular in some regions, but maybe it is starting to take hold here in North America as well? Icebound does very little to reinvent the visual novel wheel. It tells a decent story in a steampunk/fantasy setting, has enjoyable if inconsistent art, replay value and a very robust world that serves as a backdrop.Unfortunately, Icebound gets off to a pretty slow start. Our protagonist, Dougal, is a young man who has lost his memory. I get that this is a convenient way to explain the world to players, because as the character himself gets told things he would know if he possessed his memory, the gamer can learn right alongside of him. While later in the game this amnesia is explained in satisfactory fashion, it was still a slightly dismaying start to things by kicking off the game with this trope. Add to it that a popular magical item in fantasy literature is the goal Dougal and the other alchemists desire - The Philosopher's Stone - and I felt like we were getting off to a rough beginning.Alchemists are clearly of importance in this world, but they are not necessarily popular with many of the world's inhabitants. More of a necessary or accepted evil, really. Dougal makes for a somewhat bland protagonist during the earlier stages of the game, but the tempo of the story is helped by his familiar - a bat named Issac. Isaac is the Alistair (of Dragon Age: Origins) of Icebound - a sarcastic companion that you will either find amusing or annoying - there is probably not a lot of middle ground to be had there. Fortunately for me, I found him funny more often than not.Other characters come and go, and while many of them will strike familiar notes, some actually grow and change from the initial way that they are presented. That is not to say that all of the characterizations are great. Some of Dougal's interactions with characters might come across odd (there are a number of half-animal humanoids in the game, and while not explicit, there is some innuendo here and there that simply might not sit well depending on your tolerance for interspecies flirtation). There is a tendency to also have characters exit the story right about the time they become most interesting.Some visual novels are very linear affairs that basically guide the player from start to finish, where they tell a specific story with little wiggle room. Others try to form a shorter story with more variance, in an attempt to give the player more control over how things develop. I enjoy both styles when done well, and Icebound lands somewhere in between the two. Decisions do come up throughout the game where Dougal can impact relationships with others and which direction the story goes. This adds some replay value to Icebound, because you can travel down two fairly distinctive paths, earning it at least one more session after completing the story the first time.However, despite these small offshoots, most of the time the narrative comes back to its main branch rather quickly. The other area of the game that has interaction is in the simple yet entertaining alchemical puzzles that pop up now and again. They are simple in terms of the rules that govern these mini-games, but some of the puzzles can prove quite challenging. By and large these were a lot of fun, and gave the storyline some breaks along the way. The pacing of the story itself probably could have been a bit more crisp, but the puzzles serve as a nice diversion. In total your first time playing through the game will probably run just under a dozen hours.The presentation is something of a mixed bag. The sound and visuals are what help to distinguish a visual novel from an actual book, and interactive elements help to make these games and not television shows. While the interactive elements hold up rather well, the visuals were not my cup of tea. The graphics were not ugly, but they were not the most attractive I have ever seen either. Additionally, some of the assets feel inconsistent. It helps if everything you see in the world look as though they are part of the same world, but some characters and backgrounds feel inconsistent to one another. Thankfully the music is almost universally excellent, prompting me to keep the sound turned up the entire time.Icebound is not a perfect visual novel, and it will likely do nothing to convert skeptics of the genre. That being said, all of the elements are just good enough to justify the game's existence. You need a story that would be worth reading if it was not a video game, and despite the sluggish beginning it pays off well enough in the end, due in large part to some entertaining characters who make up for others that are less charismatic. The visual style and interactive elements get the job done and keep the game interesting while the music and replay value elevate the overall material to worth experiencing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F9704Y9ZQ18R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F2UGRTQ#wasThisHelpful","R1F9704Y9ZQ18R","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nostalgia can be a powerful emotion many developers and publishers strive to capitalize on. Some, like Square Enix tend to do so in a manner that is quite off-putting; enticing fans of their classic titles with ""new"" releases on more devices only to find that the game has been altered in a manner far from flattering as is the case with the latest Final Fantasy VI release for iOS devices. Other developers, such as Rare, actually cater to the desires of their fans and release titles like the Rare Replay, a collection of 30 classic titles that grabs a hold of your feels and does not let them go. Fortunately the Rare Replay does more than simply allow you to relive your childhood days gaming away, but it does so with class and shows something seemingly rare in the gaming industry ‚Ä¶ a distinct appreciation for the gamers that allowed Rare to become who they are today.Rare's appreciation for its fans shows in every aspect of Rare Replay; each of its 30 titles are lovingly ported to the Xbox One and offered in a massive 38GB download. Fortunately Rare's foresight into the relatively limited 500GB hard drive in the Xbox One proved an invaluable resource as you are able to download the package as a whole and individually remove some of the larger titles like Perfect Dark or Banjo Kazooie. Not that you would though as those are two of the titles that Rare is quite infamous for and their Xbox One ports are fantastic, the fact is that you will be able to lighten the load a bit by choosing to remove some of the titles.After loading up Perfect Dark I was immediate hit in the heart with a powerful longing of bad 00's music, a Squeezit ""fruit flavored pop,"" and some Funyuns. Navigating through both Perfect Dark and Perfect Dark Zero did shine light on one thing in particular ‚Ä¶ first person shooter controls. While Perfect Dark had excellent control for the time (that is, until Halo: Combat Evolved released shortly thereafter) but I would never want to see the control schemes recreated in modern day shooters as they were too clunky at times and too fast at others, regardless of look speed control settings. The same clunky-to-overly-sensitive controls are found throughout numerous titles in the Rare Replay, most notably in Kameo, R.C. Pro-Am (both 1 and 2), the Perfect Dark titles, Slalom and a few of the older titles. The newer releases, like Viva Pi√±ata and the Banjo Kazooie titles handled quite well and were a blast to play.The sole purpose of Rare Reply is to bring 30+ years and 30 titles that we all grew up with into a single package available to Xbox One owners that allows them to revisit their fondest childhood memories. Titles like Sabre Wulf or Cobra Triangle may not be as well known, but fan favorites like R.C. Pro-Am, Battletoads, Digger T. Rock, Jet Force Gemini, Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo-Tooie, Grabbed by the Ghoulies, and Viva Pi√±ata are all there for your enjoyment (and damn you, jet ski levels in Battletoads; 20+ years later and I STILL struggle with those levels‚Ä¶). The full list of titles are as follows:JetpacBattletoads ArcadeLunar JetmanKiller Instinct GoldAtic AtacBlast CorpsSabre WulfBanjo-KazooieUnderwurldeJet Force GeminiKnight LoreBanjo-TooieGunfrightConker's Bad Fur DaySlalomGrabbed by the GhouliesR.C.

Pro-Am IIPerfect DarkRare Replay successfully returns to you the feelings of accomplishment, the frustrations of failure, and the pure, unadulterated love of adventure that we as gamers have spent the last 30+ years experiencing, all in a single package. While controls can be frustrating at times and graphical glitches in some titles are far more noticeable due to the higher resolutions that titles are being run in (such as the rampant clipping found in Kameo), the nostalgia is still strong and for a spell you will be able to relive the ""good ol' days."" Gaming has come a long way even in the short ten years since Perfect Dark Zero was released but a massive foundation for today's gaming was laid with titles by Rare and bars were set then that are still difficult to meet now.Rare Replay allows us to step back in time to relive those moments without having to dust off old hardware and dig out the old tube TVs, all in a neat package that you can experience with your own kids, saying to them ""now THIS is what I grew up with, and it was GRAND"" as they laugh and struggle with the 8-bit graphics of some of the games of yesteryear; being able to relive those moments with a new generation of gamers is priceless and a testament to Rare's appreciation for its fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R294ZA49PYS6AB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZMBMO06#wasThisHelpful","R294ZA49PYS6AB","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fairy Fencer F is a story about world peace, though don‚Äôt tell the main character that! Fang, our protagonist, has to be the laziest and least motivated person to do anything in just about ever. Here is a man that is more than content to sit back and relax behind jail bars because it gives him a roof over his head and three square meals a day, thereby enabling him to sleep through the rest. Not having any of his laziness, his Fairy partner Eryn uses just about every trick she knows in order to get his ass out the door before the guards wake back up when opportunity arises. Being so lazy though, the guards wake up first introducing players to the battle system. Needless to say, Fang is not your usual protagonist.Fairy Fencer F originally came out late last year on Sony's PlayStation 3. Coming over to the PC realm, Idea Factory and Compile Hearts have re-released their quirky and differently styled JRPG experience outside of the likes of their awesome Hyperdimension series.The battle system is an interesting one because it‚Äôs not all about the mechanics. While the mechanics stand fairy solidly on their own, they are buffed up even further with character‚Äôs able to merge with their partner and become that much more powerful by Fairizing than your standard RPG ‚ÄúHero‚Äù.Fairy Fencer F takes a page from the Hyperdimension Neptunia series and creates something of its own in a two part system. Like in most RPGs, short of a non winnable fight numbers are key to winning. More strength than their defense usually leads to self explanatory results. Now take this idea in that players are given a rather open approach in how they wish to customize their character‚Äôs skills and abilities. Leveling up or synthesizing and buying weapons to increase your base stats is one thing, defeating monsters and obtaining Weapon Points (WP) for upgrades is another thing altogether.The Hyperdimension series works on a point system in order to build up combos for Rush, Power, or Break attacks in already existing combo slots with skills gained through leveling up. Players who are already familiar with this should prepare for something different while newcomers to Compile Hearts and Idea Factory will be easily able to figure everything out with the multitude of helpful tutorials. Starting off with only a single attack, each character‚Äôs options open up rather quickly. Using acquired WP, characters can unlock new combo slots for more attacks, increase their base stats from attacking physically and magically, or simply unlock new moves and abilities to use in combat.The versatility that this system offers is not that apparent near the beginning. Where it really starts to show its colours is once the the party is really on their way with zone exploration and quests that are flooding in to tackle and complete. By this point there is going to be a decent amount of WP to play with. Between all the available stats to upgrade, new combo moves, skills, and magics, turning your character into a whirlwind of death to enemies everywhere is going to be fairly easy. To get to THAT point though, grinding may be required which honestly? Is done rather smoothly with some of the new tweaks alongside some of the older implementations from the PS3 version.Everyone loves big and flashy moves. I mean who seriously didn‚Äôt want to sit through a Knights of the Round summoning animation while the clock was ticking to your doom? Lots of RPGs and JRPGs alike all have loads of awesome and flashy animations and Fairy Fencer F is no exception. While some do allow for players to skip over, I have yet to see one so readily skipped as well, or as fast and efficiently, as this one. When moving around questing or grinding because there‚Äôs always something much more powerful to tackle, the skip function is going to be your best friend. While the PC version is much smoother in everything than the PS3 version was, seeing the same move over and over and over and over again is going to get long like this sentence. So with that being said, the addition of this function not only allows to skip animations, but also the results screen and possible level up results. This truly allows for a very easy and simple time to grind for experience or to simply move on to your goal if you really don‚Äôt care as to how much exp, wp, and money that is coming in.Having originally played Fairy Fencer F on the PS3 myself, I had to agree with Nick in regards to a few smaller items that took away from the otherwise great experience. While graphically stunning in the static dialog scenes with the very well done voice acting and localization with moving character portraits, the character models within exploration themselves felt a bit lacking in comparison. Environments were a bit bland and the character models and enemies were not always the clearest during and battle. The PC version solves all of that with new textures smoothing everything over making everything that much nicer to look at since you will be spending a lot of time outside in these locations.The locations themselves are several in number but be prepared to see them several times over. This might sound like a lot of re-usage but in all honesty it can go rather unnoticed. Over the course of the story, the party will explore each location at least one time in regards to the current events unfolding. After this players can go back if they choose to complete quests or acquire new fairies by defeating a moderately to powerful new boss that awaits. For now that sounds reasonable enough, but without any spoilers, the party will have to re-explore every previously visited location under different circumstances. The reasons for this fit in very well with the storyline but at the same time there isn‚Äôt anything to worry about as there are now newer and more powerful monsters and enemies present bringing a bit of change and challenge along for the ride.As the party grows in number and the silly dialogues continue, the quest for Furies which hold Fairies within are going to come in handy. Furies can be used in many ways but the most important thing to be kept in mind is that they can be used to grant ‚Äúworld peace‚Äù by reviving the Goddess from her slumber after her battle with the Vile God. The reverse can be done allowing players to revive the Vile God as regardless of which action is chosen, each unlocked Fury grants the party member that they are set in Resonance with added abilities. While Resonance of the Fury and the character‚Äôs Fairy is useful, each unlocked Fury also comes with the ability to shape the world. World shaping is very useful as it can increase everything's attack, lower its defense, increase exp / money / WP gain, and even change the monsters present. Leveraging this against the possible positive bonuses that they could provide can be hard in some cases but thankfully there are plenty of Furies to go around!While a lot of re-working has been done there is still one tiny issue that I have. When going into any location there is a bit of lag as everything loads up from the textures to the enemy placements. Instead of loading everything as it is needed, everything is loaded up once a zone has been started which honestly is the reason that all the skip functions work so well as there is no re-loading of the area map once your party exits battle. The reason that it can be a bit of an issue is that without thinking about it and just running in, the frame rate drop is enough to slow you down and wait for it to all be done. While it does take a few seconds, it may not have been a bad idea to hide this behind a load screen. All in all, it‚Äôs not that big of an issue unless you really were only planning on going in there for one monster in particular before heading right back to town to complete that quest.Fairy Fencer F was already a great game. Made even better with the new textures and the smoothing over of the rest of the systems, this first chapter of the series is definitely worth the time with the fun and quirky playable characters and their Fairy partners.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJVSNMADGMV2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K5UZMGM#wasThisHelpful","RJVSNMADGMV2Y","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Episodic format is a tricky thing to pull off in games. Some companies (such as Telltale Games) have pulled it off beautifully, while others have fallen flat on their faces in doing so. King's Quest - Chapter 1: A Knight to Remember is an incredible start to the series, laying the groundwork for the future episodes while providing enough joy in and of itself to make it easily recommended.Getting out my cane and telling you kids to get off of my lawn a bit here, but I am one of those old time gamers who remembers the original King's Quest games and found those adventures to be incredibly formative to my opinion of just what a video game could be. Still, going back to an older franchise that has been in mothballs for a while can be a risky proposition. Oftentimes nostalgia provides rosier glasses to view the games through than a current day replaying would permit.Here the trademark humor, enchanting visuals and excellent voice cast reminded me of exactly why I fell in love with the original King's Quest games. However, rather than just resting on the laurels of its namesake, this new series updates just about everything to make the experience better. That is not to say that A Knight to Remember will appeal to everyone. If you do not enjoy some puzzle solving, backtracking and a slower game pace, then this might not be the adventure game for you and you should probably stop reading now. Nothing I say will convince you. However, if like me, a slow burn with some good puzzles and a charming script appeal? Then read on!Things start simply enough with our hero Graham making his way through a dragon's dwelling. The narrative almost immediately takes for an interesting turn as you realize that this is a retelling of events from earlier in Graham's life. Christopher Lloyd's warm, wizened voice is immediately recognizable as he discusses the events as they take place. He is retelling the story to his granddaughter Gwendolyn, a young girl with her own eye towards adventure one day.The King's Quest games have always made humor an important part of the proceedings, and that holds true here as well. Because this is a retelling through the memories of Graham, some of the events are certainly suspect. One of the funniest bits took place right at the beginning where there are two wheels to be tried. One will open the door out of the room, the other will smash Graham to death. I chose poorly the first time and got crushed like a grape. But of course, Graham lives to be an old man recounting this story, so he immediately pipes up and says that this is what would have happened, should have have chosen that option - but obviously he worked the other wheel as the game reloaded me into the scene so I could choose differently.I experienced a handful of deaths, and each of them were handled in similarly hysterical fashion. At one point Gwendolyn excitedly piped up that she must be part of an immortal family, and in another Graham was gargling something - indicating that the demise you suffered was just a misinterpretation of what he was trying to explain. This over-the-top humor extends from sight gags such as leaping off of his horse and falling down a mountainside (to which Graham verbally explains to his granddaughter that he skillfully repelled down the cliff side) and his interactions with comical characters.The narration of old king Graham and Gwendolyn often reminded me of The Princess Bride - one of my family's all-time favorite movies. There is that warm, loving banter between grandparent and grandchild while one is explaining events and the other adds commentary or asks questions along the way. This feeling was only reinforced when Wallace Shawn, who played the character Vizzini in Princess Bride, lends his distinctive voice to a character in King's Quest - Chapter 1: A Knight to Remember as well.The story has moments where your decisions will have an impact on the game later. Most of the time, the choices seem pretty arbitrary. You are at one point tasked with helping to fix a wagon wheel by replacing it with something round. You can find three different items to do the job, and while they look visually different, they did not seem to have any particular impact on the outcome. Other choices made - including one early in the game, promises to have more of a direct impact on the story that is told. Time will tell how much of a significant impact these choices will have.The visuals are not the strongest point here, but they are better than what we usually see in the Telltale Games. Graham's flapping cloak and the bright, colorful background environments are a treat, even though technical issues (a bit of slowdown in one scene and some pop-through on Graham's cloak a few times when colliding with other objects) do detract from the experience now and again.Graham's first chapter in this adventure runs a fairly decent length of time. Again the comparison to the narrative-heavy Telltale Games has to be made given the format and the game structure, but it felt like there was just a bit more meat on these bones than a typical chapter in Telltale games. Still, the good and the bad of it is that this was an episode - it left me wanting for more, but now rather than later.King's Quest - Chapter 1: A Knight to Remember is probably not going to be for everyone. There are some action sequences, but it is really more of an adventure game where you have to figure out how items found in the environment work together to move on in the story. Some of these puzzles are more intuitive than others (for example there is at one point a door to be passed, where I was thoroughly flummoxed for a time, until I realized that I could climb up a nearby wall - something that the game had not clearly introduced as a mechanic to that point), but once you figure them out, they make perfect sense. The pacing is slower and your own nostalgic mileage may vary, but for me it was an almost perfect way to reintroduce me to an old friend of a gaming series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23XZPKZH41GIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012PRLRE8#wasThisHelpful","R23XZPKZH41GIX","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While Arc System Works is no doubt best known for their take on the fighting genre, XBLAZE: Lost Memories shows that the talented team can pull of a completely different style of game as well. Set in the world as the popular Blazblue series, Lost Memories expands on the excellent story found in XBLAZE Code: Embryo and offers us an even broader look at the world in unique, interesting ways.Lost Memories is not a direct sequel to the events of the first XBLAZE title, but more of a shifted perspective that lives in the same time and place. The story actually kicks off in completely new fashion, having nothing to do with the original game's characters. Instead we follow a young girl who is at her dying mother's side. She makes a promise to take care of her younger sister and does just that once their father disappears mysteriously with her mother's body up passing away.The story then fast forwards several years until our primary protagonist (whom you can name, I went with Lissa for the sake of future references in this review) is a young woman doing her best to raise her younger sister. The siblings lead a sheltered life of Lissa's own design, trying to keep her younger sister safe from an outside world that might want to find and take advantage of a mysterious power she has. The tale does a good job of setting the stage initially, without overloading you with facts and data that might be confusing. However, as you play the game, you unlock tips that can be viewed from one of the menu screens. Here you can expand your vocabulary, allowing you to better understand the universe if you are new to it.While you do not have to play the original XBLAZE game to enjoy this offering, I would strongly recommend you do so. It had been a while since I last played through it, so I did so again in anticipation of Lost Memories, and my experience was undoubtedly better for having done so. Not only was I now in the right frame of mind to use the vocabulary of this world, but even the characters, locations and various histories of the world were in the forefront of my mind. This mixed with the fact that the first entry was a thoroughly enjoyable one, I strongly encourage playing through that before venturing into what Lost Memories has to offer.Moving back to the proper story of this chapter, Lissa comes home in a panicked rush because she believes something terrible may have happened to her impetuous younger sister. In trying to find her, Lissa enters her absentee father's old workshop, exposing herself to a strange new world where she meets a friendly woman of roughly the same age called Nobody. From here, Lissa realizes that her memory is but a shell of what it should be, and you lead her on a path of exploration - both physically and mentally. Here is where I wills top dipping into the story, because all of this is foundation leading into the proper tale, and to go any further with specifics would no doubt fall into some spoiler territory best left discovered for oneself.While the first hour of the game or so is nothing but straight and narrow visual novel, once you reach this stage of the game things do open up a bit. There is an exploration mechanic where Lissa must travel each floor of this abyss one at a time, looking for fragments of her fractured memory. Only by finding them can she advance down to the next floor and start to put together the grander story behind Lost Memories. In truth as far as gameplay mechanics go, this one is pretty simple. You are not fighting waves of dangerous enemies or anything of that nature - you are wandering about trying to find these small pieces of the puzzle. If you are thorough, you should be able to find them all easily enough, and they are not only important for progression, but interesting within the context of not only this story, but the events that took place in the original XBLAZE.This is a fun mechanic that adds a bit of game element to what is otherwise a very linear story. To its credit, the replay value of the original XBLAZE was helped by a storyline that had multiple opportunities to branch out and then create different, distinctive endings. This time around, it feels as though the development team had a far more specific story they wanted to tell. There are variables that you can impact throughout Lissa's story that impact fragments of the game's ending, but they are not wholesale changes. There is a very definitive beginning and end game at play here, but if you are a fan of the Blazblue universe or the first XBLAZE game, trust me when I say the story pays off wonderfully.The graphics are simple but cutesy when walking the different levels, while the animated cutscenes are handled quite well. The visuals are on par with your typical anime, which is to say the characters are cute, animations are often simple but effective and the use of color is bright and interesting. The game was not localized to English audibly, which means you will be listening to the original Japanese voice cast. I would have preferred an English track, but I did not really expect one and thankfully the subtitles were localized quite nicely. You will be doing a lot of reading (it is a visual novel, after all), so I am pleased to see that the writing was handled so skillfully.I found myself easily invested in the characters from the first title, and that holds true in XBLAZE: Lost Memories as well. We get to revisit some of those original characters I was so fond of in the first place, but the new ones hold their own as well. The way that the narrative dips in and out of the original story, giving us new angles to the prior events is handled skillfully and the entire experience was an enjoyable one that rang in around fifteen hours. While there is less replay value to be had here than in the first game, the second one is absolutely worthy of your time and should be experienced by fans of the Blazblue world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROX3NEG3K7P0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0TLY8S#wasThisHelpful","ROX3NEG3K7P0I","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Xara Photo & Graphic Designer 11 is the latest in the long-running Xara family that lets you do anything from creating short animations to designing websites to editing photos. Though never achieving the same household name status as the likes of Adobe and Corel, the Xara brand is just as old, if not older. And given their diversity and robust package, Xara is a great alternative for beginners and professionals alike who want to expand their software and editing knowledge to beyond that of Adobe, Corel and even GIMP.A WYSIWYG tool, Xara Photo & Graphic Designer 11 is as easy to operate as it is easy on your computer. Reguiring only 300mb of HDD space and 500mb of RAM, this software is a great investment for those with a medium- or low-end computer. Because it is light-weight, the response time is significantly superior than that of the most recent, high-profile softwares, such as the Adobe CC family. If the speed and efficiency were to be compared (accuracy may vary depending on your computer), it is just as quick as Picasa - but where Picasa lets you edit your photos using pre-defined assets and templates, Xara gives you creative freedom. Because it uses a sophisticated vector rendering engine, you won't have to put up with loading times; thus, you can view and edit your work in real-time as efficiently and quickly as possible. This is a major plus for those with generally weak computers, because then they will have one less thing to worry about.The GUI is plain and simple. The side panels only display the basic necessities while the upper / lower panels are truncated for ease of access and efficiency. Although I enjoyed the clean look of the interface, it was saddening to learn I couldn't alter the workspace to my own liking. I usually do this when I'm working on PhotoShop and After Effects, so this optional feature would've been nice. The tools are impressive and just what you'd expect from a solid package such as this one. Out of all, the best are the Direct Action Tools, as they allow you to add bevel, set transparency level and gradient, change the color and add or remove 3D effects via simply dragging and clicking.Traditionally, in other softwares you have to open multiple sub-menus and then enter a desired value. Some have the option to preview the alterations in real-time, while most do not. Xara simply removes the part where you enter a figure and wait for the changes to load. Staying true to its WYSIWYG status, Xara gives these features their own icons and makes them part of the designing process by giving them the same functionality as that of a brush, pen or shape tool. This feature saves a-lot of time and I personally saw a great output surge with it.Another celebrated aspect are the options found in the Insert menu. The Content Catalogue has an interesting collection of clipart and vector images that you can use as is or modify them to your liking for your web design or whatever project is it that you're working on. There are also many templates available, ranging from CD covers to business logos. Speaking of which, the logo presets aren't of the best quality - you can get better designs from Sothink Logo Maker.If you're creating a logo and want inspiration, the best bet is to design and save a logo prototype from Sothink and then edit it in Xara. Sure, Adobe Illustrator is the perfect choice for this work but Illustrator requires a-lot of learning and adapting. Font Awesome Symbol - the most well-known option from the Insert menu - lets you choose from 200+ generic high-quality symbols (such as volume, mute, playback) and over a dozen brand icons (such as Facebook and Steam). This is a neat feature as you won't have to constantly download .png images and save them in folders - which can, frankly speaking, take time and can be quite frustrating.In conclusion, Xara Photo & Graphic Designer 11's options may not have the depth as Adobe's products nor the deep customizing freedom as in GIMP, but its easy to understand interface, intuitive nature, clean GUI and lightweight platform makes it the perfect alternative. For those intimidated by the never-ending options of Illustrator and PhotoShop may find Xara an approachable slice of relief. If anything, Xara Photo Graphic Designer 11 is the perfect outlet for logo designers, as it grants you just the right dose of freedom, creativity and editing power to make your abstract ideas into concrete reality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36D178NPS1FGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015PIIFSA#wasThisHelpful","R36D178NPS1FGD","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A good headset helps to make a game more fun, especially those that have online components. A great headset enhances the experience and makes the game itself more enjoyable as a result. Turtle Beach has been in this particular hardware game for quite some time now, but the Ear Force Stealth 420X Headset for the Xbox One shows that they are still among the best in the business.To start with, you have a fully wireless headset. You use a dongle to connect the headset to the console, but the Stealth 420X cuts the middle man (in this case, the controller) out of the equation. Personally, I am a huge fan of that, because I am a gamer who has arms that tend to... well, for lack of a better word, flail. I am pretty animated, and there have been countless times that wired headsets got in my way, sometimes jerking the set down on my head oddly or accidentally getting disconnected. None of that to contend with here.The actual setup is quite easy. This thing is basically plug and play. There is an included USB cable that you can use for charging. Charge times sure seemed pretty snappy. I completely played the headset out until the battery was dead and put it on the cable to charge. I gave it about fifteen minutes to see if the headset was usable. I am not sure how long it would take for a 'full charge', but in that fifteen minutes I was able to get another couple of hours out of the set.The typical dials and features you would expect are here, including game and chat volume controls to blend the audio to your personal preference. The mic monitoring feature might be my favorite addition, however. Not for me. Despite my various arm gesticulations, I am fairly quiet when I use a headset. I listen more than I speak - that is just my personality when playing a game online.Then there is my son.My sixteen year old son during more intense games has a tendency to get caught up in things. The headsets tend to seal out sound, he has them cranked up, he is into the moment, and he is so bloody loud that I pretty much have to compare him to someone trying to yell over the jackhammer of a construction worker. I made him use this particular feature, and certainly he had his moments where he would get loud - but almost immediately realized it and piped down. I do believe that if nothing else, this makes the Ear Force Stealth 420X Headset my wife's new best friend.Next up, I wanted to discuss the construction of the headset. To start, it has the typical Turtle Beach black and green aesthetics - my son's favorite color combination. I get the feeling he is going to be using these a lot. With a full charge, the headset lasts well over a dozen hours and despite the sturdy design, the headset itself never felt overly heavy. The ear pad foam is soft, comfortable and while not completely noise cancelling, does a very solid job of helping to seal out exterior sounds. There is a nice pad on the underside of the band as well, so the headset never got uncomfortable with settling the bulk of its weight across the top of my head.The band itself expands down near where the cups are at, and the ear cups themselves have some nice swivel to them. This makes the Stealth 420X easy to adjust and comfortable for a variety of different heads. My soon made note of the fact that the cups actually did not press in on the arms of his glasses, which he was quite happy about. One other nice big of construction design is that the boom microphone can be attached and detached at will. If you simply want to listen to music or a television show (and there is an additional 3.5mm auxiliary port on the headset for those who want to use these to listen to an iPhone, MP3 player or your PC/Laptop/Tablet).The one drawback to using the headset in this fashion is that there is no passive listening - you need to have the headset turned on. Otherwise it will not carry audio. That means you have to keep them charged, and that the blinking/glowing nature of the headset makes them slightly distracting to simply walk out and about with. The headset has a handy power saving mode when it is not getting a feed through the dongle connected to the Xbox One, which is a great feature when you have it in the living room and may have accidentally left the headset on. It is less awesome when you are trying to use it with your cell phone while out and about. There is a tone that indicates that the headset might go into this power saving mode, and you can press a button to keep it going, but it is an inconvenience that could have been skipped by allowing for passive listening. I could not find any way of turning this power saving feature off.The construction of the headset itself is of a more medium weight. The headset is mostly plastic, which keeps it light. This is great for long hours of gaming as many gamers feel fatigue when the headset is worn for too long. However, it does give a slightly cheaper impression and while I have had no problems with this set as of yet, time is usually kinder to headsets of bulkier construction. I suspect that the lighter design is in part due to the idea that these can be used with mobile devices, but that loops me back to the inability of this particular headset to passively listen.The sound quality of said microphone is also very good. The microphone gets nods from my friends who say the sound quality is excellent. It does a very nice job of picking up my voice, but is not so incredibly sensitive that background noises like fans are a distraction. This time of the year it is pretty hot, so I have a handful of fans going around me at any time. I was a bit worried that they might pick up as annoying white noise, and a couple of my friends said that they could hear the fans, but that they were by no means distracting. That is some nice balance between picking up my nearby voice clearly while not being so sensitive as to pick up those external distractions.The speaker audio is quite good. It handles the low rumble of bass well, and does not get distorted with more treble heavy fair. This is not the richest, fullest sound experience I have ever heard, but there were no glaring issues that came out of the headset either. The drivers can pack a pretty nice level of audio without crackling and distorting, even when you choose to boost the bass. It did feel as though this headset was tuned more for gaming - music and movies worked well, but the audio relays gunfire better than subtle musical notes. As mentioned earlier, the foam is comfortable but the headset is not noise cancelling, so some ambient noise can certainly leak in.The Ear Force Stealth 420X Headset by Turtle Beach is one of the best Xbox One headsets I have had the pleasure of using. The voice monitoring is an outstanding feature that I would like to see show up in other headsets down the road. It is easy to hook up and it looks sharp while wearing comfortably. It is better suited as a gaming headset, despite an effort to make it versatile for those looking for headphones on the go as well. Still, the extra functionality is appreciated and helps to round out a nice overall package.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLOPE9MRUJVET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXO5X4M#wasThisHelpful","RLOPE9MRUJVET","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oni seemingly had everything a game needed: a cool heroine, easy to grasp controls, fast, original action, futuristic backgrounds. It lacked, however, a crucial element: a quicksave! But let‚Äôs start from the beginning.The main character is a brave female cop with enhanced physical abilities who must rid a big future city from organized crime. As the story unfolds she reveals secrets that will jeopardize her alliances and change her life. Anyway, I wasn‚Äôt particularly interested in the story although there is an effort to give the characters some depth.First, you play a tutorial and then you are left on your own. Many enemies are unarmed but still pound the life out of if they grab you. Others are armed. Thankfully you can take their weapons once they die. Unfortunately, how much ammo they contain depends on how many times their previous owners had shot. So, you may find a weapon only to see it‚Äôs almost empty. Other problems are you carry one firearm at a time and weapons disappear after some time so you can‚Äôt go back to get one you left behind. Finally, unlike first person shooters, dropped guns here don‚Äôt increase your general supply of ammo. Each of them may be used a few times and that‚Äôs all.The control system is very smart.The keyboard is for moving forward/backward and strafing left/right while the mouse is for looking and aiming. With one mouse button you punch and with the other you kick. By pressing a key you equip or holster your current weapon. The total amount of moves available is impressive: you can jump and attack, block, hit while crouching, backslap, disarm an enemy or strike him while he is knocked down, kill instantly by breaking someone‚Äôs back, perform throws and combos. Too bad your enemies tend to interrupt those and hit you. Generally, their behavior is not consistent.Sometimes an attack works on them and others it doesn‚Äôt, so you lose valuable health. The difficulty is increased by the fact there are few power ups, opponents become progressively stronger and shoot you from various angles and when you die you may have to replay a large section. I finished Oni at the easy setting but didn‚Äôt enjoy it as much as I wanted. Maybe I should have tried a different approach, for example fight only when necessary or make better use of weapons, who knows‚Ä¶I certainly found it appealing though. I appreciated the minimal graphics with their blue and grey tones, the cool design of Konoko and her fluid animation. I liked trekking through vast installations, running on metallic tubes, fighting bosses, exploring an airport or some rooftops in the night, shooting bad guys with uzis and laser rifles. The music is nothing special but the melee combat sound effects are very good.Oni successfully incorporated many original elements and had a distinct atmosphere, reminding of ‚ÄúGhost in the Shell‚Äù. It just needed to be more friendly in my opinion. I wish someone would bring us a remake.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS7J9RQXD12XX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004WLQV#wasThisHelpful","RS7J9RQXD12XX","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Fantastic Four. The X-Men. The Avengers. About the only way to get them on the same screen together is in video game form (due to the mess that is the Marvel movie rights). While that is a source of frustration for fans of the Marvel movies, at least the video games seem to be able to get it right as LEGO marvel Super Heroes for the Mac provides over a hundred different characters to romp through adventures with.What really sells this game is the variety. In all of the LEGO games, there is a tendency for characters to have overlapping traits. If you are playing a Star Wars game, you get a handful of characters who use blasters, a handful who use The Force, you have droids - but they feel very similar. In LEGO Marvel there are certainly similar characters. Spider-man and Iron Man both use ranged attacks, but the way that they play with the environment can differ. With so many heroes and villains called upon in this game, the variety is impressive and really makes for some fun environmental problem solving.Like other LEGO games, there are a couple of things that Marvel does very well. The first is the humor. These games are whimsical, delightful and simply a lot of fun. They are approachable for an old comic book fan like myself, but still entertaining for my youngest daughter. The other thing I expect from these titles is puzzle-solving. With all of these different super powers, there was ample opportunity for clever level design, and the development team made the most of it. LEGO Marvel Super Heroes has some of the best level design of any LEGO title, and there is lots of reason to come back and play again once you unlock some new characters.One of my favorite aspects to these LEGO games is unlocking new content. With the large city acting as a hub between levels, there is ample reason and space for exploration. This will no doubt appeal to fans of open world content, though myself I preferred the primary missions. The storyline is fairly standard stuff, but it fits in with the comic book roots of the game. Some of the encounters are more entertaining than others, but almost all of the boss fights are fun once you figure out what it is you are trying to do.As much fun as the idea of comic book heroes merged with LEGO bricks are, it is worth noting that this is actually one of the least attractive LEGO games I have played in a while. The character models are adequate - they are at least distinctive from one another, but they somehow feel 'off' compared to some of the others I have played. Additionally, levels are cleverly designed but often not all that great to look at. I much preferred the more fantasy-like visuals found in Lord of the Rings or even Jurassic World (which in fairness is a newer title).With more of an open world exploration vibe, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes will likely appeal to a slightly different audience than some of the more structured LEGO titles. As a result, this one took me longer to complete than others, but did not seem to have quite as many high points for me either. Perhaps it is because this is a more original tale than what the LEGO games usually present. The majority of their titles have the structured narrative of movies to follow (whether it be the Jurassic titles, Indiana Jones, Star Wars or others).LEGO Marvel Super Heroes deserves some credit for doing things a bit differently than some of the other LEGO titles I have played, however it is not quite as memorable at the end of the day either. The humor and puzzles I expected certainly held up their end of the bargain and it was a fun experience overall. Fans of the LEGO titles or who just really want to see their favorite Marvel characters together on the same screen will not be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDFWEWXLXLFPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZ03PYS#wasThisHelpful","RDFWEWXLXLFPC","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There were several things that were immediately apparent when starting off the second entry into this Warriors spin-off. The first entry tried to be rather different with its puzzle platforming style which worked in some cases but felt a bit strained in others. Moving away from that style, One Piece Pirate Warriors 2 instead concentrates more on the core Warrior system and takes a bit from the Samurai series for a much faster paced experience both attack buttons for creating combos in that ever enjoyable 1v1000 feel.Having moved away from the style that the original tried to implement is not the only thing that changed. Sadly one of these changes felt disappointing but on the bright side may be my only disappointment. Pirate Warriors followed the story of Luffy and his crew from the beginning of their adventure up until a two-year break in the story in which everyone ends up going their own ways to train and become stronger after a fairly heart heavy event.Instead of continuing on from this point and moving forwards, the second entry performs what they call a Dream Story in which elements of the post two year break are present but in an entirely brand new story that doesn‚Äôt exist in either the anime or the manga. I found this disappointing because of how well the previous entry followed events and how well it blended story and action sequences allowing anyone who had never seen the anime series or the read the manga to follow along and not get lost as to who these people were and what was behind their motivations.Going back into a full Warriors mode and leaving the platforming behind in a way was a good thing as the pace never drops to a crawl charging through the various fields taking on the hundreds upon hundreds of enemies that stand in your way. While the original mostly locked players into playing solely with Luffy other than in very specific moments which could feel long at times, players are now able to pick from the various cast as they become available. Crew members as well as other characters that make their appearance throughout the story mode become available but are not always immediate so following a new form of unlocking.Some characters come ready and set to go the moment that a certain point is passed in the Dream Story‚Äôs Main Episodes. Other characters such as Smoker, who belongs to the marines which chase after the pirates, needed a bit more of an encouragement to join up and become playable. Crew Episodes which are shorter than Main Episodes, allow for players to select that ‚Äúcrew member‚Äù and face off against them as they become the boss of a particular scenario. Facing off against a very pissed off Nami because everyone else was screwing around again was mildly terrifying. While she may not have eaten a fruit, she knows how to manipulate weather. Lightning in particular for effective combat strategies.For something a little newer, Pirate Warriors 2 takes a twist on the Dynasty Warriors Gundam 3 and even the later Gundam Reborn Partner Strikes. Instead of having a selected partner perform a special attack and then disappear, they perform a special attack and become fully usable for limited amount of time afterwards. While in use, the partner doesn‚Äôt need to worry about something silly like a health bar or filling up any gauges. Instead this character is able to have full function short of their Musou attacks to alleviate some of the stress off of your chosen character. This is especially great if things are in dire straights with your health bar being almost non-existent because you tackled something a few levels higher than you. Trust me. This helps.Clear from the beginning is also the look and the smoothness of everything. Having created the second entry with a newer engine, everything is much smoother both in terms of visual appearance as well as gameplay performance. The original Pirate Warriors wasn‚Äôt bad in any means, but it did feel a bit rough around its edges at times when it gets compared to the newer entry. Enemies spawning, health bars, boss fights, everything is that much smoother which is an important factor when dealing with the amount that can be on the screen at one time.Overall One Piece Pirate Warriors 2 while not keeping with the style of the original is a step up with its faster paced action. While it would have been nice to keep with the actual storyline, the Dream Story does have its own charm that flows well enough with the sub missions to unlock other playable characters. Now the only thing left to do is wait for the release of One Piece Pirate Warriors 3!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DCI8HRFBH7CK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQH48I0#wasThisHelpful","R3DCI8HRFBH7CK","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you‚Äôre anything like us at CGR, then you‚Äôve probably spent hours with your friends, within the unbreachable walls of a pillow fort, formulating a hypothetical battle plan for reclaiming your living room (and eventually the world) in the event of a zombie apocalypse. Maybe your plan, like mine, includes fashioning a bandanna out of sausage links, tearing your shirt off in a slow-motion panic - as though it were armor splashed with acidic alien blood - and employing Johnny Cage-esque low-blows to every zombie that galumphs into your macho posturing. Because you, like me, hypothesized during your childhood that, to the undead, groin-shots are just as lethal as headshots.Although I‚Äôm confident that this plan would have a 100% success rate, after playing Zombie Army Trilogy, I‚Äôve amended my hypothetical approach to decimating the undead. While a multiplicity of melee attacks to a reanimated groin may be instinctive and good for a giggle, the safest and most efficient way to dispose of waves of ragged brain-munchers is with three friends, all armed to the loins with grenades and sniper rifles, blasting gluttonous heads from a distance. You, too, will enjoy adopting this tactic in Zombie Army Trilogy if zombies, an 80‚Äôs WWII exploitation horror vibe, and precision sniper mechanics gifted with four player co-op gets your survival instinct growling for a ballistic fight.It‚Äôs a dark night in Berlin. Buildings lay crumbled, confused as to why they were meticulously created only to be demolished by tank fire. Bodies lay in scattered piles large enough to stifle the concept of decomposition. Hitler, sequestered in his war bunker along with his generals, is on the verge of losing the war. So rather than shaving his iconic mustache and ducking out of Berlin so as to escape death or capture, or consuming a cyanide capsule and taking his own life with a pistol as history demands, he slams his fist on the table and initiates Plan Z, a scheme that, at first, inexplicably raises the fallen Nazi Army and curses them with an addiction to aromatic human flesh.This is where you come in, as one of eight soldiers of male or female persuasion, with the sole suicide mission of destroying the zombie outbreak at its source and knocking the blinkin‚Äô block off every zombie that gets in your way with a collection of sniper rifles, secondary guns (which include a variety of machine guns and shotguns), sidearms, and an assortment of explosives. But, not surprising since the first two episodes in the game were standalone expansions of Sniper Elite V2, proficiency with the sniper rifle is the focus and of utmost importance.As a third-person arcade shooter, you travel in a linear path from ambush to ambush, dismembering the undead in a thrilled panic before they have the chance to overwhelm your position. And while you can stand your ground with a machinegun, pumping round after round into a collection of foes that continuously creep for a taste of your brain, effectively keeping the horde moaning beyond arm‚Äôs reach, said machinegun can be pretty inconsistent when it comes to killing the zombies accurately and maintaining your point multiplier. And so, ZAT recommends that you adapt and alternate strategies: engage from a distance by default; engage up close and personally only when necessary.ZAT insists on these recommendations by enforcing the aforementioned point multiplier: Headshots, shotgun blasts, and explosives generate the most points and ensure that your combo will be maintained through accuracy, meaning that it can be best to find a relatively safe position, lay traps ‚Äì mines, explosive trip wires, and dynamite -- between you and the zombie horde, and surgically dispose of the each threat one-by-one by sniper fire. An ability called Focus aids this endeavor by slightly slowing time and materializing a red diamond in the center of the reticule that takes into account variables such as gravity and wind speed, factors that only seem detrimental on the hardest difficulty, with conservative use of Focus Time. Of course, running-and-gunning is just as fun and very often unavoidable, especially when you have three comrades squealing ‚ÄúZombie Slumber Party!‚Äù while lobbing grenades at the boots of every foe in your crosshairs; however, the focus on maintaining and striking from a distance is what makes ZAT feel like a unique experience compared to other zombie shooters of its ilk.While not the most detailed corpse howling to be put out of its misery, ZAT‚Äôs visuals invoke a sense of dread and hilarity that perfectly captures its slightly-above B-grade ambitions. That dread comes mostly from the atmosphere produced by the dark streets, factories, and bunkers of Berlin, as well as the sinister sound design that creates the illusion of zombie omnipresence; also, the music, with its pronounced synth chords, adds urgency and purpose to every fray. I‚Äôd be surprised and probably zombie bait if I discovered that John Carpenter‚Äôs 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs films‚Äô orchestrations were not influential on the soundtrack. The hilarity, on the other hand, comes mostly from your protagonist‚Äôs melee animation, a front kick stiff enough to unhinge a welded submarine hatch. I dare you to perform it without smiling and saying, ‚ÄúI feel damn good about this, man.‚ÄùFor a shooter of this kind, tedium can potentially become your greatest enemy. There were two moments, one from the first episode and one from the second, where the game launched three waves too many at my painter-turned-freedom-fighter, muddling my enjoyment just a tad. Is this right? Is this a glitch? Did a spank a zombie‚Äôs fianc√©e during its former life? WHY WON‚ÄôT THEY STOP COMING?! Naturally, once it was over three waves later, I felt accomplished and continued on, wiping the congealed blood from my jacket sleeve. Yet, a few of these encounters could have been toned down in terms of wave number for the sake of pacing.Another issue, the answer to which could‚Äôve lessened some potential tedium by promoting more incentive for replay, is the lack perks and unlockables. The point system I discussed prior exists only as a competitive marker, to gauge which of the four players is annihilating zombies the most effectively, when it could‚Äôve been utilized as currency to purchase new guns, weapon parts, outfits, skills ‚Äì et cetera.  I mean, I appreciate the simplicity and purity of ZAT‚Äôs gameplay, as a straightforward co-op arcade shooter, but I would‚Äôve loved to have seen what sort of ideas the developer could‚Äôve formulated when it came to modifications and such. As it is, gamers will have to rely on the strength of the gameplay loop and the availability of online camaraderie to ensure that ZAT has longevity beyond the Horde Mode and 18 hour campaign.You have plenty of zombie slaying games to choose from. There‚Äôs no doubt about that. Between Dying Light and Call of Duty, you can slice, kick, and flame-throw anything that grunts with a tinge of menace. ZAT is a bit different. It wants you to distance yourself from the chaos, to exhale slowly and stop your breath for a moment as you squeeze the trigger, unloosing a single round and observing in slow motion as it crashes through your enemy‚Äôs cerebellum. For that, I think ZAT is worth it. For fans of zombies and the hysterics of co-op mischief, it‚Äôs totally worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36RGF3QXN4TJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCUEN2A#wasThisHelpful","R36RGF3QXN4TJE","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"More games have been releasing with a focus on narrative of late, and I consider that to be a good thing. Click and point adventure titles have been making something of a comeback, and even games referred to as walking simulators are more about the story than the gameplay mechanics. It would be easy to call The Vanishing of Ethan Carter a walking simulator, but that would be selling the title short. There is plenty to see, but enough to do to justify thinking of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter as a complete game worth experiencing.The titular Ethan Carter is a kid who has sent letters to our actual protagonist, Paul Prospero. There is a bit of backstory given as Paul emerges from a dark tunnel to find himself standing in a beautiful wooded area. The backdrop is simple enough, yet incredibly vague as it sets the table for this mystery. Ethan has been sending mail to Paul, a detective with psychic abilities. At first Ethan's letters come across as typical fare - fan mail essentially. However, as the young boy continues to share what he sees and knows with Paul, it becomes clear to the detective that Ethan is at the center of something sinister in Red Creek Valley, a little wooded nook of the world that time has forgotten.The backdrop for The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is wonderfully crafted to set the stage for a mystery filled with murder and partial clues. The reason this title will no doubt earn the walking simulator description is because there is no actual combat or life-threatening challenges to overcome with Paul. Instead, you will guide Paul through a first person perspective through beautiful forests, across aging bridges, down abandoned railroad tracks and into dilapidated old buildings.The environments in The Vanishing of Ethan Carter are often spectacular. The sky is brushes of painted colors, the trees rustle and move with a subtle life while abandoned buildings have different levels of light filtering through boarded up windows to create a visual atmosphere that is as good as anything I have ever seen. It is spectacularly, hauntingly beautiful and it is very easy to spend a good chunk of your time simply taking the sights in.As for the actual gameplay mechanics, the idea is that you will lead Paul around the environment taking things in. Right off of the bat you may encounter some traps set in the woods. What Paul does is encounter key items in the environment, and by piecing them together, he starts to solve the riddle to Ethan Carter's disappearance. These items are not easy to spot, because The Vanishing of Ethan Carter does not hold your hand at all. Items in the environment blend easily, with no outlines or distinguishing features. You have to actually look at the world around Paul, to see that there is something a bit odd in the brush ahead or to notice that the pile of rocks near the end of the tracks looks out of place.Once you get suitably close to these objects, you might get some text that encourages you to read or interact with the object, and then you can work with it, but it is very easy to miss these things when you first play the game. Of course, the very hide and seek nature of this game design means that subsequent replays will probably be much quicker affairs that lose a significant amount of their luster. Exploration and discovery are at the heart of this title, and the mechanics work great - but they do lack in replay value.Sometimes the finding of clues is simply a matter of stumbling onto them and reading them. At other times you will be tasked to find items to help solve fairly simple environmental puzzles. In other instances you will be asked to find multiple sets of clues. Each new clue Paul finds will allow him to 'see' more of what happened through his supernatural gift - until the entire scene plays out. One scene somewhat early on has you reconstructing the crime. The step-by-step assembly process actually reminded me of a similar scene in Arkham Knight about a third of the way through the main storyline. In both instances it really felt like I was a detective trying to put things together, and this game deserves credit for managing things so well.The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a well written supernatural mystery with gorgeous environments and simple but fitting music that help to sell the immersive experience. There are enough gameplay mechanics to help elevate the title beyond just a walking game, despite the actual threat of death and combat. The end result is a memorable story worth the five or so hours you will spend playing through to the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFMXQREUNBMR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OA7OE3I#wasThisHelpful","RFMXQREUNBMR2","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best thing I can say about this little device is that it is quite versatile. You can use it for videos or for music - I'd certainly recommend the latter for it. at 32 GBs, there is plenty of storage space, but the screen rings in at just under 2 inches, so it's not ideal for viewing - but if you go that route you will need to make sure your file format is supported. It can handle several types, but not everything. You can also view JPG files and use it as a recording device. Still, the primary use here is for music, and it does that quite well. The menu is a bit strange right at first - there is a slight learning curve when it comes to all of the features and transferring files from your computer to the Martinsen, but once you get the hang of it all, it is quite simple to use.The primary interface is a circular button on the front of the device that you can use for managing playback or navigating the menu screens. The button has a solid feel to it, which is nice. I have used smallish MP3/MP4 devices in the past that break or feel like they are going to break if too much pressure is applied. I wouldn't go jamming down on the buttons for all you are worth, but they seem to hold up well.My primary use case for this little guy is as a music player when hooked up to my car radio or to a small rechargeable speaker for sitting out front while I am grilling or reading for a couple of hours. The Martinsen holds a pretty solid charge and plays for hours. It comes with the necessary cable for connecting to your computer and a decent if unspectacular set of earphones. The sound quality on them is okay, but I swapped them out for some of my higher-end ones pretty quickly.The unit is very lightweight, easily sliding into just about any type of pocket - jacket, shirt or pants. All in all, this Martinsen player is not the absolute best I have used, but it only has a couple of drawbacks and it has a pretty fair price point to boot. Work looking at if you are in the market for a new portal player.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R81B940T9R2KK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z91VF4U#wasThisHelpful","R81B940T9R2KK","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Frisbee is simple in design, with a two tone pink color and the image of a dog and a bone on the front. There is also a lighter ring that matches the light pink shade of the dog around the edge of the Frisbee. My neighbor's dog loves fetching things, and he is a big, strong dog that tears through chew toys pretty readily (for context, he has a truck's circular tire he uses as a chew toy and drags around the yard - he's a big boy). He does tend to go through his toys pretty readily, but this Frisbee has held up really well over the last couple of weeks. In general something he fetches and brings back to me usually does not get the wear and tear of a chew toy, but he has spent quite a few hours playing with it, and the Frisbee itself is still flat, and flies straight without a wobble despite his powerful jaws clamping down on it to bring it back to me each time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R177P6AIX3OOHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XHOO6TM#wasThisHelpful","R177P6AIX3OOHJ","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't have a dog of my own, but my neighbor does and he's a good sized mixed breed with some pitbull in him. The toy itself looks good, and the different textures in the surface make it easy for him to grip on to, which is great. The squeaking aspect is not really loud, but it can be heard - more when he's whipping it back and forth in his mouth than the actual clamping down of his jaws.The downside is that the housing seems a bit on the brittle side. He's had it for a couple of weeks now, and while I don't know what the life expectancy of this ball is, my guess is it will not make it through the month. Again - big, strong dog, but it's showing some pretty substantial wear and tear. He enjoys the ball a great deal, but it is more of a short term-investment for this dog at least.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29W59ZTDCH6LP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V336USO#wasThisHelpful","R29W59ZTDCH6LP","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If one thing can be said for certain, it is that Omega Force knows how to make a game. On the off chance that the name doesn‚Äôt ring a bell, they are the developers for Temco Koei‚Äôs Warrior series. Dynasty, Samurai, Orochi, we are all pretty big fans of and that doesn‚Äôt include Hyrule Warriors, Bladestorm, Toukiden, the upcoming Dragon Quest Heroes.So with all that being said, I don‚Äôt know how One Piece Pirate Warriors avoided me for so long. My initial response at the announcement of One Piece Pirate Warriors 3 was honestly ‚ÄúThere are two others?‚Äù. Within not very long I set out to find the first two and thankfully they were happily placed upon the PSN where I promptly jumped into them as they were infinitely easier to find than physical copies which in some cases were as much as a mortgage for some reason. Being just slightly behind in the Manga as I like to read arcs as a whole without the weekly cliffhangers, returning over seven-hundred chapters back to the beginning was a nice refresher.The great thing about a Warriors game is that there is always something new whether it be big or small. One Piece Pirate Warriors is no exception with Luffy and his Crew put into somewhat of a Musou style. Instead of going about a full blown warriors game with over a thousand KOs per map, things were interestingly different both in good and frustrating ways depending upon the situation.Going about a different direction than a lot of the core Warriors series entries, One Piece instead uses the main character‚Äôs abilities for a lot of action, adventure, and light puzzle solving. For those that do not really know what One Piece is, it is a weekly Shonen Jump entry alongside the likes of Bleach (Death Gods), Fairy Tail (Wizards), and the recently finished Naruto (Ninjas). It‚Äôs about a bunch of crazy pirates in which some have eaten fruits that grant them powers at the cost of not being able to swim. The main character Luffy D. Monkey is in this boat as he‚Äôs eaten the Gum-Gum Fruit essentially turning his entire body to Rubber. Using this idea as a core, Pirate Warriors is essentially split into two different portions. The first is a good old Musou style conquering areas and defeating bosses while the other is an action-adventure-puzzle that uses Luffy‚Äôs rubberized body to get through it all.When it comes to the straight up Warriors sections, Pirate Warriors does everything right. If I had to put an approximation I would say that about ninety-percent of the time players will be using Luffy with some quick segments with other characters especially later on in the game. Combat itself is fluid with a bit of Samurai Warriors mixed in for combos being based off of both the Square and the Triangle button instead of just using one or the other for a finishing move like a lot of the other entries. This definitely allowed for a lot more versatility especially since you had only the one character for the majority of the game.Supplementing not being able to change your main character is the option to partner up with other members of your crew when they are available. By doing so, Partner Strikes open up allowing for them to switch places with Luffy for the duration of a combo attack. To set up a partner strike, a specific combo is listed beneath Luffy‚Äôs health bar. By performing this combo and then hitting L2 when the option arises in slow motion on your screen, you instantly change places for some rather large scale enemy destruction depending upon the partner. On a general basis though, any Partner Strike is a good Partner Strike. By repeatedly using these as they become available, a meter filled up on the partner‚Äôs portrait. Once filled, the next Partner Strike will also unleash a Musou attack for maximum efficiency.Here‚Äôs where things get a bit better and worse. The inclusion of a different style of levels was a great idea. Using Luffy‚Äôs rubber body, players can extend their limbs to slingshot themselves over larger distances, reach high ledges in order to make it up and over obstacles, extend over a gap in order to pull down bridges, etc. On these stages the fighting is much less as the platforming and the puzzle challenges are really what are being highlighted. What can kind of get in the way however is that sometimes it could take a few seconds and backtracking could be required. While this is generally the norm of things, some platforming elements are just too much to be repeated that often in that short amount of time especially if you miss your cue and fall down having to restart. The main example of this would be the monkey bars. Using a full combination of L1, L2, R1, R2 Luffy needs to hit the appropriate ones in sequence to make it over. There‚Äôs one level in particular that after six times I had more than enough and just wanted to get to the boss fight.That leads into the other half issue. Boss fights could be both amazing and amazingly frustrating. The frustrating boss fights are those that have no mechanics to them but instead are a full out brawl. These generally have Luffy up against foes that should technically be able to pull off a one hit kill with how strong Luffy is at that point in time. These battles can be very long even after learning the attack patterns as one wrong move can send you to the game over screen.Boss battles with mechanics attached to them however are much more pleasant and generally fun to play. These battles contain options to throw things at the boss in order to get in a coup de gras or a bit of platforming elements to dodge devastating attacks. If anything can be said though, it is that there is a lot outside the norm when it comes to Pirate Warriors which boils down to being pretty standard for the general craziness of One Piece.Not being left out there was one more feature that was included amongst everything else which can mostly be seen between the Boss fights and certain Platforming segments. Quick Time Events (QTEs) are used mainly in boss fights to show off some cinematic fight scenes to spice things up in an epic anime showdown fashion that One Piece and a lot of Shonen Jump (Dragon Ball Kamehamehas included) are really known for. In platforming they are used much less until the slingshots or the monkey bars are put into focus. I these players have to as mentioned above hit the right combinations or risk falling down which is generally into water. Since our powered up Pirate can‚Äôt swim, we really don‚Äôt want that.One Piece Pirate Warriors came out a few years ago back in 2012 with it‚Äôs sequel Pirate Warriors 2 in 2013. While it may be slightly older, it doesn‚Äôt quite yet fit into the retro section so I will be giving it a score. Honestly even with the bits of bumps that it has, Pirate Warriors is a good game which shows off a decent amount of innovation attempted by the team in order to do something wacky like One Piece justice. I‚Äôll be back soon with Pirate Warriors 2 as I get ready for next months Pirate Warriors 3!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ECUJGFBK2ZQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009EPQ45W#wasThisHelpful","R1ECUJGFBK2ZQ5","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hanasaku Iroha ~Home Sweet Home~ is an OVA that takes place near the end of the original series' final episodes and expands on the background of The Kissuiso Inn (the main setting for the series). Note that if you have not viewed the original series you will want to steer clear of Home Sweet Home until after you have viewed the series that the OVA is based on. That said, Hanasaku Iroha is without a doubt, one of my favorite anime (if not my actual favorite anime) and it follows the life of Matsumae Ohana as she is essentially abandoned by her flaky mother and forced to live at her grandmother's ryokan (traditional Japanese inn). In a world where we have heartfelt romance stories like Clannad or Angel Beats! And action-filled craziness as found in Fairy Tail or Gintama or the deep and rich worlds found in Ergo Proxy or Cowboy Bebop, ""slice of life"" anime are oft-overlooked, which is a shame as it is one of the best genres around. Hanasaku Iroha belongs to the slice of life genre and is just as powerful as its genre siblings like K-On!, Silver Spoon, and Usagi Drop (to name a few). Trust me when I say this, Hanasaku Iroha is a must-see series and I implore you all to head over to NISA's headset and purchase volumes 1 and 2 right now. Here's a link to expedite the process: http://www.nisamerica.com/iroha.Now that that's out of the way, on to the good stuff; my review for Hanasaku Iroha ~Home Sweet Home~. As mentioned, this takes place near the end of the original series, specifically around Episodes 20 and 21 and fills in a bit on the back story about Matsumae Satsuki (Ohana's mother) as well as fleshing out a bit of the supporting casts' lives. Without getting into spoilery territory, the morals found during the fleshing out of some of the characters, specifically Oshimizu Nako's micro-arc, are heartfelt and quite powerful.  While the movie center's on Ohana-chan learning more about her mother and discovering that the two of them have more in common than she thought, the supporting cast is just as loveable and entertaining as they were in the series.The artwork for Hanasaku Iroha is spectacular, though that is to be expected given that it was done by P.A. Works. Some of their other works include the near-perfect heart-crushing Angel Beats! as well the spectacular Shirobako, the wonderful Nagi no Asukara (Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea), the crazy anime, Another, and the criminally-overlooked Tari Tari. Needless to say this storied studio is well known for its excellence and dedication and Hanasaku Iroha ~Home Sweet Home~ is no different. The animation quality is top notch, the focus on realistic design and a believable environment is surpassed only by the touching story. However, Home Sweet Home feels much less focused than the original series as about a third of the story is focused on other characters. In the original series there was a significant drive to tell Ohana-chan's story and Home Sweet Home continues that concept though with more outside influence.The original seiyu return to reprise their roles in the OVA and bring with it the same fervor and sincerity that they had in the series. Ito Kanae voices Ohana-chan, whom you may recognize as Yui from Sword Art Online (a favorite of not only mine, but others here at Chalgyr's Game Room), as well as her role as Ebihara in Persona 4: The Animation. Other notables include Toyosaki Aki (Hirasawa Yui from K-On!) as Nako-chan, Tomatsu Haruka (Anjo Naruka from Anohana: The Flower that we saw that day) as Wakura Yuina, who is the heiress to a modern inn that is located not far from the Kissuiso. The interesting thing about both Home Sweet Home and the original series is that the main characters are voiced primarily by talent that has historically played supporting characters. I find this neat because the acting is superb and really allows the seiyu to shine in their own primary roles.Outside of some stellar acting you have a wonderful soundtrack that accompanies some wonderful ambient environment audio. Playing Home Sweet Home in my PlayStation 4 with the PDP Kral 7.1 Surround Sound headset on sounded great, though I personally preferred the 2.1 audio as it sounded richer, deeper, and more clear. Regardless of whether you are hearing Hanasaku Iroha ~Home Sweet Home~ through a home theater, a stereo surround, or just the TV speakers, it will sound fantastic, though likely because the seiyu were allowed to shine and really brought life to the characters.While at times I was a little confused with ~Home Sweet Home's~ direction, given its strong focus on Nako-chan, ultimately it provides a deeper understanding to the ""why"" of some of the behaviors of the cast in the original series. I initially watched the Blu Ray long after I had seen the series and it left me with more questions then answers, however I began re-watching the series and once I hit episode 20 I took a break from the show and watched the movie and after the movie was done, finished the show. Watching it in this fashion made me see the series, and movie, in a whole new light. ~Home Sweet Home~ is a rich experience best viewed in this fashion and it will absolutely drive home ""the feels"" and your viewing experience of this oft-overlooked and utterly fantastic series will drastically improve. Simply put, I loved it as it brought me back to one of the best series available today.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13G7IGEPVYLR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O6B9ETM#wasThisHelpful","R13G7IGEPVYLR2","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have played some interesting games up to this point in my life and Way of the Samurai 4 is absolutely one title that can fall into that category. You begin by getting off of a small boat in the tiny port town of Amihama during mid 19th Century Japan. What do you from this point on is entirely and literally up to you. I have to preface this by saying that there is just about nothing serious in the tone of Way of the Samurai 4, other than the time period and the changes that Japan was going through. Never taking itself seriously, there is a lot of fun to be had - especially if you don‚Äôt mind the crazy characters and townspeople that you can run into while strolling about the town in nothing more than boxer shorts. Yes you read that right. I forwent the Kimono and traditional Japanese underwear for a pair of blue and white striped modern day boxers. I eventually found a long pipe to go with that as I strode around bare foot, surprisingly never being looked at twice. Guess I wasn‚Äôt the weirdest person there with all the British wearing their dresses, three piece suits, and top hats.Before being left entirely to your own devices, there is a prologue that offers to teach players the basics in the form of being told what to do by a common townswoman. Then again, considering that she teaches you both basic and advanced moves by yelling at you as to how to do them‚Ä¶ I seriously wouldn‚Äôt want to meet her in a dark alley as she knows what she‚Äôs doing. While the basics may be simple with light and heavy attacks, dodging and blocking, putting them into play will be an entirely different story and will take time to get right.While a lot of the dialog, character personalities, and random townsfolk fall into the weird, fun and quirky categories, combat takes itself very seriously. There is no goofing around for this samurai and his weapons. If you fight and your enemy and lose, you‚Äôre Dead.Game Over Man, Game Over.This took me a bit by surprise the first time that it happened as I had barely gotten my feet wet so to speak. I accidentally chose dialog in the opening fight making myself surrender as I tried to quickly yell a taunt, was then tied up and thrown onto train tracks, saved but lost everything that I carried, and then picked a fight with a side quest mark after having told a woman being stalked that I would up put a stop to it. I faced the stalker while being barehanded and lost. Miserably...Once faced with the dreaded game over screen I realized one of two things. A) I had to get better and not suck so much the next time and B) Way of the Samurai 4 almost has a Roguelike element to it as any experience in martial art styles and weapon forms are kept and carried forward along with a few other little things on your next attempt at life. Starting right back on that boat leading up to the docks, players can once again decide to follow the same first decisions or go about another route.Once back and into the tutorial fray I actually decided not to sully my blade but instead use my fists of awesomeness and toss my enemies around like ragdolls until they couldn‚Äôt move anymore which is another of the charms that showed itself. Swords aren‚Äôt everything and different weapon styles or lack there of are just as fun as one another.Way of the Samurai 4 in a lot of ways made me think of Akiba‚Äôs Trip in the way that you have access to an entire town at all times to do really whatever you want to do. Once you are taught the basics, the town is at your fingertips. At this point I honestly stood there taking everything in and wondering to myself‚Ä¶ what do I do now? I‚Äôll be honest that open-ended / open-world games are generally not my thing as I much prefer to play something with an actual direction that provides distractions but also a clear course. So what is one to do? I went after thugs for a good while better my armed and unarmed combat skills while picking up money and other weapons to disassemble or sell.One thing that didn‚Äôt take long to notice was that if I‚Äôm really going to last against tougher foes then I was going to need a better weapon. Enter the very well oiled and muscular man that happens to be the Blacksmith. Here is a man that can make modifications to your weapon by upgrading the base strength to making it harder. Like everything that I‚Äôve been through of late there is a catch to performing such a feat and that is that by upgrading the strength of the weapon, you decrease its durability. Honestly, this felt more than a fair trade as I didn‚Äôt have to swing or block as much to even kill some certified badasses that what into town after a few events. Being on par with them was more than worth it.Fighting in the streets was generally not an issue depending upon the part of town that you could currently find yourself in. Fighting in the wrong part of town however, the upper quarters, it didn‚Äôt take long to get yourself arrested. This is another part that just felt like it was off the wall and made me wonder where they got their ideas. So getting arrested I figured wasn‚Äôt so bad until I found myself tied up, again as it wasn't the first time, and then suspended upon a spiked wooden horse.The wooden horse itself is not a very pleasant torture device, being a torture device and all, but adding spikes on it was just cruel. This became a mini-game of sorts as you had to balance yourself under the torturer‚Äôs whip but also stay above the horse. Eventually flames were turned on, she would lash out with a kick and then I figured ‚Äúalright‚Äù I‚Äôll pass out when my health drops to zero. Oh no. I died. Again. What is this Dark Souls? Alright, back to the boat! Time to start again...For all the interesting systems that Way of the Samurai 4 has in place it also has a few smaller issues. One of the ones that actually annoyed me a bit more than I thought it would was that the voices and the movement of the mouths never really seemed to match up. Now if this was a case of an original Japanese game and English voices then that is something that most of us are so used to that we think nothing of it. In this case however we have a Japanese game with Japanese voices and it was honestly rather distracting as that just about never happens.While exploring the town it could feel at times that things weren‚Äôt exactly where they were ‚Äúmeant‚Äù to be. Running around I would be hitting into other people and making them mad for ‚Äúnot watching where I was going‚Äù even if it looked like there was more than enough space between us. The same would happen when taking just a single step too far when trying to simply talk and they would be bouncing back as if I was a 500 pound sumo wrestler that was on his way to breakfast and they were between me and food. Once or twice was fine, but having to almost use a snail's pace to talk to someone could get a bit annoying and drop the pace while running around trying to take care of a few things before the time of day moved on possibly making you miss you opportunity to perform a side quest until the next day.Way of the Samurai 4 is a crazy entry that doesn‚Äôt take itself serious based while still keeping itself based on a particular era of Japanese history after the British came to call. If you want to be a the good guy, the bad guy, or the whatever guy, all of that is up to with however you feel at that moment in time. The replay value is huge, with a lot of events that can only be seen if you manage to live long enough to see the results of your decisions. In certain cases‚Ä¶ that won‚Äôt be long.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LGI1E9A2LHNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008M2QC14#wasThisHelpful","R1LGI1E9A2LHNI","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes there are games that rope you in due to an incredibly deep, twisting narrative. Other titles use photo-realistic graphics or movie actors in their voice cast to breathe life into their creations. There are a variety of hooks that development teams use to try and draw players in, but quite often the most effective is simply making a game that is a ton of fun to play. Rocket League fits that description perfectly.The idea is ridiculous, but so highly entertaining. Take the sport of soccer, but instead of using players, go ahead and use racing cars instead. They can jump, flip, burst forward with incredible speed as the teams slam into one another while trying to guide the oversized ball into the other team's goal while keeping it out of their own net. The premise is very simple, but also very fun.There are multiple reasons why the formula for Rocket League works so well. For one, the game is highly approachable. The tutorial only takes a few minutes but you can figure out the basic controls and start zipping around the arena in no time. White traditional soccer games tend to be slower paced affairs in the video game world, Rocket League is a brisk game that is frequently carrying out its action at a breakneck pace.Because these are cars and not people, the movement and momentum are what makes the experience a unique one. Flying forward in a straight line is simple enough, but the arcade-like physics can be highly unpredictable when cars have to veer and start powersliding around the arena. Straight line movement is fast, but lateral movement is basically non-existent. You can turn, but there is a turn radius. The cars are fast, but not easy to aim. Adding to the mayhem is the bounciness of the ball. The arena is also closed off, giving you and the ball walls to bounce off of or race around. My absolute favorite highlight was an instance where the ball was about to strike the wall. I zipped up onto it, boosted and then jumped, striking the ball and changing its trajectory before it could reach the wall itself. That quick change forced it to veer off in a new direction - that happened to land in the opposing team's goal. I wish I could say it was skill that drove me to that particular highlight, but if I'm being honest here, it was more likely 90% luck - but I'll still take it.While the controls are simple enough to learn, there is a depth to the mechanics that is not immediately apparent. You start to learn how to read where the ball is bouncing, how to time your jumps better and the best moments to leverage your boost charge. The first time I made an actual save on goal, the ball was hit by one of the enemy AI around midfield, and it was rolling towards our goal. I had a full compliment of boost at my disposal, so even though I was on the wrong half of the field, I just sped for all I was worth towards my goal. Just as my boost ran out, I hit the powerslide and clipped the edge of the ball - pushing it just out of the way of the goal where it bounced off of the nearby wall instead. These moments are an absolute rush, because while the potential for those memorable plays are almost always there, the chaos of the game means that they do not happen very often.Matches are relatively short five minute affairs. My first night playing the game, I unlocked exactly 50% of the trophies and finished a season (albeit the shortest season option that could be selected). Rocket League is a game that begs to be played with other human players. The AI is not bad, but Parker and I were talking about this the other day and we both agreed that the AI is built in a way that allows them to interact with one another - but not necessarily with players. Computer opponents seem more adept at passing the ball and setting up actual organized shots. Parker and I could both recount stories where we were performing what seemed like logical actions, such as streaking unimpeded down the middle or the opposite side of our teammate, but the AI teammate did not seem to register we were there and move the ball to us for what should have been an easy score.Clearly the AI has that capability, because we had both seen it perform plays like that against us when all three opposing cars were computer controlled - yet the teammate AI seems to struggle somewhat with human companions. Playing with friends however, encourages you to communicate and work as a team (or to give you some bragging rights when you best them).Even with such a fun core game, it was great to see Rocket League providing other hooks as well. There are plenty of unlockable items that can make your cars look as cool or ridiculous as you would like. Want a sharp paint job? Sure - apply a flame look to your car. Want to wear a beanie on your roof? Why not? express your uniqueness. Rocket league is all about the fun, and as such these customizable items feel right at home.Rocket League is not perfect. It could use some deeper statistics or leagues as well as sharper teammate AI, but the fundamental game is a riotous good time with plenty of unlockables to keep players coming back for more. The first night I found it entirely too easy to just say 'one more match' - several times in a row.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9TVF1I7DOI2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010R8DUFQ#wasThisHelpful","R9TVF1I7DOI2Q","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Startech is relatively well known in computer hardware as they manufacture cost-effective alternatives to name-brand peripherals. It was only a matter of time before the company took notice of the ever-growing content capture market, especially with the explosive popularity of Elgato, Hoppauge, and the utterly fantastic AVerMedia gear. Enter the USB 2 HD PVR external capture card. When it was first released it was one of the early 1080p capture devices and was quite affordable given its competition (which generally cost upwards of $300 for a portable capture solution), though much has changed since the device was first released, does it still stand up to its competition?The HD PVR is a small, compact USB 2.0 capture device that a large number of gamers these days are looking for. As a way to go through and capture their montages, ""pwnage"" streaks, Let's Play and Longplay videos, the HD PVR's pricepoint is now right in the middle of the pack. While there are some less expensive options out there, the Startech device comes with the backing of a phenomenal customer service team; something a number of its competitors seem to be missing.Unfortunately in my case I actually had to contact their customer service team as I began having issues with the unit within about ten minutes after starting my first recording. While my computer has more than enough power to drive the unit, I found that running Dark Souls II on the PlayStation 3 (both via HDMI and Component connections, as the unit supports either one) was more problematic than not. Not only was I experiencing massive input lag, but the framerate was downright atrocious. You can see a sample of the recording (using Startech's handmade recording software; more on that later) below.After a half-dozen emails back and forth, various driver and firmware updates, we (the tech and I) were able to get the unit to record properly but a quick perusal of various forums will find that the experience is relatively common. The nice thing is that the issue was actually resolved and in a favorable manner. Below you can find a recording of Tomb Raider on the Xbox 360 and there is a significant improvement in the framerate and quality. I will be completely and utterly honest; when I first saw the performance of the HD PVR I was ready to simply write the review and score it a 4 out of 10. Fortunately I put in my due-diligence, contacted support (which unfortunately delayed the review release, but ultimately worked out) and began troubleshooting the issue which in turn provided me with unexpected yet pleasant results. It just goes to show that occasionally it is not the fault of the user, the product, nor the content, but rather then unfortunate side effect of living in a world where drivers and firmware are updated on a near-weekly basis.The software (vivastation) that you need to download with the drivers and firmware is quickly installed and easy to use, however I did notice that resource usage was quite high. I attribute this to the USB 2.0 nature of the device, though I could be wrong; it could just be aging hardware or possibly even a lack of optimized software. Regardless, the videos that were turned out during the recording were small given they are AVC-encoded MP4 files which means greatly-reduced file sizes. The largest file that I had was about 11 GB and that was for well over an hour's worth of 1080p @ 30FPS. Quite nice given some recording applications tend to be massive (looking at you, Fraps).While there was some significant trouble to start, the Startech USB 2.0 HD PVR is, with a little work a great little capture card. Featuring HDMI and Component connections, you can essentially hook up any device that supports those outputs (note though that copying protected content is not possible, nor is it something that you should do) and easily capture on your Windows-based PC. While onboarding and initial use should be improved, the unit is reliable and can record just fine, though adding in Mac support would be a blessing and one can hope that Startech will develop a Mac OS-based recording suite. All-in-all it is a handy little device that I would have no shame in picking up if I did not want to drop an additional $100 on a name-brand unit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XD0IQRQTF9QA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DVS8TL0#wasThisHelpful","R2XD0IQRQTF9QA","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Years ago my above friend did something that I‚Äôve never looked back on or once regretted. He sold me his PS1, which was my move away from Nintendo based consoles for quite a while. Sometime after this he introduced me to what is pretty much a cult classic: Suikoden II. Fast forward another few years and I bought my brother‚Äôs PS2, making it my own. Louis came over throwing Suikoden III at me before he was heading out of town for a weekend. While I enjoyed Suikoden II, it to me didn‚Äôt hold a candle to Suikoden III, which was my favorite entry in the series until the release of the fifth. Back once again, Konami have re-released Suikoden III on the PSN, making it playable for both the PSIII and the Vita. While physically sitting on my shelf, it has been too long since I‚Äôve picked it up. Being able to review it now is an honor.Suikoden III was special for more reasons than the above stated. The third entry into the series went through many changes from the previous two as it took advantage of the power of the newer PlayStation 2 moving from a sprite base over to 3D models and environments. This allowed for characters to show expression in more than just dialog boxes, creating a much more of a cinematic approach within gameplay like a lot of that era tried for before voice acting became more commonplace. While graphically moving in another direction, an anime-like opening cutscene was still used as a lot of RPGs did, but was now in even higher quality both in terms of sound and visuals. Exceeding Love, the opening theme of Suikoden III, perfectly fits the opening sequence and the overall feel of the story which is deep, rich, and at a lot of times heart heavy with the actions that some must take whether they want to or not.Having gone a different route than the rest of the series, Suikoden III is the only entry in the series that features three main protagonists with separate story lines as well as several playable sub plots. Now while the idea of separate plot lines can be daunting at times since generally what happens is that players would be replaying the same events over and over for maybe one or two different story segments, this is far from the case. Each of our three characters all have chapters of their own and can be selected from the starting Trinity Site in which players are brought back to on the return of a finished chapter. This site allows for the player to choose the next chapter of either the same character or that of another. With this in mind, it is not possible to finish the entire story with solely one character as everything is intertwined. Each main character story must reach a certain point in order for everything to continue moving forward again never leaving any doubts as to what is happening.Actually, that‚Äôs a lie! There are a lot of moments in which players might be thinking ‚Äúwhat is going on?‚Äù until much later when all of the pieces truly fall into place. Here are three completely separate people, from completely separate backgrounds and cultures. Biases, hatreds, and misgivings between some is more than expected when one group tends to think of the others as uncivilized barbarians. GENERALLY though, following all chapters will paint a proper picture of the events unfolding as the chapters happen at roughly the same time or slightly prior showing how things came to the point that you are seeing or have seen. For anyone not having played, even if it is a much older game, I‚Äôm going to say that I‚Äôm not touching anything story related as just about anything could be a spoiler for something else! One thing that should be noted however is that being an older RPG, save points are not exactly the most common at times and when you sit down to play, prepare for several hours worth of game time as sometimes, that‚Äôs the minimum between various cutscenes and battle segments.Combat is probably one of my favorite parts of Suikoden III. Using a six member party, players set up their characters in groups of two for a total of three groups. The manner in which groups perform depend entirely upon who is paired with whom at times as it can make essentially a landslide of difference in battle capabilities. Actions that can be taken in battle range from physical over to magical in abilities as well as the option to simply attack. Using a form of movement, the player‚Äôs party and the enemy party will need to move between themselves and each other in order to hit their targets. Units that are mounted on horseback essentially have more chance of making it if there are a lot of enemies on the field in comparison to someone on foot.Where things get really cool is when you start collecting more characters for larger parties and experiment with who gets paired. The best example of this is one of the main characters Hugo and his griffon Fubar. Side by side in different groups they will go about attacking as they see fit alongside their partner or solo depending on the size of the group. When paired together however, Hugo rides Fubar which leaps up into the air and flies to the target and together they do a lot more damage at the expense that they only perform one action. With a total of 108 different possible characters also known as the series‚Äô Stars of Destiny, there are a lot of possibilities in mixing and matching characters for various outcomes.On completion of a successful battle, every present character receives experience points. I know right? Who would have thought with this being an RPG and all. Why this is a bit more important is that only two series that I can think of have done away with incremental experience caps and instead decided that characters simply need 1000xp in order to level. The first is the Suikoden series and the second was the .Hack series. Just 1000xp? That‚Äôs it? That‚Äôs it. Obviously nothing is ever that easy though as we‚Äôve all come to know. Each character level is a simple 1000xp with modifiers that are put into place as they gain levels. At a certain point in time it no longer becomes possible to level off of certain creatures as there is essentially nothing left to learn and experience must be found elsewhere in more danger stricken territories.Like Combat, Skill and Magic work interestingly enough. Using a form of letter grade, both of these types of abilities generally start off in the range of D, E, F, which would mean that the character has an idea of what their doing, but they aren‚Äôt great at it. Using points gathered in combat, either type of ability can be upgraded at a shop that offers its services in that field. Upgrading one of these abilities allows for several things. The first is that especially in the terms of magic, spells can be cast more times as the stock of what a character can perform before a rest in increased. Secondly the higher abilities within that tree are unlocked allowing for more powerful spells to be cast. Lastly though, this modifies the casting speed time in which a character requires to perform these actions within battle without worry as it is possible to be interrupted.Not every character is good at everything which should be kept in mind when looking at possible skills or magic to add. With 108 different people that makes a lot of sense. In the shops there is the ability to ask the owner to check compatibility. This will allow the player to better grasp how they should develop up a character. Some character for example can never be better than a D-Rank for water magic while others that excel can go all the way to either an A, A+. or S-Rank. If mistakes are made through or it simply makes more sense to add a different skill or magic type, these can be forgotten for another cost in order to start all over again. Not everything can be forgotten just as not everything can be learned. Finding out which is which is just as important.Suikoden III was released as a PS2 Classic and not as an HD Remake meaning that nothing was touched in regards to visuals, menus, resolutions, etc. The anime cutscene still looks absolutely impressive as anime does tend to age very well. As for the rest of the graphics it should be noted that everything was originally designed for a 4:3 ratio before widescreens became a thing. I know right? How did we ever manage‚Ä¶If the default settings are left as they are, there could be a bit of wanting for sharper graphics as things can look a bit edgy and the character dialog is somewhat blurry. Having a PSIII that dates back to before Sony decided to remove the chip that ran the backwards compatibility, I‚Äôve had more than enough time to get familiar with possible options to improve the older generation of games. Thankfully those options are still there on newer PS3s through the software emulation as I‚Äôve had Suikoden III running on a slim model. The particular option is ‚Äúsmoothing‚Äù which fixes the above issues making everything much more enjoyable to look at even if the whole screen can‚Äôt be taken up. This is important to mention as most people may not think to even look around for something like that and be disappointed as the quality is not up to today‚Äôs standards when it can be.Suikoden III as a game is a stellar RPG that does everything right. Suikoden III as a PS2 classic is still just as good even if something tiny like aspect ratios prevent from having full widescreens. Combined together, the experience is a great one and more than worth it for both old fans and new players as each entry of the Suikoden series happens in the same world but each act as a stand alone short of some very tiny details here and there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS8QLLHTWQZX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006LEMK#wasThisHelpful","RS8QLLHTWQZX7","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Monster Trucks should be all about fun. They are massive, over-powered and over-sized vehicles let loose on tracks to perform stunts and cause some solid carnage. A title called Monster Truck Destruction should be about as entertaining as a game comes, but it is held back by limited options and game depth that fail to take a fun premise as far as it could have gone.The biggest problem for Monster Truck Destruction is that it is about as straight of a port as you will probably ever see. There have been plenty of mobile games that have made the transition from you pocket to the PC monitor, but Monster Truck Destruction feels like one of the laziest attempts I have seen to date.The problems start with the options, of which there are very few. Low and high graphics, neither one of which feels like it has really seen a notable uptick from its mobile counterpart. The controls are incredibly basic, with touch/tap in mind. Here you will be using a mouse and keyboard instead - with controller support sadly lacking and creating something of a missed opportunity to take advantage of the game's arcade feel. It claims full controller support, but I have no idea what kind of controller the team was using. I have a PC one, an Xbox certified one and a PlayStation 3 controller (that I use with a remapping program for the inputs) and none of them works properly. The Xbox one allowed me to surf the menu options, but that was pretty much it.The other issue is the relatively shallow depth of the game itself. Like most racing games, you start off with a bit of money and pick your vehicle to start with. As you earn money from participating in events, you earn opportunities to become the champion in two different divisions while navigating a race mode and a stunt/destruction mode. Of the two, I found the latter mode more entertaining, but both took good advantage of the bouncy physics in bringing these behemoth vehicles to life.With your money you can purchase new trucks and make suitable upgrades as you attempt to progress further in the circuits. I appreciated options for buying and upgrading vehicles, but the costs for doing so are astronomical. In theory that is fine as you will be coming back for more, but with so little variety in the core gameplay, Monster Truck Destruction becomes an exercise in grinding.The soundtracks released with the game are appropriately blasted metal tunes, but with only a handful of different tracks, they can become pretty repetitive as you repeat your races. The racing controls themselves feel fine, though they take some time and patience to get a feel for. That makes sense to me, given the size of these trucks - why would they feel like a race car? That said, reverse does not appear to work at all.Monster Truck Destruction is a disappointingly bare bones mobile port that really does not do anything to justify its price tag (especially when one considers that the mobile game is free). With some more polish on the control side of things and more depth to the types of events you could partake in, Monster Truck Destruction would at least offer up some simple, serviceable fun. Unfortunately the end product is too rough for its own good and difficult to recommend at this time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T488J5GWVIHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GA6GJBC#wasThisHelpful","R3T488J5GWVIHF","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I‚Äôm a certified hack ‚Äòn‚Äô slash expert! Okay, ‚Äúexpert‚Äù is probably a bit of a fraudulent stretch.  In fact, I certainly and objectively suck compared to the player who can perform a no-damage 30 minute speed-run of Bayonetta on the hardest difficulty whilst, for added challenge and absurdity, her hands are oiled and confined within 14oz boxing gloves.But I do play and enjoy a variety of hack ‚Äòn‚Äô slash titles -- those I can manage to get my mediocre mitts on -- from the mainstream to the niche and everything in between. These can range from mass peasant-spanking simulators like the Dynasty Warriors franchise to anger aptitude tests such as Ninja Gaiden Black. And after having the fortune of experiencing Onechanbara Z2: Chaos, I must tell you, my possible fellow hack ‚Äòn‚Äô slash aficionados, while wafting the energizing scent of my own self-satisfaction:If you don‚Äôt mind the game‚Äôs arguably welcome single-minded focus on insurmountable babes, impossibly durable bikinis, superabundant undead bloodshed, and don‚Äôt take issue with incredibly linear level design as well as imbalances in level length, then you will discover a combat system in Z2: Chaos that, while not as complex combat-wise as the likes of Bayonetta or Devil May Cry 4, can be just as satisfying as its contemporaries within the genre.The story is an entertaining mixture of surreal nonsense: Two groups, the Vampiric Clan and the Baneful Bloodline, have been mocking each other‚Äôs ridiculously ample bustlines and swiping swords at one another‚Äôs bikini breastplates for decades to determine which group is superior. But when a greater evil threatens to swarm the world in a mass of undead viciousness, two sets of sisters from the opposing groups decide to collaborate, traveling the world to eviscerate inexplicable henchmen in a stylishly frenzied manner. There is camaraderie, there are cowboy hats and there are a few jokes about overly ample bosoms channeled through a narrative told in still comic book panels. There is a girl in a dress who attempts to bonk our heroines in their faces with a spiked club because... I don‚Äôt know? She‚Äôs apparently jealous of how they retain favorable hip-to-waist ratios despite eating like bear cubs deserted on a salmon farm (which is a almost certainly incorrect speculation on my part).The tale and its accompanying dialogue may be silly and campy and a bit scatterbrained, for sure. However these traits allows the game to make its awesome, ridiculous ‚Äúbikinis slay the undead‚Äù premise a triple combination of lighthearted, occasionally self-aware, and charmingly low-budget, characteristics that compliment a few hours of leisurely stupidity after a stressful day of deadlines or competitive diaper changing (if you‚Äôre a maniacally organized parent, you might be into that type of diversion). If you require a storyline that‚Äôs more cohesive, coherent, and thoughtful, however, then, well, you probably wouldn‚Äôt be interested in an adventure about bikini samurais to begin with.If the story does happen to be too bare for expectations, then perhaps the combat will improve upon and make up for its impropriety. For as a masterful team of four ‚Äì Kagura and Saaya, half-blood sisters from the Vampiric Clan; Aya and Saki, sisters of the Baneful Bloodline ‚Äì you sprint from hallway to enemy horde, releasing whatever catharsis that may be harbored within with a variety of extravagant slices, punches, and special attacks that give the word ‚Äúpandemonium‚Äù gainful employment.Now, each character has a primary weapon, a secondary weapon, and sub weapon, all of which feel unique and can be accessed on the fly with the press of a button before, after, or in between any combo set you desire, allowing said combos to be pretty customizable in terms of attack order.For example, you have the basic weak, strong, and sub-weapon attacks ‚Äì which are assigned to square, triangle, and circle, respectively ‚Äì and when executing a weak combo sequence, which consists of tapping square in succession, you have the freedom to change up this basic combo by adding a few strong and sub weapon attacks into the mix. And when you return to the weak combo, your attack continues from where it left off in the original sequence, whether it was on the third or tenth animation of said sequence before you initiated the change up. So, while the move list may not be expansive, the combat can be a joy to experiment with for the sake of challenging yourself amidst a blouse-ripping five-hundred hit combo.Skirmishes become even more chaotic (hence the game‚Äôs title, I suppose) when character switching, team attacks, and special attacks are set loose into the battleground: Pressing up or down on the D-pad immediately switches characters; smashing the touch-pad like a dishonored sells-word unleashes all four girls, each one synchronized to your input, each swing of their weapons colorfully coursed by the girls‚Äô unique auras at an unwavering 60 fps; and simultaneously pressing triangle and circle sets off each warriors‚Äô one of three (12 in total once they‚Äôre all unlocked) special attacks, which range from Saaya‚Äôs crowd-controlling earthquake to Kagura‚Äôs ability to spawn a doppelganger that allows her to accrue double damage. This all goes without mentioning how each character can briefly transform into hyper-erotic Super Saiyans‚Ä¶But before I get too carried away with how delightful the combat can be, I must address a few of Z2: Chaos‚Äô issues. Primarily, although the ladies‚Äô character models are lovely and detailed, and the enemies are oddly designed yet distinguishable, the stages are embarrassingly barren, poor representations of the real-world locations they‚Äôre barely trying to parallel. Dubai, for instance, looks less like a metropolis stacked with ultramodern architecture and more like a colossus‚Äô litter box, with its static sand dunes and ‚Äì what the hell is that, a miniature Mayan temple?  On top of this, the stages suffer from length imbalances. One stage, or chapter, may take five minutes to complete, while a later chapter will take almost an hour. What this can do in a game that focuses on repeatedly punishing waves of enemies is add tedium to its formula by the end of the game‚Äôs 5 to 7 hour campaign. It‚Äôs not an issue for me, since I enjoy a good grind, but for some it could prove to feel more like labor than leisure by the time you reach the final stage.Onechanbara Z2: Chaos has its issues. Although it has a nonsensical story (which I enjoy), level design from the deep yesteryears of virtual entertainment, and stages that vary so wildly in length that I forget the day of the week, Z2: Chaos‚Äô combat nearly renders all of these calamitous flaws silent. It‚Äôs not the deepest, most intelligent, or most skill-intensive combat on the market. But it might be the most eccentric. And with the right mindset that‚Äôs willing to embrace the zaniness and work around the possible weaknesses, it can be just as fun as the best hack ‚Äòn‚Äô slashes around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW8H8UTVIYDCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1M83TU#wasThisHelpful","RW8H8UTVIYDCG","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Turtle Beach is a powerful brand; there is a reason they hold over 50% of the market share for console accessories and it generally has to do with the fact that they build solid, high quality headsets. With the announcement of the new Turtle Beach Elite 800X headset, we at Chalgyr's Game Room decided we would take a minute to share the love and wealth of some of their other gear, in this case the Stealth 500X for the Xbox One.  Here is our take on this vaunted brand's oft-praised headset.When I received the 500X I squealed a bit; there it was, a beautiful (if rather compact) box containing one of  gaming's most popular brands and it was all mine. I popped open the box and just took it in; packed tightly into its shipping container, the 500X was sitting nice and snug with that new electronics smell. I loved it. Once I pulled out the few cables, receiver (did I mention it is fully wireless? Oh yeah, it is fully wireless and it is glorious), the headset and a few decals and the startup guide I was literally tripping over my coffee table in my haste to get it plugged in and charging. Fortunately the headset had about a 1/3 of the charge on it so I was able to plug it right into the Xbox One's rear USB port and the optical porta and I was on my wa.The headset feels compact and tight; everything about it feels tense, like a beast waiting to be unleashed. The band is stiff, but pliable and never uncomfortable. The cups feel solid and are a little on the small side but after even four or five hours of The Withcer 3: Wild Hunt I felt no discomfort. The headset is gorgeous, with sleek lines, excellent accent piping, and feel solid and durable while maintaining a light and comfortable feel. Honestly Turtle Beach must have employed some sort of wizardry while building it as I have never seen/felt a headset that was both lightweight and heavy all in one, but the 500X is certainly that.Even on the 1/3 charge I managed about 4 hours of gameplay before it died but I did notice that  as the headset's battery came closer to no charge there was a definitive *click* in the audio; it was quite annoying but once I charged the headset and went back the following day to play some Battlefield: Hardline online I did not experience it again. (*UPDATE NOTE* After E3 finished I was playing some Gears of War Ultimate on the Xbox One and as the headset neared the end of its charge the clicking reappeared; I believe that it has to do with the headset not being able to adequately power the various modes, the wireless connection, the microphone, etc. and it is dropping the broadcast power to simply power the unit. It ONLY happens within the 5-10 minutes prior to the headset shutting off)Within about five minutes of putting the headset on I could see why Turtle Beach is the market leader in console headsets; the 500X is rock solid and delivers some excellent 7.1 DTS surround sound and superior build quality. While there are numerous modes that you can set the headset in, essentially switching through pre-made equalizer settings, I did not find one that I loved more than the other (they were all quite nice), I personally could have gone for a little more bass, but to be fair I could always go for more bass.Whether I was watching Avatar, playing The Witcher, or perusing YouTube, the Stealth 500X accurately recreates audio in crystal clear fashion. The real winner though? That would be the microphone. Most of the microphones I have tested for the Xbox One feel muted, shallow, or lacking any true depth of clarity. Not so with the Stealth 500X; crystal clean audio without the hiss or high popping of some of the more sensitive brands (PDP mics run a little hot) and when I would excitedly shout inot the microphone there was no distortion; it really is the best feature of the 500X (not to discount any of the other qualities though!).Turtle Beach has had a stranglehold on the accessories market for years now and if the upcoming Elite 800X is anything like the Stealth 500X things will not be changing anytime soon. Their high manufacturing standards show in the rock solid and near-magical construction of the physical unit and the crisp, clean audio reproduction really do show that Turtle Beach has the gamer in mind when they develop and build their hardware and the Stealth 500X is an excellent representation of Turtle Beach's dedication to the gamer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC7SZEOHP4FH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSQACMM#wasThisHelpful","RC7SZEOHP4FH9","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some people seem surprised that the point and click adventure genre has been seeing something of a resurgence over the last couple of years. Those people clearly have not been paying attention to Daedalic Entertainment's offerings, because their titles are almost always excellent, with unique visual styles, compelling stories and simple, yet approachable mechanics that are often geared towards a specific audience. Anna's Quest fits right in.This is in every way a classically styled point and click adventure game. You will have to inspect your surroundings, try to solve puzzles and perhaps most interestingly, leverage Anna's new-found telekinetic powers to help progress as well. The story starts off with a simple, almost sad tale about Anna as she attempts to find a cure for her beloved grandfather's illness. Anna has been something of a shut-in for most of her life however, and runs afoul of a witch that performs some experiments on her. The end result? Anna now has telekinetic powers.It is a strange story to be sure, but one that is well crafted around a wide variety of fairy tales that get interwoven together to create a story with plenty of dark humor. The cast of characters is often charming, and they help to support what might seem like a silly tale with motivations and challenges aplenty.Daedalic Entertainment sports some of the best visual designers in the business, and Anna's Quest benefits from their talents here as well. Characters have gorgeous design, with environments that are both detailed and full of color. The characters are simple at a glance, but charming in their own way with enough facial variety to keep them from feeling like cookie cutter clones. The visual presentation is assisted by some pleasant music and very solid voice acting.While the telekinetic aspect puts a different spin on some of the problem solving, some of the game's mechanics do hold Anna's Quest back slightly. The combining of items is almost always a welcome feature in a game like this, but it leads to some backtracking in the environments when you stumble onto a new puzzle, padding the game a bit in the process. Some of the puzzles are more obscure than I would have liked as well, with the characters providing little or no help when you interact with them.To their credit, the puzzles feel like a part of the world and do a great job of generally feeling organic and the majority of them are clever. They provide the necessary sense of satisfaction that comes from solving the environmental riddles. There are only a handful of these more frustrating ones that hurt the pacing and frustrate when they pop up. They are worth noting, but these puzzles are not frequent enough to really discourage someone from completing the game.Anna's Quest exudes charm with its quirky sense of humor, adorable visuals and quality voice acting. The end result? A memorable story - which is a must for games of this type to succeed. Point and click adventures are still alive and well, at least when Daedalic Entertainment makes them. This is a genre that still holds a warm place in my heart and Anna's Quest is an enjoyable addition to the genre.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35DG0CZN0IAHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZUN3YH8#wasThisHelpful","R35DG0CZN0IAHM","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess is a great touch-up on the Deception IV: Blood Ties game. For those who have already had a chance to play the game, this version does not offer a ton of new content, though the additional story and quests certainly provide some fun. If you are new to the game or series and want something unique to play? This game is devilish fun and easy to recommend.The Deception series has always been a difficult one to define. I fell in love with the first game on the original PlayStation, when it was called Tecmo's Deception: An Invitation to Darkness. That is quite the title, but it was also quite the game as Deception left a huge impression on me. The game was dark, brooding and had a completely unique feeling to it. This is true of the narrative, but also the gameplay which had elements of action, RPGs and strategy laced throughout the gameplay.Fast forward to now with Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess and we have a game that embraces many of these same principles as you take the role of Laegrinna - a 'daughter' of the Devil made up of a fragment of his soul. This was part of the original Deception IV title, but now a new character named Velguirie has been introduced with a more mission-oriented sort of approach to the story. Both characters are similar in that they do not directly defend themselves, but instead use traps around their environment to do their dirty work.I have always felt like the early Deception game laid down some of the framework for titles like Dungeon Defenders and Orcs Must Die! These are titles that are tower defense with a more personal touch because of the character you control on the battlefield. In Deception it is not so much tower defense as using your own character as the bait that your enemies are making their way towards. They want to kill you for a variety of reasons. Some are mercenaries or knights who are hunting you down either for money or righteousness, while others have simply happened upon your location through ill fortune.The idea is basically the same at that point. Use traps to damage, kill or capture the intruders. There are traps that you can set, and you choose from a variety of them to be equipped with before each level. These can range from ground-based beartraps and explosions to wall mounted spikes and fireballs to raining death from above in the form of boulders and pumpkins. Yes, pumpkins - but it makes sense in a moment. There are also traps built into the environment, such as using a swinging axe trap to knock a column down onto a trapped intruder, or catapulting a hapless victim into the belly of a giant flaming bronze bull.Each trap comes in one of three flavors. You have Elaborate, Sadistic and Humiliating. Elaborate tend to be more about impacting a character's movements. These tend to involve beartraps, suction walls and walls that can push people into other spaces. They deal damage, but are usually more useful in getting someone lined up for bigger combinations and hits. Sadistic generally deals heavy damage, such as a swinging axe from the ceiling or triggering a statue holding a great sword to swing its arm down and strike an intruder. Humiliating are usually the least likely to be avoided, but also do not necessarily do a great deal of damage. They can be useful or lining someone up for a combination, but they tend to be a bit more difficult to predict as well. Drop a pumpkin on someone's head, and they will march off in a specific direction for a time, but it is the direction they are already facing. If they turn at the last moment, it could mess up your entire combination.Of course, enemies are not always going to simply walk right where you want them to. Some use jumping attacks to get close, while others use magic or arrows for ranged attacks. Some are certainly foolish, but these tend to deal the most damage if they get within range. Considering you often are competing with two or three enemies at a time, and it can be tough to focus on just one person while running from one location to the other. I will say that this game is much harder than the original deception - I used to just make use of narrow hallways and beat people to death with spikes in the walls. The game has come a long ways since then.The pace of Nightmare Princess might not suit everyone. There is a lot of waiting to lure people where you want them, and while I find the payoff to be exceedingly satisfying when it works, it can also be very frustrating when it fails. Add to that the somewhat squishy nature of the primary characters, and later levels will likely kill you a great deal. Replaying the same three or four guys to get back to the wave that did you in can be a fifteen to thirty minute experience that I am certainly willing to live with give the game's devilish charms, but if you are looking for fast-paced action, Deception might not be the series for you.Combining specific types of combinations, meeting the requests of your three helpers (essentially optional quests that yield more experience and money) and purchasing new traps and powers all serve as excellent progression hooks that kept me coming back for me. While this is a single player game, there are some options for creating scenarios and uploading and downloading them. The same is true of replay videos. These tools help to add to the title's replay value and they kept me coming back for more.Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess is the best version of the game by far. I had a chance to play Blood Ties on both the Vita and the PlayStation 3 initially, and it is a better experience here. The additional content is a nice touch, and while the visuals do not press the PlayStation 4 hardware, load times are actually quite snappy and help to take some of the sting out of dying and having to reload again.

"I have used a few gaming mats, from the fantastically huge PC Gaming Race Extended Mouse Mat to others such as the SteelSeries Qik gaming surface as well as a few Razer mats, and when I compare the surface texture, grippy back, and manufacturing quality the Sargas 320 is right up amongst the best I have ever used. The surface is as smooth as silk and the Naos 8200 tracks perfectly on it.On top of the near-perfect tracking there is almost no friction between the Naos 8200 and the Sargas 320 so moving the mouse is effortless and smooth. Using an EtekCity Scroll Alpha gaming mouse was not nearly as enjoyable on the Sargas 320 as it seemed to ""stick"" more, though that may be due to the fact that the EtekCity mouse is full of sharp corners and weighs a metric ton. Using my SteelSeries Sensei Wireless mouse yielded results similar to the Naos 8200, though the movement of the Sensei was not as smooth as the Mionix mouse.One of the biggest issues I have had with mouse mats in general is that they tend to attract everything from dust and lint to crumbs and other debris and while the Sargas 320's super-smooth fabric surface does quite well in repelling dust and other particles, it still gets dirty. Fortunately though a few brisk wipes and maybe smacking the flexible mousepad against your leg will shake free any dust or debris and you can get right back to gaming as needed.At about $15 the Sargas 320 microfiber gaming surface is a steal given Mionix's dedication to high quality production and superb performance. After countless hours using the Sargas 320 the gaming mat has proven to be durable, easily cleaned, and of the utmost quality and every gamer should head over to Mionix's website (www.mionix.net) and pick one up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A8FOFDEWHO5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RLHKUC#wasThisHelpful","R3A8FOFDEWHO5O","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dinosaurs. LEGOs. Those two things alone should spark the imagination of almost any kid - I certainly recall them coming together frequently in my childhood, and they seem like a perfect pairing for a video game as well. That the recent Jurassic World movie was such a huge success should only reinforce the likelihood that the game is well-received. The good news is, the video game holds up quite well as a creative, kid-friendly take on the movie.If there was a complaint from critics about the Jurassic World movie, it was some nitpicking over some of the finer points in the storyline. This did not seem to bother audience goers much as they flocked to see it in theaters and seemed to enjoy it. LEGO Jurassic World should appeal on a similar front. You do not get lost in any sort of story minutia here, but you do get to relive many of the bigger scenes from the movie, all against a background of bricks and amusing characters.Like the LEGO Hobbit game, this one actually pulls from story lines found in Jurassic Park, The Lost World and Park III as well as Jurassic World. This gives gamers a plethora of content to work through, with lots of brick-based environments to sort through, plenty of characters to play and of course, lots of adorably cute dinosaurs that make up the high points in the game.One of the best design choices in this game is the ability to let players take control of the dinosaurs and wreck havoc with them. The dinosaurs plod about in somewhat difficult-to-control fashion at times, but they are still a great deal of fun. This was a great decision because the human characters really lack for variation. This is not like a Hobbit game where you might have dwarves, archers and magic users that have different skills, or the Marvel game where the superheroes have lots of unique abilities. Certainly some humans in this can do specific things better than others, but it was a smart design choice to allow for non-human characters to control.As always, there is a sort of LEGO brand of humor at play here that works so well with the bricks and the story content. I remember being impressed years ago when I first played the Star Wars titles in LEGO form - I came away thoroughly impressed with how expressive the silent characters could be, and how funny the end results were. Fast forward to where the LEGO games are at now, and the characters are far more expressive than ever and this allows that trademark humor to really shine.Of course there are a ton of unlockables as you play, which gives the game a good deal of replay value. This is not the longest of games - each of the four chapters takes a little less than two hours to complete, so you are only spending about seven or eight hours on the entirety of the campaign. The unclockable content gives you a great excuse to go back and try some of your favorite levels again. The desire to do so is helped by great level design, charming visuals and a sound track that really soars when it needs to. To me LEGO has always been synonymous with imagination, and this is a game where it is easy for the imagination to get swept away in the fun.There are a few bugs here and there, and I do wish the dinosaurs controlled a bit better at times, but all in all LEGO Jurassic World is arguably the best installment in the LEGO series in the last couple of years. It will appeal to a large audience, it gives you a lot to do and... oh yeah, there are dinosaurs. My inner child absolutely approves of that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WNQC3EVBPAT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXEOOHU#wasThisHelpful","R2WNQC3EVBPAT5","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Safe, fast charging for your mobile devices. I actually have another one like this - but a different brand that I have used frequently over the last couple of years, before I lost it. In my day-to-day use, I didn't get much mileage out of these guys, but if I knew I was going to have an extended stay away from home, that is where the external battery charger came in useful for my iPhone 4. With a couple of different plug options, it is versatile, though admittedly I only really made use of the USB connection for my phone. The charger itself is quick to replenish, and it comes up just short of doubling my battery time when I use it to supplement my iPhone.The charger never gets hot, so it is safe and convenient - it does everything it is supposed to. The only reason I am not giving it a five star is my old one had one small feature I really liked, that I didn't see on this particular unit. My old one had a surprisingly bright flashlight-like light in the end, which can come in quite handy at times, making it slightly more versatile than the average charger. This one however, does its job well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SLXS998PMBE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KF8RP2I#wasThisHelpful","R1SLXS998PMBE5","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Small, simple and to the point.The design is a bit more flexible than most multiple USB chargers because the plug is a wired one (giving you more distance and not requiring that you hang a bulky rectangular box out of an outlet). It seems like a small thing, but it is nice. The design has five USB outputs as well, and here is where things tend to get interesting, because a couple of the ports are built for higher energy items (think full-sized iPads). These ports do a faster job getting those higher need items charged more quickly.The other ports are smart ones that can be used for whatever device you like, handy for people who have multiple devices (phones, tablets, etc) that might need charging. I like that the plug can detach from the back - making the unit easier to tote around if you use it on the go. The one design drawback I noticed is that the USB ports have a little wiggle to them. Not that anything comes loose, but it just feels like that part of the design is perhaps not as precise as I would have liked, but it does not seem to impact the actual charge any. All in all, if you are looking for a good way to charge a handful of devices, this should very well do the trick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19QPA2P508ZBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWX58P2#wasThisHelpful","R19QPA2P508ZBI","A2K7OP4VPIHQU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K7OP4VPIHQU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are not the best sardines in tomato sauce I've ever had, but the best I've had costs twice as much and are not available here with free shipping.

"First of all, the description is not true.  ""It's directly translated from the Greek and Hebrew texts..."" could not be further from the truth and I'm shocked to read this.Here's a comparison of a passage I chose at random, Matthew 6:25-27.  First the Message and then the New King James (and I'm not a ""King James only"" person).Has anyone by fussing in front of the mirror ever gotten taller by so much as an inch? All this time and money wasted on fashion--do you think it makes that much difference? Instead of looking at the fashions, walk out into the fields and look at the wildflowers. They never primp or shop, but have you ever seen color and design quite like it? The ten best-dressed men and women in the country look shabby alongside them.Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?  So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin;  and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.""fussing in front of the mirror"" is not the same as ""worry about your life"".  Talk about First World problems!  The issue Jesus is addressing is people worrying about necessities, not ""fashion"".By the way, if you have successfully read this far, you have the reading ability to use a genuine translation.If a person is ""so familiar"" with the Bible that the ""words have lost their meaning"" the solution to the problem is not to read a ""bible"" that changes the very meaning of the text.If this near-parody leads someone to faith, then I'll just sigh and take the attitude of Paul in Philippians 1:18.  As The Message says...""So how am I to respond? I've decided that I really don't care about their motives, whether mixed, bad, or indifferent. Every time one of them opens his mouth, Christ is proclaimed, so I just cheer them on!""","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GJE6POCM4949/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1576839168#wasThisHelpful","R3GJE6POCM4949","A11ED8O95W2103","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ED8O95W2103?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just saw it yesterday, here's my review:First the good.1.  Quality and detailed animation.  I could almost go through it again just to freeze frame and look at what's in the background in some scenes.2.  Takes place in the 1960's, and if you are an adult who remembers that era just seeing it recreated is fun.3.  Some humor only adults will get.  The moon landing hoax theory being an example.4.  Entertaining super-villain.  And now, almost fifty years later, she's running for president!  (Sorry, couldn't resist.)5.  Fun sixties pop music hits in the soundtrack.Now the not-so-good, for me anyway.1.  Minion language can get old.  That gibberish they speak surprisingly started to grate on my nerves after an hour.  Supposedly it incorporates bits from many languages.  The philologists out there can have fun with it.2.  The soundtrack has sixties hits, but they're just kind of thrown in there one after another, and after a while it seems like the point was to avoid writing any original music by licensing golden oldies.  If there is original music in the soundtrack, I've forgotten it.3.  Failed attempts at humor.  For example, towards the end Bob rescues a rat from the sewer and carries it around for the rest of the movie, but the rat didn't do anything funny, and hardly anything at all.  Money was spent to design and animate that rat, and for nothing it seems.4.  Kids' reactions. A lot of kids in the theater were laughing at the start, but not so much toward the end.  My son said it was ""OK"".5.  A lot of fun stuff went through my head, but nothing touched my heart.6.  Personally, I don't care if I never see it again.

"I got exactly what I expected from this movie: a lot of dinosaurs, characters I could sort of care about, and an air conditioned room to sit in for a couple of hours.  Really, if a movie title starts with ""Jurassic"" you're going to get dinosaurs running around doing terrible things and people trying to stop them.  Hasn't it been this way from the beginning?  Only this time it's more dinosaurs, more different kinds of dug-up dinosaurs (even petting zoo dinosaurs) and even dinosaurs that never even existed because the mad scientists at Jurassic World have combined DNA from all kinds of dinosaurs and other critters to make dinosaurs that are unique ""assets"" at the theme park.  I loved the line about corporate sponsorship for dinosaurs: ""Pepsi-saurus"" ha ha ha.The only other thing I'll give away is that I remember a scene when the Asian geneticist was drinking tea in the laboratory.  The scene started with a shot of some little critter encased in amber, and then the camera panned over to the tea drinking scientist, and the tea was almost the exact same shade as the amber the critter was encased in.  Ewwwwwww.And why is it now that whenever any hero character gets in trouble in any movie they always say, ""Oh no no...no no no no no...no no no...But there's humor in this movie too; at least a little bit.This is one of those movies that's great as long as you don't break the bank to see it.  It's one thing to spend fifty bucks to take your wife and two kids to a theatre to see it once, and another thing to wait and spend three bucks sometime in the future to see it streaming into your home.  I recommend the latter.  Then of course you have to wonder if you'll ever want to see it again in which case there's the DVD purchase decision.

"The trailer I saw weeks ago didn't do this movie justice.  I've never been to the same movie in the theatre twice in one week.  I went and saw it myself and then a few days later I went with a friend because I thought he'd enjoy it and I figured I'd missed a lot of detail the first time through and that I'd catch more of the subtleties the second time around.  I was right.  This is a very re-watchable movie.This movie deals with what goes on inside an eleven year old girl's head from the point of view of five emotions: Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Sadness.  They take turns running her brain's control panel as her family moves her from Minnesota to San Francisco.  And that's all the plot I'll discuss here.From my brain's point of view, during the movie it was all Joy and Sadness running the controls.

"Godzilla had dinosaurs but no robots.  Transformers had robots but no dinosaurs.  This movie has both robots and dinosaurs!  And not just any mechanical type robots, but super huge robots that are actually built by humans and take two or even three mind melded human pilots within them to operate!And not just any dinosaurs, but continually evolving dinosaurs that emerge from a trans-dimensional vortex in the ocean  floor off the coast of Hong Kong from a secret under-the-ocean-floor dinosaur base where the original dinosaurs -- who were really aliens -- retreated to after their first attempt to take over the Earth -- millions of years ago -- didn't work.  They've been stewing down their for ages learning to modify their own DNA to produce ever bigger, uglier, and more sophisticated dinosaurs to let loose in their latest attempt to take over the world.  And now they're called ""kaiju"" which sounds Japanese so it's way cooler.And at least one of these dinosaurs either walked on the ocean floor or swam half way around the world just to destroy San Francisco.  What is it with San Francisco?  Godzilla destroyed San Francisco in 2014.  San Francisco was destroyed in San Andreas in 2015.  But Pacific Rim sent a kaiju there in 2013, so Pacific Rim got there first!  And, there are many other cities that get destroyed by the kaiju too.  City destruction fans will not be disappointed.But there's more.  There's also a secret human base where the last of the ""jaegers"" -- which is a way cooler way to say ""robots"" -- are continually manned and maintained even though their funding has been cut off, which makes perfect sense because they're the only really effective defense humanity has against the kaijus.At this base you'll meet a tough, pretty, and endearing Asian girl; a leader who is very much like Nick Fury only without the eye patch; and not one but two wacky fun mad scientists who actually end up making a vital contribution to defeating the kaijus.  Top this off with a macho young soldier with daddy issues (it even says in the movie) and a daddy soldier who is too macho to ever say anything kind to his son, and you've got a movie with everything!!Seriously, if you liked the Godzilla mess from 2014 you should love Pacific Rim.  And  if you didn't like  Godzilla, you may be pleasantly surprised by this movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CBHNGE3KB0BQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FWLTPU8#wasThisHelpful","R3CBHNGE3KB0BQ","A11ED8O95W2103","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ED8O95W2103?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just watched three episodes in a row and really enjoyed them.  I'm interested in navy stuff and enjoy post-apocalyptic science fiction, so the ingredients were there.  There's some dumb stuff that might annoy you if you think too much.  Some examples I noticed:1.  Bad guys have the marksmanship of Imperial Storm Troopers.  No matter how much they shoot, or if they shoot first, they never hit anything.  Only the US Navy people score hits when they shoot.2.  Helicopters fire missiles right into the front superstructure of the destroyer, and they don't even mark the paint.3.  Destroyer arms Tomahawk missiles to use against ships, but the Tomahawk missile is a land attack missile not an anti-shipping missile.And there's more if you pay attention.  To me this is like the sci-fi epic Battleship from a few years ago.  Don't think too much, just sit back and enjoy the ride.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDXQMZUHOAYJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPQ9Q0E#wasThisHelpful","RDXQMZUHOAYJ5","A11ED8O95W2103","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ED8O95W2103?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I walked into the theater with low expectations.  I really just wanted to sit in an air conditioned room and divert my mind for a couple hours, but what I saw left me feeling good about my investment of time and money despite myself.The story is how a singe family navigates it's way through a series of cataclysmic earthquakes along the San Andreas fault, and the story centers on the destruction of San Francisco.  No, California does not fall into the sea.  Sorry.There is also a side plot involving a scientist who has a team that predicts earthquakes, but those characters aren't developed as much.The movie began with action and character development at the same time, and through the entire film the action and character development keep pace with each other.  As buildings fall, we get more and more of the characters' backstory.  It's sort of a roller coaster between getting to know the characters and seeing their world fall apart.The special effects really impressed me.  Even though we live in a time when we expect fantastic effects, I was still amazed by what I saw.  The destruction of San Francisco reminded me of 9/11 in an eerie way.  It left me wanting to see a ""making of"" documentary.The one part I didn't really get was why there would be a tsunami inbound to San Francisco harbor after earthquakes along the San Andreas fault.  It didn't make much sense to me, but it made for more awesome visuals.  Seeing the navy destroyer upended between the office buildings was weird, but it's one of my main memories from the movie.So if you want characters you might actually care about and you want to see a lot of building destroyed and screaming people, this is the movie for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CZZIR5WSLKMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YGO1FQE#wasThisHelpful","R3CZZIR5WSLKMV","A11ED8O95W2103","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ED8O95W2103?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Avengers didn't really get to do much avenging in this movie because they essentially get defeated by the bad guy (or should I say bad program) several times only to get bailed out by a just-in-time saved-by-the-bell easy to write plot twist.  I was disappointed in Joss Whedon because I think he could have done way better.  Here's my quick overview.  Warning spoilers ahead!First, I had to really focus for the first twenty minutes or so just to keep track of what was going on.  The movie took a long time to settle into telling the primary story which is of a bad Artificial Intelligence program that becomes self aware and tries to save the human race by destroying the world.  Make sense?  Didn't think so.Next, the Avengers seem to be defeated but suddenly two of the bad people with super powers become good people and join them so the Avengers are saved, for now.Then, the Avengers plus two seem defeated until Iron Man downloads a good AI program into a body that's better than the bad AI program's body, and he has a stone his forehead that is super powerful, so the Avengers add one more to the team and are saved again.Then, some of the avengers are stuck on a flying small town that's being lifted up by the bad program-in-a-body so it can be dropped again creating an extinction event for the world, and it seems like their goose is cooked, but suddenly Nick Fury shows up with his flying aircraft carrier and saves them.  Bailed out again.I may have not gotten the chronology right and I missed some detail, but you get the idea: All is lost until poof something happens that saves the day.Finally, lifting that small town up a thousand or two feet and dropping it would make a mess but certainly not an extinction event.  The town would only hit the Earth with the gravitational momentum gained by falling a couple thousand feet.  The reason why asteroids can create extinction events is because they can hit the earth at many thousands of miles per hour flying into the Earth from space, and the sheer kinetic energy does the damage to the Earth.Bottom line: wait to see in on streaming video for a few bucks and save your money.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZGG168VSMJQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WYX3094#wasThisHelpful","RZGG168VSMJQB","A11ED8O95W2103","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ED8O95W2103?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sadly this is my guinea pig's first home and likely his last.I am writing about the 30 x 18 size.  We adopted a guinea pig on an emergency basis from friends who were moving and this is the cage he came in.By the time you add a pigloo structure, a food dish and a hay hopper you've got enough room left for one guinea pig to walk around a bit, but not run.  Sadly it's as big a cage as we have room for. Using this cage to house two guinea pigs would be downright cruel.  Guinea pigs need to be able to run, and they simply can't in this cage.  I love my pig and I feel very sad for him.  He never committed a felony but he has to live in this prison.The cage is flimsy wire which comes apart too easy and then is a real pain to get all hooked back together and keep all the hooks hooked at once so you can lock it back on the plastic base.  And, you have to do that every time you clean the cage (even for daily minimal maintenance cleaning) and likely every time you want to handle your pig because of the stupid little door they put on this cage which is big enough to stick your hands in but not big enough to do very much with your hands.Oh, and the door doesn't keep itself shut.  It will fall outwards or inwards.  We use a clothespin to connect it to the rest of the cage and keep it shut.For the same money you can invest in modern guinea pig technology.  Do a search on ""Midwest Expandable Guinea Habitat"" and see the modern and humane way to house one or more guinea pigs (the authorities say you should at least have two of them for their mental health.)  Look at some videos on line and see what the real guinea pig experts have for their set ups.This cage may have all the room required for rats, mice, gerbils and hamsters.  It's way too small for a guinea pig, and I can't even imagine a rabbit housed in one of these things.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35EMY5QJOV2LA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQOJV40#wasThisHelpful","R35EMY5QJOV2LA","A11ED8O95W2103","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ED8O95W2103?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The car I learned to drive on was a 1971 Plymouth Valiant with the V8 option, the same car as in the movie.  I drove it from high school through graduate school.  It was metallic blue rather than orange.  It had the same interior!  (If you look close you can see the little sticker indicating the V8 option a few inches back from the headlights on both front side panels.  I learned that only one of about one hundred Valiants had the V8 option.  Most had the venerable slant six.)For this reason, I really feel for and root for Dennis Weaver through the course of this movie.  I wonder if I were in his place whether or not I could outrun that truck once and for all and be safe.  The Valiant with the V8 is a quicker car than it looks like.  I'd like to think I could do better than Dennis Weaver did.  Surely I could put some serious distance between myself and the truck when we ran into hills.  But could I ever shake the truck completely when we're stuck on the same highway in the middle of nowhere?  I don't really know.Anyway, this is a brilliantly simple  and great old suspense movie.

"I bought this CD on a whim when it was in print many years ago, and it just sat on my CD shelf until about two hours ago when I played it and really listened to it.This is good stuff!  I thought for some reason when I bought it that it would be children's music that would give me a little blast from the past when I watched the show as a kid, but it turns out this is a very enjoyable pop album in it's own right.  I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it, and I'll probably listen to it again soon.  One of the highlights for me was the Pussycat's version of the Carpenters hit ""(They Long To Be) Close To you"".Some of the songs seem to go into Motown territory; the others are just good clean pop fun, and the multiple versions of the Josie and the Pussycats theme song are just icing on the cake.So now all you have to do is make and drink your own coffee instead of getting that latte about twenty or thirty times and you'll save up the money to get this rare gem from the past.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DSDH7Q3E19HM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KXNKJK#wasThisHelpful","R1DSDH7Q3E19HM","A11ED8O95W2103","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ED8O95W2103?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, well I'll never listen to jazz music quite the same way again!  I knew that becoming proficient took a lot of work but I never realized or really appreciated the work required to gain the skill to play in a jazz band.  And playing extremely well by yourself in a bedroom or garage doesn't mean you can play competently with a band.But the film left me with questions (spoiler alert):Given that someone aspires to be the best in the world at something, is there only one way to bring out the best in someone, that way being abuse?  And just what is ""abuse"" anyway?  Yelling?  Yelling creative obscenities?  Slapping, but not hard enough to cause injury?  Is this the kind of treatment that looks cruel in the short term but might be remembered with gratitude years later when the ""abused"" student is standing on top of the world with the legendary greats in his or her field?To me, Fletcher the instructor seemed like a musical marine drill sergeant.  Recruits are always getting screamed at, aren't they?  They don't fall apart; they turn into marines.  Did Fletcher really deserve to lose his job?  Sure, justice was served in a way, but the Schaffer school might never produce another prize winning jazz band.It's a good thing that just by chance I'd watched all the Mad TV Coach Hines videos before I saw this movie.  I found myself laughing inside at all of Fletcher's screaming, but I still felt for Neyman.I gave Whiplash four stars because it kept my attention from start to finish, but I doubt I'd ever want to see it again.  It was a good ""one view"" movie.When the movie ends, we don't really know what the long term future holds for Fletcher or Neyman, so I made my own predictions:I predict that Neyman, having tired of splattering his own blood all over himself and his drums, will return to college, get an education degree, and end up teaching band at a high school or small college.  At nights on weekends he performs in a local rock 'n roll cover band, lending his unique drumming touch to rock standards from the 60's and 70's.I predict that Fletcher will make a living by being a special guest piano player at small clubs and occasionally conducting jazz bands in the evening.  He is also hired by parents to be a motivational speaker for their lazy teenagers.  He lives in a van down by the river.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KWL3TV01HPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYBD6VQ#wasThisHelpful","R3KWL3TV01HPX","A11ED8O95W2103","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ED8O95W2103?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a very similar product hanging from the top of my guinea pig's cage and  he could care less about it.  It looks slightly chewed on, probably just enough for my pig to decide it isn't edible.You see, my guinea pig doesn't do ""chew toys"".  He divides his world into things he can eat and things he can't.  I've seen him eat post-it notes, part of a paper plate, part of a grocery bag, the edges off a cardboard box, the edges of the covers of my vinyl records, and the insulation off of network and phone cables.  These weren't ""chew toys""; they were eaten.  There was no remnant of any of this stuff on the floor indicating that he just chewed on it.  Stuff chewed off was actually gone. (Thankfully he's been moved to a different room where stuff like this is no longer available.)I think the general idea of making wood or plastic in the shape and color of something a guinea pig would like to eat is sort of sick.  If you want your pig to chew on something, feed it actual food and  watch the cute little critter eat.  The unlimited supply of Timothy Hay that all guinea pigs should have access to gives them plenty to chew on as much as they want and it is actually good for them.  It's what they're built for.Why not take the money you'd spend on this and buy some real carrots and romaine lettuce and feed it to your pig by hand and actually build a relationship with your pet rather than dangling the promise of food in front of it only to have it turn out to be non-food?","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG5D15DTK98P2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GHBZKM#wasThisHelpful","RG5D15DTK98P2","A11ED8O95W2103","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ED8O95W2103?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Are you ever annoyed by the fact that you have to get off your rear every morning five days a week to put food on the table while some parasitic ball of fur with ""pig"" as his or her last name just sits on its fuzzy behind and gets hay thrown in front of it; some of it getting eaten and the rest getting pooped and peed all over so you end up cleaning it out of the cage?  Well then, get this ""hay manager"" and introduce your guinea pig to the hassles and frustrations of having to work for a living.  You see, the geniuses who designed this product made the space between the wooden cross beams just big enough so that the ""pig"" can get his nose right up to that hay and take a big snort, but he can't actually get his mouth around the hay without extreme difficulty!  Welcome to the real world, furball!  It's a hay ""manager"" not a hay dispenser.Sometimes my guinea pig gets so mad I hear the ""manager"" being banged against the cage wall several times as my hungry little buddy just tries to get a shred of hay out of it between the wooden cross pieces.  He did figure out that he can stand up on his rear feet, put his front feet on the top wooden beam, and put his head down in the top of the ""manager"" to get hay.  Well, now he has to get off his rear to get food.  Lesson learned.Seriously,  this is a poorly designed product and you wonder if its creators have ever had any kind of rodent as a pet or had even bothered to test it.  And, I really don't enjoy seeing or hearing my guinea pig struggle with it.  Another reviewer mentioned the idea of knocking out one of the wooden cross beams, and I may end up doing that.  If you are looking for a hay dispensing solution for a guinea pig or anything larger, I would advise not getting this as it will likely just make your furry friend miserable.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUS0Z33KS8KLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FU4Z74#wasThisHelpful","RUS0Z33KS8KLM","A11ED8O95W2103","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11ED8O95W2103?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of those cases where the trailers for the movie made me not want to see it ever.  I saw the trailers before many other movies and all they showed me was a bunch of slapstick humor scenes edited together which revealed nothing of the plot (or even if the movie had a plot), and I didn't think they humor was very funny.  Now that I've seen those same scenes in context in the movie I realize how funny they are.  And dumbing down the title from ""The Pirates! An Adventure with scientists"" to ""The Pirates! Band of Misfits"" was self-defeating, because all pirates are by definition misfits, aren't they?  But ""an adventure with scientists"" would have told me that this is no ordinary pirate movie.So despite the efforts of the promoters of this movie to made it look like a totally moronic waste of time, I ended up taking my two boys to the theater to see it one day when there was nothing much to do, one of the kids and I are suffering from seasonal allergies, and mom wants us out of the house.

"Ben Shapiro is a true hero of our times.

Only these mass brainwashing moguls aren't wizards, they're just people with certain gifts who sometimes just happened to be in the right place at the right time, so they get to live in the lap of luxury all their lives while encoding their worldview in little weekly tele-plays that untold millions have become addicted to over two generations.The analysis of dozens of TV shows that I'm old enough to be familiar with is fascinating, and the historical trace of how the TV uber elite manipulators of millions came into power is equally so.

"And yet there's something strangely compelling about movies made this way.  Maybe it's seeing how epic they are trying to be with obviousely limited financing.  This is the way cheap sci-fi movies of our era are made, and how do they compare with the really cheap sci-fi movies of the 1950's?  I'd say this movie is better than at least some of them.  I would advise watching it without any additional out-of-pocket expense, and late at night after you're too brain-dead to do anything else, including watching a more challenging and substantive movie.

"The artwork and drawings are great, but the instructions -- though verbose -- lack a complete and explicit example of an entire round (or ""day"" or whatever) of gameplay.  Also, I watched the half-hour video by the games creators, and it was not complete either.  The did not show the ""drafting"" stage but rather just talked about it, so I still haven't seen how this works, so after reading the instructions and watching a half-hour video, I still don't know precisely how to play the game.What I do know is that there are a myriad of different combinations of point scoring possible, and that one must continually be counting and recounting points with every card played, and many cards can be played per meal (or ""round"" to translate to normal-card-game-speak).  To make matters worse, many of the cards' unique instructions are not precise about what they are supposed to do, as I learned through watching the video.  Did the creators of this game bother to test it on people who don't work for their own company?This is just like true geeks, so self-absorbed with their own cleverness and creativity that they cannot perceive any need to put themselves in the place of someone who doesn't already know what they know and start from the very beginning.  Nice puns and artwork, but a tedious game most suited to accountants who love food.Thankfully my son and I dumbed the game down a bit (removed some complexity) so that we created a fun version for ourselves to play without so much counting and recounting of points with every card played.

"First of all, congratulations to the design team that finished the job on the venerable apple slicer.  The plastic piece that you push after you flip over the slicer really does push the apple out of the slicer.  Amazing it took so long for someone to figure this out.That said, there are two design flaws that may haunt you after you get over that giddy feeling of total apple slicing control.  First, the slicing blades are made of sheet metal that are folded in at the ""core"" of the slicer, creating numerous small openings for apple particles to lodge in ways that are very difficult to clean, except with a toothbrush.  Second the little corners of the slicing blades are exposed around the outer perimeter of the metal slicing assembly.  They are very sharp.  If this utensil is grabbed the wrong way, perhaps out of a sink full of dirty dishes, the potential for a nasty cut is there and could easily happen in my opinion.

"I had some experience with web design and Dreamweaver some 10-12 years ago, and needed to refresh my knowledge and bring it up to date when it comes to HTML5 and use of CSS. There are two major books on the current version of Dreamweaver, ""The Missing Manual"" and this one. I read both. I found some advantages and disadvantages in both, but overall I found that ""The Missing Manual"" is superior and is a better value for time and money.The Murach's book has a great idea behind it: it is written concisely, but not excessively so. It is half way between a tutorial and a reference book. There is always a page-long explanation of the subject on the left-hand side and screenshots with a brief summary on the right-hand side, sometimes with extra details. So you end up reading about the subject and then reading the summary one more time. I found it is a great way to memorize the material. There is an effort to provide details which are important and useful in practice (one example is a brief but clear explanation how to make a drop-down menu with CSS). At the end of each chapter, there is a list of keywords which were introduced and a relatively short exercise. Exercise files can be downloaded from the internet.The book does not go as deeply into details as ""The Unofficial Manual"", and it is not quite as targeted at readers at lower level. There are some things which are covered in ""The Unofficial Manual"" and not covered in the Murach's. There are subjects which Murach's explains better, largely because Murach's always has to explain each subject on one page or less.  The Murach's book requires a higher level of knowledge of HTML and CSS than ""The Unofficial Manual"", maybe on low intermediate level. The Missing Manual is accessible to anyone, including beginners.It is easier to use the Murach's book as a reference than The Missing Manual because it has a more transparent structure, which everything broken into small sections, 2 pages each, and table of contents is very detailed and specific.Unfortunately, the execution did not quite follow the idea. The editing job of the book is positively not up to the mark. To begin with, this book was written about the earlier version of CC,and then updated to CC2014. This versions have differences in user interface, e.g., different buttons, etc. However, many screenshots were not updated, and text oftentimes refers to the older version of  Dreamweaver. The result - you look at your screen, do not see what you are supposed to see, and have to figure it out, somehow.  The editor clearly started ""running out of steam"" (or out of time) by the time he or she reached the second half of the book because instructions in tutorials become increasingly unclear and when you follow them, nothing works. Depending your your mindset, you can either consider this a challenge and figure it out yourself, or just get frustrated and call it a poor editing work.Likewise, references to resources outside of Dreamweaver are oftentimes outdated. For example, reference to Adobe's Business Catalyst should not be there because Adobe discontinued that service quite a while ago. Several references to third party applications are also dated and probably migrated into this version of the book from versions prior to CC.The bottom line, both of these books are good and in many aspects complement each other. It is good to read both. However, I would rate The Missing Manual 5 starts, and Murach's 4 stars. If I had to chose which book to buy and could buy only one, I would buy The Missing Manual.The last comment: at the time of this writing (June 2015), Dreamweaver CC 2015 has been announced. It is not a major update, but there are quite a few changes and improvements, including changes to user interface and fluid grid design. We should expect that both of these books will be updated by the end of summer to cover CC 2015. Hopefully, Murach's will be better edited in the new revision.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYI9J5A8K63H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1890774774#wasThisHelpful","RYI9J5A8K63H","A2J9NEE5C5D2AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9NEE5C5D2AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"People not familiar with the various Festool dust extractors may get confused what this extractor is and what it is for. It is designed primarily to be used with Festool drywall sander, the Planex. It is the only Festool dust extractor which is not HEPA certified. In its standard mode of operation, it is used with 1 micron filter and without a dust collection bag (because the bag can get clogged with the drywall dust). Instead, one uses a plastic liner (which costs the same as the bag; it is a plastic bag shaped as the dust bag, but open at the top). Auto-clean mechanism shakes the dust off the 1 micron filter and into the liner every few seconds. The cleaning mechanism is not just mechanical shaking of the filter, it is some tricky way of creating differential pressure which creates a shock wave through the whole vacuum, but it works just the same. While one can in theory use regular dust extractors for small jobs with hand sanders, the amount of nasty drywall dust which can be created by the Planex is too high for a regular dust extractor to cope with and requires this extractor. If one uses a regular dust extractor, its bag may get clogged too soon, plus small dust particles may clog and ""kill"" the pricey HEPA filter.With some additional investments, one can use this vacuum as a regular dust extractor for woodworking, just as any other Festool extractor. Bags from a regular, non-autoclean CT36 fit (by the way, one even gets one bag with the new CT 36 AC). One can swap the included 1 um filter with a HEPA filter from CT36 (they are exactly the same size) to improve small dust collection efficiency (but this would not make the vacuum HEPA certified for lead mitigation jobs; it probably would pass the certification, but Festool has not gotten it tested and certified this way). Finally, the vacuum hose which comes with CT36-AC is specifically designed for the planex (has a locking ring at its end) and will not work with the handtools which require hose end to slide into the dust port. It would work with some tools which require a hose to slide OVER the dust port. So you will likely need a new hose. Any Festool hose would plug into this extractor.  Once you get this all, you can turn the autoclean off (it cannot be used with a HEPA filter, and does not need to be used with the bag), and you will end up with a regular dust extractor which works exactly as CT-36 (minus formal HEPA certification).Due to a difference in price compared to a regular CT 36, it makes sense to buy this vacuum ONLY if you own a drywall sander, or plan to buy one in a not-so-distant future. CT 36 AC has no extra features, other than drywall dust autoclean, which would make it more beneficial or more economical for regular woodworking. In contrast, it lacks some accessories required or beneficial for woodworking (see the list above).Finally, size-wise, CT-36 is quite large. In my mind, it may make sense to use such large extractor only in a professional workshop. For home use, it is too large, in my opinion. It has exactly the same suction as a smaller CT-26, and almost the same suction as the compact and handy MIDI. It just has a much larger dust container, but bags for it are also more expensive, so it is only the matter of how often one needs to swap bags. No real cost savings coming from the size. In Europe, one can get CT 26 AC, but in the North America we are not blessed with a smaller/cheaper extractor with the autoclean feature.I own a MIDI, two CT-26, and a CT 36 AC. Once I am done with my home remodeling project, I will probably sell the Planex along with CT 36 AC and will buy another MIDI instead. With Planex, however, it is invaluable and, as reported by professional drywall contractors on various forums, is very robust and efficient for what it was designed for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35JBADIDZI1FZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007H9B8F8#wasThisHelpful","R35JBADIDZI1FZ","A2J9NEE5C5D2AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9NEE5C5D2AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These stretches are nothing like what you have seen before. They only look similar to what you know as stretches.In order to understand the purpose, meaning, and value of these stretches, you should look at this book in a historic perspective. The author, Bob Cooley (B.C.), was unfortunate to get into a major accident which lead to a long path of recovery and regaining flexibility limited by consequences of the trauma. In the book, he describes his path of exploration of stretches and their relationships to the Chinese medicine, yoga, and spiritual world. This is an evolving knowledge. At the time when the book was written, B.C. knew from his personal experience and experience of his clients that his stretches work, but he could not quite explain why. In the 10+ years since this book was written, the understanding of what they do and why they work has increased significantly. His web site contains more details on this and (for a fee) offers access to videos with (at the time of this writing) of 197 stretches (compared to 36 stretches described in the book). The book is a great introduction but not the complete story.HOW THESE STRETCHES ARE DIFFERENT. B.C.'s stretches are not something that you likely saw before. They are resistance stretches. In order to achieve a resistance stretch, you go through the range of motion of a fully tensioned (contracted) muscle. For example, if you wanted to stretch your biceps, you would bend your arm in the elbow (all the way, to the position with the wrist almost touching your shoulder), would tension your biceps as hard as you can (as if you wanted to bend your arm in the elbow even more), and would use your other hand (or an assistant) to gradually and slowly extend your biceps against its resistance. You do not need to go to the fully extended position, and you never reach the condition of the ""pull"" on the fully extended muscle known from traditional stretches. It is not about reaching the limit of the muscle's range of motion or pulling the muscle to make it longer, it is about creating a lot of tension within the muscle within its comfortable range and stretching this contracted muscle against its resistance. As an added benefit, you can combine stretching with strength training as you contract a muscle and counteract this force at the same time.HOW DO THESE STRETCHES WORK. This was not covered in the book, but is discussed on B.C.'s web site. The trick is in the part of our body known as ""dense fascia"". This notion was totally unknown in the world of fitness and exercise until some 6-8 years ago. Now, there are even annual international symposia on fascia, and many training schools known as ""fascia stretching"" or ""facial stretching"". Just Google for them. Fascia is a connecting tissue which forms a network in our body which also envelopes our muscles. It is strong and flexible and it is an important part of our body which keeps it connected and strong. Fascia has many forms and ""faces"" and is a very complex medical / anatomy subject. For the purpose of stretching, dense fascia formed within our muscles is important. As we age and as we accumulate consequences of microtraumas, overuse, and injuries, deep fascia starts growing between the fibers of our muscles. It prevents the fibers from sliding freely along each other and both, reduces the length of the muscles, and reduces their ability to contract. This leads to a reduced flexibility. This type of fascia has no sensitivity associated with it. It is also much stronger than our muscle tissue and very hard to stretch. When we put our body (e.g., leg) in a stretch position, reach the limit of the range of motion, but feel no usual ""pull"" sensation in any muscle as we try to go further, it means that this motion is limited by dense fascia. When we have asymmetries in flexibility in our body, there is also a good chance that a past injury to a certain muscle resulted in preferential growth of dense facia in one muscle of muscle group on one side of our body. Traditional stretches will fail because dense fascia is too strong to be stretched by traditional means. In fact, it is 2 to 8 times stronger than the muscle fibers (which traditional stretching techniques focus on). Resistance stretches use the huge strain inside of the contracted muscle while it is stretched and extended against its resistance to dislodge and break apart this detrimental dense fascia and get rid of the scar tissue. Traditional stretches do not work against dense fascia (and consequently do not work at all if you are limited by dense fascia) because the stretching force which can be safely used in traditional stretches of relaxed muscles is not sufficient to break apart the dense fascia in your muscle. You can pull strong enough only when you contract your muscle.While dense fascia can grow anywhere and can affect any of our muscles, our legs (especially upper legs) tend to accumulate the most of dense fascia.  This is why lower back and legs, especially in people past their teen-age or after minor or major injuries, could greatly improve in flexibility when resistance stretches are used.The only other way to reduce tissue density and affect fascia (that I know of) is foam rolling. Dean Somerset has excellent lectures on how fascia impacts our mobility and how to handle fascia related issues through form rolling.HOW THESE STRETCHES ARE SIMILAR TO OTHER TECHNIQUES. Only visually. Yoga exists for thousands of years, and Yoga asanas evolved to put our body in a position which enables us to maximally elongate certain muscles along their path from contracted to extended. Traditional stretching drills overlap with many yoga poses. B.C.'s stretches oftentimes use same or similar positions, but the action is completely opposite to what you would do in Yoga. Also, complex Yoga asanas are not used in B.C. techniques. Many yoga poses put you in a position in which you just can't contract your muscles enough, which contradicts the idea of resistance stretching. Most beginner and intermediate stretches are easy enough for everyone.ASSISTED STRETCHES. The book has a total of 36 stretches. The web site has a total of 197 stretches, 31 of which are assisted. In regular stretching, assisted stretches are risky because the muscles are held at their extension limit and too much pull from the assistant (who has no immediate feedback and do you feel the level of pain in your muscles) may lead to injury. With resistance stretching, the muscles are not extended to their limit, the majority of stretch happens in the beginning when muscle is contracted, and assistance is safe. Your assistant only exerts force when you resist and he feels how much you resist. Since assisted stretches enable one to generate more tension in the muscle than you can do on your own, they are considered very efficient. However, there are plenty of stretches (the majority of them) which one can do on his own.  Out of 197 stretches on thegeniusofflexibility web site, only 16% are assisted.CONNECTION TO THE EMOTIONAL WORLD. B.C. discovered that when he gets his muscles through their range of motion in fully tensioned condition, the energy dissipated in the muscle and the effort creates effect similar to point massage or acupuncture. It stimulates the energy meridians known for thousands of years from traditional Chines medicine. The effect is even greater than in Yoga or traditional stretches. While it is not the ultimate purpose (flexibility is), B.C. wants his students to be aware of these connections. He personally values them so much that he even groups the stretches not by the muscles which they stretch but by the associated energy meridians. The first thing which I experienced when I started doing his energy series was not the flexibility change but immediate and remarkably pronounced reduction of craving for food and sugars and weight loss. I did not believe any of this emotional/mental stuff, and was shocked to find out that it actually worked.The idea that stretches can affect energy meridians is not entirely new. For example, Shiatsu uses massage and stretches (some of which match stretches in B.C.'s system) to stimulate points along the energy meridians to affect health condition and well being of a person who is not medically sick yet, but out of balance, energetically speaking.WHAT DOES THE TITLE MEAN? ""The genius of flexibility"" is not the name which B.C. calls himself (and it is not his picture on the front page), despite the impression which some of the reviewers of this book who flipped though the pages think. B.C. associated 16 energy meridians with certain personality types, certain traits of character, which are present in different degree in all people and can be developed. He calls these types of character ""geniuses"". Since resistance stretches provide a way to impact all of them to a certain degree, by helping our body to develop the desirable features, he puts flexibility sort of on top of this system, as a unifying factor, and calls it the 17th genius, ""the genius of flexibility"". This is a reference to our ability to be flexible.COMMON MISUNDERSTANDINGS. You need to read the book carefully and, if you can, watch the videos on the web site to understand how these stretches work. You do not go to the end of range of your muscles. You do not feel the usual ""pull"" on the muscles. But you need to generate as much tension in your muscle during the stretch as you can. It is difficult to achieve on first attempt. You've got to continue practicing the stretches for at least a couple of weeks to get the feeling of what developing this full tension means. It is not difficult, it just totally opposite to the traditional idea of stretches in which one needs to relax the muscle instead of contracting it as hard as one can. The harder you contact and the stronger is the resistance, the more efficient is the stretch.  It is very easy to do the wrong thing (or rather not do what you are supposed to do) if you try any of B.C.;s stretches without knowing what you need to do, or if you apply your ""standard"" understanding how stretches work and just go through the range without resistance.Some people dismiss this school because B.C. claims that stretches could cure certain health conditions. There is some truth in it, but only partial. Resistance stretches can cure to the same extent as acupuncture or point massage can. It is the same as homeopathy. It may be able to help with some persistent but not life threatening conditions which are annoyance to you. But it does not replace medical treatment in serious situations. B.C. claims that he was able to stop development of appendicitis and avoided surgery. This was his personal experience, he does not push it on other people and does not promote in the book that everyone should do stretches instead of going to a doctor.SIMILAR SCHOOLS AND SOURCE OF INFORMATION. ""Fascia stretching"", ""Facial stretching"", and ""Resistance Stretching"" mean more or less the same thing (or at least the same basic idea), and it is a quickly developing way of thinking about stretching. Still a minority, but growing rapidly. You can get on Amazon two DVDs with Dara Torres who is B.C.'s student and follows his school. I watched the first DVD in that series, it has a good explanation on how the stretches should be done. You can also find some videos on the internet using these key words. These videos may be of certain value. However, B.C. remains the ""father"" of this stretching technique, with more experience than anyone else. As I mentioned before, there are connections to traditional Chinese medicine and shiatsu when it comes to energy meridians.SHOULD I USE IT? I got the impression that it is a great addition to any stretching routine. If you are limited by dense fascia, no traditional stretching will help you. This is the best source of information available. In contrast, if you do not have too much dense fascia related mobility restrictions (which especially applies to younger people), you may find that yoga or traditional stretching is as efficient or (I think but do not know for sure) maybe even more efficient. By any means, this book is about a unique stretching method which can be complementary to anything else that you are doing, but does not overlap with or duplicate any of these traditional stretching methods.OVERALL OPINION AND SOME WEAKNESSES OF THE BOOK. It is a very honestly and personally written book. A very interesting read on its own. Quite inspiring.  Plenty of ""food for thought"". Makes you think about a bigger picture. Worth a read regardless of whether you will use these stretches or not.It is has some weaknesses, either real or conceived. Many people, myself included, get the impression that personal views on life and emotional impact of stretches and the model of 16 meridians / geniuses overshadow the discussion of basics (stretches). B.C. could've described the stretches better. He probably could've explain what they are for much clearer if he had written this book last year and not in 2005. The system has evolved quite a bit beyond the book, as one can see from his web site. Everything in the book holds true, but there is much more to it than the book covers. However, the book is a necessary start to learn the system, and the only available in print comprehensive source of information on resistance stretches. Weaknesses of the book in the area of description of stretches can be compensated by the explanations on geniusofflexibility, in videos available on B.C.'s web site and to some (smaller) extent in Dara Torres's DVDs.Another aspect which many people find inconvenient is that all stretches are categorized by the associated energy meridians rather than by muscle groups which they stretch. It goes against the traditional way of looking at stretches. The reason for this is the importance of the energy flow sequence in B.C.'s ""world"". It appears that he thinks not in terms of the muscles, but in terms of the energy meridians in the upper and lower body. The irony is his trainers featured on the videos on his web site do make regular references to specific muscle groups along with the energy meridians, probably because they recognize that for most people it is easier to think that way. Web site does contain lookup charts to link stretches to muscle groups. So, the idea of references to the muscles does fit into his school, but did not find place in the book. It is confusing, at least initially. Not only you are not expected to feel the usual ""pulling"" sensation during the stretch because you do not actually pull the muscle at its extension limit, but also noone tells you what muscles you are stretching (or removing dense facia from). It is not difficult to figure out, though. After 2-3 weeks, the logic falls back in place. One realizes that the links between muscle groups are so complex that one has to go through all muscle groups anyways (or at least upper and lower body groups), and classification by the meridians makes it much more manageable. There are 16 meridians, which limits the number of stretches which one needs to do to cover the whole body to a reasonable number which can be accomplished within 35-45 minutes. Imagine what you would have to do if you had to stretch each of 100 muscles one at a time referring to each of them by its name and how long it would take? Meridians have a fairly good association with a certain location on your body (e.g., front of the thigh, front-outside, front-inside, inside, outside, etc.) and are easy to use with some practice.P.S. I am not a convert or a devoted follower of Bob Cooley and I never met him in person. I am experimenting with several methods in parallel, including Yoga, Pilates, and Paul Zaichik's kinesiological stretching method. I read books written by other well known flexibility experts, like Pavel Tsatsouline and Thomas Kurz. They are all different (distinctively different, if you read in depth) and I see value in each of them.  But I do believe that this method must be an integral component to any efficient flexibility program because it addresses the limiting factors which no other program does. Five star rating is well deserved in this case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V6R0F2739CCE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743270878#wasThisHelpful","R2V6R0F2739CCE","A2J9NEE5C5D2AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9NEE5C5D2AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a 28 minutes long basic stretching routine. This DVD is a part of the ""age-defying workout series"", and it is definitely meant to be lame. It uses no props, does not put you in any yoga-like positions, and does not suggest that stretches be held for extended time. It is a decent routine for elderly people. Everyone can do all stretches from this class, regardless of the flexibility level. It probably will not make you much more flexible, but at least will keep you energized.Since I am only around 50, I found this routine too easy and a little boring. I went through it once and I doubt that I will get back to it any time soon. However, I can see how it can work well for some people.The quality of video is average at best.

"Did they really have to make it so small? I bought it with the only purpose - to be able to connect 4 thumb drives to my TV. The plan was to save my fitness videos by category to 4 separate USB flash drives and switch between them as needed. This would enable me to overcome the limitations ob the built-in player in my TV (it can see only a small number of files on a drive). Guess what? The distance between the 4 connectors is so short that USB sticks do not fit next to each other. One can only plug in 4 USB cables, but not 4 USB drives.

"We picked it up at the local Harbor Freight Tools store for $12.99. Usually, one can find a 20% off coupon in flyers that come in mail (which would get the HFT price down to $10.39) but we did not have it this time. This is a very basic piece of equipment, two plastic parts, a spring, and a switch inside. You plug in your tool into the pedal, plug the (fairly long) cord from the pedal into 120 Volts, press the pedal, and the tool runs as long as your foot is on the pedal. Very useful attachment which makes work with various tools which do not have a power switch right at the tip of your fingers a little safer.The drawback is that it is a kind of ""do it yourself"" kit. The bottom of this pedal is a slippery plastic, and the pedal slides under your foot. I am not the first who noted it, and the solution is well known - screw it to a piece of plywood. The pedal has two eyelets for the screws to do just that. I do not know why they did not simply attach a piece of rubber to the bottom. This would prevent slippage just the same. Anyhow, you buy the pedal, then find a suitable piece of plywood, screws, ""do your homework"", and then happily use it.This was the reason why I ranked it three stars. It is OK, but I prefer things which I can use without having to modify them straight from the box to make them useable.The good part is that one cannot beat the HFT price. This is one of these super simple things which one can buy at Harbor Freight without worrying too much about traditional for HFT low end design and low-end-made-in-china-grade built quality.  It is so basic that it is hard to make it wrong, and even if it does not last long, it is just a little over ten dollars at any HFT store in the neighborhood, so not a big loss.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QJ7UGBDGK08K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LJ6KUK#wasThisHelpful","R1QJ7UGBDGK08K","A2J9NEE5C5D2AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9NEE5C5D2AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here in the US we are not ""blessed"" with a wide selection of saw blades compatible with European sizing (in this case, 30 mm arbor and 260 mm in diameter). To my knowledge (even though I can be wrong), only Oshlun makes compatible blades. Festool makes excellent quality blades which cut cleanly and stay sharp very long, but with Festool's policy of fixing prices in the US market, they are also extremely expensive because they are always sold at MSRP and no dealer is allowed to offer discounts. Pretty much like Apple products. A single blade for Kapex from Festool costs about 3 times more than the Oshlun blade. It is probably not 3 times better, but some people believe that Festool blades are better.  For the cost reason, many owners chose to send their Festool blades for sharpening to local blade sharpening shops instead of buying new ones. In case you want to have spare blades, buying this set is a good way to cut down the cost of the new original blades.Owners of non-Festool saws should remember that there is a good possibility (almost certainty) that these blades will not fit their arbor and will not be the right size.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYRHFVKWA0SSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MYR1EK#wasThisHelpful","RYRHFVKWA0SSJ","A2J9NEE5C5D2AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9NEE5C5D2AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a small adapter... which just does what it is supposed to do. There is not much to say or to add to what was already written... Except, perhaps, a comment that it can be used two ways. Bosch non-electrostatic 35 mm hose comes with a connector that has the same end as Festool 27 mm hose. With either these two hoses, you stick the narrow part of this adapter into the 1 1/4"" dust port on your tool, and stick the connector of your vacuum hose inside of the wider (larger diameter) side of the adapter. It works quite well, and friction fit allows one to disconnect the tool, adapter, and the hose easily.With Festool 35 mm hose, which comes with a larger diameter connector, you can use the tapered shape of this adapter to your advantage and still use it if you flip it and slide the wide part of the adapter on top of your 1 1/4"" port, and then slide the 35 mm Festool connector over the narrow part and on top of the wide part of the connector.  In this configuration, the narrow part of the adapter goes into your vacuum hose connector, and the wide part is used as a spacer of sorts. It is not how this adapter was meant to be used, but for what it is worth, it works.I like it better than Fein 921072 adapter which can be used for the same purpose.Obviously, only those who use vacuums with hoses that are made to European metric standards (which would be Bosch, Fein, and Festool dust extractors) might need this adapter. It is of no use for owners of shop vacuums purchased at the local hardware store. They need an adapter which is made to ASE units standards.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AAHR0A5ZZ4AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AV77S#wasThisHelpful","R2AAHR0A5ZZ4AH","A2J9NEE5C5D2AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9NEE5C5D2AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One should think about this cutter as a specialized router bit with a fancy screw-on shank.  This puts its pricing in the right ballpark for ""comparable"" router bits. The tip of the cutter is very hard carbide, the same type that can be found on good router bits. The trick about this bit / tool is that it not only rotates, but also oscillates If oscillating bit hits hard surface (even wood) before it can cut it, the power of the tool may break it. It is very important to make sure that the Domino is stable and held firmly before engaging the cutter. In the very beginning, as I was learning to use the Domino and was on my 10th or 15th mortise, I made the mistake of pushing the cutter in before the domino was firmly in place and was still moving relatively to the work piece. A little extra torque on the oscillating cutter broke off its tip in no time. I learned from this experience and made adjustments to my work flow: I push the cutter in slowly, move it out of mortise also slowly, and make sure that the Domino is firmly in place before cutting and cannot move while I am pushing in the cutter. One has to learn to separate the functions of the left hand (which holds the Domino in the position) and the right hand (which engages the cutter).  With this, after 350+ mortises in maple, it still cuts as new. Very sharp, very long lasting. By the way, it arrives in a nice plastic container similar to those in which Freud router bits are shipped.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NWK4Q1RSKP2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017V9H1E#wasThisHelpful","R3NWK4Q1RSKP2G","A2J9NEE5C5D2AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9NEE5C5D2AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use this hose to connect my Kapex to CT26; initially, I used it to connect it to my RIdgid vacuum and bought this hose because Festool hose was not in the budget at that time. Now, with the knowledge of its limitations, I probably would not go the cheap route.On the vacuum end, it has a friction connector which happens to be universal size across US and Europe (it is a conical friction fit connector, and 2"" in US happen to be within 0.8 mm from 50 mm in Europe, the difference being small enough to be absorbed by the conical design of the connector). It fits into US vacuums with a friction fit (most Shop Vacs), or could be connected to the end of the hose from my Ridgid vacuum with a 2"" connector from a Home Depot which looks like a short piece of 2"" pipe. It goes right into all Festool dust extractors (including CT26 and Midi) as well.On the other end, it has a connector which has limited compatibility with Festool, and you should mind the differences if you decide to buy this hose to use with Festool. It is very similar to the connectors which 27 mm Festool hoses ship with, but it is shorter (or rather, its diameter increases sooner than on Festool connectors). Consequently, it would not fit into HL850 planer dust port (it is not long enough to lock inside of the port). Note that all Festool 36 mm hoses have connectors which go on top of the dust port - this one, however, has a 27-mm like connector and has to go inside of the Kapex port, thus creating a bottle neck - a narrow opening in the air way. Finally, even though it might slide onto 27 mm dust ports of sanders or other portable tools, the hose is too large and heavy to replace the 27 mm Festool hose. The solution to make it work at its best with the Kapex, and to make it work with HL850 planer, is to buy ""Festool 487721 Hose Sleeve, Reducing Sleeve For Antistatic D 36 Hose"" and replace Bosch connector with a proper Festool connector. It is very easy to install, the hose screws right into it - just note that you have to rotate the hose clockwise to get it out, and counterclockwise to get it in (which is just the opposite to what you would assume). After that, it becomes a non-electrostatic hose just as Festool non-electrostatic hose.This Bosch hose is nominally rated 35 mm, whereas Festool claims that its hoses are 36 mm, but my experience shows that Festool connector fits Bosch hose.SUMMARY: Can be used to connect Kapex to Festool dust extractors or US vacuums, but connector is narrower than on Festool hoses of the same diameter. Does not work with the Planer at all. Not convenient to use with Festool portable tools (the hose is on the large and heavy side). Festool 36 mm connector can be purchased and installed instead of the Bosch connector, which makes it fully matching Festool non-electrostatic hose, but this shrinks the price gap with Festool non-electrostatic hose to the level at which one can as well buy a Festool hose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTB0FSRJSTPOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AV78B#wasThisHelpful","RTB0FSRJSTPOU","A2J9NEE5C5D2AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9NEE5C5D2AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fairly rare example of a very useful, but under-engineered Festool accessory. Since most people who own Festool tools are usually fairly well equipped, it does not take long to modify it to make it the way it should had been made, but it is aggravating to get a ""do-it-yourself"" kit for this price. This is an attachment to OF1010 router which provides a wider area of support and an additional handle for the router. This comes extremely handy when working on edges of the work pieces, e.g., rounding them with roundover bits, or when routering a groove (dado) close to the edge. The purpose of it is to add stability. It consists of a guide stop (the part which glides on a rail) and a fiberglass base. One can attach it with rods (not included with this part, but included with OF1010), but this setup would not work with an edge guide (rods are not long enough). The only way to make it work with the edge guide is to remove the fiberglass runner from the bottom of OF1010 and attach this extension table with screws. This where one runs into a problem - the original runner is attached with 6 screws, whereas this part has only 2 holes predrilled for the screws (you cannot see them on the picture, but they are there, near the top edge), and fiberglass is too thin to keep the router firm and steady when it is attached only at the outside edge. So the first thing you do, you drill 4 more holes for screws to properly attach it  to the router. With this, it works way better. Then, depending on the diameter of your router, you drill a larger hole in the center since the table comes with a quite small hole. After that you wish you had a set with several diameters of holes for different bit diameters, or perhaps a hole of the diameter which matches cover ring, just as in the standard runner. I actually contacted Festool and asked if fiberglass part is available as a spare part - and was told ""no"".In my opinion, a well engineered part would have 6 holes pre-drilled for mounting (instead of just 2), and would be offered as a set of 3 fiberglass parts with different diameters of holes and one guide stop.Otherwise, it is a great attachment which immensely improves stability of the router.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R92FVYTWT0NUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KN3TXE#wasThisHelpful","R92FVYTWT0NUC","A2J9NEE5C5D2AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9NEE5C5D2AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It does what it is supposed to do. It is a replacement blade for Festool HL850 planer, for the smooth (flat) cutterhead. Don't get confused by its slightly curved shape - since the surface of the blade is not parallel to the axis of the cutterhead, the 3D geometry plays out in such a funny way that the blade has to be slightly curved in order to cut along a flat surface when installed. The material appears to be a very hard but brittle high carbon steel or carbide. Hitting a nail with this blade will leave a deep dent or might even chip off a significant part of the edge (don't ask me how I learned this). (I kept a Makita planer with HSS blades for the case if I need to flatten a floor or studs where there is a risk of hitting a nail - with Festool blades, it is just too expensive as you basically need a new blade after each encounter with a nail).Festool planers use a single blade, not two blades as other brands, so the price of this one is not much higher than the cost of carbide blades for other brands. Due to its shape, it fits only Festool, and only Festool blades fit Festool planer.If you own a Festool planer, you know what it is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAHJSM96BEA4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001U343YA#wasThisHelpful","RAHJSM96BEA4U","A2J9NEE5C5D2AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9NEE5C5D2AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used these bits to make maple trim pieces for my stairs using OF1010 router. Very nice bits, cut maple without effort and leave behind very smooth finish, both when cutting along the grain and across the grain. The box feels like economy grade plastic, but it is perfectly adequate for storage. I really liked storage in a foam insert because getting bits out of tightly fitting holes in wooden containers (e.g., a set which I got from a Chinese brand Woodland USA) or plastic (Freud - nice bits, nice looking individual bit boxes, but hard to get sharp bits out) can be a challenge. The bits arrived coated with protective layer of thin gel/plastic type compound which was easy to remove (no sticky oily substance as on cheaper brands). Beading set of smaller bearings is a plus, even though I did not need them.The advantage of having 5 different sizes in a set was that I could make samples using each of the bits, and then my wife and I decided what would work best.

"This scaffolding is designed to be an easy to transport, easy to assemble unit for basic interior repairs or paint jobs. However, it is so poorly designed that I cannot understand how someone can rate it five stars.My story is that I have 12 ft and 17 ft ceilings in several rooms which I had to paint. I thought that scaffolding could be a good idea, and a stack-able scaffolding would enable me to reach the ceiling easily. Just to be on the safe side, I started by ordering one scaffolding and a set of guard rails, with the intention to buy the second scaffolding later, after I paint the 12 ft ceiling.The delivery was quick, the unit arrived nicely packaged with just a few minor shipping or factory damages which make no difference. Assembly process was very easy. The first thing that I noticed is that this thing is designed and built with huge tolerances. Round tubes go into square tubes with large (1/8"" to 1/4"") clearances. This enables the low end Chinese factory produce these scaffoldings in a way that all elements fit together without any special requirements to precision or quality control. The downside is that nothing is firm, all components wobble within quite significant range. My first task was to set it to 5-6 feet height. I assembled it and climbed on it using a ladder. The thing was so wobbly that I could not stand up on it. Luckily, I had matching guardrails in my garage, purchased separately, with the idea of using them on stacked scaffolding. Well, guardrails wobble just as much as the scaffolding itself: when fully inserted, they can easily tilt by about 15 degrees in either direction. I ended up using a rope to tie them to the scaffold. This made them fairly sturdy. With this setup in place, I could stand on the scaffolding and work off it, but never felt comfortable.In contrast, when I lowered it to about 2 feet from the floor to work on windows, the scaffolding was remarkably stable and convenient.After the first experience, I dropped the idea of buying the second scaffolding and stacking them. I hated standing on a wobbly scaffolding at 5-6 feet level, and I totally did not want to experience the same or more wobbliness when I am at 12 feet. I ended up using a long pole with a paint brush or paint roller to reach the ceiling.On the positive side, wheels are large and sturdy; the scaffolding is easy to roll around when wheel locks are disengaged. Wheel locks are a little hard to disengage, but overall locks work well.  The unit is easy to assemble and disassemble and each individual part is relatively light. And it is cheap - it costs about as much to buy as to rent it for a week at a local home improvement center.It is rated, I believe, at 800 Lbs, which I kind of doubt, considering the fact that the frame of the platform bent someone near one side from my weight (which is a little over 200 Lbs). I can easily see this thing breaking apart and folding under full load.In the end, this scaffolding helped me to do my paint job, but there was not a moment when I enjoyed or simply liked working on it. It was more like: ""it is my only option short of using ladders, I have to climb on this thing now, but I hope I will not have to do it again"".There are three variety of such ""baker style"" scaffolding, sold under the names of Pro-Series GSSI, Werner, and Metaltech. They cost about the same, and look so remarkably similar that one can guess that they all produced in the same factory in China, with just a few minor modifications. For example, Metaltech sells with extra pins to lock the platform in place for safety, while this one does not. I ended up ordering such pins separately from Amazon.In summary, a scaffolding may come handy when reaching high ceiling, but one has to realize what it is and be prepared to stand on a very shaky ""ground"". I cannot imagine how someone can use it at 6 ft height setting without guardrails. In contrast, if one needs a low platform (e.g., 2-3 feet) to work on relatively low (i.e., standard) ceiling (e.g., install drywall), at low height it is way less wobbly and can be used with confidence and without guardrails.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RONMHIHB5HB09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001YIV0G#wasThisHelpful","RONMHIHB5HB09","A2J9NEE5C5D2AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9NEE5C5D2AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is an incredible synergy of music mixed in surround sound and 3D computer generated videos of imaginary worlds, all perfectly blended together. I cannot decide for myself which of the three albums is better. The 3D is one of the best I've seen, the surround mix is one of richest I've heard, the colors are beautiful, and the music is very pleasing.

"It attaches to Makita KP0800K planer with one screw and replaces the existing nozzle (which is nothing but dust reflector). Planer connected to a vacuum works way, way better than planer which ejects dust on the floor (with the exception of cases when you work outside). I am puzzled why it was not a standard part of the kit.Diameter of the nozzle follows metric standard using in Europe (or Japan), it is 50 mm outside diameter (slightly less than 2 inches). US vacuum hoses are typically 2 1/4 "" and their connectors are too large for this nozzle. In contrast, connector on my Festool 36 mm hose fits into it perfectly, it is exactly the same dust port as on the Kapex or on the HL850 planer. For those who do not own Festool vacuum / hoses, the only option is several layers of painters tape on top of the nozzle to achieve a tight fit. Adapters sold in stores are made to ASE units and do not readily fit metric sized nozzle, neither inside nor outside, although one user in the ""answers"" section reported that he was able to make one of the standard adapters work.I rated it 5 * because the planer is much more fun to work with when you are not covered with wood shavings and do not breath in wood dust, and because I could use a flexible Festool hose which I had at hand, but many other users will probably be frustrated with its sizing and mismatch with their vacuum.With this nozzle and vacuum, efficiency of dust collection is excellent. I did not compare it to Festool under all conditions (I use only Festool for any fine work), but when it comes to flattening the floor, both Makita and Festool perform the same in terms of dust collection, with the same vacuum. There are barely any shavings left on the floor.Added in July 2015: Bosch makes an adapter ""Bosch VAC003"" or ""Bosch VAC020"", for conversion of 35 mm to 1 1/4 or 2 1/2 inch hoses. These adapters can be purchased for about $7 on Amazon. Both of them can be used to connect this nozzle to a US-sized vacuum hose. Note, however, that 2 1/2"" hose is way too big and ridgid for use with a hand tool. It will be more of a struggle than a benefit. You also can buy a Bosch vacuum hose VAC0005, it is long (5 meters) and has a friction fit connector on the other end which plugs into any US-standard shop vacuum with friction connector. It is just the right size for use with a planer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V6TI0EN7F1X5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K5V4WMQ#wasThisHelpful","R3V6TI0EN7F1X5","A2J9NEE5C5D2AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J9NEE5C5D2AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I spent my 20s and much of my 30s in the gym. I loved it. I got great results. Now, after a long hiatus, I went back, in my 50s, intending to pick up where I left off, with bodybuilding. I discovered, though, that I don't have the same interest now in ""hugeing out."" In fact, when I see guys who walk around showing off their muscles, I kinda feel the way I feel when someone drives down the street in one of those tanklike cars with the windows open, blaring music. Besides, maintaining big muscles is a full-time job. So, I decided, what the hell, why not learn Olympic lifts? Sure, I should have learned them when I was fifteen but I didn't and so I'll learn them now. I have no intention of climbing on a platform and competing, I get my kicks elsewhere, but I want a workout that I can enjoy, and look forward to, that's challenging physically and mentally, and that will provide a great workout.Now, there are supplemental exercises for the Oly lifts. Plenty of them. And while there is a lot of technique in Oly lifting, you also need strength. And that's where 5-3-1 comes in. I ordered it, along with Starting Strength and few other books, and decided to start with it because it has the fewest pages, it's fairly clear, and it fits with what I'm doing. The system calls for working out 3-4 days per week, and focuses on four exercises, one of which I don't do (bench pressing) as my coach advises against it for Oly lifters, but the principles can be applied to virtually any assistance exercise--from the military press, which is covered, the squat, also covered, the deadlift, also covered, to nearly anything you care to build strength in.As a post-50 lifter, I'm considering tinkering with the reps he recommends, reducing them from three sets of five to three sets of three, particularly since strength is my goal, not hypertrophy. But so far this seems like a highly sensible program. I just started using it for military presses, front squats, and snatch grip d'lifts. I'll update the review in a few months.So I recommend this book as a good way to approach building strength. Is it the best program? There is no such thing. Every body is different. It's worth a try. And, despite some of the reviews whining about organization, I just bought the sequel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP74KU9CWMJ7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0578096366#wasThisHelpful","RP74KU9CWMJ7K","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kubik is an amazing specimen. Which is important, because he can do all that he writes about. He's set records in (natural) powerlifting events, and he's a lawyer, which suggests he's analytical. He's also over 50 and still cranking out the reps with heavy weights in Olympic lifts and the ancillary exercises. The problem with most books about weight training is that they're written for a reader in his teens or twenties. The volume and frequency of training is not geared for the post 40, post 50, or post 60 lifter. This book is. It explains the adjustments that will be helpful to avoid injury, overtraining, and burnout. It has plenty of cycles including cardio-based cycles, cycles for those who want to do a lot of Oly lifts, and cycles for those who want to keep to the standard compound movements. It's a wonderful and needed addition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29YSVOKCXQQ0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003334Y26#wasThisHelpful","R29YSVOKCXQQ0W","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book is all about classic methods and approaches to strength training that will develop strength throughout the body, with emphasis on compound movements like the squat, training the grip--which is considered essential here, and using unwieldy objects like thick bars, sandbags, beer kegs along with barbells and dumbbells. The methods have worked for the author. They will likely work for nearly anyone given enough application. The info here is hard to find elsewhere in one source and this book is a bible of strength training. THIS IS NOT BODYBUILDING. The author has contempt for bodybuilders and the exercises and methods they tend to use, and he displays it. Bodybuilders would likely enjoy some of the ideas but this is about how to lift very heavy weights. It is also not necessarily about functional strength for, say, fighting, though many of the exercises will develop that in spades. If you understand what this is and is not, and it's what you want to learn, it may be the best book on the topic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28PELZP9S6E02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006RAMBO#wasThisHelpful","R28PELZP9S6E02","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Meredith uses postures from the Cheng Man Ching tai chi form as static postures for energy cultivation. Nothing new there. What's different is his way of getting into and holding the postures, emphasizing relaxation and energy pathways. I haven't felt the rush of ecstasy he promises but will certainly keep trying. Priced to move, it's a worthwhile companion to his book, Juice, which is excellent. Meredith is a very bright guy, an MIT grad who has much to teach and deserves to be taken seriously. I thought there'd be a bit more here than there is, which is essentially the admonition to hold each posture with the very least amount of tension possible and exercises to help you do that. He does chart the energy flow, and is insightful about the body mechanics vs energetics of tai chi. Worthwhile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FI9DGURTEQCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGQ9HU4#wasThisHelpful","R3FI9DGURTEQCH","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bob Boyd claims that he learned the Yang family's insider's tai chi method, called Snake Style. I have no reason to doubt his account. This book is a presentation of that method, which boils down to several physical adjustments, all of which seem like they could be very beneficial. The problem is the explanations are not very clear and there are few drawings and fewer photos to aid the reader in grasping the adjustments. For example, Boyd writes that ""Hollowing the chest to raise the back is the steam engine that drives the tai chi train."" It's done by ""drawing the hip joints upward, the lower abdomen...inward, the ribs and thoracic vertebrae upward and backward, and the sole of the foot upward while the ball and heel press downward (rooting.)"" No drawings of incorrect versus correct posture are provided to help the reader understand what's required, which Boyd says is not a fixed posture but ""a pumping action."" No exercises are offered to help you understand how to do this.This is a somewhat lazy effort, in my view, lacking in clarity and drawings and photos that would have been most useful. It's worthwhile for the dedicated tai chi practitioner, but frustratingly unclear at times on points Boyd says are essential. It's also a bit overpriced but, as the first book I've seen to emphasize these various adjustments to how one normally performs the tai chi form, worth reading. Although it's clearly geared to the Yang style its principles could be applied to any style of tai chi.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBO0E1ITBNFFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1460932471#wasThisHelpful","RBO0E1ITBNFFB","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started learning tai chi in the late 1980s. I'm still learning it. I've had some wonderful teachers. Never have I seen, in one place, the depth and clarity and detail presented here. There is more than enough here to keep you interested and edified whether you're new to tai chi or a highly experienced practitioner. For example, the concept of coiling, which is supposedly a key part of Chen style but I've never seen it discussed, let alone emphasized, in Yang or Wu styles--here, Dr Yang puts the coiling back where it belongs. Energy flow, body mechanics, and a truly detailed presentation are all present. I do want to note that if you are used to Yang style tai chi this version might be a surprise as it is rather different in many respects from other versions I've seen; however, I find it extremely gratifying to practice though I'm still in the early stages of learning this particular version of the form. I have several of Dr Yang's books but never gravitated to them. Seeing this, I'm going to study those books. He is truly masterful and most importantly, he gives you the key to grasping the internals of this ""internal"" martial art.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R302CBZDZBQSFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006WPDKLI#wasThisHelpful","R302CBZDZBQSFL","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book teaches Olson's version of the seated Eight Pieces of Brocade. I have had little experience with that qi gong set so I can't comment on its efficacy, whereas I have experience with the standing version, and think it's great. Some books, like those by Yang Jwing Ming, teach both for the price of one, and with more clarity than Olson offers. He TRIES to explain the exercises, and most of them are simple enough that there is no problem learning them. But when movement is required, it's sometimes not possible to get a clear idea from the book and the scant photos. He has a DVD and you can see samples on his website, and that's likely clearer, but frankly I think they should be sold together or either should be sufficient. So my issue is not with the quality of the info but the clarity of the communication. He knows the theory and he knows the practice but there are books that are better for the 8 Pieces of Brocade including Yang's and Lam Kam Chuen teaches the set in The Way of Energy, but only the standing set but with great clarity.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32XTDRKJ0908O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0892819456#wasThisHelpful","R32XTDRKJ0908O","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Hand positions, feet positions, weight distributions, it's all covered, with very good explanations and good photos. Is it perfect? What is? It's also the first edition.

My copy came without page numbers--a small quibble, it was easy to put them in. I'm already looking forward to the second edition.

"An annoying but not wholly useless addition to the shelf. As another reviewer noted, the book is sloppy. Steps are left out. A recipe for Curry Chickpea Bisque tells you to rinse and soak the dried chickpeas for eight hours. Then it tells you how to cook the other ingredients and says nothing more about the chickpeas. Do I add them to the pressure cooker? Do I cook them separately? Do I drain them and eat as is? Do I sautee them? Use them in my nephew's slingshot? Come on, folks. Many recipes use the pressure cooker for only part of the ingredients, the rest are sauteed or broiled. And, weirdly, the pasta recipes call for you to pressure cook the pasta. The rest of the ingredients are usually sauteed. Now, according to the book it takes about seven minutes to pressure cook pasta. Add about five minutes for the pressure to rise and you don't have much of a time saving. Worse, I like pasta al dente. This requires frequent checking during cooking so you can get it into the colander in time. How do you do that in a pressure cooker? You can't. The book is not carefully thought out. The good news is it's inexpensive. And there are not that many vegetarian/vegan pressure cooker books. So it's okay, I wouldn't sent it back, but it's a C at best.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R199R3OKMKZWXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055X6NLW#wasThisHelpful","R199R3OKMKZWXH","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was told after an annual physical that I was on the cusp of diabetes, a disabling disease by any measure that usually requires medication, daily blood testing, etc. I turned, first, to this book, which I was familiar with, having tried to implement its recommendations once before. The regimen works. It will likely reverse heart disease, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and various other illnesses that can be cured through dietary changes and exercise. I give it four stars not five because the regimen, for me, is too strict to be practical long-term, and life long changes are what have to be made. Specifically, Furhman emphasizes leafy greens and legumes. Grains are not exactly minimized but frowned on. (In a later book, Furhman nicknames his approach for diabetics as ""greens and beans.""). I simply could not adhere to that regimen. I felt exhausted and deprived. To his great credit, Furhman lists books by other doctors in Eat To Live with similar but ""less aggressive"" approaches. Among those listed is Dr. McDougall's book, and, I think, Drs. Ornish and Esselstyn, each of whom is a leading light in the reversal of various diseases through diet. With McDougall, I hit upon the diet that, in less than two months, helped me drop 12 pounds, get my A1C out of the danger zone, drop my total cholesterol by 18 points, and reduce my LDL. I probably should review McDougall's book, and I will. But I want to say that without Furhman I might not have heard of McDougall and Esselstyn, and reading their books lead me to Forks Over Knives and a whole universe of healthy habits that have been life-changing and really delicious; I don't feel deprived. So if you can stick to Furhman's regimen, do it. If you're contemplating making the kinds of changes he prescribes, this is a great book with loads of info that will edify and inspire, but also read Ornish, McDougall, and Esselstyn, and even Pritikin, the granddaddy of 'em all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17B6W0L8EO3I1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031612091X#wasThisHelpful","R17B6W0L8EO3I1","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lawyers know that you can put an expert witness on the stand and she'll explain why the science supports a certain side and eviscerates the other, she'll likely have good credentials, etc. And she'll be answered by the other side's expert, who'll have good credentials and preach the opposite conclusion. Thus it goes with the low carb/high protein/high fat Atkins group vs the high carb/low fat/moderate protein China Study groups including Ornish, McDougall, etc.Having tried Atkins, and really having adhered to it to the point I was checking my urine with strips to ensure I was in ketosis I can tell you--anecdotally--I lost very little weight. My cholesterol shot up. Triglycerides were high. And I was cranky too. But that was MY experience, and I quit the diet because I just got grossed out with the menu. This book is an update of the standard Atkins regimen. It allows a few more carbs but it's still the high protein high fat diet Atkins recommended. Now, keep in mind that Atkins himself had significant heart disease when he died, and he weighed 258 pounds! See [...] (last visited 9 July 2013).If you want to try this approach New Atkins is a good presentation of it. But do yourself a favor: get your blood drawn before you start. Get it drawn again six weeks later. Then six weeks after that. If you lose weight and your cholesterol, tryglycerides, etc. are improving, you know this is probably safe and healthy for you. If not, get off of it. It's too dangerous to undertake ANY radical dietary regimen without checking your blood, particularly one where you chiefly subsist on protein and fat.And remember--despite all the scientific-sounding hocus pocus about insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome and the overworked pancreas--losing weight remains simple math. Ingesting more calories than you burn = weight gain and vice-versa. It doesn't matter whether the calories are from butter or brown rice. There ain't no way around this.Finally, also look into the Krebs cycle which, put very simply, means that the body burns fat for fuel efficiently only when there is adequate carbohydrate in the system. In practical terms, this means that the quickest way to burn fat while exercising is to keep the dietary fats low, the complex carbs fairly high.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W5ZW68DCUM0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439190275#wasThisHelpful","R1W5ZW68DCUM0S","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Swami Sivananda has a number of disciples, including Swami Satchidananda of Integral Yoga, Swami Radha, and this book's author, Swami Satyananda. Swami Sivananda remains one of the greatest yogis, and his disciples continue that acuity and purity. This book is a valiant and successful effort to provide anyone with a sincere interest in yoga, whatever their motivation, with a complete course that will take them from basic asana (posture practice) to advanced meditation techniques leading to concentration, absorption, and that ineffable state called samadhi. It's written for someone without a guru as a very clear by the hand manual. It is superb. I know of no other book to equal it. One reviewer cautioned that the Kriya Yoga methods taught here differ from those taught by Lahiri Mahasaya. That's true. And this book emphasizes the meditation technique called Kriya Yoga as an efficient path to samadhi. It also explains that the exact source of the group of techniques called Kriya Yoga is unknown. What's important to note is that this book does approach and teach the Kriya techniques quite differently from the Lahiri-Yukteswar lineages, which differ from Yogananda's streamlined version taught now through Self-Realization Fellowship. This book's approach is derived from Swami Sivananda's approach, and the author notes similarities between Kriya Yoga and other systems like the microcosmic orbit technique from Taoism, as well as differences. My point is this: practice it the way it's taught here. If you want to learn another approach, great. Try each. Use your intuition to decide which you prefer. There are various approaches to what's known as Kriya Yoga and I don't know that anyone can demonstrate that one is more effective than another.Also, this book keeps asana and pranayama in perspective, as supporting techniques to prepare you for the higher practices rather than being ends in themselves. This is valuable in an age that often views asana as the whole of yoga.The book offers a wonderful non-sectarian approach that is user-friendly and comprehensive. As the author says, ""Whatever your situation in life, whatever you believe or do not believe, whatever you want from life, yoga will help you because it changes your whole being and hence your relationship and attitude to life itself."" Yes it does. This is a wonderful map that will take you there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ577TOWJ7E15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8185787085#wasThisHelpful","RJ577TOWJ7E15","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been practicing yoga asanas since about 1991. I've had the good fortune to have taken classes with K. Pattabhi Jois, some master Iyengar teachers including the magnificent Gabriella Giubilaro, and I have acquired a fairly good library of books on asana, pranayama, meditation, and various aspects of yoga philosophy. Dancing the Flame of Life really surprised me. It's a significant addition to the literature. Holleman, whose background is Iyengar-based, adds invaluable information that allows me to really make use of principles I knew of but didn't really understand, or simply didn't know about. For example, take a simple thing like padha bandha. I had never heard of it. Mula Bandha, Jalandhara Bandha, but Padha Bandha? Well, it's quite simple but it has changed the way I stand in the standing postures, and that change has enhanced my posture toe to scalp. Her mental approach to yoga is worth the price of the book, with her emphasis on a highly attentive but somewhat passive, or watchful approach as opposed to the ""no pain no gain"" approach that's crept into a lot of asana practice. I haven't listened to the CD that comes with the book yet but I will, soon. I do think that this book is better suited to someone who at least has an understanding of the fundamentals so they can fully appreciate the refinements and distinctions on hand but I would recommend this to everyone who has more than a passing interest in hatha yoga. It's that good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJBL42PNFPTT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1906756007#wasThisHelpful","RJBL42PNFPTT2","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book takes nothing for granted. Every concept is explained in detail. Occult principles and made clear. Practical advice is given. There are a number of excellent books on pranayama. This belongs among them.

"A wonderful account of the making of a guru, including the part you don't often hear about--the early doubts whether or not Sivananda was the right guru for the author, or even anything special; and a very non-romantic view of rugged conditions in the ashram that had the aspirant struggling to adjust to the lack of creature comforts, and eventually learning to see god in everything.

"Almost two hundred dollars for a kettle? Well, yes, if you consider that Alessi is the only game in town if you want a high-quality 18/10 stainless steel kettle that's not made in China. And believe me I've done the homework. Some Le Creuset kettles are made in Thailand and others of theirs are from the People's Republic of Questionable Safety. I have nothing against running shoes made in China or ballpoint pens made in China or computers made in China but I don't boil water in those things, and when you boil water in a metal container, impurities leach into the water. So I sprang for an Alessi. It has a whistle that's not a screech and will alert me without annoying me. It's not so loud that I can go down to the basement or up to the attic but if I'm in the next room, it's fine. The spout pours beautifully. The interior is easy to reach and clean. The handle doesn't get so hot you burn your hand. And if the bird breaks or you lose it they sell replacements. Some have complained that it's hard to remove the bird without burning yourself. The instructions tell you to wait until the steam stops escaping. I haven't had a problem. And it looks beautiful, the kettle. Five stars, bravo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UJOT24U7GX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DSNM4E#wasThisHelpful","R2UJOT24U7GX7","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros: It looks good. The handle mechanism that opens the lid on the spout works great. The handle doesn't get too hot.Cons: The interior of the lid has a silicone or plastic gasket, and I never like plastics in proximity to boiling water or food. The kettle imparts an odd chemical smell to the water. When making coffee, the coffee conceals this. Tea, too. But I wonder what causes that. Am suspicious of the purity of the 18/8 stainless steel of this Chinese-made item. The whistle was very faint, then it stopped working after a few days.Unfortunately, there are no longer any stainless steel kettles made in the USA, and only one company makes them in Europe. Scarcity increases price, and the cost of non-Chinese made stainless kettles is high. However, when you boil water in metal, impurities in the metal leak into the water. Given what's coming out of China these days (radioactive stainless steel pet bowls, for example), I'm taking one for the team and springing for an Italian-made stainless kettle that has its fans and detractors but will give me peace of mind that we're not drinking heavy metals with our afternoon cuppa.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QD3Q4OEA28RV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BTYDZ8#wasThisHelpful","R2QD3Q4OEA28RV","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The kettle arrived beautifully packed in a cloth drawstring bag and I took it out, took the lid off, looked inside, and saw massive corrosion and the absence of plating in many places, leaving the base metal exposed throughout portions of the interior. This would be inexcusable in a $10.00 kettle. The Simplex cost $179 on Amazon and is supposedly hand made. Where is quality control? I took photos I was so shocked. I sent Simplex an email. So far, no response. Amazon customer service was unable to put me in touch with the dealer who sold the kettle via Amazon, at least, not by phone. I am unwilling to spend the money on a replacement. If they let kettles leave the factory in such appalling condition, Simplex is not a company I want to buy from, nor is the retailer who sold it through Amazon.Now for some background. My wife and I decided to avoid buying cookware made in China. The last straw was the recent manufacture of stainless steel pet bowls that are radioactive. Low levels of radioactive metals got into the steel and--this is amazing--the manufacturer said not to worry, the levels are probably low enough to be safe.When you boil water, impurities including heavy metals will leak from the steel or whatever it is into the water, then into you when you drink the tea or coffee. Unacceptable. Here's the really bad part. THERE ARE NO STAINLESS STEEL KETTLES FOR SALE NOW THAT ARE NOT MADE IN CHINA with the exception of some Le Creuset kettles that are made in Thailand, and, the sole exception, Alessi kettles, which are still made in Italy from 18/10 stainless steel. And they are expensive. Why has my country, and the whole of Europe, stopped making something so simple as a tea kettle? The answer is money but it's disgusting.Long story short, if you really want a good quality stainless steel kettle, you have two choices. A vintage kettle from ebay or elsewhere, or Alessi.Update: The Simplex company responded to my email. They were shocked by the photos. They think the kettle was boiled dry and then resold. If you want a Simplex I suggest you buy directly from them.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W3NKB8EL7E09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001V01WK#wasThisHelpful","R1W3NKB8EL7E09","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love my Garmin 305 but I lost the heart rate monitor that came with it. I bought this to replace it. It worked for the first run. Then it started giving bizarrely low readings. My heart rate was 130, the monitor said it was 56, and so on, throughout the run. I adjusted the strap, I made sure the conductors were wet. No dice. I assumed I had a lemon. I ordered a replacement. The replacement worked for the first run. Then the same problem. I was panting up a hill, my heart rate was nearly 150 based on my taking it with my finger on my pulse but the monitor had it at 73. I don't know what the problem is. Garmin generally makes good products. Also, before every run you have to pair the monitor and the watch so they interact, which wasn't the case with the heart rate monitor that came with it. I could live with that.

"I started studying this art in the late 1980s in Taiwan, then continued when I got home, and have been practicing ever since, with many lapses. I have read at least a dozen books on taiji, probably more. Juice is the first book I've read to deal directly, concretely, with the art's energetics, the patterns of energy flow, and energy cultivation. The author has a Ph.D from MIT, and it shows. His explanations are free of the New Agey ""let your qi flow!"" feel good stuff that's useless. On the other hand, he eschews the trend to dismiss all discussion of qi in taiji in favor of pure physics and body mechanics. In very detailed language he explains how to get the qi (chi) into your taiji through correct use of the form, rather than auxiliary nei kung/qigong. I learned a great deal in the week that I've been working with the book, and can feel the results. But this is experiential. You can debate it, you can agree or challenge it, but you have to give it a try and see if you can feel it. I would go as far as to say it's the most important book on taiji I've read, and I don't know the author, I'm not a shill, just another taiji nut.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SU794W0M47O2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1478260696#wasThisHelpful","R1SU794W0M47O2","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started running to lose weight. I took some workshops on correct form. I run with a midfoot strike and a slight forward lean, at least I try to. Despite being careful about form, runs longer than five miles tend to cause me plantar fasciitis. Which sucks, as you know. Until now, the best shoe I'd found was the Mizuno Wave Musha, though I also liked the Brooks Racer ST5 though it does have a more substantial heel. In a book about correct form and running shoes I saw a reference to Altra and tried the Instinct 1.5. No more pain. The shoe is very comfortable. It is not heavily padded at all, in fact, it feels kind of like running shoes feel when it's time for a new pair--very little cushioning. But it works, for me. It is not what most would call a ""minimal"" shoe, you don't get a great deal of ground feel, it's not a Vibram, its far more substantial. P.S. I tried the Torin, another model from Altra, and hated it, felt like I was about to teeter over.

"Mo Pai nei kung has attained cultlike status among qigong rats, and with good reason. As any student of Economics 101 learns, scarcity increases value. Information about true mo pai training is very scarce. Jim McMillan details his meetings with a remarkable man, John Chang, who became his teacher, and he presents a warts and all portrait.

"This is my first tablet. My wife has an iPad but I haven't used it. Overall, I'm very pleased as I wanted a tablet chiefly for books. I started with the entry level Kindle, liked it, and upgraded. Even though I am an Apple user, I didn't want to spend the money on an iPad and I didn't need a million apps. This has a really nice display. It's great for watching movies, and I now use it for email. Music is also excellent on it, though you'll want headphones or external speakers as the speakers in the device, while quite good, are not going to give you the nuances you want. I really love this device. But I can't give it five stars because (a) the battery life is somewhat short. I find that I pretty much have to charge it daily, though I do use it a lot. (b) it does not support flash player, and I'm not sure what that is, but I know that without it certain cites won't work, and there is no good reason for it not to support flash, prior models apparently did. (c) the browser is okay but slower than it could be. (d) bizarrely, whereas you can create various categories for books on the basic Kindle, you can't on this one. There are apps that supposedly allow this but the two I downloaded sucked. I deleted them. Consequently, I have dozens of books of various types, such as fiction, nonfiction, historical, foreign languages, exercise, etc., and no way to organize them by category so I can go to a specific folder where all the books on yoga are stored, another folder for books on lit crit, another folder for fiction, etc. Why the 79.00 Kindle allows this but not the Big Kahuna is bizarre. I recommend that you get an app that monitors battery life, as an Amazon user suggested to me, if you buy one of these since the battery tends to drain fast. All in all, it's a great device, and it was wonderful to have when I was bedbound with the flu. As a Prime member I watched movies for free, read, listened to music. I tend to take it wherever I go. The shortcomings are minor.

"The book's focus is on the Southern Wu (as opposed to Northern Wu) style of tai chi, as taught by a well-known Hong Kong-based teacher who made some changes to the form, none of them controversial, and whose chief contributions included the teaching of a set of qi gong/nei kung exercises that had not been taught outside the Wu family, and emphasizing the practicality of tai chi for self-defense and even tournament fighting. The book is chiefly useful for Wu stylists, and tends to disparage the other two main styles of tai chi, Yang and Chen. The book boasts photos of the author doing the long form. Unless you know the form, or have access to it on DVD, you will never figure out how to move from posture to posture, and tai chi is about movement. If you are learning the form or know the form, the book is useful if you want to check the sequence. The author includes a few photos of his teacher doing the form, and the difference between the two is remarkable. The author's teacher, even in a still photo, seems vibrant and relaxed, alert and poised. By comparison the author looks as if he's holding his breath. Which suggests that his teacher's book, which he co-wrote, might be more useful, [...] though I haven't seen it. There is an annoying tendency throughout the book to refer to ""secret"" teachings available only to students who have quite literally taken an oath of allegiance to the author and his style. Thus we have mention of the ""six secret words,"" secret push hands and fighting techniques, and above all, the qi gong/nei kung exercises which the author praises as imparting nearly supernatural physical powers, but which are  not disclosed--you have to join the club to learn them, along with, perhaps, secret handshakes. There is a chapter on tai chi weaponry, and a chapter on self-defense which is interesting. The bottom line is that this book is chiefly useful for people with a keen interest in the Wu style and this popular variation on it. The chapters on the history of the art are fine, but not worth the price of admission. If you're looking for useful instruction and are not keyed to the Wu style, there are books that offer more bang for the buck. If you have a keen interest in the Wu style, this is an interesting addition.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UEN1CJCBHCF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1861260334#wasThisHelpful","R2UEN1CJCBHCF4","A2T5YMN76G3MHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2T5YMN76G3MHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have the Dolce Vita Oro medium ""rollerball."" It's a pretty pen. A bit flashy--it's all orange--and I wouldn't bring it to a typical business meeting, but it you like orange, as I do, it's fun. Here's the problem. Delta calls it a rollerball. It ain't. It takes standard Parker ballpoint refills. There are gel ink refills that will fit, but to me a rollerball is a specific pen with a specific, usually liquid, ink, with a specific feel. There is no way this is a rollerball. So if you don't mind using gel ink refills, fine. I'm annoyed because they really should not be misleading. They make a ballpoint that's cheaper and probably a bit smaller, and when I pay more for a rollerball I expect a rollerball with rollerball liquid ink refills. This ain't that.

"I've had great experiences with Avery products in the past -- they consistently deliver a quality product.  In this package, you get (30) sheets of Letter-sized 8.5"" x 11"" matte card stock that has perforations for you to tear out (2) 4.25"" x 5.5"" (half a letter-sized) notecard-sized cards per sheet-- in total you get (30) notecards, and (30) envelopes.Unlike most Avery products, each sheet does not have the product ID# printed on it.  However, you can use the Avery #5315 to look up the template in MS Word, or download/design your notecard on Avery's website.The paper you get is basically your standard card stock with a single tear perforation to split the cards in two, and has a... (not sure what the correct word is, but has basically similar to a perforation) line that makes it easy to fold in the correct spot.  What I like about this card is that there is no wasting paper -- the full page is utilized.  There is no other markings on the paper that are to be torn and thrown away.  With that said, if you want to go the cheaper route, you could create a similar product on your own -- just print on standard card stock, cut it in half, and purchase some envelopes.  However, what Avery does is make things easier -- at a cost (though not bad at a current cost of about 26 cents per notecard + envelope)!This is a nice product for those that want to print customized note cards, and not go through the hassle of cutting individual cards, and purchasing a bunch of envelopes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NOSPDK5O5G1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006IBUU#wasThisHelpful","R2NOSPDK5O5G1H","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had great experiences with Avery products in the past -- they consistently deliver a quality product.  In this package, you get (50) sheets of Letter-sized 8.5"" x 11"" matte card stock that has perforations for you to tear out (2) 4"" x 6"" postcard-sized cards per sheet-- in total you get (100) postcards.Just like most Avery products, each sheet has the product ID#, and a reference to which template to use in popular word processing programs like Microsoft Word.  If you're unable to find a template there, you can go to their website and either download a template, or design your postcard there.Though its not the complete fault of these cards, but due to the thickness of the product, it may jam in certain laser printers.  I found the thickness similar to about 85-lb card stock.  This doesn't seem to be as thick as postcards I would find outside.  Additionally, these cards are matte, so if you're searching for a semi-glossy or glossy finish similar to what you see on photo-postcards, this isn't the product for you.  After printing, you simply need to fold and tear at the perforations.  The perforations did its job -- the result was some cleanly torn edges.This product is ideal for those looking to print the occasional customized postcard, or just a basic notecard, and I would recomend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9PVGZ3WKLKIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006B8G1#wasThisHelpful","R9PVGZ3WKLKIF","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've heard about BLU and their affordable line of smartphones before on sites like Engadget.  If you need a smartphone that won't break the bank, you should certainly consider one of their phones.  I've been playing with this particular unit for a few weeks, and my impression is that the two major selling points is the large size, and price.Below are some pros/cons of the device:PROS:- Size -- its very large, and makes it easy to watch movies on the go.  Especially good for those with kids!- Android 5.0 (Lollipop)- Minimal bloatware- Unlocked -- not tied to any particular carrier.  However, it can only be used with GSM carriers (e.g. AT&T & T-Mobile.  Cannot be used with Verizon/Sprint).- Smooth performance.  Haven't experienced any hiccups yet while watching movies or playing games.- Includes a charger, screen protector, and headphones- Though it only has 8GB of internal storage, it has a microSD slot capable of handling upto 64GB.CONS:- Low sound -- my Galaxy Note 3 sounds considerably louder- No flash.  Besides using a flash for the rear camera, I often use it as a flashlight.  No such option on this phone.- Poor camera image quality.  I set the camera settings to the highest, and yet most images appear grainy.- While the screen is large, and IPS, its colors appear to be a bit washed out when compared side by side with an iPhone or Galaxy Note3- Relatively wide bezel.- No LTE support -- with the prevalence of LTE these days, I would have thought this would be standard by now.On the size aspect, this phone is huge -- I have a Galaxy Note 3, and the Studio 7.0 is massive in comparison.  As a tablet, this seems like a decent size as it is very lightweight, and can fit in some pockets, and easily fit in bags.  However, as a phone, this thing is far too large -- its nearly the size of my head!Though this is phone is very far from perfect, at the price point, I can't expect to be WOW'd.  For the price, I give it a solid 4*'s.  The phone targets cost-conscious consumers that want something large.  It would be unfair to compare the quality and features of a $130 phone with flagship devices from Apple or Samsung -- its in a separate class!  For those that want a large phone/small tablet for movies, and games, and not rely on a speedy LTE network, this may fit the bill perfectly fine.  For those that simply want the best out there today, look elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MLFCVUVQWPS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013X0V11K#wasThisHelpful","R2MLFCVUVQWPS0","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one basic polyester table cloth.  There is nothing notable about it -- though the design looks nice, it does seem rather thin.  If you're in need of a casual table cloth, just to dress up the table a little, this will do.  If you want anything more out of it, like protect your table, and absorb liquids, then don't set your expectations too high.  Additionally, for what you get, the price seems rather high.  There are similar, if not better, quality table cloths sold on Amazon for 1/3rd of the price.

"I purchased the GermGuardian AC4825, 3-in-1 Air Cleaning System with True HEPA, UV-C and Odor Reduction, 22-Inch about 6 months ago and have been very happy with the performance.  The reason for the purchase was to clear up a bad stench coming from a room where I have the cat litter box placed (and of course where the cats do their business).  The GermGuardian AC4825 did the trick.  With this GermGuardian AC5300B, I was expecting similar positive results, and it did not disappoint.The AC4825 unit stands at 22-inches, is intended for small to medium sized room, and has a Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) rating of 100+.  The AC5300B unit stands at 28-inches, is intended for medium to large sized rooms and has a CADR rating of 125+.  [CADR rating can be verified online.  However, for whatever reason, I could not find Germ Guardian's products on the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) website.]Both units touts a 3-in-1 filter -- that is, it has a HEPA filter to capture 99.7% of airborne particles, a charcoal filter to capture odors, and a pre-filter to capture large dust particles, lint and pet hair.  Additionally, it has a UV-C light that kills bacteria and viruses, and helps get rid of odor caused by smoking, cooking, and pets.As this model is intended for a medium to larger room, I have this placed in the kitchen/dining room.  In my household, we sometimes eat durian and stinky tofu.  The smells tend to linger a bit.  With this air purifier on, the odors went away quicker than normal, and the aroma didn't spread to the entire house!This air purifier works well, and is relatively affordable for what it does.  I would recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H9CLVRH00TAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5ZB36O#wasThisHelpful","R2H9CLVRH00TAJ","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a basic shaver that does that one thing, gives a good shave at a very affordable price.I have used other shavers from Norelco and Panasonic that are 3 to 6 times more expensive and I can honestly can't say that those shavers are any better at shaving.  Sure those have other bells and whistles but if you just want an easy to use cordless shaver this is a good choice.There is a single led above the power button that gives you the status if the battery; green is good, red is bad.

"I've been using a Crock Pot slow cooker for years.  The one I had previously used is still being used regularly for soups, stews, and congee.  This unit is serving a similar purpose, and is just like my Crock Pot brand slow cooker, but is just a bit smaller.As a slow cooker, the features on this unit seem to be pretty basic and standard.  On the control dial, it has the four settings -- OFF, LOW, HIGH, and WARM.  The lid is made of clear tempered glass, allowing you to take a look at whether your food is boiling.  Though the food contents tend to be hot, the handles remain relatively cool, making it easy to move the entire unit to either the dinner table or another place on the counter.  The removable liner makes it easy to cleanup.

"I've been using this air purifier for about a month now and have been pleased with the features and performance.  What sets this apart from the others on the market is the ""smart"" features.  If you're into the smart-home craze, this may be the air purifier for you!This is my first WeMo device, so I had to download the WeMo app to set it up.  For those that do not know, WeMo is like an ecosystem -- if you find a device/peripheral that says WeMo, it should be able to be controlled via the WeMo app.  It'll let you monitor, measure, and manage devices.  The WeMo app is available for download on your respective app store (iTunes, Google Play Store, Android).  For more information about this, you can check out their website (www.wemo.com).  Upon installing the app, I was able to search for the air purifier, add it, and begin managing it.With the app, you now have a fancy remote control that will enable you to fiddle with settings, check the status, and turn on/off the device from anywhere with an internet connection.  I was able to set a schedule of when I wanted the device to automatically turn on/off (I set it to turn off when I know I'm at work, and on just before I usually get home).  You can have separate schedules for each day of the week.  You can also set it on low/med/high/auto/off, and toggle whether you want the ionizer on.  The app will alert you when it requires some routine maintenance, and when to replace the filters (as I've said, I've only been using this device for nearly a month.. so I haven't received any alerts. but if it works as advertised, alerts will be helpful as I often need reminders to do this sort of stuff!).  One feature that should not be overlooked is that the air purifier has a sensor to detect the air quality, which you can see via the app (one feature that is lacking on all my traditional non-smart air purifiers).In the event the app isn't work, or you don't have your app/phone near by, this air purifier works well via the old-school manual buttons on the top of the unit.Whats great about this unit is the availability of different types of filters, which allows you to mix/match the use of filters depending on your specific needs.  The four different types of filters available are:  Allergen Remover, Total Air, Odor Eliminator, Smoke Grabber, and the Carbon Filter.  The unit comes installed with a allergen remover filter, and a odor eliminator carbon filter.  The average life cycle of these vary depending on how much you use it, and the type of filter.If you're in the market for a ""smart"" air purifier, then this is a solid performer, and I would recommend this device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NJ08IV3PQM68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KL770ZK#wasThisHelpful","R1NJ08IV3PQM68","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I manual nasal aspirator this works great compared to the blue bulb aspirators that you typically see.  The shape of the tip seals nicely to the baby our child nose and provides a good seal.To increase the auction, this I've has a tube that connects to the back of the bulb so you can create a auction with your mouth.  I like how this one has replaceable filters to help isolate the about that can get sucked out.Unfortunately these two methods for aspirating mucus and fluid from the naval cavity is almost useless compared to using aspirators that are vacuum assisted.We were introduced to the arianna baby vac that uses a connector that attached to most vacuums so you have a strong and constant suction to really help clear out thick mucus setup in the nasal cavity.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RADM1D10N0005/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P38Q9TU#wasThisHelpful","RADM1D10N0005","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one decent lightweight upright commercial vacuum cleaner.  The vacuum comes with just a few pieces -- the main vacuum base, the handle, and a 35' standard extension cord.  Assembly is very simple -- just place the handle in to the main vacuum base, and screw it in with the supplied screw.  Plug in the extension cord into the short plug.  The zippered section that stores the vacuum bag appears to be made of a nice nylon material that some nice backpacks are made of, and should stand up well to wear and tear.The one commercial vacuum that I have, and can easily compare to is the highly rated Carpet Pro CPU 2t Commercial Vacuum Cleaner:>> ASSEMBLY:  Not a big deal since you only have to do it once... but the Hoover was a cinch to assemble -- only one item to screw in.  The CarpetPro2T wasn't difficult, but took a few more minutes to get up and running.>> FEATURES/ACCESSORIES:  On the Hoover, the use of an standard extension cord versus a long attached cord is nice -- in the event that 35' isn't enough, you can replace it with a longer extension cord, rather than lug around two separate cords.  This is also great in the event the cord is somehow damaged.  However, this Hoover vacuum doesn't have any options for hand tools/accessories, so is limited only to the open floor.  The Carpet Pro CPU2T on the other hand has a hand tool that come in handy to reach hard to reach places, and areas above the ground.  Where this made a huge difference is in the office, under desks.  Though the Hoover was light, it was difficult to vacuum under many desks, and other hard to reach places.  The Carpet Pro CPU2T also had issues, but could overcome it with the hand tool.Comparatively, the Hoover is quieter.  This may be important for some in office environments.The Hoover vacuum bag is self-sealing.  When you remove, it seals itself to prevent the dust flying out.  Not the case on the CarpetPro.>> WEIGHT:  The Hoover is lighter than the Carpet Pro CPU2T.  Some people like the extra weight, so this is more personal preference.>> PRICE:  At the time of this review, the Carpet Pro CPU2T is about $30 more.  Standard vacuum bags for the Carpet Pro costs about $1.66/each.  For the Hoover, they have a few different bags -- BAG-Q standard (model #AH10178PC) retails for $1.39/each (pack of 25), Bag-Q Alrgn (AH10021) $1.99/each (pack of 10), and the HEPA bag (model 302982002) from 3rd parties cost about $2.50/each.>> DOES IT ""SUCK""?:  The performance of both units were comparable, as both handled any debris i could find on carpets.  I did not have the opportunity to test on hard floors as my office does not have any.All in all, this is a high quality commercial vacuum.  If you plan to vacuum a lot of floors in the open, then this is a solid choice.  However, if you have a need to vacuum under furniture, etc., look elsewhere, as this isn't vacuum isn't designed for that purpose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R317Y11ET5EDNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSSNNGE#wasThisHelpful","R317Y11ET5EDNP","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have used PediaSure products before and was hopeful that this smoothie mix would continue with the quality of their products that I have experienced in the past.  I was happy to find that the smoothie wasn't overly sweet and had a pleasant strawberry and banana aroma.  Of corse overly sweet tasting, so you have to keep in mind the powder still has 8 g of sugars per serving and once mixed with the milk the package estimates each serving to have approximately 17 g of sugars.  Once reconstituted, there are also small flakes of strawberry in the smoothie.  I would say that is hit or miss depending on the kid drinking it.I used a shaker bottle and it was very easy to incorporate the mix in with the milk.  3/4 cup to each scoop of powder.  I find this a good serving size that will satisfy toddler aged kids.  Each package makes 8 servings so this isn't cheap by any means.  Each of the packages also come with a measuring spoon so it makes it that much easier to measure out the proper amounts.  My only concern is that with such small packages you end up with many extra measuring spoons that will get tossed out and end up in a landfill somewhere.Overall i am pleased with this product and wouldnt hessitate to try other flavors that are available","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PDS8RJUNM5Q5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URXQP7M#wasThisHelpful","R2PDS8RJUNM5Q5","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main reason I am only giving this carrier 2 stars is because the 5 point straps are inconvenient to adjust.  They adjust only from the back of the seat (near the release lever) and can not be reajusted on the fly.  The straps are also not interconnected so it is possible to have them improperly adjusted for each side if the infant isn't sitting straight.These straps are always supposed to be left snug where you should only be able to get a couple fingers underneath otherwise the straps are too loose.  Having the straps preset is makes it difficult when the child often wears different types of clothes and makes for straps that will inevitable be too tight or more seriously too loose. Every other infant carrier my family has owned have always had some sort of front accessible tension device that makes it easier to put the child in and take them out as well as adjust for the child on a daily basis and as they grow.  I acknowledge that seat belts work best when they are placed snuggly on as few layers of clothes as possible but anyone that has taken care of kids now that it is not always possible to have them in a onesie in the car seat and then put all other layers on them after they get out of the car.  This s especially true of children that still ride in carriers.  My experience is that infants will be dressed in varying layers depending on the outside weather since they will likely stay in the carrier for extended periods of time.  Loosing the ability to adjust the straps quickly and easily is a definite deal breaker for me.Aside from that, it does seem like a good seat and i do appreciate it's lightweight.  That s definitely a plus as the child grows past 20 pounds and trying to carry them in and out of the seat base.## CLICK vs CLASSIC -- The term Click Connect is Graco's newer series of car seats that will give you an audible ""click"" sound to know that you have secured the the car seat to the base or stroller.  On the Classic Connect system, you would snap in the seat to the base and then utilize either some straps or levers to secure the seat to its base.  Both the Click Connect and the Classic Connect are Graco's product lines designed for infants.NOTE however that these two systems ARE NOT COMPATIBLE with one another.  This isn't a problem if you're starting from scratch and getting an entirely new system to outfit your vehicles.  However, if you're dealing with hand-me-downs, or got a new addition to your household, this may pose an issue  Graco's SnugRide line predates the ClickConnect series, as the SnugRide name was also used for their Classic series.  If you're trying to look for strollers or other accessories compatible with this car seat, etc., be extra careful and MAKE SURE it explicitly states that its compatible with the CLICK connect system -- if it doesn't, its likely that its only compatible with the older CLASSIC Connect line.

The kit feels light, but does not feel cheap at all.When using this lens kit, you should have a reasonable set of expectations -- this is a camera-phone that you're using after all.  The phone hardware and software was not designed to accommodate the external lens.  The two lens does give you some added features, but it would be unreasonable to expect it to perform on par with SLRs and the like.  What you get here are two good lens that perform reasonably well.The wide angle lens works very well.  After some usage, I've found I like using this more than messing around with the panorama setting on the phone.  It expands your field of view by about 35% than without.  I've found this great for family photos in tight spaces, and the occasional selfie.The telephoto lens gives me the ability to better zoom into an object, rather than relying too heavily on the iPhone's digital zoom.  The results looks good, and seems a bit clearer than the digitally zoomed in photos on the iPhone.This is a nice kit for those that want just a bit more from their iPhone camera.  The lens are not too bulky, and can easily be swapped in and out as the need arises.  For me, this is a kit that I may bring out to special occasions and on trips, but not something that I'll be bringing with me on a daily basis.  Is it worth the price?  For me, though I like the results, I don't see myself taking this out with me often enough to justify the price.  However, it is a well built kit, and may be worthy of your hard earned money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R545EFRWCCU0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFQH6GY#wasThisHelpful","R545EFRWCCU0S","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Antec Note is a relatively small portable bluetooth stereo speaker, that also includes a built-in microphone.  The package includes the following:- Antec Note bluetooth speaker- approximately 20"" Micro-USB to USB cable (the same cable used to charge most non-Apple smartphones)- 14"" 3.5mm male-to-male auxiliary audio cable- Quick start guide- Warranty booklet- Model #/Serial # stickersPairing and setting up this bluetooth speaker was easy despite the horrid instructions.  After charging the speaker with the included USB cable for a couple hours, I toggled the power switch to ON.  To pair, I turned on the bluetooth feature on my phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 3), and held down the PLAY button on the speaker for 3 seconds, which put the speaker into the pairing mode.  The speaker immediately showed up on my phone, and was paired.To use the speaker, in addition to turning the device ON, you need to open the leather-like flap of the speaker.  If the flap closes, the speaker turns OFF, or goes into STANDBY mode.  After the speaker was on, I proceeded to play some music from my phone.  The sound was louder than my phone's speakerphone and laptop speaker, loud enough to fill up my bedroom.  The sound was what I'd consider adequate, but certainly wouldn't meet the stringent requirements of an audiophile.As this has a built-in mic, I proceeded to make a phone call.  The other party heard me clearly, and I heard the other person.  However, the sound I heard coming through the speaker was a bit muffled.  Switching the call back to my phone, the sound was a bit more clear.The Antec Note works well for what it is.  Its not going to replace your larger speaker system.  It is an ideal accessory to accompany your smartphone or tablet.  Though it'll work as a speaker/mic for your smartphone, the sound quality heard from the speaker leaves a bit to be desired.  If you're getting it as a bluetooth speaker, then the Antec Note seems to provide some decent value.  If you're buying it to use as a bluetooth speaker/mic to make calls, then look elsewhere for something specifically designed for that purpose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R169KAJGVQGKOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00THR0KRA#wasThisHelpful","R169KAJGVQGKOW","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This George Foreman grill is versatile in the sense you can use it indoors or out.  The grill is an excellent (and I believe healthier) alternative to the charcoal or propane grills as it is lightweight, doesn't coat your food in harmful carcinogens and doesn't require picking up those alternative fuel types.  Using electric vs those other fuel types also gives you more control over the amount of heat as well as a more even heat over the entire grill.  As it is portable (and pretty lightweight), it also makes it easier to clean.The package comes with large grilling surface (this unit has a 200 sq. inch surface) that is advertised as a 12-serving grill.  If this isn't adequate for your needs, they also have a larger one with a 240 sq. inch surface advertised as a 15-serving grill.  While I haven't seen the 15-serving grill, I'd say this 200 sq. inch surface is plenty big for most families.  It also comes with a 4-legged pedestal that is about 2 ft in height.This key differentiating feature of the model of the George Foreman Grill that you're looking at, the GFO201RX, versus the GFO201R and most other George Foreman grills is that the surface is ceramic instead of teflon-coated.  It is advertised as being more 5x durable, though I have no basis for comparison.I tested this grill over the weekend and was pleased.  I used the grill outdoor on my deck.  The large grilling surface was able to handle about 6 large steaks and 13 burgers at once.  The food was evenly cooked and juicy.  The grill has a drip tray to rid away all the excess fat that can be easily emptied when full.  Cleanup was a snap as I was able to wash it down with the hose.All in all, I have come away pleased with the results, and would recommend this to anyone in search of a grill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3573JSFJV3RVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUUYI#wasThisHelpful","R3573JSFJV3RVO","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for Belkin's Conserve Insight Energy Use Monitor, not for the other 5 products that this product page seems to be bundled with.This energy use monitor is a simple user friendly product that will help you measure your energy usage.  It is an easy way to measure how much energy your power hungry devices are using whether its on or ""off,"" and whether you should consider completely unplugging, or purchase a more energy efficient product.  The device will give you readings on how much power is consumed, the average cost per 30 days or 365 days based on average electricity rates, as well as the estimated CO2 emissions associated with powering the device for 30 days or 365 days.When I first plugged my laptop into the device, the readings were all over the place.  It fluctuated significantly.  Leaving my laptop plugged in for at least the recommended 45 minutes, the device is able to gather enough data points to provide more accurate averages, and is better able to project usage over the 30 days or 365 days.I have previously used a competing product, the P3 P4400 Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor.  While the information provided is similar, I've found the Belkin easier to use for one simple reason -- theres a cord.  The Kill-A-Watt device plugs straight into the wall, and gives you the reading.  If your outlet is near the ground, you'll need to crouch down to view the screen.  This Belkin device differs in that it has the control and the the readings on a display screen that is attached via a 3-ft cord.  This makes toggling the buttons and reading the display much easier (especially if the outlet you're plugging it into is hard to reach).  Additionally, the buttons are larger, making it easier to press.Though this device costs significantly more than the Kill-A-Watt device, this device seems to be easier to use, and I would recommend it to those in search of a simple energy use monitor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T4RHEGRE7RTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003WV5DBU#wasThisHelpful","R3T4RHEGRE7RTC","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using an electric shaver for years and shave once every 2-3 days.  My current shaver has served me well (or so I thought), over the years.  However, there are some spots that would require at least 5-10 passes to track down some elusive hair that somehow seem to dodge blades -- and in the process causes some skin irritation.  This Norelco Shaver 7300 is a welcome change and has seemed to do a better job of trimming those hairs.For the purpose of this review, I put off shaving for about two weeks.  After charging the shaver up, I began by first using the trimmer (requires removing the shaver head, and putting on the trimmer attachment) to whack through the growth -- the trimmer seemed to work pretty well.  After the hairs were of shorter length, I went through with the shaver.  After a few passes, my mini-beard/mustache was gone, and my skin was smooth again.  There was some minor skin irritation on the first shave, but it did deliver a clean shave.  The 2nd and 3rd shaves seemed to deliver similarly good results with less skin irritation.### PROS- Relatively close shave.  Minimal skin irritation- Quiet- SmartClean base system charges and cleans the shaver.  Utilizing the included SmartClean cartridge, it'll clean the hair out from the head, preventing it from clogging.  It also keeps the head lubricated.- Can also be cleaned manually with water, though they advertise that the SmartClean system will clean it better.- Travel Lock -- On my old shaver, I've encountered times where my shaver would turn on while in luggage.  This shaver has a lock that prevents it from inadvertently turning on.- ""Wet"" and Battery indicator- Charges full in less than an hour- Trimmer works well- Includes travel carrying pouch.### CONS- Expensive consumables cost.  At the time of this review, the replaceable shaver head costs nearly $50 (to be replaced about once a year).  The SmartClean cartridge should cost about $12/each.- LARGE charging base.  Though the base seems to work well in my limited use, it is large.  With limited bathroom counter space, this is proving a bit problematic.- Trimmer is a separate attachment.- Battery indicator only shows that its low.  No percentage indicator.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FDMIE9FZHB4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOSDMS#wasThisHelpful","R3FDMIE9FZHB4V","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hamilton Beach breakfast sandwich maker is fairly compact, and is an ideal kitchen appliance for those that make breakfast sandwiches often.  Rather than having to toast a muffin/bread and fry and egg, this device can do all that with relative ease.  And best of all, its easy to clean -- less pans/devices also means less to clean!Though the device I got is intended to make one sandwich at a time, they do have a two sandwich version.  A single sandwich maker should be suitable for most, as it takes only about 5 minutes per sandwich.Since receiving it, I've used it several times to make my own version of the classic Egg Muffin sandwich.  English muffins seems to be the most ideal bread as its relatively small in size.  I attempted to place a bagel in, but the bagel I had would not fit without some trimming.All in all, a decent product that can save you some time in preparing a hot breakfast sandwich.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4AQQ9WDXI14V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XO6NJSW#wasThisHelpful","R4AQQ9WDXI14V","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most of us have some fat that we'd like to hide away.  For me, its at the belly/waist area.

"This is the second Drive Medical transport wheelchair/rollator that I've owned.  I really wanted to like this product.  It has some nice features.  However, in addition to getting around, the whole point of this product is SAFETY.  On that note, I don't believe this is a safe product to use, and would advise AGAINST purchasing this product.### THE GOOD- This unit is lightweight.- Has a storage compartment under the seat- The footrests can be flipped out to use, and easily flipped back in when not in use.- The armrests can flip-up for use and flip-down when not in use.- The backrest can be moved to face the front or back, allowing the user to use the device as a chair in the rollator mode (facing backwards), or be pushed in the transport chair mode (facing forward).### THE BAD- No seatbelt- When ""folded up"" for storage, it will not stand up on its own.  It needs to be propped up against an object/wall to stand -- and even then, isn't stable.- The handles can be ""removed"" for storage/transport.  However, as the brake lines are attached, you'll need to carefully pack it.- The padded handles started breaking apart very quickly.  I purchased this unit, and brought it on ONE trip, and already the padded handles are falling apart.### THE UGLYI purchased this for the flexibility of use as a walker as well as a transport chair.  Especially when in transport mode (having a person sit on the seat while being pushed), this unit is very prone to tipping forward.  As shown in the photo I've uploaded, as the chair is being pushed forward, the bulk of the front wheels swivel back.  When the front wheels hit a bump, it makes it VERY easy to tip forward.  This happened to me, causing me to fall forward out of the chair, and the person pushing me to fall forward as well.  Thankfully, neither I nor the person pushing me was hurt.IF you decide to purchase this unit, be aware of this problem and exercise lots of caution when pushing (or being pushed).","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TRJOOSTI16AE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FWY1J8#wasThisHelpful","R3TRJOOSTI16AE","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this desktop air purifier for about three weeks now and have been pleased with the performance.  I've been using this in a small office.  I've been suffering a bit from allergies, and this purifier has seemed to help a bit.It is relatively compact, having the footprint of a laptop.  It has three speed settings -- low, medium, and high.  At low, it is hardly noticeable.  At high, I can hear it, but it doesn't bother me much.  I usually leave the unit on low, and it seems to be doing a good job.Like most air purifiers, this contains a relatively inexpensive air filter that will need to be replaced from time to time.  Though I haven't had to replace the filter yet, its always good to research into maintenance cost of these units (how much it costs to maintain, and upkeep).  At the time of this review, if you replace the filter itself, it can be found for as cheap as about $3/filter (when purchased in multipacks) -- not bad for once or twice a year.This seems like a quality air purifier that is best suited for a small room.  I would recommend this unit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31KNGD63LSF3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DK35B#wasThisHelpful","R31KNGD63LSF3I","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on the reviews, I purchased four of these luggage locks for a trip.  The instructions on how to set the combination seemed simple enough:-----1. Adjust dials so the preset factory combination of 0-0-0 aligns with the markers2  Hold cable tip (A) and move toward left to remove from lock  (Cable tip A is on the side with the combination dials)3. While pushing in button (B) turn the dials to any combination you choose  (the button B that its referencing is at the bottom of the lock)4. Release button (B), insert cable tip (A) back into the hole, push down and move all the way to the right5. The lock is now ready to be used with your combination.  To change the combination again, repeat steps 2-4-----Though the instructions are pretty easy, I ran into a problem at step 3, where it states that the button should be pushed while changing the combination.  I had unknowingly released the button while changing the combination -- this caused the combination to change to the number that it was on when I had released the button -- OOPS.  Pretty annoying to say the least on a newly purchased lock -- as I was in a rush, I was not in the mood to try all the different possible combinations.  That leads me to a tip:HAVE SOMEONE HELP!  Two sets of hands will make it much easier to set.  Have one person hold the lock and use a pen or other item to push in the button (it'll be difficult to press the button down with your finger).  Have the second person toggle the combination dials to the new combination that you want set.I was prepared to return the lock, but wanted to see if there was a work-around -- My lock was still open, I just needed to figure out how to reset it.  It seems the only workaround is to actually hack the lock itself and exploit a flaw in these types of locks.  This was bittersweet -- I was happy to be able to figure out the combination I had accidentally set, but now know how UNSECURE this lock is.  After reading about the flaw itself, I was literally able to crack the code within 30 seconds.Though this lock will be a deterrent to the opportunistic thief, it will not keep your stuff safe from a determined criminal.  Had I known before how easy it is to accidentally set the wrong combo, and how easy it is to crack the code, I would not have purchased this lock.  Due to those reasons, I cannot recommend this lock.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17Z0PFNYELFFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WO84Z2#wasThisHelpful","R17Z0PFNYELFFS","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one relatively nice shredder.  When purchasing shredders, theres a few key things you need to consider:1)  What size of paper are you shredding?2)  How frequently will you be shredding?3)  How large are the stacks of paper will you be shredding?4)  How small (secure) do you need the documents shredded?5)  Besides paper, what else do you need shredded?  Staples, CD/DVDs, credit cards?After answering those questions, you should be able to narrow down your search to find yourself the shredder that best suits your needs.For this AmazonBasics 6-sheet high security micro-cut shredder, it can shred up to the standard 8.5"" width paper without folding (some larger shredders intended for offices can manage 11"" width at the mouth without folding).  It has the capacity to shred 6-sheets of paper at one time, for up to about 3-minutes continuously before it needs a short break. AmazonBasics has larger capacity versions available, but this unit should serve most basic needs.  The one essential feature that everyone should look for in a shredder is how small it can slice and dice the paper to -- this unit slices to 5/32"" x 15/32"" sized pieces which is pretty small (a good thing!).  The smaller the cuts, the more difficult it is for those with malicious intents to tape up your shredded documents.  This particular unit will also allow you to shred credit cards -- I placed one of my old credit cards through the shredder's dedicated credit card slot, and it was able to shred through it with ease.Beyond the those primary features, this shredder includes a manual reverse (to remove paper jams), and a 4-gallon waste bin.This is one quality shredder that performs very well for basic home use.  It did not jam once in my few weeks of use, though I expect that it will eventually.  I would highly recommend this shredder to those that are looking to shred bank statements, important documents, and the occasional credit cards.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMJK55Y5A6UCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q3KFX8U#wasThisHelpful","RMJK55Y5A6UCW","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We have taken the regular SmartyPants vitamins, the ones with more fiber, and the kids in the family have taken the kids version.  We like these in part because of the taste.  When it comes to vitamins, the focus should be on the nutritional benefits, not the sweet gummy taste.  However, just like with the kids, the gummy acts as our motivator.This Prenatal vitamin has most of the essential vitamins needed to promote health of the baby and mom.  As noted in the nutritional facts, this product does lack Iron -- you should consider taking a supplement to make up for that.

"I received the 1,500 PSI model for review.  I've never used pressure washers before, but was interested in what it could accomplish.  For my washing needs, I previously utilized my standard garden hose -- not too effective.  This is obviously leaps and bounds better than a standard garden hose.The GreenWorks GW1501 1,500 PSI model is one of their smallest units, and is suitable for basic washing needs.  It is relatively portable with a small handle on top to bring around easily.  However, keep in mind that you will need to have it plugged in to a standard power outlet, so a long extension cord may be necessary.  Hooking everything up was pretty easy without instructions.  In a matter of a few minutes, I was up and running, spraying down my dirty neglected front steps, and even gave my car a rinse.  It did a decent job of getting dirt washed away, but I needed to hold the unit a bit close to get enough power to wash things down.This unit seems ideal for small jobs, and I'm now searching for more things to pressure wash.  I would recommend this for those with very basic needs.  If you plan to use it more regularly, I would likely recommend purchasing the more powerful units.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QK6ERZ97W6OG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PSQ4X2W#wasThisHelpful","R3QK6ERZ97W6OG","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one lovely cast iron grill pan!  Like all cast iron cookware, this is heavy.  But this pan, with its beautiful blue enamel coated exterior, isn't just all looks -- it is very well made.  One nice feature of the pan is that the handle is stainless steel -- the use of this reduces the transfer of heat to the handle.  Additionally, it has a ""helper"" handle on the other end of the pan to make it easier to lift the heavy pan.  Before using any new cast-iron pan, you'll want to season it.  Following some basic instructions I found online, I did the following:1.  Wash the pan with soap and water (generally shouldn't do this, but OK if you are going to season it)2.  Apply a light coating of cooking oil onto the pan using a paper towel3.  Place the pan in the oven upside down on the center rack.4.  Place a sheet of aluminum oil on the bottom rack below the rack to catch dripping oil.5.  Bake in the oven at about 375' for an hour.  After an hour, just let the pan sit and cool down completely before removing.After those steps, you should be able to start using your new pan.Over the past few weeks I've been using this regularly, and though its heavy, it has been nothing but a pleasure to use.

When you flip the lid to wash the inside, the knob stays attached.  On the Instant Pot, the pressure release mechanism comes off.  Its better to have it stay attached so it doesn't get lost.> Delayed start -- You can set the pressure cooker to start within a 24-hr period.  This is great to have things all ready to cook in the pot in the morning or the night before, set the timer, and have it start cooking while you're on your way home from work.  The Instant Pot does not have this feature.> Detailed and clear instructions.  I was up and running very quickly.  The learning curve may have been lower based on my experience with the Instant Pot.  The Instant Pot took me a bit longer to learn.> Relatively inexpensive (as of this review, it is about $40 cheaper than the Instant Pot)Cons:> To start cooking, it requires pressing more buttons than the Instant Pot.  For the Elite Platinum, if you want to Saute, you would need to press the Saute (the light turns on), then press start.  On the Instant Pot, you would just need to press the one button and it starts.  (this is a minor con, as it takes just an extra press or two, but something to get used to)All in all, this is a decent pressure cooker and I recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R114GJ65TJHY0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZJOGBO#wasThisHelpful","R114GJ65TJHY0U","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are some good training pants.  I had used some of the boys training pants with my nephew, and these work just as well with focused protection on where girls need it.  The idea behind these training pants is that once the pants get a bit wet, it turns cold within seconds alerting the child to go to the bathroom.Training kids to potty train can be a bit hectic, but these certainly help.  It does not seem to hold as much liquid as the old diapers, but its not supposed to.  As with the boys Pull-Ups training pants, I found these to run a little bit small.  Similar to the boys version, these pull-up training pants feature velcro straps, making it easy to change your child without having to completely remove their underwear, pants, socks, shoes, and whatever else they may have.If you have a child that needs help getting potty trained, these training pants are worth a try!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYY5XJE0F2T6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TX1KVCE#wasThisHelpful","RYY5XJE0F2T6F","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Based on the other reviews, I had some high hopes for this flea and tick treatment.  The treatment seems to be working well.  However, I was disappointed for the following reasons:The one end of the applicator is supposed to be used to part the hair.  This was rather ineffective -- it would be easier to use your hands.  If there were some sort of bristles like a comb, it would be much more effective.Additionally, the mouth of the applicator is pretty wide.  When applying it to my dog, the meds flowed rather quickly, making a mess and spreading all over.As I mentioned, the treatment itself works pretty well.

"The Arkon Magnetic phone mount works wonderfully.  This mount works like few others out on the market today.  Instead of the traditional clamps that hold the sides of your phone, this one works by placing a THIN magnetic piece on the back end of your phone/device.  Once its on, it will stick to the magnetic mount.The great thing about the this is that it works well with my cell phone case.  I can stick it between my phone and my case with no issues -- it also makes it not noticeable at all.  This is a huge plus as my previous mounts had trouble holding my phone + case in place (I would constantly have to remove my case to keep it in the mount).  Additionally, all you have to do is place it on the mount with relative ease instead of having to pry the mount clamps onto your phone -- this is effortless with the Arkon magnetic mount!The one drawback I've found is with certain features of the phone that gets engaged when it comes in contact with a magnet -- such as ""car mode.""  That isn't entirely the fault of the mount, but something to keep in mind as it can get annoying.All in all, this is a good solid mount.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QWKR996UJ9HT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZHIERG#wasThisHelpful","R3QWKR996UJ9HT","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kenwood is a brand that I would associate more with stereo equipment than anything else.  The brand has been around for quite a while.Before I started using this machine, I used a basic toaster oven.  The kind that has a metal tray that pulls out when you open the front door.  The machine was cheap, and served its purpose -- to toast.This toaster itself features a single wide slot to toast, and is similar to other toasters where you lower the bread in vertically.  The slot is wide enough for two standard slices of bread.  The slot's can be adjusted using a lever on the bottom right side that allows the slot to accommodate larger/thicker breads if necessary (e.g. bagels, croissants, panini, etc.).One type of sandwich I always loved making in my toaster is grilled cheese sandwich.  Though it is possible to make a grilled cheese sandwich in this toaster, you'll need to make some adjustments.  Instead of using two slices of bread with some cheese in the middle, I needed to make sure that the end that went into the toaster first was ""folded"" so that the cheese wouldn't melt and drip down.  The same can be said with most types of sandwiches with any types of filling -- take care in putting it into the toaster, as you don't want your fillings dripping/falling down into the toaster.  Clamping down on the bread with the lever does help to keep things in place a bit, but things inevitably will fall into the toaster's crumb tray.  The crumb tray pulls out from the front for easy cleaning.The toaster has four pre-set buttons for toast, croissants, panini and bagels, and a single cancel button  You can easily pull up whatever it is you're toasting to see the toasting progress and lower it back down without stopping/cancelling the toasting process.  If you decide that your item is toasted the way you want it, just press the cancel button and the unit/heating elements shuts down pretty quickly.  There is also a knob on the side that you can dial from 1 to 5 to adjust the amount of toasting time.In my testing, the results were pretty good.  However, I'm the kind of person that likes to set it and forget it.  I love the look of this toaster and the features, but I dislike having to make adjustments in the way I prep the food to prevent dripping.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by my cheap toaster oven?  That aside, this is a nice toaster, and I would recommend it, especially those looking for a toaster to do the basics.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R4PHCM2GGNAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJLD7D4#wasThisHelpful","R1R4PHCM2GGNAR","A16RI68PS6T5CA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16RI68PS6T5CA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This beautiful sink couldn't come at a better time.  I'm in the process of building my new house, and the sink has been placed in my kitchen.As the product title indicates, this is an undermount sink.  For those that do not know, it means that the sink is mounted below a surface -- such as a countertop.  In my case, I have installed this below a granite countertop and it looks great.  This particular sink is one large single bowl measuring about 31"" x 18"".  Kohler makes other size variations to suit your needs.The key differentiating factor between this sink and most on the market today is Kohler's ""Innovation Preserve"" feature which Kohler claims makes this sink scratch resistant.  Unconvinced, I put this to the test myself.  I brought out several knives, forks, and other utensils/instruments that I figured would be able to cause some scratches.  None seemed to do the trick.As you will notice from the product page, compared to other sinks this one is expensive!  However, anyone that has owned a stainless steel sink will attest that its prone to scratches.  If scratches is something that may bother you, the added expense may be worthwhile.

It is very lightweight, the leather has a nice feel to it, lined with what feels like suede so it won't scratch your phone, snaps on to the phone easily, and is easy to grip.  It also came with a screen protector, which is often purchased separately.On the negative side, the case doesn't offer too much protection.  If you view the product images by the manufacturer, the top and bottom of the case as well as the sides for buttons are not enclosed by the case -- it is ""open"" towards the screen side.  This allows dirt to be trapped into the small ""channels"" on the sides of phone.  The case overlaps the other channel areas offering protection.Additionally, it does not appear to offer much protection for the screen.  The sides of the case, the lip, does not extend beyond the screen.  If the phone were to be dropped flat on the screen, or even simply placed on a desk, the screen will come in direct contact with the surface.  If the lip was to extend beyond each of the 4 corners of the phone slightly, it would offer a bit more protection.Although I like the look and feel of the case, I still prefer my original case.  Unfortunately for me, I use and abuse my phone a bit, and this case doesn't offer the sort of protection I need.

"First off, why not 5 stars?  -- Simple; I'm afraid the microphone is going to break. I've seen both of my boys and my fully grown-up adult aged husband all toss these down when they're frustrated at their games. A friend told me my boys aren't the only ones. It's not even that the mic feel like it will easily break, but with it sticking out during talk, and these are tossed onto the floor (or left on the floor to be stepped on.)  Other than that, I've got no reports of bad from my actual 3 users.Here's what I do have from them:(1) the lights are 'cool'(2) the headphones are very comfortable for long term(3) the headphones make my ears sweat after too long(4) likes that the mic doesn't have to be in front of his face - that it still picked up his voice(5) the sound is good*(6) likes that he can change the cord from side to side(7) wishes it would work on XBox360 also(8) shocked these don't come with a case, wondered if one is available specifically for these*I verify the sound is decent. I listened to music (yes, with the adapter you can use these on a regular headphone jack like on an iphone or computer.)  However, I did not test at loud volumes, something I think gamers hear a lot of just by nature of the games (explosion, tires squealing, fighting, etc) Still, none of my boys mentioned a loss of sound quality.If these can handle the wear and tear of a couple of competitive teens and their dad -- it might be a sign that we need to invest in another pair.

"I'm a BIG fan of Tess Gerritsen, having read all of her printed works.This story was a departure from her typical medical thriller.  Gerritsen has written outside that realm, but she most definitely has excelled in the medial thriller/mystery genre. Her voice is so natural and comfortable to read. She developed the characters well, and relatively quickly. Playing With Fire is a particularly interesting book as the story takes us between two different times, and two different groups of characters (and 2 different main characters.)  *This was slightly annoying because you'd really be getting into one part of the story and the chapter would end and you now have to read about what happened 65 years ago to someone else. Gerritsen is not usually a tease, but for this story it was almost necessary (looking at it from hindsight.)  The old story, though a terrible ending, is still actually quite beautiful in it's own right. It *did* make me cry. The modern part of the story very much had the feel of a typical Tess Gerritsen book, her voice, just without all the medical stuff (there was a teeny bit but absolutely nothing like we usually see.)I kept wondering if there was a supernatural thing going on with this story, which urged me forward to find the answers. As a fully vested reader, I HAD to know how things would turn out for both my characters and absolutely devoured this book over the course of 2 very busy days (in between everything I kept picking up the book.)There was a bit of romance. Adventure. History. Music. Psychology.  I know a Tess Gerritsen fan will like this book, but I think she's going to draw in more fans here than her normal readership.  This is a special story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1973FSGQTDKN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101884347#wasThisHelpful","R1973FSGQTDKN4","AJKN1OQ368JGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKN1OQ368JGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ok, so I've been using these for a couple of weeks. Not heavy usage yet -- it's just too early to give a great review like that. I'll come back in September to update after a bit more substantial wear and tear.Meanwhile -- I grabbed these because they are adorable. Period.  Good enough reason sometimes. But they're more like a vinyl than plastic, so the flexibility is there. Preference perhaps, but as long as my papers are in the binder as well, they should remain relatively flat. I don't need super rigid folders.I've only gotten one package, and have been trying to make my upcoming yearly lesson plans and attendance and badges and etc etc all fit into one main binder. I've had papers in and out, over and again many times lately.  And as I said, this is far from heavy use, but I think the flexibility of the folders will help keep them from ripping or splitting (and being sharp.)Complaints - I wish I had more choice in patter/color variety (ie all pink, or all chevron)I wish the price wasn't so high. Will have to keep an eye out for sales.I wish the front pocket was a little higher up to hold papers in more securely when I've 'stretched out' the pocket in the future.All in all, I like these and despite the shortcomings, I will be ordering more (when on sale, of course.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XDWLSYF7VKCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V2M9O98#wasThisHelpful","R1XDWLSYF7VKCB","AJKN1OQ368JGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKN1OQ368JGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to love this grill because I love the smaller one - which we own - but it's small and I muse about how nice it would be to have the bigger version of our grill so my family of 6 can eat together.Let's start with ""6 servings."" This grill is sizeable, but you can't put 6 sandwiches of artisan type bread on this grill. When you use larger pieces of bread the surface is only able to handle 4 sandwiches (with extra room.)  Can't attest to plain sandwich bread, but I think 6 pieces of that should fit? But I was able to make 6 (1/3lb) burgers and get them on at the same time without issue.  Depends on what you're making, but there's an idea for you about how much can fit on the grill.Temperature control. First of all, I made a label for the front/top of my grill with the temperature ratings. I don't want to have to keep referring back to the book. I've used the grill 4 times now, and I'm only getting good grill color when I've pre-heated the grill for more than 25 minutes.  Not exactly an electricity saver. And that was on MAX temperature. So now I know why they didn't automatically put temperatures on the appliance... probably don't need them as most things will need to be cooked on MAX.And then I have a problem with this grill, a physical problem that is a drawback.  I have fairly standard kitchen counters, but the cabinets prevent the George Foreman grill from opening all the way. And there's no locking mechanism to hold the grill open like that. So as I'm loading it I either have to stand there and hold the grill open with one hand and try to load it with the other, or open and close it for every item going in because it's too tall and the cabinet is in the way. The included cord is very short and does not allow for use where this won't be a problem. Now, the grill opens wide enough that I have full access to the grill plates - so if you have a kitchen situation like that, at least the food fits.We live in Phoenix, so this is still better than walking outside to grill something quickly. Outside IS an oven here in the summer... As much as this grill makes me sad and it's far from perfect, we'll still use it plenty.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VEP6NL7YDPA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUWVE#wasThisHelpful","R1VEP6NL7YDPA1","AJKN1OQ368JGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKN1OQ368JGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not even used this yet and it already deserves 2 stars... Received it today from Amazon. This was not a repackage, it was still factory sealed. Shipping box looks good, but the George Foreman box the grill came in was more banged up than the Amazon box. And so I have a broken plastic handle. It's broken enough that I can't see it staying attached for too long. Aside from the sharp edges hazard, it won't affect the grill performance I don't think.Next issue is that the directions kind of sucked. No parts list of what should be there. There's a diagram... That's small and black and white and so everything looks attached or not different from anything else.  Worthless. There's no differentiation between upper and lower leg in the diagram. You have to read the directions. The grill base frame is loose on one side, it wiggles almost a whole cm.  Directions say to attach the grill base frame to the grill base with the included screws.NO screws were included. And it would have been nice to have a parts list so I knew I couldn't do this without a trip to the store for screws first.I'll add to the review after I can get it working.

"This book was quite a good read, better than most books I've read this year.The story began immediately. Right out of the gate, you were headlong into one aspect of this storytelling (not the boring, descriptive set-up too many authors expect you to trudge through.)  Unfortunately, the ending else just basically stopped. Within 10 pages the story went from action and fast paced to resolved and over. Hence 4 stars...So as I said, off like a bat out of you know where. Love that.Having not read the authors previous book, I was at a disadvantage on characters. A lot of characters in this book are thrown at the reader all in a very short time and that was a bit much (having not read the other book.) Also, there weren't as many physical descriptions of the characters by the author. Both of these things slowed me down in the beginning.I was impressed at the prologue and epilogue. The author seemed to be genuinely grateful for the help he got, more so than probably any other prologue I've read before.This story was FAST. Full of conspiracy, full of bad government officials and corruption and greed. Shootings and chases.  Kidnappings, international travel, priests and nuns and spies, and more. (It's hard to write a review without giving up the story.)  Some was plausible. There was one incident that was repeated - which I wasn't expecting, nor did I like in the realm of storytelling.Most characters had their own perspective and voice, and that's how I like most of my stories.If you like a very fast paced book, and can grasp a little techie information, this is a great story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GXZW8K9JWR71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006227371X#wasThisHelpful","R3GXZW8K9JWR71","AJKN1OQ368JGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKN1OQ368JGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this!!!!! We just tested it out (it arrived this morning.) Now, for as long as I can remember I've used a Black & Decker Brew n Go system. I still have zero complaints about that. In fact, these function identically. The Mr. Coffee brand comes with a much nicer travel cup. It's tall and insulated well. The top has a spout cover, too. And what I really like is the especially narrow footprint. It fits in my windowsill. A whole appliance, plugged in and working, in my small windowsill.For this coffee maker, it's the ultimate in simplicity and earth loving. Brew only a 16oz cup at a time, or less. No cups or pods or any of that. There's a reusable filter basket. You don't have to tip anyone. You'll probably spell your name correctly. Oh, and it brews wicked fast. From the time you hit start (there's only ONE button) to having your cup full is about 2 minutes.My daughter will probably want one of these for college next month.

"I haven't decided, after 1 day and 3 quick recipes, if I don't like this blender or if there's a learning curve to using a blender without sharp blades.As a test, I made 3 of the recipes in the Black & Decker book. Photos are here somewhere for you to see.Let me begin with the peanut butter. The blender ran so long to get it smooth (about 1 minute, then a scrape down, and then a second minute) and it started stinking like the motor was getting really hot so I stopped. We never got it quite smooth enough for what we were aiming for. I actually checked the fire extinguisher, in case I needed it, but it was low so I decided not to make it creamier just in case. (And frankly, turns out the crunchy version was great!)Made salsa. This is where I am not used to this electronic pulse and have a learning curve. I was pressing pulse like I've done on my food processor. You know, push and release. Not so hard. But it's not the same on this Black & Decker blender. All of the ingredients were turning into a salsa smoothie on the bottom of the jar with nothing from the top coming down. After a decent amount of frustration I finally figured out to properly PULSE you need to basically touch the pulse button like it's radioactive. So fast then finger off the button before you even realize the machine did anything. Seriously, between this salsa and a couple different smoothies, this took practice to push it so quickly. Our first batch is more blended than the recipe calls for because of learning how to use the pulse function, but you can still see our salsa doesn't look bad.And then smoothies. This worked fine using the personal blending system.  I learned on the first one that the banana sticks to the side of the jar and doesn't drop down on it's own - so plan to make arrangements to give the bottle a smack to release sticky foods when using the little jar.A big drawback for me is the lack of removable blades from the main unit.  It was pretty hard to clean that thing after making peanut butter, trying to get up in there under the 'blades' was a pain. Luckily the blades aren't sharp. Still, might be just the change I'm not a fan of.Oh, and it's a plastic pitcher. Not glass. Might make a difference to you... I like that so it's not so heavy.  I can teach my kids how to make a smoothie and not worry about heavy glass or sharp blades.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5VXPHI09Z6AI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHLXLNO#wasThisHelpful","R5VXPHI09Z6AI","AJKN1OQ368JGH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJKN1OQ368JGH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Right up front:  If you buy this book because you like thrillers, hard sci-fi, and mind-tweaking visions of the future, you WILL get your money's worth.  Author Suarez is no hack, but rather has extensive knowledge of both computer gaming, and the capabilities of cyber warfare.  Mix in some futuristic weaponry (all of which has either had proof-of-concept initial testing or fits well within the realm of feasibility), some impressively thought-provoking moral and ethical complexity, and some truly perceptive rumination about where technology can and will be taking commerce and human society, and what emerges is a rollicking techno-thriller burns through preconceived notions of the future like a plasma torch cutting through aluminum siding.  So why not five stars?Well, truth be told, the writing could be spiffed up.  Considerably.  Initially taut, the book develops some plot stutters about two-thirds of the way through.  Characters in the book tend to be more suited for a graphic novel, barely reaching 2D status, much less fully fleshed out 3D personas.Bottom line?  A brilliant conception by an author whose intellectual capacity and imagination outstrip, at least in this first novel, his literary skill.  Regardless, a tale that is evocative, provocative, and a helluva fun ride.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39OX5IGL92AZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451228731#wasThisHelpful","R39OX5IGL92AZB","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use headlamps frequently.  In Central Oregon, the winter days are short enough that if I want to run, it's in the dark.  I tend to push hikes on either end of the day, showing up before dawn, or getting back after dusk.  The Icon deserves it's name: it's simply terrific.  The batteries last a stunningly long time, and the light output, in several of it's many modes, is outstanding.  The rheostat function, which allows me to smoothly increase/decrease the light output to fit the circumstances, might seem like a useless ""bells and whistles"" add on.  It isn't:  low level is perfect for me reading my Kindle or book in bed without disturbing my wife, higher levels are great for trail running in the dark hours, medium light level perfect for running on paved paths/roads.  Down sides?  Only one that I've noticed. The light can be tilted up and down, but Black Diamond erred by not giving a greater range of motion in terms of tilting the light downward.  Works just fine for ambulation/skiing/biking, not quite so well when one is stationary and trying to focus on something in one's hands.  Hopefully the next iteration will incorporate a fix for this.

"The Great Silence, the deafening LACK of contact from intelligent aliens that the Drake equation says ought to be swarming our galaxy (and the universe, if not multiverse), bothers me mightily.  And it bothers astrophysicist David Brin mightily, too.  The Great Silence is a boon to those skeptical that there is life other than on Earth, those who (modern day anti-Copernicans?) believe on some level that our home planet really IS the center of, and the only example of, sentient life that God and/or physics has managed to create.  Existence is Brin's lengthy and thorough exploration of the possibility that humans are NOT the universe's sole example of a sentient species, enriched and spiced by vigorous conjecture about the future of artificial intelligence (AI).A pertinent bit of biography regarding David Brin: he's an author with a mission.  Successful authors ply their craft for quite a variety of reasons, ranging from personal profit to polemics, from sheer love of wordsmithing to sheer love of self.  And a few write to try to change the world a bit.  Henning Mankell, the terrifically successful Scandinavian mystery writer, for example, spends a good deal of his creative energy, a significant part of his time, and no little amount of his money on promoting the social good as he perceives it.  Brin fits easily into the ""change the world a bit"" category, as a quick visit to his website will confirm.  An optimist (and a carefully reasoned one), Brin is not afraid to touch what was long a third-rail in anthropology: in his opinion evolution appears to be GOING somewhere.  In Existence, Brin makes a nuanced and sophisticated case, absent of sentimentalism or species chauvinism, that the universe is unfolding itself in a fascinating way.  Humans, should they choose to thread an endless procession of catastrophe needles, just might get to play a role in this.  The sophistication and depth of Brin's approach to this notion is the stuff of a five star novel.  Worthwhile as the book is, though, it doesn't shine with five star luminosity.My favorite creative writing teacher in college would have handed Existence back to Brin with an A for content, and a C+ for writing. One mild to moderate detraction is the liberal cut and paste approach that Brin used (maybe as a labor saving device)to graft previouly published material into Existence.  The result falls short of seamless. Secondly, the characters don't play second fiddle in this space opera, at best they're part of the stage crew.  Much like Kim Stanley Robinson in his latest hard sci-fi opus, 2312, Brin seems to frequently place the plot and characters in cryogenic suspension while he expounds (albeit entertainingly) on theories, conjectures, and technological tours de force that he has clearly been ITCHING to talk with us all about.So....an ""A"" and a ""C+"" averages out to a high ""B"", does it not?  The book is a must for those of you that were nerdy enough to download the SETI program that enlisted millions of home computers to (unsuccessfully) help search for evidence of ET's (yes, I was one of those nerds).  The additional bonus of Brin's conjectures about the future of AI makes this an almost mandatory read for the hard sci-fi buff.  But if you're into a story that flows synchronously, or into narratives that explore the intricacies of human relationships and social intercourse, and don't care all that much about the Great Silence (you really ought to!), you can pass this one by.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5MO5FJ8I0SQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0079XPMQS#wasThisHelpful","R5MO5FJ8I0SQS","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kevin Mitnick's digital universe (maybe more accurately called his playground) is composed of 0's and 1's.  On...off.  Binomial.  Would that the world of ethics could so easily be reduced to the binomial valuation of either good or evil.  Ghost in the Wires, Mitnick's marvelous memoir of his rise, fall, rise in the cyber world of hacking is breathtaking from a technological point of view, and endlessly challenging and deeply complex from an ethical point of view.I would guess that most people that pick this book up want to feed on Mitnick's audacious and brilliant run as one of the world's premier hackers, and such readers will not be disappointed.  Mitnick's penetration of well-defended company data bases, almost at will, is a tech feast version of a groaning table loaded almost to breaking point with delicious main courses, side dishes, and fantastic sweets.  The book would succeed on that basis alone.  But there are other aspects of the book that raise it above the run of the mill memoir.From the vantage point of the semi-aged (I'm 60), this book is a marvelous societal record of the kudzu like advance of technology into every aspect of our lives during the past half century.  What did hackers do before there were computers to hack? Phonephreaking, i.e. manipulating the phone service (largely in the attempt to get free long distance) is what they (and I, as a college student in the 70's) did.  I'm a technophile, and largely welcome technology into my life, but I can say that Mitnick's memoir, as he moved from phonephreaking through his first contacts with computer systems, to the development of the internet, through the dawn of the personal computers, and on to today's Wi-Fi in every coffee shop environment, was both fascinating and sobering.A good memoir gets us inside the mind of the author, and Ghost in the Wires does just that, often with disturbing effect.  Mitnick's self-portrayal varies from accuracy when he describes himself as addicted to hacking, no more able to pass up an opportunity for a major hack than a heroin addict can pass up his/her next dose, to self-delusion when equates the fact that he did not use his hacking for financial gain with never having done any harm.  Mitnick uses the term ""social engineering"" hundreds of time throughout the book, a term he uses to glibly cover the lying, the leveraging of trust to betray the confidence of those that he was scamming, the habitual and callous manipulation of humans that were acting with the best of motives, that he used to enable his hacking.  One can almost share Mitnick's glee when he used his ability to manipulate humans that were pompous fools or jerks, but in truth Mitnick's techniques of ""social engineering"" were MOST effective on humans that were helpful, trusting, and doing their best to aid another human being that seemed to need assistance.  So is Mitnick nothing more than a brilliant tech guru that is also little more than a common criminal? In a binomial ethical world, maybe yes.  But in the real world, Mitnick is the embodiment of the Coyote in Native American folklore, the Trickster that pops up in different guises in mythologies all over the world.The Coyote/Trickster, in mythology, has an essential job:  challenge, over and again, the existing system.  Probe it, exploit it.  Find the weaknesses in a system, and expose them.  Few love the Coyote/Trickster, particularly those that are left to clean up the messes being caused (in Mitnick's case, police, company investigators, the FBI, the Secret Service, Mitnick's own family).  Sociologically, though, the argument can be made that the Coyote/Trickster is ESSENTIAL to the wellbeing of any given system.  When provoked by individuals such as Mitnick, the system learns, grows, strengthens itself. In the past, people inoculated themselves with cowpox, which made them a little sick, in order to prevent themselves from getting smallpox, which could kill them.  Mitnick, a human vaccine of sorts, did cause disruption.  Expensive disruption, if one adds up the man hours and the emotional toll the search for him took.  He also taught the cyber ""immune system"" an enormous amount about how to defend itself better.  Mitnick now works actively to improve that immune system, surely one of the best societal integrations of a Coyote that I've encountered.Does any of this justify Mitnick's actions?  Well. That question is what elevates this book from a ""Gee whiz, look with I did, and look how smart I am"" tale of self-aggrandizement to what it is in fact:  an important tale of our times, to be digested carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15ZY2MBOF1T3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316037729#wasThisHelpful","R15ZY2MBOF1T3B","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It takes only modest talent to sketch out a good yarn, regardless of the fictional genre chosen.  An author has to reach deeper to give dimension to the characters in his/her yarn, and deeper yet to reflect on the complexity (both the nobility and the barbarity) of human nature.  In Speaks the Nightbird, author McCammon reaches deep, and comes up with a rich and rewarding tale.The tale, set at the very end of the 17th century in Carolina territory, involves a combination of elements that is almost sure to please:  legal drama, pirate treasure, murder mystery, a bit of international intrigue, young love, and, front and center, a young, beautiful, intelligent woman accused of witchcraft.  Guilded by a wealth of historically accurate detail that McCammon spent over two years researching, the language, the clothing, the social structures, the medical practices, and the overpowering influence of religion at the time, move the plot beyond bare bones to being fully fleshed out with the muscles, sinews, and beating heart of a high quality body of work.In the age of anti-heroic literature, where award winning novels can be read from cover to cover without discovering a single character that one really cares about, Speaks the Nightbird is a refreshing departure.  One DOES care about the characters, and takes pleasure in the successes of those that deserve rooting for, as well as in the stumbles of the villains.I generally don't enjoy historical fiction, and it was only through a bit of a fluke that I picked this story up in the first place.  Regardless of your favorite fictional genre, though, it's hard to imagine that McCammon's literary skill and strong factual and observational integrity will fail to entertain and inform those that begin to turn the pages of Speaks the Nightbird.Flaws?  The author will never be accused of being a man of few words.  In an interview regarding Speaks the Nightbird, McCammon notes that he had to rewrite the first part of the book ""because it was too long"".  The current length of the first part of the book indicates that the original version must have bordered on interminable.  Secondly, rich as many of the characters in the book are, the portrait of the woman accused of witchcraft, despite her central role, remains curiously wooden.  Way too much about her beautiful black hair and her dark-toned Portuguese skin, way too little about the inner workings of her mind.  The author's descriptions of sex (including an act of bestiality) and violence are quite graphic at times, sure to offend some readers.None of these flaws change the final verdict:  this is one fine tale. The ending invites a sequel, and McCammon has followed with at least 3 sequels to this tale since 2007.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R1PJ0IOS7QW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416552502#wasThisHelpful","R2R1PJ0IOS7QW3","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a Plant Knows is a rare and beautiful piece of science journalism. Author Daniel Chamovitz's writing threads a needle with an aperture so fine that it is only rarely successfully accomplished: in elegantly simple language that is accompanied by a gentle sense of humor and deep integrity, he guides the reader to a new door of knowledge in a fashion that guarantees one will step through it.  And once he/she steps through it, the reader's appreciation of what a plant can sense and remember (yes, remember, in a very specific sense) will be irrevocably altered.This is not a dry and dusty tome.  Though the phrase ""I read it in a single sitting"" more commonly applies to fictional thrillers (e.g. The DaVinci Code), it's applicable occasionally in science writing, and it's applicable to What a Plant Knows.  Chamovitz, is a natural born teacher.  When the reader wants to know ""How the heck does a plant know which way is up, and which way is down?"", Chamovitz refuses to plop the final answer out in one paragraph, instead, teasing the reader along the actual historical pathway that elucidates what we now know.  And in so doing, he brings the full beauty of any given aspect of plant biology into focus, but ALSO brings to light the beauty and power of science that is well done; science done by people with a careful but insatiable need to know; science done by people whose need to be accurate exceeds their desire to prove their own theory right.Chamovitz has the startling belief that the unvarnished truth is more fascinating than hyperbole, and hence What a Plant Knows is completely absent the hype and goofiness of The Secret Lives of Plants.  You won't, after reading this book, find yourself crooning your favorite songs to your tomato plants (plants, Chamovitz convincingly demonstrates, really are deaf).  But despite the fact that Chamovitz eschews sensationalism, what he says about the sensory life of plants, and what a plant can ""know"" and ""remember"" (the author very carefully defines what he means by those terms) is indeed both fascinating and sensational.The book is just plain fun.  Besides getting to learn terrific words like statoliths (essential for a plant to know which way is up, which is down), Chamovitz ups the relevancy factor multiple notches by linking the knowledge he presents to the reader with real life applications.  He, for example, lets us know just how it is that flower growers get boat loads of chrysanthemums to bloom just in time for Mother's Day. Growers of Northern California's inhalable cash crop use this knowledge in what they call their ""light dep"" (light deprivation) season.Plants, front and center, are the rock stars of this fascinating book.  But also in starring roles are the folks that quietly, carefully, and with determination, track down the truth about the way our world works:  scientists.  They look good in this book. And so does science.  Chamovitz's gentle, firm, funny, exploration of what tricks that plants have up their sheaves is full of integrity and passion.  Treat yourself to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J8Y9665WY35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374288739#wasThisHelpful","R3J8Y9665WY35","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My.  My, oh my!  You'd have to be one nano-hearted, micro-visionary, ""gone are the days of my youth"" human being not to tumble for this rollicking story of young adults taking on both the real and the virtual Universe at the same time.I won't bore you with the details of the intricate and mega-twisting plot, except to say that it is intelligent, and more fun than ten consecutive rides on the world's largest roller coasters.  And to say that all though the entire story is told through the eyes of a teenager, I (in my seventh decade of life), loved the entire story enough to neglect everything on my ever-lengthy ""to do"" list to devote full attention to finding out what the heck was going to happen next.I will leave you with a thought, though.  In an increasingly fragmented society, one in which traditional methods of identifying the values by which one lives one's life are increasingly discarded, one wonders, how DO young people learn to read their moral compasses.  And one way is by reading books like Ready Player One.  Honesty.  Integrity.  Loyalty.  Respect for all regardless of ethnic background or sexual preference.  Justice. Sharing of wealth.  Kindness.  Focus on who a person is, rather than what they look like.  A notion of romantic love NOT built solely on the yearning to exchange genetic material (i.e. sex).  Celebration of rowdy creativity, valuing education deeply, heck, even Shakespeare gets several nods.  And, in a theme rarely expressed in 21st century lit:  success comes by dint of very, VERY hard work, not by winning a lottery, or entitlement.But let me step away from all that philosophy:  Ready Player One is one fine adventure, an almost Arthurian tale with a private chat room instead of a Round Table, seasoned with intelligence, creativity, and delightfully basted in the values that would make the real world that we live in a finer place to be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M141FEWFUAA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030788743X#wasThisHelpful","R1M141FEWFUAA1","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two separate reviews in one, here: one for people that have read Kim Stanley Robinson (KSR) before, and one for those who have not.Review 1: For those that have read and enjoyed KSR in the past (e.g. veterans of the massive Red Mars, Blue Mars, Green Mars trilogy), the message is simple.  Get your hands on this book, kick back, and enjoy.  KSR is at his terraforming best here; the Solar System a fabulous playground for the relentless expansion of Earth's most potent primate species.  If you liked what KSR did with Mars, you'll find what he does with the rest of the Solar System breathtaking.  And, you'll get, almost as an afterthought, a plot involving the elements of murder mystery, romance, political intrigue, and thriller all in one.  2312, in several senses, outdoes the Mars Trilogy, and builds on it.  There is not a trace of succinctness in the entire book.  But, fan, you already knew that about KSR.Review 2:  Never read KSR?  KSR is a must read, if you think of yourself as a sci-fi buff.  Not doing so would be like claiming to be a fan of English literature, but not having read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (or if length is a criteria, George Eliot's Mill on the Floss).  And if you're going to read KSR, 2312 is a wonderful place to start.KSR writes hard sci-fi.  Virtually nothing included in this deeply imaginative exploration of what mankind's expansion throughout our solar system might look like by 2312, is without scientific foundation.  KSR is a modern day polymath, with a knowledge base that is spectacularly broad, and not lacking in depth.  What you'll be treated to in 2312 is page after page (after page, after page, after page) of KSR's informed and spectacularly innovative vision of where the marriage of technology and the human genome is headed.  And if such speculation fascinates you, stop right here and order the book:  if anyone does it better than KSR, I haven't yet encountered them.Plot?  Ah.  You're one of those:  you want a STORY along with the spectacularly high-tech scaffolding.  Hmm.  Well, there IS a story here.  And a good one.  One that could have been related in about one third of the 576 pages in this book.  There is a romance, and a mystery, and an AI thriller that triggers recall of Asimov's I Robot.  KSR is an excellent writer, and his opening scene of going for a walk on Mercury as the terrifying, searing light of the oh-so-close Sun creeps over the horizon is flat out astounding.  But plot is not his predominant strength, providing in this book just enough cohesion to graft KSR's stunningly visionary prognostications together.  I liked the plot.  Enjoyed it thoroughly.  But if plot is your most-prized quality for choosing a sci-fi novel, on the stellar scale, think white dwarf rather than supernova here:  it sheds light, but won't vaporize you with its intensity.Overall?  KSR fan:  do it.  You won't regret it.  KSR on steroids.  New KSR reader:  great place to start, and if you're a sci-fi reader, you most definitely owe yourself a KSR novel at least once in life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FVFS6VMSSK2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316098124#wasThisHelpful","R1FVFS6VMSSK2L","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a gem of book: small, dense, multi-faceted.  I don't hold an advanced degree in cosmology or physics, extracting the book's information required some focus on my part.  It was well worth the effort.Author Lawrence Krauss sets the intellectual tone for A Universe From Nothing in the first lines of his preface, quoting Jacob Bronowski:  ""Dream or nightmare, we live our experience as it is, and we have to live it awake. We live in a world which is penetrated through and through by science and which is both whole and real.  We cannot turn it into a game simply by taking sides."" Put in as slightly different way, a way that Krauss repeats several times in the book, the job of humans with intellectual integrity is to accept the world as it presents itself through evidence, whether or not we like what the evidence shows.  Is this a foreshadowing that most will not like his conclusions?  I think not.  I loved what he had to say.A Universe From Nothing is a success on at least three levels: explanatory, exploratory, and exhortational.From an explanatory point of view, Krauss is a competent and good humored educator.  Though his prose doesn't, in my opinion, match the story-telling ability of Brian Greene in The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality, or the engaging style of Richard Panek in The 4 Percent Universe: Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and the Race to Discover the Rest of Reality, it is more than adequate to lead a reader with a solid science base through the cosmology, particle physics, and quantum theory updates that are available to us in the second decade of the 21st century.  Krauss's succinct reviews of cosmic inflation, dark matter and energy, and quantum physics provide a solid underpinning for his theme that the universe does indeed appear to have come from ""nothing"", though what Krauss means by nothing is not the ""nothing"" that you grew up thinking about.In his exploratory mode, Krauss is just plain fun.  His explorations branch down at least two major pathways.  First, how do current discoveries and popular cosmological/quantum physics theories intersect with  theological/philosophical mullings over ""How could SOMETHING possibly come from NOTHING?"".  Second, leaving theology and philosophy aside, Krauss indulges in the pure pleasure of speculating about the different implications of contemporary cosmological and quantum physics theories.  He includes one of the finer, and more lucid, discussions of the anthropic principle that I have run across.  Krauss, who also wrote a book on the physics of Star Trek, deftly manages in these explorations to demonstrate that science well done is entrancing, and regularly capable of producing crops of awe-inspired goose bumps.Krauss is also unabashedly exhortational.  He makes the point repeatedly, and throughout the book, that any scientist, any human that claims intellectual integrity, must accept the universe as it presents itself, rather than as one would like to find it.  Those cosmologists that liked the notion of curved universes must yield to evidence that the universe is flat.  Those who thought the world was only 6000 years old, much yield to geology and cosmology that tags an extra 13 billion years (and loose change) on to that total.  We humans, including Einstein in his day, keep trying to bend the world into a comfortable shape.  Krauss, in effect, says ""Hey, kick back, enjoy the ride, it's all fantastically interesting, even if it isn't what you wanted!"".  Filled with a passionate love for science, Krauss exhorts us to be dispassionate in the face of properly accumulated evidence.This would not be a complete review without mentioning Krauss's thinking about God and the cosmos.  Krauss does not deny the possibility that there is a God (though his personal belief on the matter seems clear).  He forcefully denies, from the preface to the epilogue, the need to invoke digitus Dei (the finger of God) to explain the universe(s) that we are a part of.  The universe, according to Krauss, simply doesn't require divine intervention to come into existence, nor to continue its existence after it spontaneously generates itself in a fashion concordant with quantum physics.  Thomas Jefferson said, in speaking as the founder of the University of Virginia ""A professorship of theology has no place in our institution"".  This was not an attack on theism, it was a ringing endorsement of the notion that when trying to explain the world that we live in, one should rigorously pursue natural explanations, to the exclusion of supernatural explanations.  Reliable knowledge about the universe we live in, felt Jefferson, will come through science, not theology.  Krauss could not agree more heartily.Finally, after reading this book, few will think of the concept of ""nothing"" in a way that has even remote resemblance to prior conception.  In a sense, the book calls into question even the notion of ""nothing"".  And though Krauss doesn't explicitly discuss it, the distinction between ""something"" and ""nothing"" takes a serious hit in his narrative.  How's that?  Well.  That would be a spoiler, would it not?","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KR79MS1FH0NS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=145162445X#wasThisHelpful","R2KR79MS1FH0NS","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm an intermittent King reader.  Started with Carrie when it was published, railed at King's inability to pull epics like The Stand together for a satisfying ending, and gradually drifted away from all contact with him.  But the premise of this book was a fine one, and I stuck my reader's toe in the pool, liked the temperature, and jumped in.  Loved the swim.Steven King has been through quite a bit in his life, including his near fatal car versus pedestrian accident a few years ago.  He has a long term marriage, and some real authority on what love is.  He was once a full time teacher, a heroic job by anyone's standards.  He has known poverty and he has known great wealth.  And by virtue of all that, in 11-22-1963 he instills what can only be called wisdom into the tale.  Yes, there are the trademark squirm-fests, when describing gore and the emission of various body fluids/solids.  But they are subdued.  Yes, there are the thinly veiled pokes at religious obsession, but no rants.  Yes, at times one wishes that King was forced to write the way that chess masters sometimes play speed chess, with only so many minutes allowed for moves.  And yet....in 11-22-1963, it all works.It all works because Stephen King LIKES being human.  He LIKES America.  He LIKES women that are smart and strong.  He likes to imagine, and he believes that the actions that we take in life make a difference, maybe a huge difference.  I'm going to remain solidly non-spoiler here:  this is one of King's best works in years, it's a work for him to be proud of.  More thought-provoking than scary, it'll leave a mark on you.  A good one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L8UUMCWEE002/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451627289#wasThisHelpful","R3L8UUMCWEE002","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kayt Sukel's brief, succinct, humorous, and thoroughly scientific book about love, sex, and relationships is well worth the price of admission.  Though a trifle technical in spots (you'll become more familiar than you perhaps want to be with terms like ventral pallidum, ventral tegmental area, caudate nucleus), Sukel's skill as a science writer, and warmth as a human being, will keep you from running permanently aground on technical lingo.Dirty Minds is no small achievement.  Though providing excellent and cogent results of contemporary research on emotion and the variety of forms of love (ranging from immediate sexual gratification to life time partnerships), Sukel never denies the mystery and wonder of the actual experience of being in love.  Or in lust.  Or simultaneously both.Sukel is more careful than most, when presenting the results of provocative studies, to provide abundant qualifiers, and careful instructions about the dangers of over generalizing.  Nevertheless, when one is done with this book, one will never listen to a friend obsess about his/her new love without thinking about the neurohormonal storm, and the highly fired up parts of the friend's neuroanatomy that are contributing to the (usually) temporary loss of sanity that the friend is in the grips of.  In the same way that the steadily increasing knowledge about what, on a hormonal and neuroanatomical level, leads to depression and subsequent treatment options, Dirty Minds allows either the victim of one of Cupid's arrows, or the witness to a friend or family member similarly pierced, to actually take an informed course, if one is required or desired.Without being sensationalistic, Sukel raises ethical issues.  As the neuro chemistry/anatomy of love (all forms) becomes increasingly clear, it also becomes clear that ""treatment"" might be available for the lovesick.  Are we ready for either a very effective Love Potion #9, or a very effective ANTI-Love Potion #2?  If your teenager was in love with an undesirable person, would you consider slipping a medication that could end that obsession into their soft drink?  Not idle speculation, based on the research Sukel presents.Finally, kudos to Sukel for her humility, her openness about her own experiences, and her simple and warm celebration of the human experience.  Her writing is a wonderful example of what happens when you merge competent science with liberal arts skills.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D69MJEJFPPV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451611552#wasThisHelpful","R3D69MJEJFPPV1","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Professor Rebecca Stott's latest book has a misleading title .  No matter.  The final product is brilliant, highly entertaining, deeply thought-provoking, and astoundingly informing; an intellectual/academic feast from beginning to end that is equally accessible to those who favor the liberal arts and those who live for scientific discourse.  But it's not all that much about Darwin.  What's it about?  The Wikipedia comment on Darwin's Ghost just about nails it:  ""(Rebecca Stott) has now completed an epic account of the history of evolution before Darwin which documents a 2,200 year history, a tale of heretics and free thinkers who were prepared to risk public censure or even imprisonment by asking questions that challenged religious orthodoxies.""  The point?  This is not a book about whose shoulders Darwin (and/or Alfred Wallace) stood on when they came to their virtually identical concept on the origin of species.  It's about the pitched battle between religion and science on issues geological, astronomical, and most especially, biological.Stott has written at least two novels hallmarked by suspense, and has a reputation for being able to blend science and the arts in a way that does credit to both fields.  Her wonderful ability to merge her literary and historical skills with solid science reporting results in a book that reads like a historical novel, but is backed by 75 pages of references.  Though Stott starts with Aristotle, and follows up with some little known theorists (e.g. Arab thinker Jahiz, ninth century C.E.), and includes an interlude with Leonardo da Vinci (eat your hearts out, Lyn Margulis and James Lovelock: da Vinci had the concept of Gaia centuries before you were zygotes!), it is not until the French Enlightenment that the figurative cannon fire explodes on many fronts.  Or as polymath/heretic Diderot put it ""It is raining bombs in the house of the Lord"".The churches of the 18th and 19th (might one include the 20th and 21st?) centuries, both Catholic and Protestant, were not to be pried easily from the account in Genesis in which God creates each of the species, and gives man dominion over the earth.  As a growing chorus of voices (well detailed in Darwin's Ghosts) began to sing the notion that species evolved, were mutable,  possibly came from a common ancestor, Stott summarizes the responses of the major religions, and the European governments that often functioned as theocracies:  ""It struck at the heart of the Christian religion, clerics declared; it contradicted the  biblical account of creation; it sullied the idea of a benevolent God who had designed the universe for the enjoyment of man;  it belittled the position of man in the universe; it challenged belief in man's divinely granted dominion; it contradicted biblically based estimates that the earth was around 6000 years old.  It was not to be supported.""  Eminent writers, philosophers, scientists often lost all social standing, were often financially ruined, and were sometimes imprisoned.  Joseph Priestly, famous for isolating the element oxygen, had his estate ransacked, and returned to find graffiti stating ""For God and King"" in the ruins of his home.Darwin's Ghosts also chronicles the remarkable adaptations that evolved out of this persecution:  revolutionary ideas were couched in epic poems, in fictional discourses, in anonymously published books that had been smuggled to Holland, printed, and smuggle back into the countries where they were banned.Darwin's Ghosts is not a perfect book, though with editing that was just a hair more discriminating it would be a legitimate Pulitzer Prize candidate.  Chief amongst the flaws, though a charming flaw it is, is author Stott's seeming inability to relinquish ANY of the fascinating gems she discovers in her research. .  One gets the sense that as Stott did her extensive research, she became the literary equivalent of a hoarder.  The chapters are JAMMED with factoids, including who was sleeping with who.  Fascinating though it might be on some level, knowing exactly what kind of plants are in a scientist's garden (for decorative, not scientific, purposes) teeters on the ""too much information"" fulcrum.Overall?  Professor Stott notes that in 1844, a literary critic reviewed a book suggesting radical new ways of looking at biology and geology called Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, by brilliant writer/publisher Robert Chambers.  The critic wrote "" We have found so many great results of knowledge and reflection that we cannot too earnestly recommend (this book) to the attention of thoughtful men"".  To eliminate the double negative, I earnestly recommend this book to the attention of thoughtful men and women everywhere!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A0PR39EDJGUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400069378#wasThisHelpful","R2A0PR39EDJGUO","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beautiful cone shaped bottle with a silvery label: kudos to the product container designers.  How about the product itself?  Mixed emotions.  Pure water, about a cup of coffee's worth of caffeine, reportedly without taste. Is this a product that will cause a market stampede?Most likely not.  If you need a caffeine boost with zero calories, but don't like coffee or tea, there are a host of products already saturating the market.  These range from NoDoz tablets, to energy drinks (which do come in zero calorie varieties) to the many diet colas and sodas (Diet Coke, Diet Pepsi, the potent Diet Mountain Dew, Diet Dr. Pepper) all of which are significantly cheaper per dose of caffeine than Avitae, and all come with flavor, to boot.As far as I can tell, Avitae's only claims to fame are that it has only two ingredients (water and caffeine), and that it is tasteless (literally, not metaphorically).  My experience: it does have a very faint, but real, slightly bitter taste.  Not unpleasant, but noticeable if you're paying attention.I was ready to write this off as another oddball marketing excursion, but for the following anecdote.  Last weekend I drove 400 miles down from Oregon to meet up with my brothers for a 100 mile bike ride in California (The Chico Wildflower Century).  The ride was the easy part, staying awake and alert on the 5.5 hour drive home afterwards was the tough part. Despite a Venti Starbucks latte, about 3 hours into the journey home, I began to feel a bit drowsy.  Reaching over to my duffel bag, I fetched the Avitae, cracked it open, sipped it over the next fifteen minutes.  Results? Perfect:  I felt alert, comfortable, zero stomach distress (sometimes coffee gives me some rumbles), and I cruised on home without incident.

"The origin of this book is a simple one:  The editor, John Brockman, tossed out the question ""What scientific concept would improve everybody's cognitive toolkit?"" to over 150 contemporary thought leaders, and recorded the results.  Brockman has worked for decades to bring thinkers together, under the premise that great things happen when cross-disciplinary exchanges of brilliant thinking take place.  Bacteria, because they are so profligate in exchanging genetic information across species, are astoundingly capable of arriving at new and adaptive solutions to environmental (including antibiotics) challenges.  Brockman, I'm guessing, would be comfortable with the notion that in posing annual questions to leaders in the fields of many different disciplines he is increasing the adaptability, creativity, and problem solving capabilities of the human race.  This Will Make You Smarter is excellent evidence that he may well be correct.  Bacteria have something to teach us.Almost everyone gets a say here: astrophysicists, sociologists, environmentalists, historians, microbiologists, newspaper columnists, particle physicists, philosophers, and a host of notables in other disciplines.  The result is a truly provocative treasure heap of notions that just might do what the title of the book claims.  The book is a bucket of pearls:  succinct (for the most part!) notions with real punch are the order of the day.  John Brockman's website, Edge.org, aims to represent cutting edge ideas, and the included authors often are forced to create neologisms or resurrect arcane vocabulary (e.g. Interbeing and apophenia) to express their thoughts fully.This book is not a quick read.  I left it at my bedside and knocked off a few every evening, often with a new concept, or an improved version of an old one, caroming around the confines of my cranium as I drifted off to sleep.  Some ideas seemed both verbose and obtuse. Most seemed refreshing and useful.  My favorite was also the shortest of all the selections, almost haiku like in intensity.  In its entirety, here is Susan Fiske's (Princeton Professor of Psychology) essay:  ""The most important scientific concept is that an assertion is often an empirical question settled by collecting evidence.  The plural of anecdote is not data, and the plural of opinion is not facts.  Quality peer-reviewed scientific evidence accumulates into knowledge. People's stories are stories, and fiction keeps us going. But science should settle policy.""As several previous reviewers have noted, this book is available free online at Edge.org.  Why spend ten bucks? There is one reason that you might want to consider:  it's a book that you'll savage with your pen, assaulting the pages with highlighter ink, filling the margins with thoughts, and littering the essays with circles and exclamation marks.  You'll pull it down off your bookshelf regularly, every time you want tangible evidence in your hands that human beings do, on occasion, have some REALLY good ideas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PTLFKE4B1LEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062109391#wasThisHelpful","R2PTLFKE4B1LEQ","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"172 Hours on the Moon (original title: Darlah) is a product of Norwegian author and pop icon Johan Harstad's fertile and darkly hued imagination.  Though it is miles apart in style and presentation from the typical American young adult sci-fi novel, for the reader that likes to step off the beaten path now and then, and isn't afraid of what dangers lurk, 172 Hours is your ticket to the moon and beyond.172 Hours is alien in more than one respect.  Written in Danish and later translated into multiple languages (including English), a slight mental shifting of gears is required to get into the flow of the book.  Similar to, but not as demanding as, the first few minutes of a movie with subtitles:  it's a distraction for a bit, and then you no longer notice it.  Give your mind's eye a moment to refocus and you'll be rewarded with the author's Scandinavian perspective on the world, a perspective that has made the Scandinavian mystery/crime novels such a sensation (e.g. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo).This book is a chilling one, made all the more so by the author's habit of integrating historical fact into the narrative.  There really was, on 8/15/77, a radio signal received by an early version of SETI, that remains inexplicable.  Was the famous 6EQUJ5 signal, aka the ""Wow!"" signal, alien in origin?  Might Stephen Hawking be right when he warns that we shouldn't be trying so hard to contact aliens, because we simply don't know what their intentions might be?  And how about the concept of the doppelganger that is woven into the story?  Were John Dunne, Abraham Lincoln, Goethe, and one of Percy Shelley's friends all just imagining the exact replicas of themselves and others that they claim to have witnessed?  Was the case of Emilie Sagee in 1845 simply mass hysteria, or do doppelgangers actually inhabit our world (or in this case, the Moon)?Harstad adds to the reader's pleasure by a series of unique illustrations, as well as well-drawn descriptions of the life of young musicians that are trying to make a name for themselves.  Harstad is both a musician and a graphic illustrator, and the authenticity of his own experience enriches the portrayal of his characters.Harstad won an award for youth literature for this book.  If you're a teacher or a school librarian, should you add it to the collection you make available to your students?  Hmmm.  There is no graphic sex.  There is some moderately graphic violence.  If the choice were up to me, I'd make the book freely available with this proviso:  take the time to discuss the book afterwards with any student that reads it.  Death stalks these pages.  It is increasingly unlikely that we are alone in our galaxy.  When we stare up at the stars on a crystal clear night, should we feel a peaceful awe, or should we feel (along with Stephen Hawking) deep foreboding?  Singer Bonnie Raitt has a song with the reprise ""Let's give `em something to talk about"".  With this book, Johan Harstad has most certainly done that!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY3B23WNZ8S41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316182885#wasThisHelpful","RY3B23WNZ8S41","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ship Breaker, Paolo Bacigalupi's fast-moving eco-adventure set in the not too distant future, is high quality science fiction that fulfills the classical belief that art should both entertain and instruct. It's good stuff.  How good?  As good as Heinlein, Norton, and Asimov (all dead before the most likely readers of Ship Breaker were able to read a novel), and as good as any contemporary writer of young adult science fiction.  Doubtful?  Send your objections to the folks that have nominated Bacigalupi for, and often awarded him, a boat load of literary awards (including a Finalist National Book Award for this book).What makes Ship Breaker a stand out young adult novel?  Take all the standard (and much loved!) ingredients, including a small but tough protagonist, genetically augmented human/animal hybrids, cross-cultural romance, high tech whiz-bang, and the human struggle for survival in a post environmental apocalypse world.  Mix well.  Add moral conflict: loyalty versus greed, bravery versus common sense and/or cowardice, honesty versus self-serving deception.  Spice it with complex themes, such as an abusive father that raises the often relevant 21st century question of what does ""family"" really mean?  Is family a genetic relationship, or more a matter of human bonds with those who care for you, and put themselves at risk for you?  Simmer the stew long enough to allow the hero and heroine to figuratively and literally weather several storms, long enough for them to choose what type of humans they wish to become.  Consume the result, and sit back to enjoy that wonderful sense of satisfaction that comes from a creation that is both delicious and nutritious.A few months ago I asked an eighteen year old that had never been to a church in her life, and who professed little interest in whether or not there is a personal God ""So, where do you get your values?  How do you choose how you will act, and what you believe in?"".  She paused for a bit, looked thoughtful, and then said ""Well, I listen to stories.  I read.  I watch movies.  I think about what I've read, or seen, and then I decide what kind of person I'd most like to be."".  Ship Breaker, though salted throughout with mild to moderate profanity, and laced with significant violence, is not just a good story.  It is a modern morality play.  Choices have real consequences.  Decisions aren't simple.  Bacigalupi acknowledges shades of gray in this world, but does not waver on a central theme:  how you treat others, and how you treat the planet that you live on, matters.  His characters grow by confronting their moral dilemmas, sometimes at mortal cost, rather than running from them.  If the eighteen year old girl I mentioned above were to read Ship Breaker, I'd be confident that what she carried away from it would be compatible with the moral values that many of us received through more conventional approaches.  And this, I'm thinking, is a very good thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CDEXN6KSTHKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316056219#wasThisHelpful","R3CDEXN6KSTHKT","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a boneyard of bicycle tail lights strewn around my garage.  I commute year round in Central Oregon, 45 minutes each way.  In the winter months, when the sun comes up around 8:30 AM, and goes down by 4:15 PM, that means I'm riding in the dark, coming and going.  Though I choose my route carefully, there are a couple of ""tight spots"" along the way where I really want to be seen.  During the last year or so, a variety of truly bright tail lights have come out, visible during daylight hours from quite a distance.  The Cygolite Hotshot 2-Watt USB, in my mind, is the best.Is there a noticeable difference between a 2 watt LED and a single watt?  My wife, who overtakes me in her car on the way to work, says ""YES!"".  She notes that the Cygolite is easily the brightest tail light I've ever used.What's to like?  Easily detachable/attachable.  Multiple modes.  Very long life on a single charge, well over 24 hours even at the brightest setting.  Gotta love the USB rechargeable battery:  at the end of my work week, I pop the light off my bike, charge it (2-3 hours), pop it back on, good to go for at least another week.  No prying covers off, no batteries to dispose of.What's less to like?  If you belong to a group of night riders, you'll have to tone down:  this light is obnoxiously bright even to some cars, much less to a fellow rider right behind you.  The light intensity, in fairness, is very adjustable.  Mode selection is easy, adjusting the intensity of the light took me a bit of practice, and cost me a bit of frustration.I've been using this light for five months.  I'm loving its ease of use.  I'm loving that it's so bright that cars often give me far more room than I need to feel safe.  It's high daytime visibility is a real plus on my recumbent.

"This is a review for people that are NOT raving Elmore Leonard fans.  If you ARE a dyed in the wool Leonard fan, go ahead, get it over with:  draw down on me with your literary Sig Sauers and Glocks, empty your clips, and move on to the next victim that dares to give one of the master's books less than five stars.  But if you're new to Elmore Leonard, or have only sampled his prolific writing (over 40 novels) in the past, allow me to draw out my antiquated Colt six-shooter and take half a dozen shots at this patched together, moderately entertaining, barely deserving of the name, novel.Before my twitchy trigger finger lets loose on the keyboard, let's get a few things straight, amigos.  Elmore Leonard at his best has only a few peers amongst American authors.  His gritty story lines often pack so much realism into the plot that you figure Leonard must have LIVED the stories, rather than just written about them.  Leonard's skill in writing dialogue has captured the attention and the admiration of some of America's best authors and critics.  Leonard, in stories like Get Shorty, defines the notion of cool with an exactness and ultra high definition that may well be unmatched in the literary world.  Step back, Ian Fleming and your poser character James Bond:  you don't deserve to be within a hundred yards of your average Leonard hero/antihero.But I'm not drawing my six-shooter out to plug Elmore Leonard: it's this cow-chip of a semi-novel that I aim to make dance in the dirt.  If you're an uber fan, go ahead and read it, so that you can say ""I've read `em all!"".  But the rest of you.....don't pile this one on your stack of ""must reads"".Round number one:  this isn't a novel.  Or if it is, it's the first posthumous novel published while the author is still alive.  It is so fragmented and disjointed that it reads like those perpetually unsatisfactory attempts to take the scattered pieces of a book that was in process when an author died, and stitch it into a pseudo-novel so that the family estate can hear the ching of the cash register one last time. In this case, Leonard seems to have used plot fragments from his TV series to attempt a coherent piece.  This is a disservice to the reader.Round number two: the crappy plot devices just don't serve.  The thrill of letting a hero get himself painted into a corner is all in the ingenious way that he/she escapes that doomed little piece of real estate.  Raylan Givens, our hero, does get painted into predictable (from a mile away) corners, or in this case plopped into a bathtub, but the escapes that Leonard hands us are lazy, unimaginative, and smacking of downright creaky deus ex machina.Round number three: Leonard is an excellent portrait artist, using words to bring to life fascinating and fully fleshed characters.  Which he does again in this book, EXCEPT in the case of our hero Raylan himself, who has no more depth than a 2D poster advertising the latest Western.Round number four:  Women in the book are divided into smart and beautiful pond scum, and less intelligent pond scum.  To qualify as an attractive woman in Raylan, you have to be gorgeous and dangerous.  Forget the sugar and spice recipe.  The ingredients are equal parts raw ego, evil goddess, sociopath.  Each of the women our hero Raylan considers sleeping with is self-centered to an extreme that relegates the word narcissistic to the category of euphemism.  There are other women in the book, such as low IQ prostitutes, and former low IQ prostitutes that have now moved on to being low IQ drug addict bank robbers.  One woman in the book has brains and ambition, and a lucrative gambling habit.  But not one has the cool, ethical, and heroic qualities of several of the male characters.  Come down with a moderate case of misogynistic flu, Mr. Leonard?  Ah, well.  It's been going around for a few millennia.Round Five: Macaroni and cheese is the main item on the menu.  The macaroni being some tried and true, but trite, appeals to the sensibilities of the honest working man.  In this case coal miners.  The cheese being the less than candid split of the world into the good guy laborers and the evil amoral management.  No denying the truth that some coal companies are equally adept at wreaking damage on the environment and on the lives of men.  The book Raylan tells an important story using an almost comic book format that seems more fit for a failed TV series than for engendering serious thought.Round Six:  Difficult tight rope to walk here, but what's life without risk?  Leonard, in this book, follows the lead of many fine, but aging, male authors before him:  the older the male author, the more they focus on sex.  Not just any sex (an aspect of human life that I'm a fan of), but a version of sex that seems perilously close to an old man's fantasy.  My favorite sci-fi writer, Robert Heinlein, drifted down this path in his later years.  In this world, young college students in their early 20's fall head over heels with middle-aged guys with fine cowboy hats and who answer questions like ""Have you ever used that gun to kill anyone?"" in the laconic affirmative.  Yawn.Cylinders empty, slight curl of smoke from the barrel.  Final thought?  Why read a book like Raylan in which gleams and sparkles of Leonard's vast talents peak out through piles of dross, when one can go back into his earlier career and read his writing in its full glory?  If you're a Leonard fanatic, you know you're going to read this book no matter what I say.  If you're less acquainted with him, but want a very fine reading experience, go back in time and experience him at his peak, rather than this trough.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NOVOP4X5WXEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006211946X#wasThisHelpful","R1NOVOP4X5WXEM","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Using simple and clear language (often in a playful way) and creative illustrations, Dawkins' words and McKean's art work contrast the simple and elegant beauty of what science has to say about natural phenomena with the murk and confusion of invoking the supernatural.Adults with a solid science education will not find much new in The Magic of Reality.  I didn't.  But what I can say with complete candor is that had I read this in middle school or high school, it would have chopped a good fifteen years off of the confusion I endured while trying to mesh my religious faith with my hunger for scientific explanations of natural phenomena.  My wife is a middle school teacher, and she covers much of the ground in this book with her sixth graders.  For young men and women who lack, as did I, school teachers as science oriented as my wife, this book offers a whoppingly good shortcut to achieving a science-based world view.As one would expect from a scientist of Dawkin's stature, the information presented is impeccably vetted.  But is it readable? Is it fun?  Brief story that gives a hint of an answer:  Noticing that I had my ADHD nose buried in this book for an uncharacteristically long time, my wife asked to see what I was reading.  When I tilted the book toward her to show it, she was intrigued by the illustrations, and took it from me.  She wouldn't give it back.  I had to choose between marital accord and other reading material.  I picked up my April issue of Scientific American. The next morning, before she was awake, I reclaimed my prize.The Magic of Reality is a serious and solid attempt to show that elegant scientific explanations of the phenomena that we experience every day are more beautiful, and more awe-inspiring, than the legends, myths, and religious explanations that are often substituted for more rational explanations.  Dawkins is a better scientist than he is a writer, and his prose lacks the dazzling punch of the selected articles in The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2011.  Nevertheless, the finished product is a wonderful accomplishment and a marvelous gift to young minds, or to older minds that retain a strong spark of youthful curiosity and a persistent bent toward inquiry.  Would that I could have read this when I was sixteen, instead of sixty!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23YWVPITLCW2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439192812#wasThisHelpful","R23YWVPITLCW2C","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Walk Two Moons, Sharon Creech's gentle and intriguing story that combines elements of mystery, romance, loss, and coming of age, won five literary awards, including the prestigious Newbery Award.  Turning the pages of this beautifully written tale, meeting the exquisitely drawn characters, absorbing Creech's rich and colorful prose, and being tantalized by a plot with more hairpin twists than the steepest mountain pass you've ever driven, one can easily see why the book has been so honored.The details of the plot are best left unsaid, as they can't reflect the richness of this story that is more a multi-layered parable than a young adult novel.  It is not the plot that is so unusual in Walk Two Moons, though its highly creative nature makes is delightfully unpredictable.  In the same way that one can have a grocery chain store apple pie out of a thin cardboard box and have a limited culinary experience, and then have a slice of apple pie prepared by a master chef that comes close to transporting one to a different dimension, it is Creech's telling of the story that makes the it a dramatically different experience.  And, truly, it's not a stretch to say that in the telling of the story Creech opens up new dimensions to the reader.Though I'm reluctant to discuss plot details, it is worth highlighting the highly effective device that Creech uses to unfold the plot:  a 2000 mile long road trip, moving east across the northern stretches of America.  In a car without DVD players, MP3 players, or even a radio, young narrator Salamanca spends the trip telling her grandparents her ""Phoebe story"".  The aging grandfather's inability to drive either fast or far gives the trip a pacing that allows the grandparents to hear Salamanca's story in full detail, and for them to give Salamanca in return a good deal of the story of their own lives, and the life of Salamanca's missing mother.  Sometimes Salamanca's tale holds center stage; sometimes the stops at some of America's most treasured destinations (e.g. Yellowstone, Mt. Rushmore) are front and center. But whatever is on the stage, the notion of a grandfather, a grandmother, and a granddaughter moving through the country with their ears filled with conversation, family history, and the accumulated wisdom of lives well-lived instead of a tinny jangle emanating from ear buds hooked to an electronic device creates a powerful sense of longing for deep human communication and connection.A small aside.  Creech taught children (and adults).  The classroom scenes in Walk Two Moons are grounded in the author's experience, rather than her imagination.  It is refreshing to read about teachers that suffer from an abundance of enthusiasm, and whose worst flaws spring from loving teaching too much, rather than too little.  I have the great fortune to be married to such a teacher, and feel honored by Creech's portrayal of one of life's most noble professions.Walk Two Moons is a beautiful tale.  Pandora had her famous box. When she opened it all the evils in the world escaped, leaving only one thing at the bottom of the box: Hope.  Sharon Creech's box is different than Pandora's.  Open it and you'll find that it is filled with contents more reflective of the world that we live in: objects and circumstances of great beauty mixed with circumstances and objects that are deeply painful.  Regardless of all other contents, Pandora and Creech both have the same object at the bottom of their boxes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OPQ17QGJQPEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060560134#wasThisHelpful","R3OPQ17QGJQPEU","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Regardless of what your taste in literature is, consider throwing down a slug of Gelasimov.  Thirst, his most recent book to be translated from Russian into English, may not intoxicate you, but it will alter your consciousness a bit.  If you read solely to cater to your dopamine receptors (i.e. for pleasure alone), it would probably be best to look elsewhere than to Thirst.  Thirst is not without pleasurable moments, but few would call it a feel good novel.So why bother with this short (just over 100 pages) and often grim and gritty novel?  Xenophilia and a taste for inclusivity, would be a couple of good reasons.  More on them in a moment.The story is not a complex one.  Taking place over a few weeks and told in the first person, the protagonist Konstantin and two of his Chechnyan War buddies spend a couple of weeks driving around Moscow looking for a fourth war buddy that has disappeared unexpectedly.  When the search is resolved, each of the members of the trio returns to his respective life, subtly but significantly deviated from the paths each had been on.Konstantin introduces himself to us while struggling to find the maximum number of vodka bottles that can be fit into his refrigerator.  ""All the vodka wouldn't fit in the fridge. First I tried standing the bottles up, and then I laid them on their sides, one on top of the other. The bottles stacked up like transparent fish. Then they hunkered down and stopped clinking.  But ten or so just wouldn't fit.""  Konstantin, who suffered terribly disfiguring burns to his face when the armored personnel carrier that he was in was attacked, is obviously a thirsty man.  What exactly he thirsts for is the subject of the novel.  And whether you like vodka or not, you would have to have a deeply Siberian temperament not to share a craving for what Konstantin thirsts for.Xenophiliacs, those that love stepping inside cultures that are foreign to their own, will treasure this dusty window pane view into contemporary Russia seen through eyes of young men.  The grayness of the social landscape recalls, but does not approach the intensity of, the colorless landscape of Cormac McCarthy's The Road.  As the trio drives around in an SUV for several weeks, the reader is treated to a kaleidoscopic view of urban life in today's Moscow.Gelasimov's pen is an inclusive one; all humans are invited to sit with him at his literary table.  Though the Chechnyan War and post-USSR Russia provide ample fodder for anti-government, or anti-corruption, rants, Gelasimov (as the mini-bio at the end of the book points out) keeps conflict on a personal level:  problems begin, and problems are resolved, one-on-one between humans.  Our failures and/or our successes occur at a personal level.  There are no rages against the machine in Thirst.  Rather there is a gentle and restrained insistence that forward motion is not a matter of revolution, overthrow, or political ideology, but rather a matter of human relationship.Humans can thirst for power, money, sex, status, alcohol.... the list is long.  The thirst that Konstantin attempts to slake is not in the above categories.  Identifying what will sooth his scorched and parched soul is the subject of Thirst.  Curious?  Read Thirst and enjoy.  Gelasimov may go down a bit rough, like a shot of hard liquor, but the subsequent sense of warmth is worth the price of an initial grimace or two.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L4R4E9EEZQLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611090695#wasThisHelpful","R3L4R4E9EEZQLF","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a heavy duty ear bud user, commuting an hour and a half per day on a bicycle while listening to audiobooks, listening to podcasts during long car trips, more audiobooks when on long training runs.  Ear buds have always been a source of irritation for me.  Often uncomfortable, often low quality sound, and worst of all, short-lived.  Maybe its something about the constant up and down of jogging with ear buds in place, but I've gone through dozens of earbuds because within a month or two, one earbud or the other cuts out.  Metal fatigue in the tiny wires?  Dunno, but real.I bought two sets of the Gogroove Ergonomic Earbuds a few months back.  My wife and I use them mercilessly, and in all kinds of weather conditions.

"At a conference I attended once, a young and fiercely idealistic CEO of a hospital stated his goal in life:  ""When I lay my head down for the last time, when it is my time to die, I want to be able to look back over the years and know that what I did with my life, professional and personal, changed the lives of my family and friends, and the lives of the people that came through my hospital system, in a deeply positive way"".  Blue Nights, Joan Didion's memoir/partial autobiography/memorial to her husband and daughter, is a sort of ""Now I lay me down to sleep"" narrative, delivered from the vantage point of 75 years of life on planet Earth.Didion's life pathway has been strewn with deaths of family members (husband and daughter) and significant friends, as well as with not a few health problems of her own.  There is an Arab saying ""All sunshine makes a desert"".  There has most certainly been rain in Didion's life.  A memoir such as Blue Nights offered the opportunity to see what oases of wisdom and tranquility could bloom in the desert when the water of tragedy is applied. Did Didion utilize this opportunity?  Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist and neurologist that survived the Holocaust, said ""Who is to give light must endure burning"". Blue Nights offered Didion the opportunity to share light with her readers,  light emanating from the searing pain of personal loss that she suffered.  Most simply put, many cultures have come up with proverbs that reduce to this:  without pain, there is no wisdom.  Didion details the pain that she has experienced in life in Blue Nights.  Does she leverage that pain to bring her readers wisdom?  Does Blue Nights give light that radiates from the intense suffering that Didion has endured?  All humans eventually face death, both our own, and of those we love.  When the sunshine in Didion's life was obscured by the rain storms that befell her (and befall all of us), is it clear in Blue Nights that she used those floodwaters to nurture the growth of wisdom that we readers might vicariously access?  I would argue that in writing the beautiful prosody and intriguing autobiographical tale of Blue Nights....that Didion did not, or could not, answer those questions in the affirmative.Memoirs can be read for a variety of reasons, all of which are probably legitimate.  Read from the point of view of gaining an interior view of the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of one of America's great writers, Blue Nights succeeds.  Many psychologists and psychiatrists agree that loss of a child is the single most stressful event adults can endure, and Didion's formidable writing talents bring home such a tragedy with devastating force.  Blue Nights also succeeds on the ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" level.  Didion does compulsive name-dropping in this book.  At times, when she feels the reader might not understand the importance of the person she is has just mentioned, the story veers away from tragedy into a Wikipedia like segment on just WHY the person she is mentioning is such a luminary.  Such is the case when we become thoroughly informed about the importance of an organized crime figure whose table Didion sits at.  At best, such information seems like a bit of a non sequitur; at worst, blatant self-aggrandizement.Quintana Roo, Didion's adopted daughter who died at age 39, occupies a front and center position in the book.  I should mention that I have been a Joan Didion fan for 40 years.  I'll also say that in Blue Nights I felt that Didion's treatment of the agony of losing a child veered into frank melodrama, and cloying sentimentalism.  Didion's writing, long an example to me of startlingly insights and clear-eyed  analyses of the country and culture that she has grown up in, has seemed almost absent of sentimentality and melodrama in the past.  No longer is this the case.  It is true that sentimentality and melodrama sell well in the entertainment world.  Most would agree that neither are the hallmarks of excellence in art.Those that enjoy highly detailed accounts of celebrity lives will be entertained by Blue Nights. Readers actively pursuing the liqueur of wisdom that can be distilled from the crazy fermentation called life are not likely to find resonance with this book.  Some say that the definition of important art is that it both entertains AND informs.  Blue Nights makes it halfway there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OLBS3HG7Q0OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307267679#wasThisHelpful","R3OLBS3HG7Q0OP","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This spiffy item's claim to fame is that will keep your ears warm AND keep the sweat out of your eyes. By applying a soft, yellow, thin, water impermeable band to the part of the headband that fits against the forehead, the Halo people claim that sweat will be diverted away from the eyes. Ridiculous, I thought.  I bought the headband because I needed something for my chilly winter bike commutes, and similarly chilly Central Oregon winter runs. But it's so comfortable that I use it summer and winter.  Here's the kicker:  the dang thing actually works as claimed.  When I work up a sweat, the perspiration from my forehead comes down, hits the barrier, and then runs harmlessly off to the sides where it trickles down the side of my face, instead of into my eyes.Bonus! The material it is made of is the best sound insulation I've found yet for bicycling.  When I slip the Halo over my earphones and tap my iPod on: heaven.  It holds the earpieces securely in place whether I'm running or biking, and it substantially reduces the noise from the slipstream when I'm biking.  AND, it keeps my ears warm when it's cold, but breathes excellently when it's hot.  Bottom line:  Best ever headband/ear cover at a very reasonable cost.  Love it.  Wouldn't do without it, way up on the top of my mandatory clothing list when I'm gearing up to go outdoors.

"If the style Jeff Jarvis uses to write Public Parts (a bit of a play on Howard Stern's book ""Private Parts"") is any indication, I'd imagine that Jeff was the kind of kid in school that was perpetually being told to get back to his seat and sit down, and to quiet down a bit.  But you know...it works.  Jarvis has much to say about the fantastic challenges to commonly held ideas of privacy that the massive hyperdrive toward connectivity in the 21st century poses.  His approach to getting it all out in this fairly short book is a bit frenetic, and his never-a-dull-moment journalism can be energizing, or off-putting, depending on your own preferences.  Jarvis's approach is far more the shotgun than the high-powered rifle, which allows him to encompass a wide pattern of topics.While Jarvis acknowledges that privacy has its uses, he is a gigantic advocate of openness, of public access to information, rather than containment.  He backs his advocacy with examples that range from the very personal level (where we hear about his urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction after his prostate cancer surgery) to the international level, where he argues that ""governments should be public by default, private only by necessity"".  Good governments, he says, are transparent.  Bad governments are invariably, and often lethally, private.  While conscious of the collateral damage that can occur with making some forms of information public, I think he would agree with the thought that when all is said and done, when all the dust is settled, when all the fires of public outrage die down, being public with information is a large net gain to society compared to a culture of privacy.Particularly enjoyable to me was Jarvis's review of the stages of increased communication that humans have gone through:  development of language, development of the written word, development of the ability to copy and distribute the written word (think Guttenberg), ability to cast the written word to millions of people simultaneously over the radio, ability to reach millions (now billions) over TV, and now the ubiquitous connectivity of Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, SMS texting, and whatever the newest iteration of ramped up communication will be.  And each time (at least once history was being written down), the naysayers and the prophets of doom predicted (only slightly exaggerating here) the end of society as we know it.  Which, of course, the prophets of doom were right about:  society has ---now and many times in the past--- come to an end as we knew it.  Few even wish it otherwise, Jarvis would guess.  Millenials, who often have little interest in NRA slogans, would resonate deeply with ""You'll get my cell phone and my Facebook away from me when you pry my cold, dead fingers off my keyboards/keypads!""Flaws? Jarvis likes to use the word ""I"" and ""my"" quite a lot.  He's more attached to name-dropping than a smoker to nicotine.  Just in case you've forgotten that he has a blog, he reminds you of this fact with more insistence than the ""Your headlights are still on"" chime in your car.  Ping, ping, ping.  But don't let this ad hominem stuff distract you from this truth:  Public Parts will challenge you to think, and regardless of your convictions before you start the book, you'll find yourself with new perspectives by the time you end it.  If you don't have time to sit and read it, get the audio download version, and listen during your commute or during your daily (right?) exercise period.  Privacy, as we've known it, is dead.  How to handle information going forward will be a series of decisions we'll make as a culture and a country.  If you're in the camp that likes to make informed decisions, rather than shoot from the hip/lip, Public Parts is a fun, fast primer to get you up to speed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HNANHFKNLXZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451636008#wasThisHelpful","R2HNANHFKNLXZ2","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm an all weather, any time of day commuter (9 miles each way)in Central Oregon.  For a good part of the year, I am either going to work, coming home from work, or both, in the dark.  Visibility is critical for me. This tail light delivers, powerfully.Let me make mention of an early misadventure with this light.  In the earliest versions manufactured, one of which I had, the light would unexpectedly turn itself off while I was commuting.  I reported this in my first review, Planet Bike contacted me, and provided me with replacement lights that had been re-engineered to fix what I had experienced.  I've tested my replacement lights for two weeks:  no recurrences of the self turn-off.This is not an ordinary tail light.  It's amazingly bright, when I'm riding in full darkness cars seem to be giving me an additional couple of feet of clearance compared to dimmer tail lights that I've used in the past.  I'm not sure yet how long a set of batteries will last, after two weeks of 1.5 hour/day use, the light (in strobe mode) is still going strong.Anything that could be done to improve the unit?

"Michael Lewis's Moneyball is not a homerun, but it's good for a couple of extra bases.  A triple if you're a baseball fan (maybe an inside the park homer if you're a fanatic!), a double if you're not.The book, which chronicles the 2002 Oakland A's season, absolutely does provide an intriguing inside view of the workings of major league baseball.  It struggles, though, from a paradoxical case of TMI (Too Much Information) and NEI (Not Enough Information).  And it fails to adequately expand its fascinating central premise into something that is slowly, but steadily, becoming incorporated into the way that smart companies do business:  throw out preconceptions, develop new and more meaningful ways of measuring performance, implement, measure, repeat the cycle.Baseball, Lewis points out, is a ship whose hull is so heavily encrusted with the barnacles of superstition and untested tradition that the speed with which it can move forward is significantly impeded.  Up until Billy Bean (whose fascinating biographical info is worth the read in and of itself) is saddled with a team with few stars and little money, the major league solution to the encrusted hull was to simply apply more horsepower:  more money, to buy bigger stars.  With that solution not available, Bean and a small but innovative crew, get down to the business of carefully scrutinizing what REALLY counts when the goal is to win.  Stealing bases is out.  A walk is as good as a single.  A batting average of .300 with a low on-base average is not as good as a batting average of .240, but a high on-base average.  In short:  science comes to baseball.The TMI:  though the book is a short one, it is repeatedly saddled with long descriptive scenes that serve more to show that the author had quite a bit of face time with baseball VIP's,  than they forward the thrust of the theories that the author (very valuably) wants to bring to light.The NEI:  the premise of the book, that baseball has for a century been shackled with assumptions about recruiting and strategy that are actually counterproductive (in terms of winning games), is a powerful and extremely thought-provoking concept.  But it's way too big of a concept for an author with a wide-ranging mind (see his book The New, New Thing) to limit it to baseball.  My field (I'm a family physician) is also deeply barnacle-encrusted with ""expert opinion"" that often obliterates good solid evidence to the contrary.  Faced with diminishing resources in the face of sky-rocketing healthcare costs, the best outfits in healthcare are applying precisely the same principles that Michael Lewis details in Moneyball:  develop MEANINGFUL measures of performance, retool to obtain those meaningful measures, be willing to trash popular healthcare myths if the evidence doesn't support them (e.g. breast exams and prostate exams do NOT save lives, routine physical exams are largely useless, prostate and breast cancer screening, in the best studies done to date, may have caused more harm than good).Lewis, in Moneyball, uncovers this:  most businesses operate on principles that are time-honored and  so ingrained that when you attempt to deviate from them, you are ridiculed at best, and fired from your job at worst.  But then someone like Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg comes along, insists that there is a different way of looking at things, and the rest is history, much to the detriment of Microsoft and My Space, respectively.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DAGCX4U42F6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393338398#wasThisHelpful","R2DAGCX4U42F6L","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All diet books cater to these notions:  you'll lose weight fast, it'll be easy, and only THIS diet book has the proper secrets to success. The 17 Day Diet fits those criteria.The difference between a quality diet book and a scam is that some leave the reader properly informed about the foods that make us thrive and have a normal body weight (South Beach Diet, Zone Diet, 17 Day Diet), and some are based on fantasy premises, such as that your blood type makes a difference, your ethnic background makes a significant difference, or your astrological sign makes a difference. The 17 Day Diet is a quality diet book.The keys to sustained weight loss (30 lbs. or more, maintained for longer than TWO YEARS, not six months, or one year) are established by good research.  You don't need to buy a book to accomplish the requirements: proper diet, and physical activity.  I'm a family physician that lost more than 30 lbs. 16 years ago, and have kept it off.  I did it by following the research based information noted long ago in a Scientific American article.  And I'll give you the info for free in two parts:Food:  Eat fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meat and fish.  Stay away from the white stuff (bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, sugar).  Even more simply put by Michael Pollan in his books:  Eat food.  Not too much.  Mostly vegetables.Exercise:  Here's the rough part: people that have lost 30 lbs. and kept it off for more than two years AVERAGE an hour of physical activity per day.  Lots of ways to get this done, often creativity is required.  I have patients that are long-haul truckers and traveling salesmen that, against formidable odds, are thin and healthy. They have found ways to get this one hour of activity in (often by splitting it into smaller intervals several times/day). I had to begin riding my bicycle to work every day (45 minutes each way).  I do it year round (even have studded snow tires for my commuter bike).  You can find a way. Don't use weather as an excuse to skip your activity. There is no such thing as bad weather, there are only improperly dressed people, say the Scandinavians.  I'm Irish, but I believe them.There you have it.  Where does this leave 17 Day Diet?  IGNORE the wonderful testimonies posted by Amazon readers regarding their weight loss.

Write these folks claiming marvelous success back in two years, and you'll find that the only ones that have succceeded are the ones that have adopted what I suggest above.Bottom line:  The 17 Day Diet is one of the ""good"" diet books, because Dr. Mike provides excellent nutritional advice, and insists that you stay active.  His particular hook, his innovation, is that you keep the body's metabolism ""off balance"" by shifting back and forth between metabolic food groups.  None of which contain baloney, though the advice is.  Try the book, stick to it, you WILL lose weight.  Stick to it for two years, and you'll keep the weight off.  Why? Not because of any diet secret here, not because of keeping the metabolism ""off balance"", but because if you follow Dr. Mike's advice, you'll be eating fresh fruit and vegetables, lean meat and fish, dramatically reducing the ""white stuff"" in your diet, and exercising regularly.The 17 Day Diet is also distinguished by the upbeat and friendly tone of the author.  Any doctor that goes out on a walk with his patients twice a week (as Dr. Mike does) is quite literally walking his talk.  Kudos to the author!One last note: the author does refer, somewhat obliquely, to a relatively new hot topic in weight loss medicine.  The type of bacteria that colonize your gut MAY affect your ability to lose weight.  The author recommends probiotics to shift your intestinal flora.  Current research is more suggestive that when you eat a healthy diet, your gut flora evolves to deal with healthy foods, whereas junk foods encourage intestinal flora that promote obesity. In other words, if you want healthy gut bacteria, eat right, as opposed to taking probiotics.  This research is intriguing, but preliminary, and not established.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RROXL1GIFI72D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451648650#wasThisHelpful","RROXL1GIFI72D","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Diamonds with flaws are still gemstones, still have enough density to scratch through layers of most other earthly materials, and still refract light in dazzling ways.  If one uses a jeweler's loupe to inspect a diamond closely, the flaws can be distracting and distressing.  The remedy is not to look too closely.  A proposed approach to State of Wonder:  enjoy the density and the fascinating refractions, but leave your literary jeweler's loupe in your pocket.In this book, Patchett spins her own ten days of experience in the Amazon into a tale whose slowly moving course has many tributaries feeding its river of narrative.  The convincing realism of Patchett's description of the primeval rain forest environment, given her brief actual stay, is a powerful testimony to her powers of observation.I'm certain that I will not be the first to observe that State of Wonder is very loosely analogous to a modern day Heart of Darkness.  The protagonist, Merina Singh, sets aside her comfortable Minnesota MD/Ph.D life as a pharmaceutical company employee to journey up the Amazon.  Dr. Singh has a two-fold mission:  bringing closure to the death of a colleague, and assessing progress on a drug that her company has invested millions on.Patchett uses the literal journey of Dr. Singh to take multiple adventures up offshoots of the plot, including an examination of the soul (or lack thereof) of the pharmaceutical industry, the inevitable (often tragic) consequences of contact between cultures with widely divergent levels of technology, the notion of a ""fountain of youth"" that only affects one organ system (men, eat your heart out), and the many different types of love that we humans have for one another.  If one enjoys moving along at the pace of a canoe, paddle dipping first on one side of the boat, then on the other while one contemplates what unfolds at each bend of the river, State of Wonder is a very edifying excursion.The gem like qualities of this book include the images and thoughts that linger long after the book is laid down.  The philosophical and ethical dilemmas raised by Patchett seem legitimate, relevant, and important (sure to raise eyebrows, if not hackles, in a book group).  Patchett's sure, steady, experienced, and competent hand on the prose of the novel is a pleasure and a tonic.The flaws in the gem?  To dwell on them would be picayune, as they are outshone by the quality of the story.  In an interview published on the Amazon website, Patchett says ""All the adventure I need I can dream up in my kitchen. I love writing outside of my own experience, making imaginary worlds.""  There are inherent limitations to such an approach.  I'll leave it at that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6KEGNFMXYRJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062049801#wasThisHelpful","R6KEGNFMXYRJ4","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When information on a topic is scarce, even a flawed presentation of the material is valuable and appreciated.  Scott Carney's The Red Market, a bit short on coherence, and significantly longer on shock value and home grown philosophy and ethics, is a valuable, quick, and easy read.  Its deficiencies, though, keep it from having the depth and power of books like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacksand The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer.The Red Market has very real value.  Dead or alive, the human body has value to those amongst the living.  Whether it be medical/nursing schools desperate for cadavers and skeletons needed to adequately educate students, individuals looking for a surrogate mother to carry a custom ordered embryo through a pregnancy, or someone in need of an organ for transplant, the urgency of the potential buyer has historically (and currently) often overwhelmed legal and ethical constructs that are ill-suited to cope with demand.  Carney's explorations into grave robbing, the marketing of blood products, the commercialization of organ donation, the abuses (including outright kidnapping) that can occur in the adoption industry, and the surrogate pregnancy farms where women are treated little better than farm animals kept in stalls, are eye-opening, thought-provoking, and often likely to stimulate both the gag reflex and moral outrage.  So far, so good.But The Red Market also has very real flaws, including a flirtation with being good old-fashioned yellow journalism.  After wading through three-quarters of a book devoted to lurid (and accurate) examples of what happens when human bodies are treated no better than any other animal might be in a butcher shop or packing house, using language that evokes urgency/emergency, Carney pauses.  Pauses to admit that if you do get a kidney for a transplant, or blood products, or an adopted child, or a child born to a surrogate mother, the odds are 90% or better that you're getting a legitimate product, from legitimate sources.  No one should ignore the plight of the 10%, and it is often investigative journalism such as Carney's that begins to focus bright light on problems that sorely need attention.  But magnitude is an important quality when assessing a problem, and the relatively late-coming information that the huge majority of trade in human body parts is legitimate is a definite pin to what seems portrayed as a crisis sized balloon.Carney is at his weakest when philosophizing and/or moralizing about the ethical dilemmas that face the human race in its pursuit of health, longevity, or parenthood.  Rather than present the dilemmas clearly, and subsequently let the reader contemplate possible solutions, Carney has his own pre-packaged moralizations to bestow on the reader.  His ruminations come across with more indignation than substance, often with a lack of depth that seems almost akin to having been too lazy to tap into the marvelous ethical and philosophical debates that swirl around the topics that he includes in The Red Market.The bare bones:  The Red Market has high value when illuminating the actual and potential abuses that occur when a mixture of raw determination and wealth on the part of the buyer of humans, or parts of humans, collides with the poverty and desperation that is fertile soil for exploitation.  When it comes to conclusions to be drawn, however, I'm guessing that either the reader, or the reader's book group, can fairly easily outdistance the author's own conclusions.  If I desired preaching, I'd go to church instead.  But I don't.Addendum: an excellent article on the red market by science writer Yudhijit Bhatacharjee titled The Organ Dealer can be found at Discover magazine (where it was originally published) or in The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2011, where it is the lead story of the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE0XICI1KKSNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061936464#wasThisHelpful","RE0XICI1KKSNV","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Books that combine an excellent review of quantum physics with a provocative world view should probably merit a baseline three stars, and this one does.  That said, The Beginning of Infinity does not seem to have the makings of a classic in the genre.As numerous reviews have pointed out, this book is a David Deutsch ""Theory of Everything"", not in terms of uniting all four of the basic forces of physics (though in a sense he does that), but in the sense of expanding quantum physics into a theory that encompasses everything that we humans tend to hold meaningful.  Thus the book includes attempts to show that an absolute standard of beauty, a system of ethics, and even systems of politics and (loosely interpreted) parenting and education can be derived from Deutsch's unique point of view.In The Beginning of Infinity, Deutsch goes to great creative lengths in an attempt to make quantum physics less mysterious and more comprehensible. In this he succeeds better than many other authors.  As an educated person that has made an effort to keep up over the last five decades with advances in science, but still regularly gets pushed into ""I'm FAIRLY sure I understand what is being said"" territory, I found Deutsch's explanations illuminating and very helpful.  Deutsch's explorations of the implications of the well-known single photon studies (leading many, but not Deutsch, to say that photons are ""both particles and waves"") are striking and deeply exciting.  Deutsch is an acknowledged leader in quantum theory and quantum computing, and when he discusses topics that he knows best, he seems to be on the most solid ground (as solid as anything can be in this quantum world!).  It is when he strays from his area of expertise that he begins to take on the colorations of many other great scientists that wander off into clouds of quirkiness when they leave their area of expertise.  Linus Pauling on Vitamin C, James Watson on race, Lynn Margulis on the cause of AIDS come to mind.When Deutsch jumps with all four limbs into philosophy, anthropology, politics, and education, he does so with a maximum of enthusiasm, and not a little combativeness.  Often defending his positions by preemptively consigning any and all opponents to an ""ism"" (e.g. empiricism, reductionism, rationalism, ""isms"" ad infinitum), Deutsch's arguments vary wildly between seeming shockingly superficial and too profound to easily grasp.  It is instructive, if you have the time, to watch the TED lecture (YouTube) that Deutsch gave in 2005:  it gives a sense of just how static his points of view have remained over nearly a decade.When Deutsch discusses Artificial Intelligence, he seems woefully out of touch with the literature that has emerged over the last five to seven years.  When he discusses why mankind is a species of animal that is different in kind, rather than degree, he ignores (and is often factually incorrect) when citing animal research data regarding non-human language capabilities and levels of consciousness.  When he describes humans as ""universal constructors"" and/or ""universal explainers"" (i.e. capable of infinite progress in both related arenas) his arguments often, again, seem out of touch with current research on neuroanatomy, consciousness, and far more in synch with the powerful drive we humans have to think of ourselves as unique in all the universe.Deutsch's estimation of the human mind's infinite capacity requires him to climb further and further out on epistemological limbs.  If one could compare Deutsch's science of the human brain to the field of astronomy, it would be fair to say that he runs a very significant risk of being a Pre-Copernican:  it's probably just not true that EVERYTHING with advanced computational capacity  revolves around the human mind, now and forever.Deutsch diverges almost imperceptibly, but very significantly, from much contemporary evolutionary/complexity/emergence theory when he uses the word ""knowledge"" in place of the word ""information"".  Whereas a fair amount of contemporary thought has been devoted to the emergent phenomena that occur as more and more information (down to and including the color and spin of quarks) coalesces in a process that started with whatever we think the Big Bang may have been, by using the word knowledge instead of information, Deutsch appears to coopt the evolution of information by establishing human ownership of it.  If information, starting in its most basic form (quarks? Superstrings?) evolves in increasingly complex ways over the life of the multiverse, then humans are simply a particular (in this case, primate) manifestation of an inevitable process that is independent of humans.  An evolutionary process that is akin, then, to what Kevin Kelly seems to allude to in his striking book What Technology Wants.  If on the other hand, ""knowledge"" is the key evolutionary factor, then humans (who translate information into knowledge and are the sole possesors of knowledge) are absolutely necessary for forward motion.  Motion toward infinity, Deutsch proposes, needs the current version of Homo sapiens (Deutsch distinguishes between current and past versions).  Which is an attractive proposal to me from an egotistical point of view, I'll admit.  But then....I read the morning paper.  And it makes me hope that the Multiverse, in all its Information, has more in store for the future than Mankind Uber Alles.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PS40DXUPTI9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670022756#wasThisHelpful","R2PS40DXUPTI9U","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a family physician, and I deal with cancer every day that I work.  I initially avoided reading this book for a variety of reasons.  Cancer is a distressing, depressing topic to deal with:  Why would I want to read a moderately lengthy book about something that I've had more than my fill of both professionally and personally (both my parents died of cancer, a year apart)?  I was wrong to avoid it, and when I did read it, found it to be deeply rewarding on two levels, a bit disappointing on a third.Level One:  Medical history.  The history of cancer, dating back to its identification in Egyptian papyruses, then tracing its course up to 2010, was entrancing.  Filled with fascinating anecdotes, descriptions of the lively cast of characters that tried to engage cancer over more than 3000 years of battle, and a clearly laid out scientific history that moves from theories about an overabundance of black bile to the intricate workings of suppressor genes and oncogenes, the book is simply a marvel of illumination.Level Two: A Cautionary Tale.  As the author chronicles the incredibly aggressive approaches that early surgeons and oncologists took toward treating cancers ""liquid"" (leukemias) or ""solid"" (lung, breast, etc.), one is rocked back on one's heels while contemplating the arrogance and brutality of early and more recent treatments.  How many of the hundreds of thousands of women that received radical mastectomies actually obtained a result superior to that which a simple lumpectomy would have afforded?  NONE, may well be the answer.  When lawsuits (and in some cases, laws) forced HMO's and other health insurance companies to pay for bone marrow transplants for breast cancer victims, the treatments killed more women than they saved, at the cost of many millions of dollars.  Mukherjee also brings to light case after case of medical pioneers that glimpsed truths about cancer, but then were subsequently mocked, persecuted, even run out of their professions for daring to have insight.  Mukherjee also gently, but clearly, points out the dangers of letting the American political process mandate the direction of research, often with tragic consequences.Level Three:  No author is perfectly effective at telling a tale.  Mukherjee is most effective as a historian and a science writer, less so when he tries to plumb the human aspects of an encounter with cancer.  The book begins and ends with descriptions of his relationships with patients with cancer.  These encounters seem a bit heavy on drama, and a bit light on the hard and somewhat mundane work one does while walking a patient through the course of their illness (be it a successful treatment or a failure).Summary?  This book is not just a good book. It is an important and rare book, both in its explanatory power regarding the disease of cancer, and in the lessons that such a thorough and unblinking history of medicine call forth.  It changed the way that I explain cancer to my patients, and it changed the way that I thought about my own profession as a physician.  Having read it, you will not be able to read the news (e.g. the recent recommendation that PSA not be used to routinely screen for cancer)through the same lenses that you used before.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/REM4R4S9RKE86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439170916#wasThisHelpful","REM4R4S9RKE86","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There was a time, before iPods, Walkmans, TV, radio, record players, in which workers (usually women) that were assigned to long hours of menial labor would assign one amongst them to read a book to the rest. The Return of the Native, Thomas Hardy's sixth novel, would be a terrific choice for such a reading group.  Few in the 21st century have the leisure, or the inclination, to delve into a tale in which many pages might be given to the description of a natural scene, or to the intricate development of the personalities of the main characters of this book.  But if there were a modern reader that either had, or made, time to read this book at the deliberate and careful pace that is required to experience its depth and richness, that reader would be richly rewarded.  As was I.Thomas Hardy, better known for Tess of the D'Urbervilles, was one of the most influential of the English authors of the 1800's.  Both D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf pay him homage and cite him as a source of their inspiration.  His stories can be explored on two levels, both levels very accessible to the moderately experienced reader, neither level involving a journey into the deep complexities of books such as Pinchon's Gravity's Rainbow or James Joyce's Ulysses.The first level of The Return of the Native:  it's simply a wonderful tale.  For the price of a tiny bit of patience, as Hardy's narrative begins to unfold the reader receives a rich story involving integrity, duplicity, humor, passion, selfishness and selflessness, nobility and narcissism, as well as the consequences of impetuous action and the rewards of patient persistence.  As a well told story it stands on its own and stands proudly, with or without the embellishment of scholarly opinion or critical review.The second level:  Hardy infuses the story with his philosophy of the relationship between nature and mankind, his criticisms of the tragic consequences of societally ordained values (Victorian values colliding with human desires and capabilities), and beautiful symbolism. For those who feel that plots are not the core of a novel but merely scaffoldings upon which to hang literary/philosophical schools of thought and layers of symbolism, The Return of the Native serves well as a cerebral playground.  This particular edition is a wonderful companion to those who delight in experiencing every nuance that can be brought to life.Taken at the first level, The Return of the Native is an absorbing tale complete with unpredictable twists of plot, human souls whose fates are determined by letters that arrive moments too late, and bouts of comic relief.At the second level, The Return of the Native is rich in philosophy, anthropology, even theology.Take both levels together, and you have what is deservedly called a classic.

"In a twist on William Wordsworth's words, in my family, the child (my adult daughter) is often mother to the man:  she often introduces me to literature that is deeply enriching, and that I would have otherwise completed my trundle from cradle to grave without enjoying.  Such is the case with An Atlas of the Difficult World.Sometimes poetry packs density of thought so tightly that it becomes diamond-like in its ability to etch new messages on the glass windowpanes that we view life through.  Such is the poetry of Adrienne Rich.  Rich writes at one point that writing comes from the marrow of the bone, and her bones are not quiet ones.  Hematopoesis is the process that bone marrow uses to form the complex elements that make up the blood that runs in our veins, and the literary hemotopoesis of Rich generates a wealth of elements that include a vibrant femininism, a spelunking expedition into the nature of our human and national soul, a compassion for the disenfranchised, and a steely eyed clarity, a blowtorch intensity, that incinerates hypocrisy and preciousness.It would be easy to make a list of the brilliant lines in Rich's poetry, and one can certainly try to patch together a meaningful review of this book.  But the last poem in An Atlas of the Difficult World is, for all intents and purposes, Rich's own review of her book, and I cannot match her eloquence:""it will not be simple, it will not be longit will take little time, it will take all your thoughtit will take all your heart, it will take all your breathit will be short, it will not be simpleit will touch through your ribs, it will take all your heartit will not be long, it will occupy your thoughtas a city is occupied, as a bed is occupiedit will take all your flesh, it will not be simpleYou are coming into us who cannot withstand youyou are coming into us who never wanted to withstand youyou are taking parts of us into places never plannedyou are going far away with pieces of our livesit will be short, it will take all your breathit will not be simple, it will become your will""Quantum sufficit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CSLUG7PPQY4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393308316#wasThisHelpful","R1CSLUG7PPQY4U","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This compact and easily packable book is by no means a replacement for more comprehensive bird, wildflower, or tree identification handbooks.  That said, it is amazing how much high quality information is packed between the front and the back cover.  My wife and I used it on a recent road trip from the eastern borders of Washington and Oregon to the Pacific coast.  Whether we were at 8000 feet in the Eage Cap Wilderness, along the Columbia River, or on the beach at Cape Disappointment, it was amazing how frequently this field guide was useful in identifying flora and fauna that we encountered.  The geological sections added to the pleasure.Overall, it fits well in the ""If you like nature, but are allowed only ONE book to take with you on a road trip or backpacking outing, which book would you take?"" category.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZWL33O3KX9U4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679446796#wasThisHelpful","RZWL33O3KX9U4","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Written in 1819 by Sir Walter Scott, Ivanhoe is a novel that is, by some critics, credited with the revival of modern interest in the Middle Ages, and the principals of chivalry.  But...that's probably not why you'd be interested in reading it.  Ivanhoe contains a fascinating portrayal of the very gradual merging of the Saxon and Norman cultures after William the Conqueror prevailed at the Battle of Hastings.  But, again, this probably isn't the reason that you might be induced to pick up a book you've often heard of, but have never been tempted to read or listen to.  Arguably, Ivanhoe's most admirable and intriguing character is Rebecca, a young and beautiful Jewish woman.  Scott leverages Rebecca's travails into a thoughtful and powerful exploration of the oppression of women, and the brutal discrimination against medieval Judaism.  And....I'm guessing that's not why you'll make room on your ""to be read"" pile for an almost 200 year old novel.But here's why you might want to take an ""I'll read fifty pages, and if I don't like it, won't read the rest"" approach to the tale of Ivanhoe:  it's an intelligent, rollicking, swash-buckling, humorous tale of beautiful damsels and men with sword arms like tree trunks, couched in semi-medieval language that is so lush that you'll find yourself going around for days afterwards talking like the yeoman of yore that lived with Robin of Locksley in Sherwood Forest.  Get those fifty pages under your mental belt, and you won't put it down.  Why?  Because it has it all:  magnificent battles, truly good guys fighting truly bad guys, corrupt priests and abbots, arrogant noblemen, estranged fathers and sons, Robin Hood, Richard the Lionhearted, Knights Templar, the evil King John and his nefarious henchmen.  But wait! There's more: accusations of witchcraft, a Lazarus scene, mortal wounds, near mortal wounds, and hearts that break or burst from love and/or anguish.  Ah, for a world when right makes might, instead of the 21st century might makes right.  Oh for a century where bromances were based on shared adventure and combat rather than epic bouts of drinking or the mentality that the Jackass movies are based on.Through all of the above, Sir Walter Scott's witty, careful, and exquisitely crafted sequences of dialogue give a glimpse of the beauty of human discourse (or, intercourse, as Scott refers to it) before we began to communicate in tweets, twitters, text messages, instant messages, and Facebook comments.Ivanhoe, one should know, is barely about the character Ivanhoe. Fine young man of courage and honor that he is, the plot swirls and thickens while Ivanhoe is largely indisposed for one reason or another.  Though the book wouldn't have sold had it been named properly (it should have been called ""Rebecca""), the reader will find the struggle between an ultravirile Knight Templar with dishonorable intentions and Rebecca, beautiful in mind, body, and soul, more absorbing than Ivanhoe's own contribution to the plot.So.  Ivanhoe is an important novel, but beshrew that, kind sirs and ladies:  read it and dream of castles that have pennants on the battlements, Dark Knights that save the day, the clash of swords, the shattering of lances, fire-breathing war horses, and excellent archers that can split a wand at a hundred yards.  To heck with you, Rhett Butler and your Southernb belles:  life for real men doesn't start until the clank of arrows bouncing off one's suit of armor in the full riot of battle reaches a crescendo, and Sheffield forged swords bounce off Spanish made suits of chainmail.

"Viewing a 3D movie without wearing the special glasses required yields a blurry, migraine inducing image.  Razor-sharp focus of plot and theme in Victor Pelevin's genre-busting Omon Ra may not be entirely achievable, and it's a fair bet that the author's Buddhist background led him to deliberately include paradox (a literary koan) in the weaving of this kaleidoscopic tale.  A bit of background does, though, sharpen the images that blast through this novel enough to allow the emergence of a rock-you-back-on-your-heels trip to a mental outer space that many readers (including myself) have not yet explored.Pelevin, Russian-born in 1962, earned a degree in electro-mechanical engineering, then went on to study creative writing.  A student of Buddhism, the right-living (reportedly he neither drinks nor smokes) Pelevin was witness in his 20's to the rise of glasnost and perestroika and the ascendance of hope in the emergence of a Russian national culture that would be based on openness and justice.  By his early 30's, Pelevin was witnessing the disintegration of Russia into a culture that combined the worst elements of capitalism run amok and gangsterism as a form of government.  Two pillars of Pelevin's life, science and Buddhism, are at their hearts a search for purity and truth.  Juxtaposing them with the soul-destroying conformity of the receding USSR empire and the insurgent raw materialism of the new Russia didn't result in creative tension, one might guess, but rather a rupture of spiritual/psychological tectonic plates whose 9.0 Richter scale creative shock waves Pelevin (to the reader's benefit) captured in Oman Ra, his first novel.Oman Ra is science fiction only in the sense that Brave New World is. Sci-fi fans addicted to space opera, technophilia, or alien encounters:  stay away.  Just as easily categorized as political satire, existential literature, surrealism, or historical fiction, Pelevin packs all these genres into a 154 page vehicle, where they sit cheek by jowl, sometimes uncomfortably.  Cram your way into this rover, though, and you're in for a wild ride that rivals Hollywood's best chase scenes.  Pelevin's imagery is nothing short of brilliant.  From Oman's (the protagonist) father lying drunk on a couch under a reproduction of Michelangelo's Creation of Adam, to the use of an unsteerable, virtually blinded bicycle powered moon rover as a metaphor for existence, Pelevin draws sharp intakes of breath and scores mental TKO's from the first pages to the last.  From the absurdity of preparing for walking into a lunar vacuum by stuffing lubricated tampons into ones ears and nostrils, to the haunting image of humans as stars  that twinkle in empty space, seen by each other, but separated by unbridgeable interstellar distances, Pelevin never lets the reader quite recover equilibrium.  The first page is intriguing.  The last paragraph of Oman Ra may be the most precise literary expression of existentialism ever written.Though immersed in the absurdity of life, Pelevin's role as editor of a magazine that deals with issues of science and religion indicates that he may still be looking for answers, still plumbing for meaning.  Gertrude Stein once said ""There ain't no answer.  There ain't going to be any answer.  There has never been an answer.  THAT's the answer.""  I suspect that if Pelevin agreed with Stein, his tectonic plates would settle down, and the creative shockwaves would diminish.  We, the readers, though, would suffer for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/REW49Z78RN0R6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811213641#wasThisHelpful","REW49Z78RN0R6","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a fair bet to say that most readers of Gail Holstein's Waking the Ancients will read the last page, close the book, and think ""Wow.  I've never read anything quite like THAT before.""  It's also a fair bet that many readers will find it a page-turner, likely finishing this brief (184 page) novel in just a few hours.  What's much less clear is whether the reader will be glad that they've had the encounter with Waking the Ancients.Under the influence of a mysterious and charismatic ex-anthropologist, an American family that has all that our society can offer, accompanied by a runaway teenager and a successful African-American female bank executive, retreats into the wilderness of the Arizona's Mogollon Ridge to reclaim the purity, simplicity, and spirituality of the lives that ancient Native American tribes of the Southwest reputedly experienced.There is one scene in the novel that became emblematic when trying to capture the essence of Waking the Ancients.  A teenage girl, living for the first time completely off the land, attempts to make a fur vest for the clan leader by stitching together the skins of various small animals that have been caught and eaten.  Lacking any skills as a seamstress, and not having the necessary tools for completing the project well (e.g. scissors, needle, thread) the finished product is lumpy, misshapen, and not functional.  Holstein's book has an uncomfortably close metaphorical relationship with this failed garment.  It is an odd mix of a hyper-reverence for Native American culture,  some nods to feminism and environmentalism, a bit of social commentary (especially regarding the superficiality/complexity of modern American life), some mysticism, with an analysis of the psychological dynamics of cults thrown in for good measure.  Sautee the whole mix with a discomforting sexuality in which a plethora of male faults and/or brutalities are repeatedly tolerated as long as hard abs, low body mass index, and ""mountain biker butt"" physique are part of the mix. With its numerous loose threads and inconsistent construction, this garment/book simply doesn't achieve a level of coherence that leaves the reader either with a sense of having a good time going along for the ride, or having any important takeaways from the reading experience.Will you finish the book if you finish the first chapter?  I'm betting you will.  If you use it as a book club selection, will it stimulate discussion?  Almost certainly.  Some feel that true art both entertains and instructs.  This book gets less than half way to art.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1567OEOHPRPIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0974080632#wasThisHelpful","R1567OEOHPRPIS","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The child in me (my wife says that aspect of me never became ""inner"") was entranced by this book.  Nine pound flightless parrots that smell like honey, play peek-a-boo with humans, and growl like puppies? Adult or child, one wants to know more!In simple, and yes, somewhat childlike language, this book details a story that has happened many thousands of times in recent centuries:  A prevalent animal or plant species encounters humans and the animals that accompany us (dogs, cats, rats) and is subsequently reduced to extinction, or near extinction. The beauty and intelligence of the Kakapo make their story more poignant, but no more tragic than countless other similar tales.  What is powerful about Kakapo Rescue is the fusion of breath-taking photography and the careful, non-judgmental telling of the impact our human presence has had on other living beings.  Young and old readers are invited to contemplate how once thriving species (whales, passenger pigeons, kakapo) can be moved from almost innumerable abundance to catastrophic reduction by human action, AND they are invited to contemplate how dedicated, skillful, and committed humans can begin to undo the harm that has been done. The story of individuals, governments, and corporations banding together to nurture a devastated species toward recovery is powerfully hopeful. Regardless of age, a message of hope sometimes seems more a call to action than repeated and relentless tolling of disaster.Dr.Suess attempted to tell the story of our human impact on the Earth to children and adults in whimsical form; Kakapo Rescue tells it in stunning photos, simple and accurate prose, and in age-appropriate scientific language.  Much as I admire Dr. Suess, as a young person I would have far preferred this fascinating book to any fictional allegory.Shortcomings?  Hmmm.  I hungered for more detail, more examples of the intelligent behavior of these birds, a more developed portrait of what it is to be a Kakapo.  That said, this is one fine book for both the young, the young at heart, and any lover of nature, regardless of age.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYZZ45BC4OFBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0618494170#wasThisHelpful","RYZZ45BC4OFBO","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's way more fun to learn something from fables, or listening to well told stories, than having to listen to a sermon, and Fish! takes a stab at the former approach.  It doesn't quite get there.There's no argument that humans who can't choose their circumstances CAN choose their response to these circumstances.  FISH!, though, is a pat, overly simplistic response to the very real problem of how to endure jobs that seem meaningless and repetitive.The author of the book leads a young and vulnerable (single mom, trying to support a family) woman through the steps required to turn a ""toxic waste dump"" of a job situation into an urban garden of delightful working conditions.  The book makes it sound like a piece of cake.  In reality, the scenario in which a new boss (or an old boss) rolls out a new way of doing things designed to improve productivity and enjoyment in the work place is the eternal fodder of sitcoms.I'm not being cynical, here.  My job involves counseling people that are deeply dissatisfied with their jobs, and the cures are far more complex than changing one's attitude and making the work place fun.  Sometimes, jobs really ARE meaningless, and demeaning.  In which case the cure is to take the steps necessary to change one's job.  Sometimes inertia has left one in a job that is far below one's capabilities, and distant from the creative talents that light us up when we use them.  And sometimes, one works for an employer that has created abusive working conditions.  In the above circumstances, FISH! seems to me to be a sort of ""opiate of the masses"":  read this book so that you'll feel better about being in a place that you should probably try to find a way to leave.That being said, the book does have some pearls.  If you have a job that is not abusive, that offers decent pay and good stability, there is content here than can make the workplace something far more tolerable, and even enjoyable. Worth the price?  Hmmm.  Consider getting a copy from your local library instead of buying it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J2OGGL8P06M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC0YNG#wasThisHelpful","R1J2OGGL8P06M9","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The people most enthusiastic about this product are probably too young to write their own reviews: young kids LOVE the Tykelight.The product performs as advertised, emitting a soft but plentiful amount of light (in a variety of colors) when lifted off its charger base. It glows all night after a single charge, and recharges quickly  It is easy to operate, the three year old that I gave it too mastered the ability to change the colors as well as set the timed phaseout (it can be set to fade out in 20 minutes) with no trouble at all.Esthetically, the creators hit on something very pleasing.  The soft looking shape is a crowd pleaser; both adults and children seem fascinated by it, and reluctant to part with it.  The white surface doesn't seem to soil easily, but if it does, it wipes down without any problem at all.Me?  I felt a bit goofy at age 58 being entranced by this simple toy, but actually felt a twinge of regret when I removed it from my night table so that I could give it to an adopted grandchild.

"Sometimes a book is so good that I'd like to simply say ""Don't bother with what I have to say, just go read it"". Julia Whitty's Deep Blue Home fits in that category.  But for those that need a bit more convincing....Deep Blue Home is a collection of 32 science and nature essays that are provocatively named (The Very Air Miraculous, Bone Rafters, The Tempest from the Eagle's Wings), and even more deeply provocative and evocative in the reading.  Lowering her creative bucket into the well of her own scientific training, her wide travels, her multiple professions, her life experiences, and the richness of human mythology, Julia Whitty brings up into the light a payload that is astoundingly rich in content, content that is potent enough to alter the world view of those who choose to drink it in.Whitty's style of prose can be compared to, well, probably to NO other writer.  Her graceful, seamless, and fluid blending of hard science, love of nature, wry humor, keen observational skills, and all things good that come from estrogen, bring forth a book that powerfully delves into the relationship of mankind to the world that we dwell in.  At times Whitty's dramatic use of metaphor can be almost overpowering, such as this description of  being in a boat off the coast of Newfoundland:  ""Yet our comforts are largely forgotten, in this numinous theater when white eyelids of fog open to undress the nudes of the landscape: the loins of an Irish-green fjord, a hank of blond kelp bound to the seashore and tongued by waves, the clattered bones of a ghost village sagging to driftwood.  In one blink of mist a muscular cliff materializes, tagged with the orange tattoos of crustose lichens hundreds of years old.""  At other times, her language is more suited for an article in Scientific American, such as when she gives a detailed description of the aerodynamic design of fish-eating bats, whose high aspect wing ratios allow them to fly low and slow, carrying heavy payloads of fish.Dreamy and magical descriptions of enormous sea turtles methodically chomping their way through clusters of jellyfish give way to graphic (and also magical) descriptions of the life-giving journey of a whale carcass on its way to the seafloor, where it will nourish a carcass dependent community for decades.Each of the chapters is illuminating, and many are startling.  But lest we forget that nature is not a series of zoo-like exhibitions to be viewed in tidy parcels, but rather an inextricably woven web of interdependence, Whitty ends Deep Blue Home with a descent into a Baja California cave that is richly illustrated with Lescaux-like pictograms.  Antelope, octopi, whales, tuna, deer, sardines, pelicans, mountain lions, eagles, and humans swirl around each other in the cave's murals.  And over them all is a depiction of an event that occurred in 1054: a supernova that was visible during the daytime. What is it that Whitty sees in these ancient murals?  She sees a dark mirror of the human past:  ""On convex walls darkened by soot we read the broader perspective---of disparate exploded realms of sea, air, land reassembling into wholes.  We see the numinous interplay among whales, pronghorn, sardines, lynx, eagles, sea turtles.  We see ourselves and know that we are part of the landscape, the seascape, the airscape, and can never be apart from them.""  This is something we once all seemed to know, and have somehow often forgotten.  Deep Blue Home, once read, will never let you forget again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKXAC4GK4CFFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0618119817#wasThisHelpful","RKXAC4GK4CFFK","A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Any review of this book would have to start by mentioning that it is part of Osprey Publishing‚Äôs ‚ÄúCampaign‚Äù series. As such it is only about 96 pages long, roughly a third of which is composes of illustrations of one type or another. Hence if one is looking for a tome on the subject it is not the book.The book itself is very well researched and filled with incredible detail on very minute activities surrounding the landing itself, taking of strongpoints, etc. A lay reader or one only interested in only a high level analysis would probably be overwhelmed. Hence the book is really geared for the specialist or the knowledgeable looking for great detail. In that regard the book is wonderful (thanks to its meticulous research).The book follows the typical Osprey ‚ÄúCampaign‚Äù format and covers the opposing side‚Äôs commanders, armies, goals and how the campaign played out. The only critique this reviewer has is that the book lacks a discussion/analysis of how this particular campaign fitted into the context of the other Overlord campaigns (i.e., Utah, Sword, Gold, Juno beach landings). There is no discussion of how this fitted into the puzzle with the other landings. In addition, there is no discussion of the extremely challenging logistical problems this landing had to overcome and to succeed. There is no discussion of underwater pipelines or man-made ports created near the landing zone. Despite these weaknesses this is still a solid book worth a four star rating and well worth reading for any serious reader albeit the lay reader may be overwhelmed by its level of detail.This reviewer would like to conclude that pointing out that this book, along with its sister ‚ÄúCampaign‚Äù books on the associated landings of Utah, Sword, Juno, Gold (and the airborne landings) can be purchased, in a very cost effective manner (as opposed to separately) in Osprey‚Äôs one volume book ‚ÄúOverlord : The D-Day Landings‚Äù. In addition, this one volume book has a very good introduction that brings together an analysis and discussion of all four landings in terms of commanders, armies, overall goals, etc. that the individual books in the series leave out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROXFA4YTXHPJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1841763675#wasThisHelpful","ROXFA4YTXHPJ3","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a relatively short book, at only about 150 pages. The author makes no use of primary sources ‚Äì only secondary. In addition, there are no footnotes hence the reader does not know what sources were used to come up with quotes, damage reports, etc. Thirdly, the book does not provide anything new to the literature, either in terms of analysis or historical facts. This is the book‚Äôs most serious shortcoming. It greatly diminishes any value this book may have for anyone who has read on the battle to any degree. The book also lacks a detailed technical discussion of the vessels involved (Graf Spee and the 3 British cruisers) as well as any in depth diagrams/illustrations of the vessels. All and all, very disappointing for a book published by an authoritative press such as the Naval Institute Press.The subtitle of the book, ‚ÄúThe Grand Delusion‚Äù, is clarified for the reader in the end of the book. According to the author, from the German perspective this was Langsdorff‚Äôs (the Captain of the Graff Spee) attempt to fight a ‚ÄúGentleman‚Äôs War‚Äù. From the British it was the belief that the battle rubber stamped the wisdom of then current British naval strategy centering on surface ships and warfare. Not exactly, in this reviewer‚Äôs opinion, either a deep and profound observation or ‚Äúgrand delusions‚Äù.On the positive side, the book is of value to the novice (as opposed to the knowledgeable or the specialist). It provides what is a very good introduction to that audience. Hence, in short, this is a book that would be a four star for a novice but only a 2 or so for the knowledgeable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M785RSY5CJAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591140404#wasThisHelpful","R3M785RSY5CJAT","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any review of this book would have to start off by mentioning the fact that it is part of Osprey Publishing‚Äôs ‚ÄúRaid‚Äù series. As such it is relatively short, at only 80 pages in length (very roughly a third of which consists of illustrations of one type or another). Hence if one is looking for a tome on the subject this is not it. Instead the book is geared to those seeking more of an executive summary. A second thing that should be mentioned is that there is a great deal of overlap between this book and a previous Osprey book, ‚ÄúFort Eben Emael: The key to Hitler's victory in the West‚Äù. Although that book was in Osprey‚Äôs Fortress series, the bulk covered the raid per se. This reviewer would say that there is, very roughly, an 80% overlap between the books. Hence if one has read the first he would get little out of reading the second. Not to say that there are not differences. There are. For example, the Fortress book mentions that three-quarters of the machine guns on top of the Fortress were inadvertently knocked out by the gliders during their landing. The Raid book cites one or two. The most important difference in the books, in this reviewer‚Äôs opinion, is the depth devoted to the shaped charges that were so important to knocking out Eben Emael‚Äôs guns. The Raid book provides short coverage while the Fortress a much more in-depth discussion, including illustrations that show how the charges work. As stated previously, there are differences between the two books but there is a very large overlap between them.The Raid book, on its own merits, is excellent. There is a very good discussion of how important knocking out the fortress was to the overall German strategy and how it fit into Belgium and France‚Äôs defense plans (these were so important to France that France paid for 80% of the costs of the fortress). From the German perspective there is a very good discussion of the paratroopers, their training (in general and for this particular operation) and how the operation went. The only thing missing, albeit slight, is an illustration and discussion of the gliders themselves. From the Belgian perspective there is a discussion of the physical characteristics of the fort, the garrison (understaffed, not very high on morale) and serious command and control issues between the fort‚Äôs command and Belgian higher command elements. Some of these problems were, to a large degree, responsible for the German‚Äôs ability to take key bridges around the fort intact. The book also includes a discussion of the ancillary paratrooper operations undertaken to capture these bridges (in the Fortress series book there is no such discussion).The author, Chris McNab, concludes that key factors in the German success were excellent training and tactical flexibility, surprise and the shaped charge weapons used to destroy the fort. On the Belgian side one key factor contributing to defeat included the inability of the Belgian high command to foresee the event, despite the fact that paratroopers were used in Norway the Belgian high command know about this. The top of the fortress, where the German gliders landed (and stopped only a few meters from their goals) could have destroyed by placing a few anti-glider obstacles on the fort. Other factors contributing to defeat included poor moral of the garrison, the fact the fort was undermanned, the fact that higher level officials outside the fortress gave orders that required reducing key garrisons positions at the worst possible time (troops that should have been on the top of the fort were instead wasting their time destroying documents in administrative buildings when the landing occurred) and the fact the garrison did not have enough fighting infantry to counter such as landing (as opposed to men to man the fortresses guns, administrative personnel, etc.).  Despite this the Belgian garrison performed quite well considering the circumstances. Nevertheless, after the war, an official military enquiry on the matter blamed the garrison and its commander and, naturally, said nothing of higher level officials who were so responsible for this defeat.All and all an excellent book for anyone interested in investing 2 hours or so of their time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWVRTFR0DKFAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780962614#wasThisHelpful","RWVRTFR0DKFAI","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has one theme. That is that the world‚Äôs most powerful nation, the US, has historically and institutionally had the goal of becoming and staying a world hegemon. As evidence he cites the policies of the administration of the US (i.e., President Bush‚Äôs) at the time the book was published along with the history of a variety of neo-con thinkers and intellectuals who have influenced them. He posits that the hegemonic goals of this administration have been, in his view, mainstream in the US. Dr. Chomsky states that Vice-President Cheney‚Äôs 1% policy, whereby any nation that even threatens the US by 1% needs to be acted on in one way or another (i.e., destabilized, attacked, etc.). He also mentions the neo-con‚Äôs views regarding trying to keep any power from arising that may threaten US hegemony economically, militarily or politically (i.e., a policy of permanent hegemony). In addition, Dr. Chomsky makes the claim that the US invasion of Iraq had its roots in US foreign policy, both historically and institutionally.Unfortunately the view that the neo-con‚Äôs and Vice-President‚Äôs 1% policy, permanent ‚Äúhegemony‚Äù and the US‚Äôs invasion of Iraq are not ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù policies held institutionally by governmental institutions such as the Departments of State and Defense, leading thinkers and officials in government, academia and the press, contrary to Dr. Chomsky‚Äôs assertions. These views are only held by a tiny fringe of decision makers and influencers of policy, the neo-cons. This group in no way constitutes US ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù thought in foreign policy. This is clearly evident by the fact that the State and Defense Departments and the intelligence services, as institutions, were opposed to these policies. That is why the Bush administration had to form groups such as Douglas Feith‚Äôs and Paul Wolfowitz‚Äôs Office of Special Plans, to by-pass the conventional intelligence services and their analyses. That is why there were perpetual leaks to the press on Iraq that were intended to undermine that administration‚Äôs arguments in favor of an invasion. Henry Kissinger and John Measheimer works, that oppose the neo-cons views on all these topics are the ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù, not the neo-con‚Äôs. Hence to state that these views have been historically driving US foreign policy and are the institutional ‚Äúnorm‚Äù is ridiculous. This is the biggest problem with this book and its Achilles heel.Not that this is the only problem. There are an infinite myriad of others. For example, he also explicitly claims that many of the world‚Äôs problems such as pollution as poverty, for example, are caused to large degree by this hegemony. The question this view begs is, why? Why would poverty and pollution be much reduced even if there were no single hegemon in the world? Dr. Chomsky, unfortunately, provides no answer. He just asserts it. This is another very serious problem in the book. Many assertions with no attempt to provide an analysis or explanation. For example, he states that the main reason why Eastern European nations supported the US invasion of Iraq (in many cases even sending troops such as was done by Poland and Georgia) as US pressure. Apparently it did not occur to Dr. Chomsky that these nations desperately needed US support in preserving their independence from Russia. The imperialism practiced by the Soviet Union does not enter the formula for their diplomatic actions in Dr. Chomsky‚Äôs world. Nor, for that matter, is there a contradiction in his views that capitalism is the main driving force for imperialism and that nations that did not have capitalist systems (i.e., Soviet Union, China) engaged in some pretty serious imperialist ventures of their own in Eastern Europe and Tibet.Other assertions that Dr. Chomsky makes also are not provided with a logical justification. For example, he blames the US for the crimes committed by Indonesia in East Timor. The Indonesians engaging in these crimes against humanity, naturally, are not to blame. Also unsaid is the fear the Australia and the US of East Timor falling into the Eastern camp. It never occurred to Dr. Chomsky that the West‚Äôs recognition of East Timor coincided with the collapse of the Soviet bloc was more than just a coincidence.Unfortunately this whole book is filled with an almost infinite number of such unfounded assertions. Between these and its inability to support its also unsupportable view that neo-con‚Äôs views have been the standard US world view held by US institutions, policy makers, the press and academics, this book is worse than worthless. Normally this reviewer gives books he has read to the library for others to enjoy or to get something out of. In this case the book is going straight into the garbage can.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R62ZG22QXT2PC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1559279419#wasThisHelpful","R62ZG22QXT2PC","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book starts off with a story on the author‚Äôs grandfather, a successful engineer and immigrant from the old country. The author tells the tale of how, many, many years ago an innovator had to not only come up with a successful idea but, more importantly, due to capital requirements stemming from a large number of factors (i.e., high fixed costs involved in manufacturing in particular), had to find a ‚Äúpartner‚Äù in large business who basically relegated the inventor to the sideline. The most a successful innovator, unless he was from a ‚Äúmoneyed‚Äù family or had connections, was to hand over de fact control of his invention to a larger partner. Those with even good ideas could never succeed unless they were able to find such partners.Today, according to the author, things have drastically changed. This is so, in a nutshell, for two reasons. One is that manufacturing technology has advanced to the point, cost wise and in terms of user friendliness, where production runs can be relatively small and yet still be (relatively) cost efficient. There is no longer, as in the past, the required use of very expensive molds, etc. that would make small production runs prohibitively expensive. The author discusses the main tool that enables this, the 3D printer, as well as electronic kit components. He spends quite a bit of time discussing this technology (for example the large variety of 3d printers and how they work and with what they work [plastic, wood, metal, etc.]). For the engineer working in the field or even the enthusiast this is not very enlightening. However, for the layman who is interested (either in terms of just curiosity or considering actually bringing a project to life), this would be very enlightening.The author then goes on to discuss the business model that can best be used, in his opinion, to bring to market an idea that requires manufacturing and/ electronic components and know-how. That model is the ‚Äúopen source‚Äù model. The author describes the many benefits of this model. This includes (not all inclusively) free labor and ideas provided by potential or actual users, the creation of ‚Äúword of mouth‚Äù marketing, testing the size of the market to see if it is large enough to justify entry, etc. All of this is interesting. However, there are problems with that the open source model has that the author leaves unsaid. I do not know if this is willful or whether he just believes that some of these potential problems are not at all significant. A major one is that the use of volunteers, as opposed to employees, insures that people are supplying the needed know how throughout the entire product development and manufacturing phase. After all, employees need to work to be paid. Volunteers, on the other hand, can just leave or stop in an instant. In many cases without a seconds notice. Anyone who has worked in volunteer organizations knows this. In the author‚Äôs model this is even more of a problem as the volunteers are linked via the internet and do not even know each other. This puts a significant dent on projects that have development phases that are more than very short periods of time. A big problem, even if the author does not mention it.The author also discusses financing. He again emphasizes internet based ‚Äúopen source‚Äù as opposed to more traditional ‚Äúangel‚Äù investors (whose use would imply capital dilution) or bank financing that would require capital being tied up as collateral and interest payments. However, the author does not point out how difficult it is to use Kickstarter and similar internet sources to raise capital. They are not the panacea he makes them out to be.The author then provides 3 case studies that show how effectively the open source manufacturing and financing model can be used to help start up entrepreneurs. All show how successful the model has been. Unfortunately no statistics are provided regarding the percentage of entrepreneurs for which this road has been successful (as opposed to failing them or the use of more traditional methods such as partnering with large companies or ‚Äúangel‚Äù investors).In short, the book has plenty of weaknesses. However, it also has plenty of strengths, especially in regard to small entrepreneurs interested in bringing their idea to market. For this reason alone it is worth reading by such people or even by those with just a passing curiosity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C651HVWT7IO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307878899#wasThisHelpful","R3C651HVWT7IO3","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any review of this book needs to start off by stressing the fact that this book is really geared to the specialist. This is defined as either that group very knowledgeable on the minitua of German armoured tactics or those with actual military experience in the field (i.e., armour operations), even if on the modern battlefield as opposed to that of the Second World War. It also needs to be stressed, as if the subtitle of the book ‚ÄúGerman Small ‚Äì Unit Armour Tactics in WW 2‚Äù is not enough of a give-away, that the book emphasizes tactics and other factors (i.e., training, maintenance) at individual tank level, platoon level and the platoon - compny nexus. The book is definitely not geared to high level tactics and strategy (basically any activity over and above the battalion level).The books covers small scale operations on a very thorough level. It has chapters on: offensive operations, defensive operations, unit/march maneuvers (both in rear areas and combat areas), reconnaissance, command and control, logistics and maintenance, combined arms and operations (emphasizing front line cooperation with infantry, engineers, artillery and air support), life in a tank, training and a chapter contrasting tank tactics then and now (this last one is too brief).Each topic is covered in an extremely technical manner and just about every detail, no matter how minute, is covered in very great detail. For example, complete lists are provided for how communications should be sent from tank to tank (in a platoon environment), platoon to company, etc. These include content of communications as well as the order that content should be transmitted. It is that detailed of the book. Considering that it has been written by a current German officer this is no surprise. Hence it would be of interest to primarily the specialist as opposed to the layman. The specialist will find it a gold mine and for those currently (or recently serving in armoured vehicles) one sees how little things have really changed, to a very large degree, in 60 years.Despite these weaknesses, the book does have a few weaknesses that need to be pointed out. They are as follows:a) The translation is rough. As a result, many times, the reader needs to reread passages 2 or 3 times to understand what the author is attempting to convey. This is not surprising considering the author‚Äôs native language is German and not English. A translator should have been hired to, at the very least, fine tune the text.b) There are many maps, diagrams, etc. but all are in German. In addition many leave much to be desired in terms of quality. The book should have hired illustrators to draw high quality maps/illustrations to show what many of the poor quality maps/illustrations cannot clearly show. Apparently the budget was so limited none could be hired. The use of original training materials, etc. is a very nice touch to the book but many times something that was better drawn would have much better assisted the author in conveying his views.c) A few stories from actual troops to illustrate the tactics stressed in the book would have been nice to have included.d) Some technical specifications on tanks and how and why the physical characteristics of the vehicles changed over the course of the war would have been nice too.Despite these relatively minor problems, that can be easily overlooked, this is all and all a book that is very highly recommended for its niche intended audience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZPOFLC5THWP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811732444#wasThisHelpful","R1ZPOFLC5THWP0","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The below is a review of the unabridged cd (not audible) version of this bookSedera's last few books have left much to be desired. The main reason for this is that he has transgressed from his normally witty, humorous, sarcastic and pathos filled stories in a variety of ways. In his ‚ÄúSquirrel Seeks Chipmunk: A Modest Bestiary‚Äù, for example, he attempted to be scatalogical and crude. Unfortunately it did not work. Comedians like George Carlin and Richard Prior were able to pull this off. Unfortunately Sederis cannot. Not a surprise considering that his humor is not, at its core, of that nature.In this new book Sedaris goes back to his early books such as ‚ÄúHolidays on Ice‚Äù, ‚ÄúNaked‚Äù and ‚ÄúSquirrel Seeks Chipmunk: A Modest Bestiary‚Äù and back to, in essence, what made his humor unique. Finally he returns, once again, to his original witty, ironic and, most importantly, pathos filled roots. Hopefully he will continue on this course in the future.The CD audiobook is very well read by Sedaris himself. His reading captures his irony, wit and sarcasm very very well. This has typically been the case with all of his previous audiobooks, even the mediocre. Hence this reviewer highly recommends the audiobook instead of written version of this work. The audiobook captures Sedaris in his purest form.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R50KB5PC2YNKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619696991#wasThisHelpful","R50KB5PC2YNKG","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The below is a review of the unabridged cd (not audible) version of this workThe first place to start in any review of this book is to stress that it not a novelized version of this historical work. Instead it is a poetic version. Hence for those not inclined to poetry it is not the version to purchase. Those appreciating poetry, instead, would find it very engrossing. The story also assumes, as it did of its audience millennia ago, that it be knowledgeable regarding ancient roman mythology and history. Without this knowledge the listener (or reader) would not understand the nuances, allegory, context and meaning of this story to the Romans (or at all for that matter).Hence, in short, this book is geared towards and would most be appreciated (and very appreciated at that) by those who BOTH love poetry and are very familiar with Greco-Roman mythology and roman history.Last but not least a few words about the audio version of this work per se. The reader of the book does an excellent job both in terms of the dramatic and poetic nuances. This reviewer has read many audio books and can say, unequivacly that it is in the top 5% of what he has listened to. For this reason this reviewer highly recommends the cd audio version of this book as opposed to the written version. The audio version, as opposed to the written version is also more in line with what Virgil had in mind. Readers should remember that this work, like Homer‚Äôs, was intended to be presented in oral form, usually over a campfire, as opposed to read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H4UJMATYADIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143059025#wasThisHelpful","R2H4UJMATYADIZ","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many years ago James Dunnigan, a military analyst, published a book entitled ‚ÄúHow to Make War‚Äù.  The first edition was published in 1982 and the last in 2003. The book was intended as an introduction to land, air, sea, nuclear and chemical warfare and logistics for laymen. It provided a very good overview of weapon system and comparative national strengths in these areas. The book was intended as a high level introduction hence there was little discussion of these weapon systems from the perspective of individual users. This was the greatest weakness of the book in this reviewer‚Äôs opinion. Nevertheless, this reviewer still highly recommends the book, as the introduction it is intended to be, for a lay audience.Tools of Violence is, basically, a compliment to this book (that is also geared to a lay audience). It is a compliment in that it covers the gap that Mr. Dunnigam‚Äôs book does not cover, the direct face-to-face impact of these weapons both on those on the receiving end as well as the users. The book provides a ‚Äúhuman‚Äù face to the weapons systems discussed by Mr. Dunnigam. In addition, it provides an update to how the weapons systems have evolved since the last edition of ‚ÄúHow to Make War‚Äù. The book provides a discussion of not only the newer aspects of the same weapons systems but also developments in new directions in weapons (i.e., electronic high velocity beam weapons) that were not even imagined when the latest edition of Mr. Dunnigam‚Äôs book was published. ‚ÄúTools of Violence‚Äù does all of this very well and in a manner geared to layman. Hence for this audience this book is highly recommended.The book does have a few weaknesses that prevent this reviewer from giving it a 5 star rating however. One is that it does not provide an analysis or discussion of relative national strengths in the fields of air, sea and land warfare as Mr. Dunnigam‚Äôs book does. There are very few illustration of the weapons themselves or maps or other illustrations showing doctrinal use in the field. The book is primarily geared to land warfare. Even the emphasis on sea and air warfare is primarily from the perspective of ground support as opposed to, for example, air superiority. This is not a surprise as both of the book‚Äôs authors have had extensive field in that arena as opposed to the air or sea.  The book also does not provide historical perspective on how these weapon systems have developed, over and above the very recent past (in nearly all cases).Lastly the book does not cover, in enough detail, the ridiculous exponential cost escalation over the years in these weapons systems. As defense ministers in the most advanced nations have stated, they would not be surprised that in a few years if the entire budgets of air forces, for example, are spent on a single squadron. In addition, the implications of exponential costs are not examined or analyzed with respect to R&D and the development of future weapons systems. In the past there have been multiple variations of hardware developed to the prototype stage (i.e., 3 or so types of fighter superiority aircraft in the US) before a final version has been selected. This has mitigated against the failure of the development of any one particular system. Due to escalating cost this will probably not be possible in the future, hence there will be a far greater risk of not developing successful platforms (with serious national security implications). This may also result in next generation systems that are not significantly more advanced than previous generations, in an attempt to reduce this risk. None of these very serious implications are even mentioned in this book.Nevertheless, despite the above mentioned problems, this book is still highly recommended as an introduction, geared to laymen, on modern warfare. Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BRYMHRKBO875/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1846032253#wasThisHelpful","R3BRYMHRKBO875","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Artillery played a key role during the First World War. Few would dispute this. Yet there are very few books that have focused on artillery, per se, during the war. This is clearly evident by the fact that even in the 20 or so page bibliography of this book, just concentrating on artillery during that period, there are barely any books focusing exclusively on it. Hence this books fills a significant gap in the literature. The book also does this quite well.The book is arranged in chronological order, with each section of the book being dedicated to a year of the war. The reader sees how doctrine and technology, at least in Germany, Britain and France, advanced (other nations are barely mentioned). The reader sees why the advances that were made were made. In Britain, the most advanced nation in terms of artillery doctrine, technology and use, the reader learns that organizational flexibility and cooperation between and within civilian and military parties was crucial and key. In addition, there were institutional factors that assisted in the diffusion of both doctrine and knowledge (i.e., the British high command regularly published guides incorporating the latest advances, for example). In Germany these were lacking. In that nation tactical front line experience was the driving force. Unfortunately, for the Germans, there was little institutional dissemination of doctrine and knowledge. Hence advancements were kept isolated in the units that developed them and in the men who developed them. There was also little of the military-civilian cooperation that so assisted the British in the development of their cutting advances technologies, particularly in the fields of ranging for counter battery fire. Man power losses also played a major role in the use and development of artillery. As the major powers were running short of men they sought to use artillery as a substitute, as much as possible, for manpower.Even with all the doctrinal and technological advances made in artillery warfare, however, losses were still significant. Even towards the end of the war, where Allied artillery proved far superior to German (including both superior allied firepower that could be brought on the German front line and counter battery fire), it was still normal, in contested battles, for allied casualties to amount to about 40% of attacking force‚Äôs initial strength. Hence blood was still an important ingredient in victory.Despite this very good analysis, the book still suffers from some problems. They are as follows:a) There is practically no discussion of artillery warfare outside the Western front‚Äôs trench environment. There is little discussion of artillery use on the Russian and Italian front and practically none on Ottoman fronts and areas Austria-Hungary fought in outside of the Russian and Italian fronts (i.e., Serbia). This is a major weakness.b) A second major weakness is that there is practically no discussion of the nexus between gas and artillery. For those interested in filling this gap this reviewer highly recommends Osprey publishing‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorld War I Gas Warfare Tactics and Equipment‚Äù. Despite the fact this book covers gas warfare in general (as opposed to just artillery delivery methods) and is very short (only 64 pages), it does an excellent job in filling the gap that ‚ÄúArtillery in the Great War‚Äù leaves.c) A third major weakness is that there is not enough discussion and analysis regarding the very important issue (as even the authors the book imply) of industrial production. This is clear by the fact there is not a single table in the entire book on artillery or shell production. There should have been a stand-alone chapter on this topic or, at the very least, the equivalent in terms of text in the book.d) The book is also weak on discussing observation techniques. As a supplement this reviewer highly recommends Osprey publishing‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorld War 1 Battlefield Artillery Tactics‚Äù. This book, like the previous Osprey book on gas mentioned above, is very short but nevertheless fills this gap (as well as others in this book).e) The book has very few maps. In addition, with respect to the very few maps there are there is little integration between text and the maps. Hence an opportunity to illustrate doctrine and use topologically is missed.f) One last weakness, albeit minor, is there are few illustrations. Some illustrations would have proved worth a thousand words in illustrating the concepts of creeping and box barrages as well as illustrating many other points in the book. For example an illustration on creeping barrages would have clearly illustrated why poor quality control in ammunition production early in the war prevented this tactic from being widely used at that period. Some photographs on the major and commonly used artillery pieces would have been nice too. The previously mentioned Osprey book ‚ÄúWorld War 1 Battlefield Artillery Tactics‚Äù does an excellent job at filling this gap.Despite the above mentioned weaknesses this book still very highly recommendable. For those seeking to fill the gaps mentioned above (a through f), this reviewer recommends the previously mentioned Osprey books ‚ÄúWorld War 1 Battlefield Artillery Tactics‚Äù and ‚ÄúWorld War I Gas Warfare Tactics and Equipment‚Äù. Despite their brevity and the fact that they too, like ‚ÄúArtillery in the Great War‚Äù, are too highly focused on the Western Front‚Äôs trench environment (with very little discussion on their topics outside this) they fill the gaps of this book well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VFIZ2K8W68F2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006LQ2D34#wasThisHelpful","R1VFIZ2K8W68F2","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This documentary has been highly praised by many reviews in the press with good reason. It provides a very good biography of Welles the man. One learns of his sad early childhood, very reminiscent (crudely) of the childhood of the main character in ‚ÄúCitizen Kane‚Äù. His mother died when he was 9, his father was out of his life and he was raised at a boarding school as a result. He was also a child prodigy in terms of poetry, music and the arts. He started in the theater when he was only 16. He was extremely focused and lacked empathy. Perhaps that was the reason for his success. It was probably also responsible, unfortunately, for his many divorces and his inability to interact with others, particularly the ‚Äúmoneyed‚Äù in Hollywood that were so needed for financing. As a result he was unable to complete many, many of the films that he started.The viewer also learns that he was an extremely dedicated and fixated on his craft and a workaholic (he died while working). Simultaneously, and ironically, he also had perspective with respect to his profession. He said, many times in his career, that he wished he could do more for humanity and being human transcended his profession. The documentary, unlike so many, is filled with pathos. It is not just a straight forward emotionless film.The documentary is also very, very well researched with many clips from his many interviews and public appearances. In addition, there are many interviews, that provide valuable insights into the man, with co-stars, co-workers, fellow students, etc.The one weakness of the film is that it does not delve into what really and truly made him the great artist that he was. That was the ‚Äústyle‚Äù of his art. In the whole (about) hour and a half of the documentary there is only one line on his film style ‚Äì basically that he made original and unique use of lighting, camera movements and was able to get the most out of his actors (and himself when acting). A few more minutes and more specifics on these would have provided valuable insight into what truly made him one of the greatest filmmakers of the last centuries. In the documentary there are many interviews with film greats such as George Lucas, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg (among many others) describing how influential he was in the medium but, unfortunately, the viewer does not come away, knowing specifically why.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VHN32VWD6BZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJFXGTO#wasThisHelpful","R1VHN32VWD6BZ6","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any review of this book would have to start out by pointing out that it is part of Osprey Publishing‚Äôs ‚ÄúCampaign‚Äù series. Hence it is relatively short, at only 96 pages in length (about a third or so of which consist of illustration of one type or another). Hence if one is looking for a detailed academic tome, like Dr. David Glantz‚Äôs multi-volume studies of campaigns like Stalingrad or Barbarossa, one will be disappointed. Then again it really would be unfair and unjustifiable to expect such a tome considering the limitations of the format imposed by the Campaign series. The relevant question to really ask is how well does the book do considering the format it is part of? The answer is very, very well.The book does an excellent job at all aspects that the Campaign series consists of, from the section on the strategic picture at the beginning of the campaign, through the commanders, how the campaign progressed, the aftermath and the battlefield today. The book starts off with the very important impetus for this campaign ‚Äì Hitler‚Äôs desire for oil. The text‚Äôs first sentence is the following quote from Hitler: ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt get the oil of Maikop and Grozny then I must liquidate the war‚Äù. Dr. Forzyk then delves into the commanders on both sides. In short and in a nutshell the German leadership, in the form of List, was a grave mistake. Not that he was a bad leader. He was not. The problem was that he was the wrong type of leader. He was an infantry leader with not enough understanding or experience commanding mechanized forces. This was a serious problem considering that the campaign was of a blitzkrieg nature plus had to be won in a very short time before the weather in the region put an end to fighting and without adequate forces. In addition, List misused the resources he was given. He used important elements of his mechanized forces in mountainous areas and used infantry, instead, in wide open areas where the benefits of maneuver that mechanized forces could have brought were squandered away. In addition, List, placed too much emphasis on protecting flanks, chasing ancillary goals and expending far too many troops (whole corps) on Russian troops already trapped. These doomed the campaign. That is not to say that Hitler‚Äôs usually meddling did not cause enough damage (i.e., changes in campaign priorities, not delivering promised forces to List, especially a number of mountain divisions that may have made a difference, etc.). From the Russian side, the most important negative was that those on top of the hierarchical command heap were the usual bunch of political cronies, albeit the lower level commanders were more experienced and better (as were lower level Germans like Kleist).With respect to the how the campaign played out, in a nutshell, the Germans started out quite well. Even though they did not bag as many troops as in previous campaigns they still did very well initially. Unfortunately they eventually came up to mountainous regions, stronger soviet defenses and bad weather. As a result the Germans never were unable to conquer the oil producing regions they so desired. Plus they were not even able to get more than an inconsequential trickle of fuel out of thea oil producing regions they did manage to conquer. Thus there were initial tactical and operational successes followed by strategic defeat.Overall an excellent book and highly recommended. It should also be emphasized that the book is not just a re-tread of already existing secondary literature. The author has made extensive use of primary sources, in particular German language.There is one particular weaknesses with the book though. That involves the Nazi leadership‚Äôs fantasy of being able to use this region, even if the military campaign was successful, as a means of fueling the German war machine (or a significant portion of it anyway). The problem was that just getting crude oil to the service is one (and only) step in obtaining useable fuel supplies. A second problem is that crude needs to be refined. Hence it also needs to be transported to refineries. It is inconceivable that the Germans could have built and operated a transportation infrastructure to transport so much crude oil back to refineries in axis territories (primarily refineries in Rumania). Even if they could transport it there was the question of whether or not the refining capacity existed to handle this crude. Unfortunately these key issues are not discussed in the book. They are what made Hitler‚Äôs dream nothing more than a Kafkaesque fantasy that made the military consequences of the campaign, to a very large degree, moot.One last point this reviewer would like to make is that, as Dr. Forcyzk pointed out, German special forces were widely used in this campaign. For those interested in an in-depth role that these forces played this reviewer highly recommends David Higgins ‚ÄúBehind Soviet Lines ‚Äì Hitler‚Äôs Brandenburgers Capture the Maikop Oilfields 1942‚Äù (part of Osprey‚Äôs ‚ÄúRaid‚Äù series). That book also has a more detailed discussion regarding the oil production issues and how they doomed the campaign from the beginning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJT6P9KXFW7QO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1472805836#wasThisHelpful","RJT6P9KXFW7QO","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The below is a review of the MP3 version of this work (not audible)This was one of the Financial Time‚Äôs best books on finance in the year it was release. For this reason this reviewer decided to read it. The first part of the book describes the role of excessive debt and how it leads to severe economic downturns and how debt overhang magnifies the impact of severe economic impact. It does this, primarily, by decreasing demand, especially by those not in the very, very top.In the second part of the book the authors show how in the US most government assistance went to the banking sector, primarily through TARP. He makes the argument that this policy preserved banking liquidity but did not (and could not) lead to a way out of recession as banks were unwilling to lend. The authors argue that housing debt should also have been targeted by government policy. The US‚Äôs policies, in their opinion, were too weak in this sphere.In the last third of the book the authors present what they consider to be a solution to the mortgage debt problems that have caused (in their opinion) and magnified economic downturns ‚Äì shared risk mortgages (SRM). A shared risk mortgage, unlike a conventional, fluctuates in value for the issuer. A fixed debt mortgage does not vary by the value of the underlying asset, the house. It stays the same, after the purchase of the house, no matter what the market value of the house. If a house is bought for $100,000 for example, and then falls to $30,000, the mortgage debt stays at $100,000 (minus what is paid off). AN SRM, on the other hand, varies. If the house is purchased for $100,000 and goes down to $30,000, the loss of $70,000 is split, in some manner, between the buyer and issuer of the mortgage (vice-versa also applies). The advantage an SRM would have is that it would permits the economy to better ‚Äúride out‚Äù busts in housing prices leading to an inability of owners to buy. This, in turn, would mitigate against a decrease in demand. The authors, MIan and Sufi, are not the first to put forth such an instrument. Schiller, in his ‚ÄúFinance and the Good Society‚Äù and the third edition of his ‚ÄúIrrational Exuberance‚Äù has put forth a similar proposal and, in this reviewer‚Äôs opinion, more robust proposals making use of financial instruments to hedge against a decrease in home prices. These books are also highly recommended (especially the former).For a laymen or undergrad economics major the first two portions of the book are worth something albeit the points have been written about countless times. The last part of the book, covering SRMs, is relatively novel and should be of interest not only to laymen but also serious students of economics and finance. It is the real meat of the book and what makes it highly recommendable.One minor critique of the MP3 audibook involves the reading. The reading is far too dramatic. As a result the book comes across as an overdramatic piece of fiction as opposed to the more serious economic book it is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10U9VG2U4WHTE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1491582324#wasThisHelpful","R10U9VG2U4WHTE","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The below is a review of the unabridged MP3 audio book version of this workIN the past three years or so a number of serious books have come out on the topic of the technology and its impact on the labor force. The most important of these seem to be (not necessarily in order of quality or importance) Eric Brynjolfson and Andrew McCfee‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies‚Äù, Tyler Cowen‚Äôs ‚ÄúAverage is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation‚Äù and Jaron Lanier‚Äôs ‚ÄúWho Own‚Äôs the Future?‚Äù.  Each has gaps that, to a large degree, Martin Ford‚Äôs book ‚ÄúRise of the Robots‚Äù fills and makes worth reading. For example, The Second Machine Age discusses well how technology is very rapidly and exponentially advancing but the book does not cover, very well, how that advance is impacting employment in the manufacturing sector, never mind the white collar. Plus the book‚Äôs ‚Äúsolution‚Äù, more education, is rather lame (as Rise of the Robots points out). Cowen‚Äôs book, the worse of the three, posits that technology will also negatively impact workers. The problem is that there is no real analysis of how. Dr. Cowen uses, exclusively, the very esoteric example of chess playing to posit that it is those who can best interact with machines that will be the real winners. Everyone else, the proverbial average, will lose. There is little discussion of capital ownership‚Äôs role in winning and losing (Mr. Ford posits that these people will be the real winners). Dr. Cowen also has no real solutions. He mentions that because the population will be older the status quo will prevail and a more progressive tax structure will not be feasible. In his book Lanier does a better job at discussing how the internet will lead to job loss (basically the nature of businesses on it is to favor a highly skewed income curve that will favor first movers). He puts forth a solution based on the payment of cash to individuals for the use of their digital on-line identities. One problem with this is that this is enough. The second is that, as even Lanier admits, these payments will be made by users on a ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù basis. Not very realistic. Discussion of non-internet job prospects is totally ignored.The Rise of the Robots proves superior to all of the above by filling in the gaps they leave. Most importantly he discusses how, in both white and blue collar sectors, technology will lead to unemployment. He discusses, intelligently, how various technologies (i.e., 3-D printing, neural networks and computing, big data, advances in machine pattern recognition) will do this and what current bottlenecks there are (primarily the lack of dexterity of machines). In addition, like Lanier, he posits that employment gains will follow a highly skewed distribution and that the real winners will the owners of capital, as opposed to just those who can work with computers (as Dr. Cowen did).Mr. Ford, after this discussion, provides solutions. The one that he emphasizes and considers the most realistic is a minimum income (not minimum wage) a la Hayek‚Äôs proposal. He believes this can solve the problem of mass unemployment caused by automation. However, this solution tacitly works on the assumption that those with who own all the income will just hand it over via progressive taxation. Not very realistic in this reviewer‚Äôs opinion. Why would they, if history is any guide? In the past this has only happened when nations were under serious threat from outside. England during the Napoleonic and two world wars and the US during the two world wars are classic examples. But would the financial oligarchy sacrifice otherwise? Of course those who say they would imply that the continuation of parliamentary democracy and stability would call for it. Aristotle observed the most stable states of his time were those with large middle classes. But what would prevent them from, instead, preferring a Pinochet or Franco, as the financial elite did in Chile or Spain? Mr. Ford does not investigate this relevant and very important question.The book also has a few other weaknesses albeit not acknowledging the above question is the book‚Äôs most important weaknesses. Other problems include going on too many tangents (i.e., global warming) and not discussing, in much greater depth, the issue of the physical dexterity of machines and the bottleneck it currently serves to the prevention of mass automation based unemployment. Despite these problems the book is still very good and well worth reading for both the curious and for policy makers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OY7A9JGPTP82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465059996#wasThisHelpful","R1OY7A9JGPTP82","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any review of this book would have to start by mentioning that it is part of Taschen Publisher‚Äôs ‚ÄúBasic Art‚Äù series. As such it is short at 96 pages (roughly a third of which consists of illustrations, primarily Durer‚Äôs most well-known works). Hence if one is looking for an academic tome this is not the book to purchase. The real question to ask is, how well does it serve as an introduction to Durer?The main drawback of the book is that Durer was incredibly prolific. Hence the book is unable to touch upon many of even his most famous works. Books in the ‚ÄúBasic Art‚Äù series tend to do quite well when covering artists with a relatively short portfolios. Examples include those on Hieronymus Bosch or Brugel the Elder, both of whom had, roughly, 40 or so identified works associated with them. This is not surprising considering the restraints imposed by the short length of the books in the series. Durer, unfortunately for the format‚Äôs short length, produced hundreds of works. The book does a decent introduction at introducing the reader to some of his major works but, due to its limitations, that is about all it can do.The book does a decent introduction at providing a biography of the artist (where born, his travels, what other artists inspired him, etc.). However it falls short on covering Durer‚Äôs unique ‚Äústyle‚Äù and how it differed from his contemporaries. The book also has very good illustrations. These are definitely not of a par found in museum quality books costing $50, $100 or more but then again the ‚ÄúBasic Art‚Äù series are priced at only about $10. For that price range the illustrations are unchallenged in quality.In short, a decent introduction to the artist‚Äôs life and his most important works but nothing more than that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FBFJ0WGWNYJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3822849227#wasThisHelpful","R1FBFJ0WGWNYJE","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing that needs to be stated in a review of this work is that it is intended as an introduction. It is not intended for anyone with an intermediate or above knowledge of the topic. For them the book would present nothing novel or nothing that one not new to the subject has not heard many times before. The book is a fairly conventional introduction that, in each of its chapter, touches the many bases. For example it covers the philosophical arguments for why deists believe what they do as well as atheists (though disappointingly it does not cover polytheism). It covers the intellectual development of religion as well, among other things. In short, a succinct introduction that touches the main bases and hence would be value as an introduction (four star value to this group) but that would not have anything that the more knowledgeable would find original or inspiring (two star for this group).The book is relatively well read by the author. Never monotone, boring or unenthusiastic.

"This is a review of the unabridged CD audio version of this work (not audible)This work consists of a number of short stories by Vonnegut on war plus a short introduction read by his son (which is also read by him). The short essay by the son (also read by him albeit the rest of the book is read by Rip Torn) is quite enlightening regarding Vonnegut‚Äôs career, personality and life. It elaborates on why, thanks to his personality, he was really unable to hold a ‚Äúconventional‚Äù job and how this forced him, more or less, into his profession. It also provides some insight into his humor (very strange) as well as into his personality and political views (not surprisingly anti-war and leftist).The meat and potatoes of the book, the numerous short stories, are a very mixed bag in terms of quality. Some are truly spectacular. These, in particular, are not the fictional works but the real life stories of himself as a prisoner where he worked extensively cleaning up after allied bombing raids. The scenes he described are truly horrific. For example, children being trapped in basements, cleaning out ash in the form of human beings, etc. These are truly moving and one can see, even if disagreeing with his anti-war views, why he had them and why they never left his mind or stopped inspiring him (if that is the correct word). The first story, which this is, is very well placed in that it is what inspired the rest of the stories on the CD as well as his lifelong works.There are also one or two other stories that can be described as being 5 star. Truly spectacular. There are also a few four star and one or two three star. Unfortunately about half the book consists of some pretty bad stories (one or two star quality). Hence this reviewer is unable to grant this CD more than a three star rating. That unfortunately, is pretty much is the mean quality of the stories on aggregate. On a more positive note the book is quite well read (about 4 stars). It is never monotone or boring, as bad as some of the stories may be.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBE3M5Z53YQBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425226891#wasThisHelpful","RBE3M5Z53YQBX","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a review of the seventieth anniversary edition (published in 2010)Any review of this book would have to start out by emphasizing that it is short. The book is only about 120 short pages of main text, as opposed to appendices (with each page consisting of only 2-3 paragraphs). It is something that can be read in about 2 hours or so (at most). Hence if one is looking for a scholarly tome on the subject this is not the book to read. Even the chapters on the subject, in Dr. Overy‚Äôs opus of bombing in the Second World War, ‚ÄúThe Bombing War: Europe 1939-1945‚Äù, are longer. [Please note that I am referring to the version of the book published outside North America. The version published in North America, called ‚ÄúThe Bombers and the Bombed‚Äù is unbelievably missing the chapters on the Battle of Britain as well as British air defense policy in the late 1930s.]The book serves as a very succinct survey of the situation before the battle, how it played out and what the results were on the course of the war. In the first part Dr. Overy describes British and German pre-war and early war air policies, experiences and force strengths and what role they played in the battle. One learns of the importance of British early warning system and the 2 excellent fighters that were designed before the war, the Hurricane and Spitfire. This system and the fighters were an excellent example of pre-war planning (and one of the few pre-war plans that actually was of any value) that played a decisive role in the battle. Without these the battle would probably have been lost. One also learns that German air policy was, pretty much, geared to supporting ground operations (as was actual German experience in the war up to that point).  As a result the Germans did not have the appropriate bomber aircraft, long range fighters, experience and doctrine to fight such a battle. Thus British air policy and assets were appropriate for the battle to come while Germany‚Äôs were not. Also, the author shatters the myth that British fighter forces were vastly outnumbered by Germany‚Äôs in either the number of fighter aircraft or fighter pilots available for operational service. Unfortunately Dr. Overy does not mention the main reason for this, which was the severe mauling that Germany‚Äôs air force experienced before the Battle of Britain (about a third of the German air force was destroyed).In the second section of the book, the battle, Dr. Overy provides an excellent narrative on how the battle played out. German indecision on what strategy to pursue, British fixation on the correct policy along with vast overestimates of British losses by German leaders (and British underestimates of German losses) that lead to asymmetrical strategies (as the Germans believed that England air power was finished they adopted aggressive policies that lead to unsustainable losses while Britain adopted conservative policies that enabled them to minimize their losses) all played a role in the final results of the battle.In the final third of the book Dr. Overy provides an overview of the battle in terms of what in meant in regard to the war (up to that point). He emphasized it was one, and only one,  aspect of the war and that what was happening in other fronts (i.e., battle of the Atlantic, middle east and most importantly Hitler‚Äôs decision to attack the Soviet Union) were also of great importance . He also is careful to mention that there were other factors that were of great importance to the feasibility of operation Sea lion (i.e., British naval superiority and the questionable ability of Germans to carry out the requisite amphibious aspects of such an operation even if they had achieved air superiority). These all greatly mitigated the importance of the battle in terms of its consequences on the war.In short, a very succinct and readable book that hits all the nails on the head with respect to this battle. Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W9WL904YY8H0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393322971#wasThisHelpful","R2W9WL904YY8H0","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a relatively short book, at 90 pages (each of which consists of about 4-5 paragraphs). As a result it is not a scholarly tome. Nevertheless, it makes some very important points that economists as well as the lay public need to be made aware of. The most important, by far, is that excessive private sector debt in and by itself (as opposed to public sector) plays a very important role in setting off banking crises. The author notes that when private sector debt reaches about 150% of GDP AND private sector debt has grown about 18% (or more) per annum for five years straight years, a liquidity crisis follows over 90% of the time. This alone is worth reading the book to learn. Considering the fact that the book takes about one hour to read not much cost in terms of one‚Äôs time. Another additional observation the author makes, though not very original, is that there is serious deleveraging of debt after the associated bubble bursts. This leads to anemic post-bubble growth. For a far more in-depth and scholarly analysis of this deleveraging this reviewer highly recommends Dr. Richard Koo‚Äôs (Economist for Namura Securities, a Japanese investment/banking house) ‚ÄúThe Holy Grail of Macroeconomics: Lessons from Japan‚Äôs Great Recession‚Äù and his ‚ÄúEscape from the Balance Sheet Recession and the QE Trap‚Äù.Unfortunately the book also has many weaknesses. One is that the many empirical illustrations that the author refers to in the book‚Äôs text (and are important to his argument) are not included in the book but must be examined via a website. A second problem is that there is no explanation of why debt may increase in the spurts he describes that lead to banking/liquidity crises. On the flip sides he also does not elaborate on why deleveraging occurs (unlike Dr. Koo in his books).The third and most important weakness is the solution that the author presents to getting an economy out of a post liquidity/banking bubble burst. That is a government subsidized debt forgiveness program that would be geared, primarily, to the mortgage market.  According to the author, who emphasizes this would be a one off event (considering the real political world it is hard to believe this assumption would be credible), this would lead to a recovery. Unfortunately the author does not discuss how exactly this would happen. It may decrease the time required to deleverage but why would it be expected that this would lead us out of slow (or no) growth period during the interim deleveraging period? The author does not answer this question nor provide any empirical evidence to support why it would be the case. Dr. Koo, in his books, is quite explicit in his views (strongly argued) that it would be hard to imagine that this would happen during the interim deleveraging period.That is why Dr. Koo, as well as the majority of mainstream economists, emphasize the need for expansionary fiscal policy during this interim period. Mr. Vague, the author, contends that such an expansionary fiscal policy is not a logical solution (page 53 of book). This, he contends, is for 3 reasons. One is that ‚Äúthe private market is generally a better allocator of capital‚Äù (p. 53). True, but his debt relief program would also lead to capital misallocations, especially if it were known that it would not be a one-off event. The second reason is that ‚Äúquality of spending matters and is more often than not compromised in these efforts‚Äù (p.53). Again, quality is important but why would it be expected that there would be any increase in private sector spending resulting from debt forgiveness? This is a very problematic assumption that Mr. Vague does not argue persuasively either theoretically or empirically. All that decrease in debt resulting from the subsidized write-down in debt (which may not even be 100% of debt ‚Äì the author does not discuss how large this should be) could be used to further pay down debt or be hoarded (i.e., not spent). Mr. Vague‚Äôs third critique of traditional expansionary fiscal policy is that its ‚Äúmost notable drawback ‚Ä¶ is that it results in higher government debt to GDP‚Äù (p.53). Unfortunately Mr. Vague‚Äôs subsidized debt write-off program also leads to higher federal government debt. He does not answer the question of why this would not be the case.In short, a book with one notable reason to read (rapid increases in private debt over a five years and a level of private debt at 150% of GDP has historically lead to banking/liquidity crises in the past) but little more. That, however, more than justifies the hour to hour and a half that it takes to read this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX02BLD9646JZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812247043#wasThisHelpful","RX02BLD9646JZ","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Of these pages only, very roughly, a third of consist of text. Hence if one is looking for a scholarly tome on the subject this is not the book to purchase. The real question to ask is how well does it do for the limits imposed by this format? The answer is very well.The book provides more than just a brief biography of the man and his paintings (parents, where he was born, where resided, who commissioned his major works, etc.). Thanks to the fact that the two authors are scholars (i.e., Professors) they provide a very interesting analysis of Bruegel‚Äôs major works. Not only is what is painted, literally, is discussed and analyzed but so is the allegorical meaning of the works in terms of their historical time as well as minor nuances that are quite important in interpreting their meanings. For example, the authors point out how many common maxims of Bruegel‚Äôs time and area of residence (i.e., Spanish Netherlands which today consists of the areas, very roughly, of the Netherlands and Holland) are referred to implicitly in the paintings. For example, one of his paintings illustrates over 100 of these common maxims. The authors present a one page schematic showing this.The authors also point out how many of his paintings have allegorical historical meanings. For example the Duke of Alba, the man Spain sent to lead the vicious counter reformation in the Spanish Netherlands (where Bruegel resided), is subtlety included in an implicit and subtle fashion as a black knight (he wore black armor) in paintings set in ancient times where Christians are being persecuted.The book also discusses Bruegel‚Äôs particular ‚Äústyle‚Äù of painting and how it differed from his contemporaries. This is not only in terms of technique (i.e., use of bright colors) but also topics chosen. For example common folk were presented in a non-mocking fashion, something that was common, at the time, only among painters in the Spanish Netherlands. In the rest of Europe peasants and common persons were usually presented only as fools, sinners, degenerates or in other non-praiseworthy manners.Lastly, the paintings are illustrated in beautiful colors and plates. These by no means can compete with fine museum quality books (which usually sell at many times of this Taschen volume) but are, by far, the best this reviewer has ever seen in art books in the $10 range.All and all a very good book on Bruegel and his art (and all 45 of Bruegel‚Äôs authenticated paintings) for anyone interesting in getting up to speed in about an hour and a half of reading time. Definitely very well worth much more than the approximately $10 cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3516S3IFSVES9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3822859915#wasThisHelpful","R3516S3IFSVES9","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any review of this book would have to start by mentioning that it is part of Taschen‚Äôs ‚ÄúBasic Art‚Äù series. As such it is relatively short (96 pages) with plenty of illustrations (at least half the book). Hence if one is looking for a scholarly tome this is not the book to purchase. The relevant question is how well does this book do, as an introduction, considering the limits of its format? The answer is very well.This reviewer states this for four reasons. One is that the book provides a decent biography of the man. Where he was born, who his parents were, where he lived, under who he studied, his family life and the economic circumstances surrounding it. The latter is of particular interest as most of his life, as a result of his well to do economic status, he was able to practice his art. However, one of the Franco-Dutch wars led to his financial ruin and this lead to the end his career as an artist and to his life. This ruin lead to an acute depression that brought an end to him.The book also covers his ‚Äústyle‚Äù, particularly what differentiated him from other painters of his time. The most important differentiating fact, in much of his art (especially landscapes and interiors) was his use of the camera obscura (a box like camera that projected an image through a pin hole or lens to a paper at the back) to produce photorealistic art. This device was known since antiquity but with advances in optics around his time, enabled him to go one better. It enabled him to, basically, make sketches that he painted over later. Much of his personal ‚Äústyle‚Äù can also be traced to it. It accounted for lens-like distortion, especially towards the edges of his paintings, in both his landscapes and interiors. In addition, it accounted for the lack of very close-up detail. If one looks very closely at many of his paintings very fine lines are not visible. The ‚Äúdetails‚Äù are blurred instead. The author points out how the use of the camera obscura was responsible for this. The book also covers well the historical and social context of his paintings as well as their allegorical meanings.The illustrations are also very good for this price range. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. They definitely do not compare to fine museum books going for a $50 and above price range but for only $10 they are unsurpassed. They have few faults compared to even these higher price range art books. One final comment is that this book does not have a blurb on the back cover or back jacket flap with a paragraph or so telling the reader who the author is, Norbert Schneider, and what his credentials are. Authors of books in this Taschen series are normally art Professors and museum curators and based on the author‚Äôs knowledge base, as illustrated by the book, this is probably the case. It would have been nice to know however.All and all a four star book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OGW190FXMNGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3822863238#wasThisHelpful","R2OGW190FXMNGH","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This produce is being reviewed with the following options:1) Raid 0 option selected (no other raid option was tried)2) Esata connection only (USB not tried)3) Windows 7 Pro operating system4) 2 Toshiba 3 tb 7,200 RPM 64 mb cache hard disksThe product was relatively easy to set up. Was opened using standard screw driver (unfortunately the unit does not have tooless type screws that can be opened/closed by hand) and the hard disks put in and screwed in position. This is not a hot swappable unit. Then the dip switches were selected and the ‚Äúreset‚Äù button was pressed with the unit still open. One minor problem with this unit is that the dip switches and reset button are not accessible from outside the case. You need to open it up. Hence for those who need to switch these often this case is not optimal. Then the new Toshiba 3 tb hard disks formatted. The instructions state that it takes about one hour per 250 gb. This sounds about right. I set it in early evening to start formatting and it was done by next morning. It should be noted that the formatting should be done before the enclosure is attached to the computer. After formatting went into windows disk manager and assigned the raid 0 disk a name. Computer recognized it and was ready to use. Works relatively well and quickly. Have had it a week and no problems yet.Two more comments. The case is fairly nice and solid. By this I mean for an office setting would be fine but the case is not something I would lug around perpetually. Not well built enough for constant vigorous movement. If one is looking for a case one needs to lug around a lot would not recommend this. The LED lights are quite bright. Too bright in my opinion but this is not a serious problem. Also, the fan is not loud at all. On 1 to 5 scale with 1 being silent and 5 loud would give this a 2. Another slight problem, related to this though, is that the fan is not that powerful. Placed my hand in front of it and it did not seem to draw (or push) much air into or out of the unit. Plus it is relatively small. I had a Sans Digital dual disk raid system and the fan was much more powerful (and only slightly louder). Due to the small fan, combined with fact that there are no vent holes in unit, I would not recommend for disks that radiate high heat (i.e., large disks such as 6 GB, 10,000 rpm disks or disks that have a reputation for heat).All and all not a bad enclosure for the price. Recommended for what it is and the constraints mentioned above.

"This book, like those in Peachpit‚Äôs ‚ÄúFrom Snapshots to Great Shots‚Äù series, is geared to the beginner. It contains relatively basic information on equipment (i.e., importance of tripod in landscape photography, overviews of types of digital camera and formats, etc.), composition (i.e., rule of two-thirds, etc.), exposure and depth-of-field. Any photographer over and above the beginner would have heard everything mentioned with regard to these a million times over. Thus the book, for anyone over and above the beginner would not find too much value in the book.A few important facts that also need to be mentioned about this book is that it covers a few topics that are rarely touched upon by books on landscape photography. One such topic, rather surprisingly, is how to make use of the sky. Few books on landscape photography touch upon this. The book also has chapters geared to using HDR photography specifically in situations geared to landscape photography, black and white landscape photography and computer fine tuning specifically geared to landscape photography. Very few books geared toward the beginning landscape photographer cover these topics.The book does have one problem and that is that it does not emphasize (or even state for that matter) the very important fact that early sunsets and sunrises produce lighting that tends to be, in general, fantastic for landscape photographers. No examples or discussion is provided of using lighting during these so important photogenic parts of the day.In short, a very good book that the beginning photographer in the field would find of quite some value but that more experienced photographers would not.

"This book does a very good job at providing an overview of Kubrick the artist and his films. It starts off with his childhood and how his passion for photography served him well throughout his career. It also shows how he was a prodigy as a photographer. At 16 he had managed to sell one of the photographs he had taken to Look magazine, one of the nation‚Äôs leading picture magazines (a competitor of Life magazine). The viewer learns how his father had such confidence in him that he cashed in his life insurance to finance his first film. The viewer also learns how Kubrick was uncompromising and perfectionist in his art. It was his way or the highway. No comprimise whatsoever. Kubrick‚Äôs style of filmmaking is also examined. That was basically that Kubrick had full control of his films, from the properties he bought, to the filming through editing. He basically controlled every aspect of his film. The only notable exception was Spartacus. All and all a very good introduction to Kubrick the artist and his films.However, the documentary does have a few problems that prevent this from being a five star film. One is that many of the ‚Äútalking heads‚Äù are added only for purposes of making the documentary more marketable. Most have nothing of value to say. There are a few, however, that do. Not surprisingly they are filmmakers like Martin Scorsese, who comment on how Kubrick‚Äôs cinema graphic style and originality. Arthur C. Clark also offers insights into how it was like to work with Kubrick and insights into his personality from that perspective (i.e., Kubrick‚Äôs perfectionism, lack of compromise, hard work ethic, etc.). Most of the talking heads say nothing of value though.The documentary also has a few other significant weaknesses. It misses the fact that Kubrick was introverted and shy despite the fact that he was very forceful, personality wise, behind the camera. It also misses the fact that he was probably autistic (albeit only to a minor degree). It also misses the role that his childhood hobbies of literature and chess played in his role as a filmmaker. It is mentioned that he liked chess in the documentary but not how chess, in Kubrick‚Äôs words, trained him to think a few moves ahead while making films and not concentrate on just the immediate.In short, despite these weaknesses, a highly recommended documentary. This reviewer also recommends, Paul Duncan‚Äôs book Stanley Kubrick: The Complete Films. This book provides an excellent supplement to this documentary in terms of missing gaps as well as providing a slightly better survey of Kubrick‚Äôs films and Kubrick the artist (five stars for that book versus four for this documentary).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UCDUOO96HEI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0079HXCVQ#wasThisHelpful","R3UCDUOO96HEI7","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is part of Taschen publisher‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Complete Films‚Äù series. As such it is relatively short at only 96 pages in length (of which about a third to a half consist of photographs). As such it, obviously, cannot provide an academic tome on its subject. The relevant question that needs to be asked is how well does it cover its subject considering the limits of its format? The answer is an excellent manner.The book provides an excellent synopsis of Kubrick the artist, from his childhood to his first films through his final, Eyes Wide Shut (according to the book he considered this his best film). According to the author, Kubrick suffered from some learning disability, possibly autism. Others would disagree with this prognosis. In the documentary DVD Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures (a DVD that this reviewer highly recommends to those interested Kubrick) the argument is instead made that Kubrick only cared about what interested him and ignored everything else (as opposed to being autistic). But, either way, his father provided him with extensive schooling outside of and in addition to his formal schooling. His father also was responsible for giving him a passion for literature, chess and photography. His father, being a medical doctor, could afford to buy him a professional twin lens camera as a child, something that parents of lesser means could not afford. This interest in photography played a very important role in his filmmaking. Literature also served Kubrick well as it played a pivotal role in his films. Kubrick thought that story and plot lines were of the utmost importance and he found inspiration in serious literature throughout his life. Even chess was important to his filmmaking in that, in his own words, it required him to think ahead in terms of the filmmaking process and not just accept immediate aesthetics in, say, the immediate shoot. As a child and early adult, Kubrick also had school mates and friends that fit in with this filmmaking career. He had class mates who were serious photo buffs with darkrooms, with musical ability and with writing ability (one was later a Pulitzer Prize winner). Everything fell into place in his childhood. It reminds one of Jung‚Äôs theory of synchronicity.He was an exceptionally gifted photographer as can be seen by the fact that Look magazine, one of the leading pictorial publications of the time, bought a photography of his when he was only 16 years old and made him a staff member shortly afterwards. One also learns that Kubrick was quite introverted, withdrawn and shy. Many thought he would never make a director as a result. But behind the camera he was very demanding and domineering. Things had to be his way with no compromise.The book then goes into his cinema graphic career. From his very first films shows that he is a prodigy despite the limited budgets he had to work with. The book then goes through and discusses the remaining of his films in detail and with a good analysis regarding what inspired him and why they worked. The book, as usual for a Taschen publication, is also richly illustrated in high quality photographs and printed in almost museum quality. Very impressive and surprising for only a $10 book.In short, an excellent succinct overview of not only Kubrick‚Äôs films but also of Kubrick the filmmaker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NKF24EHHDKY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3836527758#wasThisHelpful","R3NKF24EHHDKY0","A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Summertime means grilling right? Well my husband in this household is the grill king. I make sure he has all the right tools for the job as well. We will call the Sauce pot and Basting Brush by A1PP the crown and the ceptor. I had originally purchased just a regular paint brush for him to use. For some reason it just wasn't what he wanted. There was a promotional offer on this product for an honest review. I love buying items and reviewing them. My husband has been my test guinea pig on many items. This one though I think has been his favorite so far. He saw the package and even if it isn't for him he opens it.. So much for surprises huh? Well he saw this and was ready to find whatever he could to put on the grill. He started pulling stuff out of the fridge for his ""Sauce"". Wow. I was frightened for a short moment. His excitement was so intense. He says it is the perfect size, the brush is perfect because it won't burn. He went out and bought some ribs and went to town. Then I decided for dinner one night I would grill some chicken and personally I was thoroughly enjoying the experience as well. Now I may not love it like the Grill King, but I can see his affection for the item.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B76NGGWBGVMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5YNKHM#wasThisHelpful","R3B76NGGWBGVMV","A19H0LVGWNI0CZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19H0LVGWNI0CZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So as a woman at a beautiful age of 37 and raising 3 kids I can get a bit tired. I am not quite at the age where I have to worry about menopause or other consequences of aging. But with life you have to be on top of things and sometimes that does not include your husband. I know I know a bit dramatic. I love my husband dearly and he still after almost 10 years finds me very attractive and lets me know every chance he gets. I think he is still sexy as well and wish I had the energy to keep up with his drive. I saw a promotional offer for Lovera supplement and at first thought maybe i didn't need it because of my age. When I read some of the claims about increased libido and energy however I took the offer. I have barely been taking it for 2 weeks. I must say that within the first week I noticed a difference. My sex drive definitely increased. My husband I think noticed the difference before I did. He had a ""What has gotten into you?!"" moment. It was then I made the connection. My energy has increased as well. I felt more like getting projects done around the house instead of just maintaining.First I love how feminine the product looks. It comes in a cute little tub with a  snap top and a cute pink pouch. The product really caters to the woman in you. The one that likes to feel and look pretty. There is no aftertaste from the product and the pills are normal easy to swallow size. I recommend this product to any mom who is just tired and is looking for a natural supplement to help out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW34PU0GS2GXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHARLD2#wasThisHelpful","RW34PU0GS2GXT","A19H0LVGWNI0CZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19H0LVGWNI0CZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use these headphones ALL THE TIME! Earbuds hurt my ears and won't stay in. I have tried numerous kinds. The ones that do stay in hurt, or the ones that don't hurt won't stay. So I was looking for a comfortable set of headphones. I found these and loved them immediately. I will use them walking around the yard doing work. I use them to rehearse my music. I even use them to talk on my phone when I am busy doing dishes or need my hands free. I even fall asleep sometime with them on while listening to guided meditation.

"I am an avid gardener and love growing culinary herbs and medicinal herbs. I usually use a mortal and pestle but that can be so time consuming. I have an herb grinder for my medicinal herbs but not really a separate one for my culinary herbs. There was an offer to get a discount on this item in exchange for a review and I was excited to receive it. I love trying new products that can better benefit my life and my kitchen skills. So my main grinding herbs are stevia, mint and rosemary. I pick them, dry them, and grind them. The stevia is such a beautiful plant and is what I used in the photos below. I use it in baking as a sweetner and I brew it in my tea.First let me describe the product. It is a four part grinder that has a magnetic top for grinding, large holes that catch the grinds on a screen and another bottom chamber that catches the small pollen or powdery bits. It has a small scraper to get all the powder bits for ultimate use.I for one love this as it is not to small and grinds the herbs perfectly. Not to small but not to big either, perfect for teas and spices. I have yet to use it on my medicinal herbs but I bet it would be great. Might even switch it out with my other one. Still out on that. Quick and easy to use. No fuss, no mess.. No more hand cramping mortal and pestle grinding. I have the WEnEED now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M6IKSWBSGAII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WYWNWGQ#wasThisHelpful","R3M6IKSWBSGAII","A19H0LVGWNI0CZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19H0LVGWNI0CZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am thoroughly impressed with this eye cream. I have been using it for 2 weeks now. I saw a noticeable difference in the first week. The puffiness and dark circles under my eyes decreased dramatically. I have used creams and anti wrinkle serums before but not worked as well as this. There was no stinging or burning around my eyes. There is a little tightness but I would expect that if it is decreasing wrinkles and puffiness. There is no harsh chemical smells. It is my go to first thing in the morning and I even apply it before bedtime. Again I am impressed! Maybe even that isn't a good enough word but it is what I have. I can honestly claim though as a mom of three children my sleep habits are not at the finest. So to have something that actually does what it claims to do is a joyous occasion for me. It is part of my permanent face regimen.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. My opinion is. I love it! I will be buy it again and will be posting pics as soon as my computer will upload them from my camera. You have to see the difference to believe it.

"My husband is the coffee drinker of the house. I mean at least a pot a day. I on the other hand like to have one cup a day. I like the taste of coffee but usually only with cream and sugar. I shy away from drinking it because personally I could do without the extra calories the cream and sugar have to offer. Also I get the leftover coffee in the morning. The quarter pot that is sitting cold 2 hours after my husband has left for work. I usually add a cup of water, reusing the already used grounds,  and turn it on. Yes the coffee is a bit weak but I honestly don't want to brew another pot that will  be wasted. This also allows for my husband to still have a cup left when he gets home to have his iced coffee. Okay! I know that may seem like a lot just to review this coffee but it is leading to something very important to me. Something that has changed my enjoyment of coffee.We have locally roasted coffee companies in the area that we buy our coffee from. They have many spectacular blends, but not to many flavored blends. When offered a coupon to try this flavored organic coffee, there was no doubt I would enjoy choosing flavors. I have always been a fan of caramel and so of course I went for the Caramel Nut. There was temptation with other selections but I will save that for future purchases. I really like how it is already  ground, my husband prefers beans, hence why I get lazy about brewing more. This way I can still keep routine but one extra step of adding a tablespoon of Latitude Organic Caramel Nut coffee to the top of my husbands. I add my water and brew. (I would like to add that I also brewed this in my french press and tasted without the hubbies brew.)After it was done I wanted to taste it without my added calories. Immediately the aroma took my breath away. I know this sounds like someone who has never had caramel flavored coffee before, and I have, but it has been a LONG TIME. This was like starting all over again. THE AROMA!! No words in my vocabulary can describe that smell. I literally took a moment and pulled in long deep breathes through my nose. Even now my memory of it is enjoyable. Back to what I was saying. I took a sip of the coffee and I don't know coffee talk as far as robust, or nutty, or acidic. I say what I taste. I did notice the caramel flavor right away, partially I think cause my olfactory was still deeply connected to previous events. The flavor was light and yes I guess I would say nutty. All I know is the taste on my tongue was just as satisfied as my nose. I drank that entire cup without any extras. Then I did the french press and added a touch of cream. Oh my... Again words would be helpful, but all I have are emotions!! This is a welcomed part of my morning routine. I could almost cry. Overwhelmed with satisfaction and joy over my new morning cup of coffee. Literally changing how my days start. It tastes so absolutely amazing! I will be trying future flavored blends as well. This coffee is a must-have, and when brewed in a french press you really get a grand experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ITL0CC5IBSXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V54E08S#wasThisHelpful","R2ITL0CC5IBSXV","A19H0LVGWNI0CZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19H0LVGWNI0CZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have become a fitness enthusiast for the last few years. While I have not completely met my fitness goals I am steadily working to achieve them. So when I see particular supplements offered that can help me reach my goals I love to research them and then try them out. I saw a discounted offer for the L-Carnitine in exchange for a review and wanted to give it a try. First I did research the supplement itself to see if it would be something I could use. Of course I read that it increases blood flow and help with active muscle recovery after a workout. I knew that would be beneficial for me as I lift weights and rip my muscles apart. This leads to dealing with soreness the next day. It also stated that it will help improve cognitive ability as well. With 3 Kids I need all the cognitive help I can get. So I received the supplements approx. 2 weeks ago. I have been taking them consistently for 1 week. So far I have noticed a slight difference in my performance level during my workouts. My muscle soreness as decreased after my workouts. I have been making an effort to increase weights so I can truly test the product. Really pushing my muscles to their max.  As for my cognitive performance I am not so sure.As for the pills they are small and easy to swallow. The dosage is absolutely doable. Take 2 pills twice daily is easy to remember. I take them in the morning and afternoon. There are no side effects that I have noticed and no after taste. I have experienced some nasty after effects of other supplements. I was very glad that this one did not do that. So far I am enjoying the supplement and hope to report back with more definitive results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C2MX5YUH8C6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YBIL2CW#wasThisHelpful","R2C2MX5YUH8C6","A19H0LVGWNI0CZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19H0LVGWNI0CZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He loves hiding in boxes and reaching out to get you. I received a coupon code for this item and thought what the heck. When I got it in the mail I was really excited to try it. My kitty just happened to be outside and in a very relaxed mood. We took out the long toy with the fuzzy end and started moving it around .. He was immediately interested and loved playing with it.

"I am no stranger to using menstrual cups. I have been using one for that last 5 years. I was ready to buy a new one when I saw this was up for a discount in return for a review.So the shape/design is like the other brand I have used which was really great because I did not want to try to get used to a new design. The cup itself comes in two different sizes, small for women who have not had children and large for those of us that have. The Large is not huge and is actually a comfortable size. The stem on the bottom really isn't that long with is also a plus because if they are to long they can be uncomfortable. The instructions were easy to follow. The cup itself is a very soft pliable material. Where the past one I used was a bit harder. So this has taken some getting used to. I am still unsure if I like that it is softer. I am getting used to the insertion process with it being a bit softer which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of five. This could change after a few uses and I find can really decide how I like it.It comes with a cute discreet bag to put it in when not in use.The seal is good and I have not experienced any leaks so far. My cycle is always heaviest the first 3 days so if it was going to leak it would have. Most of the time if you do experience leaking it is not inserted correctly. (I found this out the hard way).What I love most about using a menstrual cup is not only has it saved me HUNDREDS of dollars but it also helps protect the planet and our body from harmful heavy toxins and pollutants.I am super happy to see that this kind of product is on the market now. Knowing that these are on the market and having two daughters I am going to forgo the ""mainstream"" menstruating choices and introduce them to these instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F6N33WGLZCQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TNLO7ZQ#wasThisHelpful","R2F6N33WGLZCQM","A19H0LVGWNI0CZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19H0LVGWNI0CZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never thought to use scissors for my herbs. I don't know why it has never crossed my mind, but it hasn't. I always just dry and crush, or chop them up on the cutting board with a knife. I really had no idea these existed until I saw the coupon for these in exchange for an honest review. Of course I was ready to try it out. I felt like I was getting to try out a new invention or something. When I received them in the mail I immediately ran to the herb garden. I told the kids and the husband: ""I don't know whats for dinner yet but its gonna have rosemary in it!"" I was so excited. I just started cutting.. just snip snip snip and the wonder and joy I felt while doing this could be compared to a kid in a toy store. Wide eyed and overjoyed. They are a normal size, the finger holes are perfect. It has a great cover to protect the blades after use that lock on so no fear of it falling off. They are easy to clean.

"WOW! <-- That word does not even begin to describe my love for this kit. I am a mom and wife. I like to cook for my family and anyone in my position knows that you can get stuck in a rut. I have tried to cook with Curry and make is taste as authentic as possible, but there was never any direction or understanding about the spices. I mean I have a jar of anise seeds in my cupboard forever but have no idea what they are used for. Until now! I finally understand what cardamom is and why it has such a potent smell but fabulous taste, I now know that chili powder isn't just for beans anymore. I have a new love for whole fresh spices!With this kit you get a nice round tin, the spice box, in this are small dishes that hold the individual spices. Now it comes packaged so you get to clean up the spice box and dishes and slowly add the bag of spice to each one. I really enjoyed doing this. They sit nicely in the tin and are easy to just take a pinch or a measurement from.There is a book that comes with it. A real actual very vibrant pictured book, with real recipes. So far I have cooked the Chicken Curry (as in pic attached), Broccoli and Onion Curry, and the Cauliflower and Peas Curry. I don't wanna give to much away, but the book has some very good information and is easy to follow.My husband and kids loved all the recipes I have tried so far. As a matter of a fact my husband said something along the lines of ""Ever since you got that Kitchen Curry Master Set all the dinners have tasted great! Are you gonna use that more often?"" Needless to say trying my hand at authentic Curry dishes is a winner in this household. I have succeeded in trying something that I was completely foreign to and feeling like a Master after using this set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REFOHM6ML2G0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JCFV2T2#wasThisHelpful","REFOHM6ML2G0S","A19H0LVGWNI0CZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19H0LVGWNI0CZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As with any stay at home mom I am sure I am not the only one trying to organize her life with three kids running around. Though there are times I am extremely grateful we don't have sports just yet. I still have to keep up with a schedule. Between blogging, playdates, rehearsals, and the common household chores one can get a little overwhelmed. First of all I loved the binding and the front and back hard book this is. Secondly I absolutely adore the beautiful words of encouragement all through out this wonderful organizer. The prompts for being grateful, for being positive are right up my ally of love and wholesomeness. I was surprised at all the great detail this encourages for organization. I do wish the pages were replaceable or that the months weren't assigned to pages. I unfortunately received it half way through the year and would've loved to use start to finish. But I did receive a purchase coupon to review it. I must say that my favorite part is the way it encourages you to be happy. Just the sayings alone are enough to make you want to pick it up and start writing, organizing, and straightening life out a little bit. The vision tactic is helpful and keeps you goal oriented. Plus it is 100% recycled which for an earth conscious person like me is important.  I have been using it regularly and am loving it. If it works out will probably look into getting one for next year.. but start the year off with the organizer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJNYEWM24GLW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T1ZG92S#wasThisHelpful","RJNYEWM24GLW8","A19H0LVGWNI0CZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19H0LVGWNI0CZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This family of mine, bikes and more bikes.. rides and more rides.. bike lights and more bike lights. Now mind you we live out in the country and ride on a lot of dirt trails and country roads. So the kids needing lights is more of a way to get around the woods when the lights getting dim on the property. I can't tell you how many we have purchased. My youngest had his tail light break and I was just about to buy a new one when I saw these being offered at a discount to be reviewed and was excited to try them. I have purchased other light products from AOR and know they are a brand I have enjoyed using before. My son saw these and knew they were for him. He opened the package and ran to put them on his bike, he is 4 years old. They just happened to come around a weekend we were having BBQ with friends and late night bike rides in the woods with the daddies. I figured if my 4 yr old son could figure out how to get these on his bike then he could ride with them as long as he wanted to. Unfortunately the taillight died and needed a new battery after just a short time of using it. But it was an easy enough fix. Haven't had a problem again. I like how they are an easy push on and off button. I like the pliable feel and how it grips onto the handle bars and seat post nicely. There were no worries of it falling off.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MI8ID9WE661/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRPEFK4#wasThisHelpful","R1MI8ID9WE661","A19H0LVGWNI0CZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19H0LVGWNI0CZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live on the beautiful Northern California Coast and as beautiful as our beaches are I swear we don't get to go enough. When we do go however, we take kites. There is never a doubt in our mind that at the beach there will be enough wind to suspend a kite. Normally however the kites we get are ones that Nana sends to the kids. They are dollar tree plastic kites. While we take care so we always have them. There are those times when the plastic rips or the strands tear off, or even the braces break. When I saw this kite was being offered at a discount for an honest review my first thoughts were, ""YAY an Actual KITE for the beach!!"" Then it got me thinking about why there aren't any kite shops in the area, but I digress. So it was time to go fly the new kite. The kids were super excited and a little bummed there was only one. I let them know that if this was a go then we would definitely be getting 2 more (I have 3 kids). We got down there and immediately was able to put the kite together with ease. Super understandable directions for an easy to build kite.  The fabric was durable and the wind picked it up with out a care. The kids loved seeing the colors fly in the sky. We anchored the kite and just let it flap in the wind for a good while. It comes with reusable packaging to put the kite in when you are done and store for later use. Which for us was the next couple days.  Definitely going be looking in to getting a couple more kites from this company.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UYY2Z01UNBBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JUEJ4H2#wasThisHelpful","R1UYY2Z01UNBBA","A19H0LVGWNI0CZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19H0LVGWNI0CZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the perfect little flash light for our family. We have three very active children. Sometimes sleeping on the trampoline is a must do. Well we normally have a nice camping lantern they use. Alas the batteries were dead. So I let the kids use this cute little flashlight instead. It worked out great. The kids were able to see what they were doing but still able to fall asleep because the lantern was not to bright. Of course we did have it on the low setting. I was able to get it after they fell asleep and use the flash light end to go lock up our chickens. Since then it has been my go to light for going outside in the dark. I have already put in on my list of must haves to go in our camping gear. It is light weight and compact. The handle is just right for hanging off of places so you can be hands free. I am so happy I was selected to review this item at a discount price. Now I know which company to go to for my light needs.

"This Mat is Amazing! Now I do not do yoga on a daily basis but a few times a week I do enjoy it. This mat is Eco Friendly, Durable, and Just the right size. I have gone through numerous mats. They end up shredding where my feet are. So when I got the opportunity to use this item and review at a discount price I jumped on it. Well the deal and the mat.Anyhow, I loved how when I took it out of the box and wrapper it didn't have a chemical smell at all. It smelled nice, clean, and sweet. Then to learn about how it is made from recycled materials and the environmentally friendliness of the product I was hooked.Then it was time to use it. I popped in my Yoga DVD played out the mat and started doing my yoga. Now again the smell came in handy when doing the Vinyasa. It was nice, thick, and just the right length. It didn't slip when jumping to my feet or back into plank. I can tell that it isn't going to shred the way my other matts have.This mat is just amazing. I look forward to using it many more times when doing my yoga routines.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R139JNENCZZDPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P2T3IG2#wasThisHelpful","R139JNENCZZDPP","A19H0LVGWNI0CZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19H0LVGWNI0CZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh my! My husband is a 4 am coffee drinker. I am an 8 am coffee drinker (I get the cold reheated coffee pot leftovers)! He is a bean grinding, percolating grounds, dark roast, splash of cream, hard working, coffee drinking man. He is very particular about his coffee as well. If it doesn't taste like it will put hair on his chest then it won't work. So when this showed up he was a little leery at first. He does have his regular brand and to try something different caused a little anxiety mixed with a little excitement.So fast forward and it is time to open the bag. A Saturday morning so I could also enjoy the fresh brewed coffee, rather than the leftovers. Nice smell, definitely the small of dark roast beans. He grabs a handful, a little oily but no worries, puts it in the grinder. He admires the nice dark color of the grounds. I can see the excitement rise in him. He grinds them a little finer this time. I think at this point the words ""Espresso Blend"" is sticking with him. I remind him though that these will be percolated not pressed. I don't think he cared. Then it was time to put the grounds in the filter and turn on the coffee pot. I could have cut the anticipation with a knife it was so thick and heavy. The time came and he poured his cup but this time without cream. He says he has to fully experience the 100% Guatemalan Coffee Flavor. He licks his lips and closes his eyes. He loves it.. Hey Mikey He likes it!! Anyhow. He said it had a slight hint of bitterness but a nice robust full bodied flavor he would want from a dark roast. He said it was hair on the chest flavor and a winner. I had a nice taste and I agree. Though I can do without the hair on my chest.Now the only reason I would dare attempt to have my husband try another brand of coffee is because I received a generous discount in exchange for an honest review. With my husband I knew it would be an honest review, cause he can be very critical about his coffee. I am thoroughly glad he enjoyed it and even said that when I decide to switch the flavor again to get this brand.. YAY!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH47VUAN4DRC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VSQWQUW#wasThisHelpful","RH47VUAN4DRC5","A19H0LVGWNI0CZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19H0LVGWNI0CZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband is a construction worker and there are times he has to run a jack hammer or a concrete vibrator. After doing this kind of work he often comes home with achy hands and wrists. Now when I was offered a coupon for this bracelet in return for an honest review I thought what better person to try it on than my husband. Not to mention both of us are huge fans of Celtic design. I thought if he doesn't wear it, then I will. Well he hasn't taken it off. He has even taken it to work with him so it goes back on his wrist as soon as he is off work. He says that it has been helping relieve the joint pain he has in his wrist after work. He has another plain copper bracelet from Earth Therapy that he wears all the time so when he saw this and the cool Celtic design he was excited. Now if I could get him to let me try it out.. oh my wrist aches.. I think I need to wear the bracelet. Hasn't worked yet but it is so darn cute. Of course it is a little big because it is meant to fit a man, but it is also adjustable.

"So my husband and I both have knee problems. He blew his knee out in High School playing football and has had surgery but it still aches. I put a tear in my ACL in my 20s playing Basketball and then it completely detached about 5 yrs later while I was pretending to be a Ninja Warrior in my back yard. So when there was a discount offer for this Copper Compression Knee Sleeve I was excited to get it. I got a large and though it fits nicely it does cut into my top thigh. I wore it for a couple of my workouts and I feel it really helped with the ache I get during my workouts. Then it was my husbands turn. He likes to ride his Bike in the Mountainous unpredictable single track terrain we have around here. After his rides his knee is quite achy. Well he does not go for a ride without this sleeve on. As a matter of a fact if I want to wear it.. I have to ""buy a new one"". So if that doesn't just give the product A+ status in my book. I had never thought of using a copper compression sleeve for my workouts and now I don't know what else I will do. For the athlete or just a person who loves to be fit. This is a great sleeve to wear. It stays in place and is not bulky, it is very thin and comfortable. All the while delivering some healing benefit and compression.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7QE6D71I5B9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LXRPK5Y#wasThisHelpful","R7QE6D71I5B9X","A19H0LVGWNI0CZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19H0LVGWNI0CZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have used my previous eyelash curler for years until my daughter pulled out the foam and pulled it apart. It was time for a new one. I saw this and was willing to give it a go. First I would like to say I love the grips, or finger placements. They are much more comfortable than the round finger holes like most other curlers. Second I love how the insert isn't foam but more of a rubber material. I heat my curler with the blow dryer, or stick it in my bra while applying my makeup, and this held the heat a lot better than foam. It did curl my lashes wonderfully. The only reason I didn't give it for stars is because my eye sockets are a little shallow, and lashes are short and it was pinching my skin in order for me to get close enough to the root to curl properly. However after a few tries and adjustments I got it. I loved how it curled my lashes. I even applied less mascara than usual. So far it is comfortable to hold and with a little finagling easy to use with great results.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GQKEJU8HEJ9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJQEV6Y#wasThisHelpful","R2GQKEJU8HEJ9R","A19H0LVGWNI0CZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19H0LVGWNI0CZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My 2 girls least favorite time of day is when it is time to brush their hair. I get a million excuses as to why it is not going to happen. I have a million reasons why it DOES need to happen. I resorted to soft bristle brushes, but they don't get all the way through my girls thick hair. Both have different hair. One blonde with stick straight but VERY thick hair.. the other curly/wavy brown VERY thick hair. So I needed to find a brush that works for both. I was told about these and ordered. They look like regular hair brushes so I was a little skeptical. I especially loved that 2 came in the box so they would each have their own. So the time came, showers were over and they dodged me as usual. I got the box and asked them to pick blue or pink. Handed them the brush of the color they chose and told them to try it. I was met with resistance and whines. I just asked them to try it and so they did. Not only were they surprised but so was I.. There wasn't a sound of worry coming from them at all. The brushes glided through their hair with ease. They still give me a little resistance because it looks like a regular brush, but when I remind them of how easy it is they are ready to brush their hair. I think our hair problems are going to come to an end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3574O4PKL2X66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PUP0RJO#wasThisHelpful","R3574O4PKL2X66","A19H0LVGWNI0CZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19H0LVGWNI0CZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start by saying this book was easy to read and the language was very understandable as well. I did find it to be a bit repetitive in parts and could have used a bit more editing. Only a few spelling mistakes. I was expecting more of a guide on how to start or work an online business but found more of a personal journey. Now that being said reading her journey was exciting and she was quite entertaining in her telling of experiences. I was hoping for more of a platform to use, but nonetheless I did learn a thing or two about her journey. The book is entertaining and if you are doing any business through eBay or Amazon I would suggest giving it a read.

"So far, of the three wine bottles we had readily available, this pourer/stand doesn't fit any of them. We didn't think that would be an issue, and we didn't see anything on Amazon's listing otherwise, so I'm a bit confused.It came in a plain black box with no paper. Elegant, but confusing. I realize you really don't need instructions for this, but considering none of our wine bottles (the shortest of which still doesn't fit in this) fit, I'm perplexed.

"We got this to replace our old camera, which had been knocked over. It worked well enough, but the antennae kept falling apart after the incident, and by that time it was well past its warranty.We didn't realize how much more that one had than this model, especially considering they're both around the same price.Right out of the box, though, my wife and I noticed how sturdy this one seemed. It's small, but it has some weight and over the past month we haven't had it budge from its spot at all. We use ours as a kids monitor. As such, we don't mind that this stands out. It's bright white, and has LEDs for night vision. When we need to, we use it as a security camera when we're away for long periods of time. It'll make do.Compared to our previous camera, this one was a LOT easier to set up. Because it has its own app, the camera and our phones synced perfectly and instantly. Before, we had to pick and choose from various apps since the camera didn't have its own. It was cumbersome and confusing, so we welcome this change. As far as IP cameras go, this one was easier to set up. I would still like to use this camera on a browser, but I haven't ventured into that, if at all possible.It doesn't do as much as my old camera at the same price (namely, rotate), and the cloud feature makes me wary to the point that I turn it off when I don't need it, but it's a good, sturdy little replacement for our previous model.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21BS4PE1RNODR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3BPWLC#wasThisHelpful","R21BS4PE1RNODR","A3R33KMESG0XGQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R33KMESG0XGQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The watch is a beautiful gold-colored stainless-steel timepiece, but the face is a LOT bigger than I was expecting. While I was expecting a large face, and I had gotten a pretty big watch recently, I was still surprised by how big this watch is. I'm a pretty small guy at 5'9"" with slender wrists, so this watch is a bit big for me. I'm planning on wearing it at the occasional formal business event, ones where only executives are attending, but for now it'll stay snug in its box.It doesn't have that many features compared to others in the pricepoint, but it's a fine piece that screams attention. The numerals don't seem as elegant as the rest of the watch, and, to be truthful, kind of give it a cheap look, but the gold and black design is pretty enough.Would be better if you have beefier hands than me.

"I've owned a memory foam pillow and have slept on memory foam mattresses, but this is the first time I've owned one. It came in a rather large box (expectedly), and was wrapped tightly like a carpet.Once we had the bed platform set up, getting this on the bed was pretty easy. All you have to do is cut the outer plastic and it unrolls. There's another plastic cover underneath and over the mattress; we cut it open to get to the instructions, which were on display in Spanish only, only to turn it over and find the English version, which indicated that you have to let it set for 24-72 hours before cutting the other plastic. Whoops.Thankfully, we didn't remove that second plastic cover all the way.The mattress inflated to the full 10 inches within 24 hours. We slept on it the first night, but the plastic was a nuisance. The second night was great, and is very comfortable. There's some give and the mattress isn't too firm. It's a bit soft to lie down and read comfortably, but it's great for sleeping.

"Being of Mexican heritage *and* from Chicago, I have a special place for Rick in my heart. My whole family does.We make our own guacamole, and different variants of the ingredients, too. Mashing avocados is one of the important parts, and this masher is not joking around.Right out of the box, this thing is sturdy. It means business. The steel masher is thicker than any steel kitchen utensil we own, and sturdy enough to bludgeon someone with. The wood handle is great, though I can't tell how thick it is inside. The red handle is nice and gives it a better grip when you're mashing stuff.So far we've used it only to mash what we call ""the mix,"" and that was inside an aluminium bowl. The masher worked quite well, though we're not going to use it to mash anything inside steel again; this steel is far stronger than our bowls that it actually left scratches inside.

"I was a bit hesitant to order this watch because of its big, bold face, but I ordered it anyway. I have fairly slender wrists, so I wasn't sure how it'd look, whether it would be too large. That, and the color. IT's called Rose Gold, so I was afraid it would look too pink.But when it arrived I could not have been any happier. The color of the band is more of a light bronze, which--come on. What man wouldn't want a watch of bronze?! The face is big, true, but it's not so big as to be gaudy. For reference, I'm 5'8"", 160lbs. I have fairly slender joints, and am able to grip entirely around my wrists. I had to remove four links from this watch to make it fit properly.The time so far has kept its accuracy for the time I've had it. The only other watch over $100 I own is a basic Movado, and all that does it tell the time and date. This is the first time I've had a watch that had twisted knobs to change the settings, and well as the band that had push levers to loosen. I'm actually pretty excited about trying these features that I'm sure are standard in many watches today.The only part of the watch I haven't set yet is the world time. I haven't figured out yet, even though the instructions are clear, but I plan on doing that shortly. I just haven't traveled yet so I've no emergent need of this feature.The only gripe I have about it is that the day of the week is sometimes hard to read. Because the hands are so big and the day of the week is in written circular, with a hand of their own, I have to stare at the watch for a second more to remind myself of the day of week. Not a big deal, but still something I should point out.The weight isn't too heavy. The only time I remember I have it on is when I've been speed-walking for a long time and I have to wave my arms out wide. Otherwise, it's not as heavy on the wrist, though it definitely has gravity when you set it down on a table or something.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34Z4DIW2L04AD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XOQFHM#wasThisHelpful","R34Z4DIW2L04AD","A3R33KMESG0XGQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R33KMESG0XGQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had gotten into Gundam kits only within the last decade and worked my way up through HG kits. This was the first non-humanoid I had worked on; I was both nervous and excited to see how it'll turn out.It took me as long as any more recent HG kit, though there was a lot of repetition as the legs were mostly the same. The hind and fore legs were slightly different, but only toward the joints where they connected to the torso.The three heads were also similar initially, though the main head has some slight variation. The wings are fun to use, and overall I love how the joints work on this kit.

"When I was a kid I really, really wanted the Dragonzord. Who didn't? I envied my friends who had one, and, while I did get some sweet Zords later on, the Green Ranger's robot was never mine.Many years later, after I graduate college and landed my first job, I used some of my spare change to acquire stuff I've always wanted but never had. The Dragonzord was one of them. It was a prized possession for many years; even when the Legacy Dragonzord was announced I scoffed at it and never desired to own one sine the original '90s version was all I needed.Yet, somehow, the Legacy version grew on me over the months and when I had the chance to get a slightly used one at a handsome discount I jumped on the offer.When I got him I was not disappointed. The condition was fantastic--almost new, even. Anyway, not going to banter about my transaction.What I love most about this version is that there are no stickers and everything is sculpted and painted. The Dragonzord now looks the proper Dragon Caesar rather than the MMPR thunderbolt-stickered toy, even though this was made by Bandai of America and not by Bandai [of Japan]. It comes with the regular rocket hands that the old '90s version came with, but now it also comes with a second set of interchangeable hands. This second set replicates how the Dragonzord's hands looked normally; that is, the regular humanoid curled hands. This is what I use all the time when my Dragonzord is on display.The overall figure is now more svelte and looks like it jumped right out of the show. It's about 90% perfect in my eyes.Now on to the 10% that's not so perfect.The original Dragonzord leaned forward a bit, but not by much. This Dragonzord leans forward even more, so when you have him standing regularly it seems like he's looking down. You can correct this by bending the knees and then he's standing all the way straight, but then the knees look very awkward compared to the original toy and how the Dragonzord/Caesar looked in the show. Many complained about how long the tail is, and it is very long, but it was also long in the show. What Bandai could've done, however, is allow half of it to detach so that when you transform the tail into the drill it's not that long. I guess Bandai was trying to prioritize the segmented joints--which work wonderfully--and didn't have the engineering to allow that and complete detachment.Because this is a more modernization of the original '90s toy, there's not much more articulation. There is die-cast, but I feel he could've used less on the feet as they weigh him down in certain transformations. The jaw also reveals the face inside more than the original, which is a bit weird, but I pose him with his mouth closed anyway.The joints feel a bit looser than I'd like. I presume this is to allow the Zord Builder functionality, though my opinion is that that feature should've been left out. But that's me.Otherwise, this is about as perfect as he can get right now. The only way I can see more improvement is if Bandai in Japan decided to create him with modern articulation and transformation. I know they can do it; I've seen it with other robots. But, considering how much more popular MMPR is here over the popularity of Zyuranger in Japan, I don't see it happening any time soon.But for collectors who grew up loving Tommy, this can't be beat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I1WNENNWR8P3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8OSDUE#wasThisHelpful","R1I1WNENNWR8P3","A3R33KMESG0XGQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R33KMESG0XGQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We actually have a surplus of these from a previous purchase when they were on sale at a local store, and we also had a coupon. I didn't realize I was ordering the same ones from Amazon, but at least I didn't order too many more.We've got a tiny garbage can in the kitchen and a larger one right outside to hold the smaller garbage bags when they're full. We haven't found perfect ones for our can. Either the bag is tough but has a lousy drawstring, or the bag is weak and has a fantastic drawstring. This Hefty Extra Strong bag is of the former class.I am never worried that the bag will rip when I carry the bag out to the trash, but the drawstrings themselves sometimes rip or, when I put a new bag in the can, they never grip the lip of the can and the first trash put it in it always cause the bag to slip in a bit.Most of the time I end up closing the bag without the drawstring and carry the bag by the top itself without the strings.

"I'm awful at math. The last math course I took was Trig in college, and that was over a decade ago. My math has gotten rusty since, though there was a summer where I brushed up a bit due to the GRE. But that, too, was a while ago, so I decided recently I really ought to put more attention in this area.Once I was able to search for some workbooks, I found this one through Vine and decided to order it. I figured 6th and 8th grade math can't be too hard--right?It starts off right in the middle of some algebra, with a quick lesson to get you up and running and gauge your abilities at the moment. I admit it was tougher than I thought but only because I had forgotten a lot of the terminology. Once I was able to memorize them, however, the algebra came back to me and I solved most the problems correctly at first try.The book is divided into chapters, though sometimes it's hard to tell which chapter/section you're in. I do one a night and I feel it's a good pace for me, but some sections last one page or two, and often I found myself skipping into the next night's assignment simply because I didn't realize I was doing another set.There is an answer key in the back to grade yourself. I think it's a great book for people like me to refresh their algebra skills, and I most certainly am going to order another once I'm finished with this book (about a little over halfway with this one).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDOLLYHM3BZTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1483816648#wasThisHelpful","RDOLLYHM3BZTL","A3R33KMESG0XGQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R33KMESG0XGQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big fan of the Nick Turtles. I grew up with the '80s Turtles show and the subsequent trilogy, and later on I read the Mirage comics. I also played Turtles in Time feverishly on the SNES.When Nickelodeon bought the rights to the Turtles I was a bit hesitant. I wasn't sure what they'd do with the property, and so when they announced that they were going to do a new show I was cautiously optimistic, to use the term.By the end of the first season I knew it was the best incarnation of the Turtles in film form. It's a bit cheating, however, as they take elements from previous Turtles runs, but they don't run on pure nostalgia. They meld the best of the best all the while refining them and creating their own mark in the Turtle timeline.As a figure collector I knew I had to have these Turtles, and I sometimes dreamt that a Japanese manufacturer would someday obtain the rights to create them. Playmates did an adequate job in making inexpensive figures before the show began and they were suitable. But when Kaiyodo announced the Turtles for their Revoltech line I knew I had to snatch them up. While I prefer Max Factory and Bandai to Kaiyodo, I pre-ordered them anyway as I'm not sure the other two will create them.Anyway, on to the figure.These are far superior to any of the Nick Turtles we've got, and for those complaining about fragility please be aware that these are meant for adult collectors. Model kits are very fragile, yet they are catered to both adults and children, with the simpler kits often meant for the latter. Consider these Japanese figures in such a way, except that these are kits that are pre-built, professionally painted, and finely packaged.All the joints are Revolver joints, as expected, with the smaller joints having less resistance to provide for easier movement and less stress against the plastic. There's even a joint in the bandana to allow the eyes to move. These are my first Revoltech figures with movable eyes since Woody, so I'm not sure if this is the direction Kaiyodo is taking with moving eyes from here on out.That said, what I love about the movable eyes is that if you move the bandana far enough to one side the eyes will become completely white, allowing for that ""fight mode"" viewers have come to love from the Nick show.The primary limb joints are the standard Revolver joints common in most figures, so don't expect these Turtles to seem accurate when in relaxed poses. People often complain about Revoltech's joints, arguing that they're frustrating to manipulate and they hinder the figure from posing in more natural humanoid stances. That's not the purpose of these joints. Rather, their positioning and sculpting is meant to give them more dynamic, even less-natural, poses than are usually allowed. So while the Turtles can't pose worth a boot when standing normally, expect to give them excellent articulation into flying, jumping, and kicking moves.The accessories are excellent, and I love the included heads with each Turtle. Leo has his shocked face, but be aware that you'll have to remove the bandana for each head as there's only one included.The pizza accessory can break apart into separate pieces, and each piece has specific indents into the platter so there's no confusion as to which piece goes where. I didn't think it was necessary to have the individual slices come with singular indents, but whatever.The only thing that I found didn't work well, and why I gave this figure one less star, is that the katana sheaths don't stay on Leo's back. No matter how many different times and ways I've tried putting them on his back, they don't stay on, or at least they do when only one is placed (they come as separate sheaths rather than both combined into one). It kind of ruins the look as Leo is seen almost always with them on his back, with swords or no, but I'm not sure if that's just my specific figure.The box designs are nice and they line up nicely against each other on a bookshelf, with a bust of each Turtle taken straight out of the show on all left sides. I'm not a fan of the simple window design, as the older Revoltech figures came with a book-style cover that opened to reveal the window underneath.Anyway, that's my review. I love these Turtles, and they're my second-favorite TMNT figures after the NECA versions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB1VN26X7P050/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LJDFQNS#wasThisHelpful","RB1VN26X7P050","A3R33KMESG0XGQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R33KMESG0XGQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend of ours introduced us to Anberlin about a decade ago. ""They kind of sound like Linkin Park,"" she told me. I gave it a go, but quickly deduced they sounded nothing like Linkin Park. Still, I loved their music right away. Never Take Friendship Personal was the first album I listened to, though not the first song. It wasn't until later I realized one of their songs from their first album was in a sampler I owned, and I recall liking that song a lot.But I digress.This was the go-to album for me when recommending music for a long time, at least until Cities released. There wasn't a song on here I didn't like, and the album grew on me more and more over time. To this day it's one of my favorite albums, and I would say it would be Anberlin's best if Cities didn't exist.Even for the people to whom I recommended this album they'd recommend to others this as well.Once, when my friends and I were in car ride traveling from state to state, I decided to put this album on when it was my turn for music selection.

"I had never heard of the Eagle Creek brand before this product.  I was excited to try this bag as I usually wear comfortable to shoes to work and change into my work shoes when I get to work.  This bag was great for transporting my work shoes to and from work.  I am a size 8.5 women's shoe and both flats and high heels fit perfectly into the bag.  I wouldn't be able to fit two pairs of shoes though.  I could see possibly fitting two pairs of flips flops in this bag, but definitely not two pairs of regular shoes.  They'd be too squished and I'd be afraid I'd damage my shoes. It's nice and lightweight which is convenient considering I have several other bags to carry with me to work.  I love this bag and will continue to carry my work shoes in it.  I'm sure it could be used for other purposes as well (e.g. carrying socks, small amounts of clothes, other shoes, etc.).

I love the anatomy and life of the building, but man is it a killer for electronics. They weren't meant to be in a building like this, but I refuse to let them go and need to boost most of them with Internet.My wife does work and takes classes at home, and I take home the occasional odd job, so the Internet is a necessity. And when we like to have down time we stream videos in different rooms; we have the modem and main router set up in the living room, which is at one end of the apartment, and we have a smaller range extender set up half of the way. The Internet certainly was boosted, and I never got any more dropped signals from my office (which is at the other end of the apartment).Still, the signal wasn't the strongest, and occasionally I'd get weak Internet from my already-premium subscription.So then this extender arrived.The previous extender was set in our bedroom, which is exactly half of the distance between the apartment, and that's where this Linksys extender came in. I was surprised at how easy it was to set up, though it did take a few tries before it was set properly. At first I didn't notice that stark a difference, but a few days later I realized my pages loaded faster and I was able to download more files for work at a quicker pace (not sure if doing more work faster is a good thing, but you get my point).Before getting this my laptop would get three bars max in my office; I now have a full five and haven't seen a drop since.The outlet I have this plugged into was placed incorrectly and is upside down. I know how to turn it around but I'm too lazy, but thankfully the antennae can rotate all the way around, so I have the extender upside-down and the arms facing upward.The colors change throughout the day but they stay mostly a lime-green. I haven't tried the outlet pass-through yet; however, I don't think I ever will. I trust the Wi-Fi extending powers, but I'm not certain about the electricity power as I don't want the old wiring to cause a short or anything.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MT8EQKCENNZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN20YA#wasThisHelpful","R1MT8EQKCENNZU","A3R33KMESG0XGQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R33KMESG0XGQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't acquired a kids' board game in some years, but when I saw this edition I couldn't pass it up.At the time, I was living with my parents, having just graduated college, and the only other person to enjoy this game with me was my 7-year-old kid sister. I hadn't played Trouble in a while, but it's a very familiar game with very basic instructions. My sister got the hang of it right away.I'm not the biggest fan of the CGI-version Clone Wars (I prefer the Tartakovsky version), but since it's pretty much the only Star Wars-themed Trouble I got it, though mostly for R2-D2.R2-D2 has an on/off switch if you get annoyed by him. There's still the regular dice in there, and I never got tired of hearing little R2 chirp.What bothered me the most was the quality. For $10 at my local Wally's World I wasn't expecting much, but it was worse than the regular editions of Trouble I had seen. There's no plastic over the cardboard layout, and you have to apply stickers to the pawns which is a bummer; I'd rather have etched pawns.For $10-$15 it's not bad if you're a Star Wars geek and have kids. Since playing this when I initially bought it many years ago, I've gotten married and had a daughter, who this years is turning 3. I think it's safe to bring this game out of the basement to give it a whirl again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W6SQZ0I24GAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002QFN6T4#wasThisHelpful","R1W6SQZ0I24GAX","A3R33KMESG0XGQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R33KMESG0XGQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Back when HeartGold and SoulSilver were announced I was super excited. Pok√©mon Gold is my favorite in the series and I had been hoping for years for a remake, at least ever since the Red and Green remakes were released.So the games were announced but after that Nintendo announced these neat little gadgets that would pair with the games and the DS. I thought it was neat that they were shaped like Poke Balls and would go around with you as a pedometer.Back when it released I used it extensively for the first few months. It was extremely easy to use for its time, and the battery lasted for years.The games were terse and sweet, and effective for catching select Pok√©mon.Over time its usefulness and novelty grew stale, but it still acted as an excellent pedometer. The screen is extremely crisp and the game works flawlessly with the accessory.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DCDCWSWWAXO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EMT4LM#wasThisHelpful","R1DCDCWSWWAXO7","A3R33KMESG0XGQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R33KMESG0XGQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter is two years old and has been using regular cups for a few months now. We keep an eye on her when she does, but when she drinks on her own and likes to wander around we let her take cups with lids. They're especially useful when carrying out and in the car.We have quite a few but ordered these as well when we had the chance. Build quality they are very good. We have other Munchkin products and they're all very good quality.Functionality is a different story, but these aren't too bad.What makes these cups stand out is the lid. I've never seen a lid like this, but it doesn't mean it isn't common. We just don't own too many variations of Sippy cups.The plastic piece screws on like any other lid, but there's a softer part on top that keeps the liquid from spilling out. When first I washed these I couldn't tell how they worked. They came in just a bag in the Amazon box so I had no clue how they worked. It's simple, however, once I got the hang of it: just drink as you normally would a cup, except you have to suck on it as well.The ones we had worked only on certain angles, but it worked in the end. My daughter got the hang of it almost immediately, although she was confused only because of the way it looked as she never had seen cups as such.Because it didn't come with any instructions or anything I can't--or rather haven't--removed the softer part from the plastic lid when I wash them. I don't know whether they're supposed to, but I didn't try placing too much force when pulling for fear of ripping them.Thus, they may mold over time, but by then we'll probably have moved on from Sippy cups.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EEECRIKLMIXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRZIGXY#wasThisHelpful","R1EEECRIKLMIXZ","A3R33KMESG0XGQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R33KMESG0XGQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Why they didn't include a headphone jack in the SP is beyond me. Considering it's now an older device, I can't ask. If you do want to use headphones, however, you are going to need either Nintendo's headphones (or any third-party SP headphones) or this little adapter to use any headphones you want.The quality is fine, but it can range as there are a lot of knock-offs and third-party versions. The official Nintendo one looks like the one in this listing, and also has the ""Nintendo"" stamp on the part that plugs into the SP. The female jack is also gold-colored and doesn't protrude from the adapter at all.The quality of the adapter can make all the difference, even if the SP isn't exactly stereo quality.The first one I bought was a knock-off; I knew it was because it didn't have the ""Nintendo"" stamp, but it was close enough. The official ones are a little hard to come by nowadays, but they're not expensive once they do pop up.The old one I had sometimes didn't align properly in the SP slot.

"I had a case for my DS Lite from Kmart which I had purchased when I first got my handheld. That was back in 2007. It was perfect for me. It was a strongly tinted clear blue hard case that had two sections and a single tab in the front which released those flaps. The top portion held a few DS cartridges and an extra stylus, while the bottom held the handheld itself. The entire interior was insulated with a soft rubber-like material. It was perfect, except for one flaw.That mentioned tab in the middle was pretty thin so after a couple of years it would break right down the middle, preventing the case from remaining shut, thus rendering the case's primary function (to keep the handheld safe inside) relatively dysfunctional.I bought another of the same case right away, fearing they wouldn't make it anymore and convincing myself it was a fluke. Thankfully I found one of the last ones at my local Kmart but, again, a couple of years later the same issue happened.So I finally caved in and looked on Amazon. The top-rated DS Lite case was the same one I found when I initially looked for cases. The main reason it didn't attract me was the big brand name on top and no middle flap to separate the top from the bottom. But I caved and ordered one, hoping this would be the last DS Lite case I ever order.It's mostly the same as the previous cases I had. The outer shell seems to be made of the same material, as well as the interior insulation. I did notice that the inside produced a distinct smell when first I opened it, and the smell still lingers even after a few years.The top holds DS cartridges, though I don't really carry around my games anymore since I restrict myself to one game when I'm on the go. Still, for those that carry games please note that only four of the six slots are used for DS cartridges. The other two, the ones in the middle, are used for SD cards. Why they did that is beyond me. Does the DSi carry SD cards? If so, I can't imagine people will be carrying more than one with them.The bottom of the top holds a spare stylus in case you need it, which is where I put one of the two styli my DS came with.The closing and opening button is a lot better than the previous cases', and I can tell I probably won't have to fear with it breaking. The ""Intec"" name on top is a real bummer, as I hate big brand names on my merchandise. I get it's their product and they made it, but something more subtle would've been nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DMTQ5N9RWHNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000V8TZ16#wasThisHelpful","R1DMTQ5N9RWHNS","A3R33KMESG0XGQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R33KMESG0XGQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't have the exact version in this listing. Rather, I found one at Target and it's made by Power A and is even titles Mini Transporter Case. But to be exact the one I found at Target was $9.99, blue (came in black and pink as well), and didn't have the full front and back compartments like this listing shows.Rather, mine came with a simple flap to hold the 3DS XL as well as a thin zippered back compartment which unzips all the way (except for the bottom) to reveal slots for extra 3/DS games.But that's not why I bought this case.I needed a case for my Game Boy Color clone. Regular GBC cases didn't fit as the clone has slightly different dimensions. I prefer my clone over the standard GBC because of its excellent backlit screen (despite the aspect ration being *slightly* stretched).I realized cases for the DS XL and 3DS XL are the perfect size so I walked out the closest store that had such cases: Target.The case fits the clone (Kong Feng GB Boy Colour, if anyone was curious) perfectly, and, while I don't house cartridges in the back compartment, it can fit one or two snugly.The loop on top is very sturdy, and the color is a beautiful brilliant blue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A9EXFIYXXLY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J15I8K#wasThisHelpful","R1A9EXFIYXXLY3","A3R33KMESG0XGQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R33KMESG0XGQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't own a DSi so I was hesitant about getting this, but the box indeed does stated that it works with the Lite. In fact, there are clips that adjust to accommodate either model.Out of the box it came adjusted to fit the DS Lite so I didn't have to mess with anything. There are instructions on how to adjust it, however, in case you need to.The stand is a durable plastic, but I was surprised to find how light it was. Before it arrived I had no idea how it stayed in place, considering it's a stand. I found that it accomplishes this by having EXTREMELY durable rubber feet, which do not slide at all once they're placed on a flat surface.The stand rotates by clicking in a swivel manner, as well as the stand itself rotating in degrees. There should be a comfortable angle for about anyone.It comes with a larger stylus as well for a more comfortable experience since your hand will be slightly elevated to accommodate the stand.Another excellent peripheral by Hori.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TPYWA31BEYLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002G5U1CE#wasThisHelpful","R2TPYWA31BEYLN","A3R33KMESG0XGQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R33KMESG0XGQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review contains spoilers, but I'll preface such spoilers with an alert.The last trade paperback left much to be desired. The Walking Dead has been going on many years now, and it was inevitable that at some point it would start to go stale, at least in some point in the narrative. This last story arc was its low point. I even told someone after I read the paperback that it would be a good idea to end the series soon.But with this paperback I was wrong.***SPOILERS ABOUND!***This collection begins about two years after the events of the last trade. The colonies are now at peace--at least, until Kirkman allows them.But for once we get to see humanity slightly thriving once again. Of course, there's always the lurking enemy in the background, but they don't pose a threat. At least not until you realize the zombies can learn. Or at least that's what I thought.By the time we get a taste of what's really going on, I was disappointed slightly that it wasn't what I thought. It was thrilling enough, however, and I haven't felt that intense about a Walking Dead trade in a while.***END SPOILERS***I'm excited once again for this series.

I've never read any of them, though I did read this book a bit before giving it to him!It's a great set of the novels in a set of three, but I have to caution those against the Annotated version by Klinger.I love annotations--when they are done well. These editions are for those who know everything about everything the Sherlock realm. I've read Klinger's Dracula annotations and a bit here, and I was put off by his style of annotating. His references and notes are exhaustive to the point that they consume the fiction itself, taking up more room than the meat of the prose.If you really, really like Sherlock and know a great detail of the world, then I'm sure this is a good read.

"The Wii is one of the most versatile machines in the past decade; if you have a Wii and a PS3, you're pretty much set until the current generation catches up to the former's beefy library.The white Wii especially is greater than its descendants. The initial Wiis can play GameCube games, they come with component video signal, and, depending on your production run and ability to soft mod, come with DVD-playback capabilities. Take that and the ability to download WiiWare and Virtual Console titles, as well as most people installing The Homebrew Channel, and you've got yourself a powerful gaming machine for excellent classic titles.So, of course, you're going to want to share the wealth.I've taken my Wii to many homes and events. Friends and family loved it when it first came out, and, while its spark has certainly died down some, it's still a hit whenever I bring it around, especially since I'm able to run older games on it.Before, I used to use a messenger bag and hope nothing happened around inside. But after a few trips I decided to browse for a dedicated carrying case. This specific case turned up many positive reviews, so I decided to keep an eye out for it.But, by the time I found out about it, it had been out of production and the prices seem to incline. I was patient and managed to score one brand new at a fair price.After a couple of uses with this bag, I now look for ways to bring the Wii anywhere!Everything has a designated compartment, and even if you happen to forget what goes where there are labels above each compartment with a picture of what's supposed to go in. Everything fits wonderfully, but I will admit that the spaces for the console and receiver are a bit too snug than I'd like. Not sure if it's a good thing that it's so snug, but I haven't had any issues other than taking them in and out.The slot for games that hold a few discs with their cases packed tight, but I don't bring the cases anyway, so I can fit more games if I needed to by using temporary slim DVD cases or a CD wallet.The strap isn't removable, but that doesn't bother. Still, thought I should mention that.It's a great way to transport the Wii, but be careful if you're carrying this in public for long periods of time. As it screams ""Wii"" right on the bag, it may be a target for potential theft.My sister was visiting the other day and wanted to borrow the Wii, so after I got it all set in the bag I decided to move everything into a different, non-labeled bag since the word ""Wii"" is stitched on.Still, it's the best bag dedicated solely for Nintendo's Revolution, even though it's the only dedicated bag I've used!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4JCXKJ67YNEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RD0XL4#wasThisHelpful","R4JCXKJ67YNEW","A3R33KMESG0XGQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R33KMESG0XGQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The reason I ended up getting one is that it came bundled with Mario Kart Wii. For a while that was the only way to obtain the game new, anyway, so why not get an additional wheel?What I've found is that the wheel is great for those interested in the motion gimmicks and having a more casual experience. I use the term ""casual"" gently as I know how much of a dichotomy that word can create. Still, it's important to point out that a majority of competitive players will prefer using other controls, especially the GameCube or Classic Controller (and Pro).I'm not saying that the Wii Remote by itself (or with the Wheel) doesn't have pretty accurate controls; on the contrary, it has very good controls for being fully motion-driven. But extending your hands out can wear the muscles quickly. And controllers just have far more precise controls.It's fun, and it came with Mario Kart Wii, so I'm not complaining.

The lights on the vacuum are especially helpful when vacuuming my poorly lit hallway. It's great on hardwood floors, rugs, and carpet. It comes with a hook to put on the wall for easy storage. This is also because the vacuum is top heavy due to the handheld being at the top. When moving furniture while vacuuming, I needed to place it on the floor as it couldn't stand on it's own and just fell over. This is inconvenient for me as I'm constantly moving furniture. This is, however, the only negative I found with this vacuum. Overall, great vacuum. I would say it's comparable to my Dyson.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MKY69IZXWC4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGVF0TQ#wasThisHelpful","R3MKY69IZXWC4F","A3R33KMESG0XGQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R33KMESG0XGQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I LOVE these pans!! I use them for just about anything and they are so easy to clean. These pans are $99 which may seem expensive, but they are well worth it. These have surpassed my expectations. The heat goes evenly through the entire pan. I have a feeling that I'll have these for a very long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RULCF161AMBZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GGE6V98#wasThisHelpful","RULCF161AMBZS","A3R33KMESG0XGQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R33KMESG0XGQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I feel like I could just cut and past the review for Black Ice Heart here.  Both had an element that was a big turn off for me.  In Frost Station Alpha a group of genetically engineered super humans kill almost everyone on the space station and then demand help making their planet livable.  Really!!  Who would think killing everyone would bring the help you need to survive?  Not me.Then one of the men doing the killing becomes the alpha hero.  This is not my choice for a hero.  He did change as the story progressed and it did not seem to bother others who reviewed the book.  I guess we all react to characters in our own way.Ruby Lionsdrake writes a very well plotted story and Frost Station Alpha is no exception.  The world building is very well done.  The characters are developed.  The story moves at a nice pace.  It was a story I expected to really like but I just could not get past the first action of the main male character.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XPOWL1CZQSGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LRV75O#wasThisHelpful","R2XPOWL1CZQSGK","AX0ZTNX6KVJ40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX0ZTNX6KVJ40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many things to like about Black Ice Heart.  The world building is very well done.  The back story is told when and where needed.  The plot is interesting and moves at a nice pace.  The characters are well developed and interesting.  Everything is in place for a very good Science Fiction Romance story.  I should have loved it.  Instead there was an element that I did not like and as a result I could not enjoy it as much as I should have.That element was how the story started.  It started with the deaths of many of the occupants of the space station that serves as a prison.  It was not the deaths but who did the killing that bothered me.  I want consequences for actions and instead the killers ended up being portrayed as the good guys who were not responsible for their actions..The Scoriah start as killers and end up looking like long lost puppies.  It just did not work for me.  Joan Holly should have been running away from them screaming.  Instead she was cuddling with them.  While the Scoriah got away with murder their creator get the punishment she deserved.Something similar turned me off of Frost Station Alpha and my review is very similar.I like danger and tension.  I also like the bad guys who run around killing people to stay the bad guys.  When that does not happen it is a complete turn off for me.  I would like to see what others say about the story and if any had the same reaction as I did.I have enjoyed other stories written by Ella Drake so it was surprise when I reacted to this on as I did.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1456JBVDZYMG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LEWCTW#wasThisHelpful","R1456JBVDZYMG2","AX0ZTNX6KVJ40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX0ZTNX6KVJ40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It has been almost six years since the last Travis Family book so I had forgotten a lot about the previous books. That did not matter as this on worked well as a stand-alone. The story follows a familiar pattern. A successful woman who has locked up her heart and a man who is determined to unlock it.

"The Coltons are an interesting family. This time we meeet Dr. Eric Colton and MW (Mystery Woman). There is the usual romance and like previous books the mystery woman has someone trying to kill her. It is a fun read with a good plot. The solution is pretty tame but it did fit the series. This is a series written by different authors. Each book can stand alone but there are elements that are present in every book.

Now they have a limited time to overcome the damage done by their Father and have the money for an balloon payment fro the loan he took out that is due in just a year.  The Kincaid‚Äôs are a very interesting blended family.  It seems that Dad was not only a bad business man but also had three families.

"Gin has a new job and it is one she does not really want.  That is what she gets for taking down the leaders of the underworld.  Now she is the head.  When some one tries to blow up Philip‚Äôs boat with Gin on it she thinks they are after her.  Turns out she is wrong.Once again the past comes into the present.  This time it is an event from her very early days ‚Äì one that she has forgotten.  It is not Gin they want but someone else who was there that day.You can expect a lot of violence in the Elemental Assassin books and Spider‚Äôs Trap is no exception.  Once again it looks like Gin will lose but at the last minute she prevails.  Before that happens she almost loses someone that is very important to her.All of the events in Spider‚Äôs Trap work toward Gin accepting that she is the underworld boss.  It also adds a new characters to the series.There is a big bomb shell at the end.  It seems there are still more secrets that are going to come out.  Danger to Gin and friends is not over by a long shot.

"With Tom and Nell‚Äôs story Ether & Elephants puts the Gaslight Chronicles to bed.  While this is primarily Tom and Nell‚Äôs story there is a gathering where we get to see most of the previous characters and find out how they are getting along.Tom and Nell‚Äôs have a back story and it comes out as the book begins.  It plays a big role in how the plot progresses.  There is danger and tension as they have to work together to solve a mystery and get rid of a villain once and for all.Both have always been interesting characters and as the story progresses we see how much they both have grown and changed.  Tom because of a rash action that broke Nell‚Äôs heart and Nell as she left family and friends behind to live on her own.  Tom becomes much more focused and Nell much stronger.Ether & Elephants wraps up a mystery that started in previous books while allowing us to see the characters one last time.

"Did her sister exist?  Was she pushed?  Did Keith push her?  Why has she never been mentioned?All of that is part of the mystery of The Secret Sister.  Maisy Lazarow get much more than she expected when she returns home to Fairham Island.  Instead of helping her brother and mending fences with her Mother she bring an age old mystery out in the open.She also reconnects with Rafe Romero and finds that romance has not disappeared from her life.  The Secret Sister has a great setting, interesting characters and a mystery with more than one twist and turn.  I was very surprised by the answer to the four questions I started the review with.This is the start of a new series by Novak.  I did see a nice collection of secondary characters but really did not see the hook for future stores that sometimes appear in a new series.  It looks like whoever will be featured next will be a surprise.  It does leave me with another question.

"Once again Simon Archer and friends must protect Britain from destruction.  Gaios has been at the heart of the danger in the previous books but in The Conquering Dark he takes center stage.  He needs the Stone of Scone and will do anything to get it.  Simon, Kate, Malcolm, Penny, Charlotte and Imogene all must work together to save Britain from the destruction Gaios wants to reign on the land.As usual this is non-stop action and danger.  Simon needs his magic restored, the Stone must be found and protected and Gaios defeated.  Nothing is easy.  Many are killed.  Much is destroyed but in the end our hero‚Äôs prevail.  This time one of their own does not survive and another is not what he has always seemed. For awhile it looks like death and betrayal will end the team?Like the two previous books The Conquering Dark is action driven.  Take a deep breath before you start.  You will need it as you read.  We do get to know more about each character.  Some of the side characters become more important.  The world building and back story continue.

"I have been a fan of Alyssa Everett since her first book.  I like the fact that she writes books that have an unusual twist.  The Marriage Act has that and more.There is a marriage that ended almost before it began.  Caroline Fleetwood and John, Viscount Welford, have been apart for 5 years.  Now they have to pretend to be happy.  Both Caroline and John are very well developed characters.  As the story progresses we see why each reacted as they have and how those reactions have shaped  how they have arrived at the 5 year separation.  Thinks have to change and there are some very good secondary characters that play a part in that change.The story line does follow a familiar pattern for a romance but the small twists and turns kept my attention and added to my enjoyment of the story.  I had to keep reading to see what was going to happen next.  Pick this one up for a enjoyable read during this very hot summer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O89F7KFAOGV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XCZFU6Y#wasThisHelpful","R3O89F7KFAOGV6","AX0ZTNX6KVJ40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX0ZTNX6KVJ40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don‚Äôt let the fact that this is a prequel to another series stop you from reading The Terrans.  I read the first book in Theirs Not to Reason Why series several years ago and still have book two on my TBR pile.  The Terrans has no trouble standing on its own.I loved The Terrans and had a hard time putting it down.  It has all the things that make a great story.The Salik are wonderful villains who like to eat intelligent living beings.  They have no redeeming features.The V‚ÄôDan are humans who were removed from the home world (Earth) 10,000 years ago.  While they are human there is difference in their appearance and that difference shows that prejudice can live for any reason.The character development is influenced by that difference.  While the story focuses on the two main characters there are secondary characters that play a big part in the story line.The book starts with an exciting recue but from there it becomes a story of discovery allowing the reader to see what Earth in the future could look like.  (I think a lot of us would love to have a government that functions like the one in The Terrans.  It would be a great improvement over the politics of today.)The plot is simple.  The V‚ÄôDan are losing the war with the Salik. Now there are new humans who might help turn the tide.  However  just because they are both human does not mean that their differences could not make getting along a big problem.  Both the Terrans and the V‚ÄôDan will have their work cut out for them.This book is set mostly on Earth and ends as they start their journey to the V‚ÄôDan home world.  There is a lot more story to tell and I am looking forward to the next book in the series.  It is due out in January of 2016.ACE published The Terrans by Jean Johnson in 2015.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L5K0C7RHK68A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425276910#wasThisHelpful","R1L5K0C7RHK68A","AX0ZTNX6KVJ40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX0ZTNX6KVJ40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Picks up where the first book left off. I recommend reading The Silver Ships first as it does a lot of the character development, back story and world building. I nice addition to the series.

"Contract of Defiance is good Space Opera.  It features Aly Erikson as the main character.  She has a fascinating past history, a brother she will do anything for and works with an interesting cast of characters, some good, some bad, and some shades of grey.The world building and back-story come together in a way that keeps the plot moving.  This is a first person story so we see everything through Aly‚Äôs eyes.  That does limit the development of other characters and keeps the motivation of  the other characters a mystery.The plot is simple and complex.  Aly just wants to save her brother but while she does that she must also stop a plot to kill millions.  There is a lot of action and the tension ramps up as the story progresses.  While two problems are solved some things are left hanging.  That gives a hint of what will be the focus of the next book.Contract of Defiance tells a good story with all the elements needed in space opera.  It is somewhat one dimensional because of the point of view but that does not take away from tension and action in the story.  If you like space opera give Contract of Defiance a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FYENUIL3HJHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TK6KCG#wasThisHelpful","R3FYENUIL3HJHS","AX0ZTNX6KVJ40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX0ZTNX6KVJ40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is hands down the best new series I have read this year.Both the  worldbuilding and backstory are right on target.  Both unfolded before me as I read.  It was so seamless that instead of interfering with the story it added to it.The characters and their development were the perfect fit for the plot.  We meet Satrine Rainey as the book opens and she had a lie in her pocket.  It takes awhile to see why she needs the lie but that is such an important part of who she is.  Her family is her prime concern and she needs the lie to keep that family together.  Turns out she is very good at the job the lie brings her.Minox Welling cannot keep a partner.  He is brilliant but in a very offbeat way.  He sees the facts in a way other do not.  In addition he has a secret that is not that much of a secret.  Most people cannot follow his logic but Satrine not only follows she can take it one step further.As he and Satrine work together you see why they are such a good fit.  A great cast of secondary characters aids them.Mages are being murdered and it is up to Minox and Satrine to find out why.  There are plenty of twists and turns in the story.  Satrine‚Äôs secret comes out.  Minox learns his secret is interfering with his ability to work the case.  Even as the case is solved Minox sees what others do not.  There is much more to the murders than came out.An important fact for the series is the file of closed cases that Minox has.  While they are closed Minox feels that they were not solved correctly.  I see future books in that group of files.A Murder of Mages is an exciting well-written book.  Satrine and Minox are strong characters with very different personal lives.  I like that fact that they are great partners but work is their only common dominator.  All in all this is a great start to a new series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P8RB00NI78RG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PT4J12K#wasThisHelpful","R3P8RB00NI78RG","AX0ZTNX6KVJ40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX0ZTNX6KVJ40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Someone really messed up and the passengers for the cruise ship Far Horizon were not told that Dantaralor, the planet they are visiting is now in the war zone.  When the ship and the shuttle leave Meg Antille and Red Thomsill marooned on the planet the adventure starts.Meg and Red are both crew on the Far Horizon.  After they are left things go from bad to worse.  The enemy appears and most of the passengers are killed.  Meg, Red and the survivors escape and the danger just keep escalating.  While the action and danger are a big part of the story another big part is the romance that develops between Meg and Red.On the ship Red could never get close to Meg but now they are a team trying survive.  That bring them closer together and gives each the chance to explore the feeling that are developing.Scott has written a very good Science Fiction story about survival under very difficult conditions.  I like it when it is a good story without the romance and becomes a better story with romance added.The two main characters are very well developed and do a good job carrying the story.  The secondary characters are adequate for the part they play.  I would love to see Meg and Red in a future story.  I am sure they are up to another adventure.I did finish this in one setting.  It is novella length.  It is very satisfying read and I found the story line to be very well developed.  The danger and tension stayed at just the right level.  The plot was interesting and believable.  The ending put a nice period to the action.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KTQVGUXBWLNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZZ0OCBS#wasThisHelpful","R2KTQVGUXBWLNZ","AX0ZTNX6KVJ40","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX0ZTNX6KVJ40?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An Alien to Love has five One Night Stand stories.  Each can stand alone but there are cross over characters.  I loved each one.  In all five a one night stand becomes an HEA.  All have really great characters.  Each has a reason they feel there will be no happy ending in their lives.  All of the stories are short easy reads with fully developed plots and story lines.

He realizes that Jess has something in her past that scares her and he is taking it very slow.  This is a very good story about how the past can affect the future.

"My laptop's speakers do not work very well and I usually have to wear earphones when I have a webinar to make sure I hear everything that is said. I finally decided it was time to get a set of external speakers. I did some research and decided the Satechi Dual Sonic Speakers were what I needed. I am so glad I found these speakers because they are amazing and have nice crisp clarity.The speakers are round in the front and are 4 inches wide and 3 inches deep. Each speaker has a metal stand to keep it in position. The speakers are connected to each other with a 34 inch cord. Another cord is connected to one speaker and will need plugged into the headphone jack and into a USB port.The volume is controlled in two ways. The first way is by your computer volume control, how ever loud or soft you have the volume on your computer will affect the speaker volume. I set my computer volume in the middle. The speakers have a volume control on the cord and will go very soft to very loud. When I have my computer volume turn up to the loudest setting and the speaker volume up to  the loudest, the speakers get very loud.I am impressed with the clarity of the speakers. They produce very crisp sounds and nice bass tones. When I watch a movie or video, I am able to hear all the background sounds that my computer speakers would muffle and not let me hear. Now when I listen to my webinar, I can hear everything that is said and do not have to worry about missing anything.I would certainly recommend these speakers. They can be used on any device that has an earphone jack  and they will need to be plugged into a USB port for power.I received a free sample in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H8RELFVESI0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017RQ1J9K#wasThisHelpful","R2H8RELFVESI0M","A3211UDGS0L9TC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3211UDGS0L9TC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered the Anpress Bogesi Black Leather Wallet for my husband to carry since he doesn't like anything big and bulky. The wallet has a nice feel and fits his pants pocket just fine.The wallet is nice and slim,  being  3 3/4 inches wide and 4 1/2 inches tall.  The wallet fits perfectly in the back or front pocket of your pants, the breast pocket of a shirt or suit jacket. The wallet has 6 slots for credit cards with one of them having a clear window to hold your ID or license. There are two larger slots that can hold two more cards or papers, one zippered section for your coins and 1 sections for your dollar bills. There is also a pull out ID holder that works great when you need to pull your license out and don't want to remove it from your wallet. The pull out clear window makes it useful if you have a work card or bus ticket that needs scanned, it will scan through the window and slide back easily in your wallet.The Anpress Wallet is a nice sleek modern looking wallet, perfectly for anyone wanting a thin, not bulky wallet.

"I keep my library card in the glove box of my car to use whenever I need it. It seems to get lost and scratched up since I pull other items in and out of my glove box. When I saw the Horizontal Vinyl Badge Holder by Wisdompro, I decided to order them since the holders would protect my card from damage.The Wisdompro Badge Holders are heavy duty with a nice sturdy zip lock. The badge holders  that I ordered are horizontal facing and are 4 1/2 inches wide and 3 1/2 inches tall. They are made from a clear vinyl that makes it easy to scan your ID card without having to remove it from the holder. The vinyl is soft and flexible, not stiff and hard. The badge holder has a slot for a lanyard clip to connect to it. You could also use a clip to attach the holder to your clothes or pocket.The badge holder is great to keep your ID's, driver license, extra checks, credit card, bus pass,  library card,  metro card or train ticket safe from the environment. It works great for keeping theme park passes secure and dry from any wet rides you are on.The badge holder works great in your pocket, purse, backpack or just to carry around. You could also place dollars or coins in it to make a quick trip in and out of a store if you didn't want to take your wallet or purse.

"I use headphones when I watch movies on my computer and also when I listen to music. I prefer headphones over earbuds and needed to get a new one. I have heard that gaming headphones add depth to whatever you are listening to, so I decided to get the Sentey Gaming Headset. I am so glad I chose these headphones, they are completely amazing!The headphones are soft and very comfortable to wear and are labeled Left and Right. The earpads are 3 inches wide and 4 inches tall. The earpads are big enough for your ears to fit inside the pads to block out surrounding noises. The headphones are easy to adjust by simply putting the headphones on your head and allowing the headband to slides, which adjusts to fit your head. They fit everyone perfectly and  sit comfortably on my head without being too tight or too loose.The sound is always nice and crisp without any static noise or muffled sounds. The headphones has a switch for you to choose which setting you want to listen in. You can choose the regular setting or the vibration mode. The vibration mode vibrates with the rhythm or with loud sounds. I really enjoy this setting because it helps you feel the emotions and moods of a movie. When you listen to music it makes you feel like you are there feeling the pounding bass and drums. The louder you have this setting, the more you feel the vibration.The headphones have a mic that is tucked away on the left earpad. You pull it down when you need it and push it back into place when you want it out of your way. The headphones also have a blue gaming light on the side of them. Both earphones light up when you turn the switch on. You have the choice to have them on or off.Overall, these are the best headphones I have ever owned. They are used everyday and have held up great. I am still amazed at how these headphones make me feel like I am a part of the movie or at a concert when I wear them.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18TR7NF6BAAXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010TRHOC0#wasThisHelpful","R18TR7NF6BAAXG","A3211UDGS0L9TC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3211UDGS0L9TC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have not had any problems charging my phone with the cords. I have noticed that when I transfer photos from my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone to the computer that the photos transfer fast and easy.

"I normally use a set of small scissors to clip my grandchild's fingernails, but the scissors are getting dull and not safe to cut their nails. I do not like using clippers on their nails because I always catch their skin and make them bleed. When I saw that the Baby Comfy Care Deluxe Safety Nail Clipper only had one blade and that it was designed to safely trim babies nails, I decided to try them.The nail clipper is a little big and bulky but it fits in my hand just fine. It is 1 1/2 inches wide, 3 1/4 inches long and  2 inches tall. The clipper is plastic and has a big button that clips the nail when you press it down. The nail clipper only has a top blade so it will not clip the skin. When you place the finger correctly on the clipper, it pushes the skin under the nail back so the clippers can clip without clipping the bottom skin. I had to clip small sections a little at time until the nail was completely clipped. It takes a little practice so you get use to the feel of the clipper, but once you have used it a couple of times you get the hang of it. The nail clipper does clip the nails nice and short. The hardest part is keeping a 1 year old still enough to clip their nails.This clipper will work on older kids too. My 6 year old granddaughter could actually use the Baby Comfy Care Deluxe Safety Nail Clipper to clip her own fingernails. I would certainly recommend this clipper for someone who is timid on cutting fingernails, afraid they will clip the skin and make them bleed. The only problem I had with the clippers is seeing what I was doing, it would be great if they had an attached light, but a lamp works just as well.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R333KOE1FDJH1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XAOGEYY#wasThisHelpful","R333KOE1FDJH1D","A3211UDGS0L9TC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3211UDGS0L9TC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My grandkids do a lot of painting when they are at my house, and I never know what to do with all the wet brushes after they get cleaned and are waiting to dry. I usually lay them on a paper towel to dry or place them in the silverware holder in my dish drainer. The brushes never retain their shape afterwards which make them harder to paint with the next time. I ordered the Deluxe Brush Cleaner with Wash Tank by US Art Supply to help keep my brushes secure while they dry. I have been very happy with the brush cleaner canister and the spiral brush holder.The stainless steel brush cleaner is bigger than I thought it would be. It is 8 inches tall and 4 1/4 inches wide. It is plenty big to hold several type of brushes and will hold any size handle. The bottom container holds the water and all the heavier paint will fall into the bottom bucket keeping the top tank with cleaner water or solvents. You can not overfill the bucket more than the bottom bucket will hold or it will spill out, make sure you do not fill it more that the inner fill rim. If you are soaking your brushes, they will only be covered with about 1 inch of water, depending on what size of brush you are using. There is a metal mesh screen at the bottom of the paint bucket to help rub your brushes on and help remove the paint.The spring spiral brush holder is very nice to have. It will hold several brushes. I have had up to 8 on there at one time and they still have room between each other for more brushes. The spring swings with the weight of the brushes, so you have to rearrange the brushes when they are hanging to dry, so that they will not be touching the side and stay more centered in the tub.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI5Z4J672CY0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013PB35N4#wasThisHelpful","RI5Z4J672CY0X","A3211UDGS0L9TC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3211UDGS0L9TC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:20 MinsI ordered the Mini Laser Stage Lighting by JS LIGHTING to have for school and church activities. Kids and Youth love it when the room has a lot of flashing colors and when you add music with lights flashing at the rhythm of the music, it becomes even more exciting.The mini laser is made from metal, some of it is a little rough and scratchy if you pick it up wrong. The laser has a handle with a hole in it where the laser can be hung from the ceiling or placed on a table by using the included 3 leg tripod. The tripod will need connected to the bottom of the laser and positioned so the laser will stand up. The laser is 3 1/2 inches wide, 4 inches long and 3 inches thick. When you have the tripod connected, the laser will be around 5 inches tall. The laser has a short 3 foot power cord, so you will need an extension cord or be close to a plug.To use the laser you will need to plug it into a wall outlet. The laser is controlled by a remote control that is 3 1/4 inches tall and 1 1/2 inches wide and takes a CR2025 battery that is included. The laser projects on the walls and ceiling of your room up to 15 foot. The projection looks like crowded clouds in the slower setting and more like fast ocean waves in the fast setting. There are 3 setting for the movements, slow, medium and fast. You can choose for the colors to rotate or stay a single color. The single color choices are red, green, blue, yellow, light blue and purple. There is a black button on the back of the laser that can be pushed to change the color choice if you need to press it instead of the remote control.The laser has 3 settings, music, auto and off on the back of the laser. The music mode is sound activated. If you have music or loud noises, the  laser will flash at the sound or to the rhythm of the music being played. The auto mode allows you to choose which setting you want from the remote control and what speed you want the lights and motions to flash. The remote will also allow some of the colors to become strobe lights.This is a great laser to use for parties and holiday events. I even plugged it up for the preschool kids in our church nursery and they loved the lights and danced around the room trying to catch the waves in the air and being projected on the wall. It really made the kids full of energy!I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KC78Q1DJDPTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GPDCVC#wasThisHelpful","R3KC78Q1DJDPTI","A3211UDGS0L9TC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3211UDGS0L9TC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Even though I waivered between wanting to wring Chase's neck and wanting to feel sorry for him in the last book, I was looking forward to his chance at redemption and a chance at real love in this book. Because despite my frustration at Chase's previous attitude and disappointment, he is such a fun, likable guy (you know, when he's not killing people), and I was rooting for him. And I wasn't disappointed with 'Entice'.One of the things I liked about this book was getting the combined backstory between Chase and Mil, along with their current predicament. Because a Mafia-driven marriage might be considered a predicament. With Mil dealing with her new and dangerous position as Boss, and Chase consoling a broken heart, these two had a bit of a mess between them. Fortunately, life has a way of turning things around, and as Chase and Mil adjust to their new life, and new dangers, their hearts and feelings are adjusting as well.Chase and Mil together were super sweet, bringing out the best in each other. So I really liked their developing relationship and how well-suited they were for each other. But I also loved being around the whole mafia family, squabbling, gun slinging, blood spattering and all. Catching up with Nixon and Trace, and finally feeling great about them, was fantastic. Then also seeing other members, and the potential of future stories hooked me in even more. Seriously, I'm not stopping here. 'Elicit', here I come!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UTCB5ITDM5HX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K57A5I0#wasThisHelpful","R2UTCB5ITDM5HX","A324QY39RJ9A4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A324QY39RJ9A4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Elite' hooked me on this series, so once I finished 'Enforce' I jumped right into 'Elect'. Here we get the continuing story of the Eagle Elite, their love lives and mafia lives. Trace, Nixon, and Chase, along with the rest of the gang, took me on quite the wild ride. The combination of mafia war and love triangle was crazy. These guys could not catch a break, except perhaps a broken heart. I really felt sorry for Trace, Nixon, and Chase, but mostly for Trace. I wanted to yell at these guys and the unfair way her emotions were treated. I know they were stuck between and rock and a hard place, but I still felt indignant on her behalf. I also felt the frustration for all involved, battling life and death choices, family ties and sympathies, and requited and unrequited love. This is an exciting series, and I'm flying through the pages, ready for the next one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C8E1BS3LYBM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FKAD59I#wasThisHelpful","R2C8E1BS3LYBM1","A324QY39RJ9A4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A324QY39RJ9A4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 'The Game Plan' we get to experience yet another Bradford driving his neighbor completely crazy. In this case, Danny has been pushing Jodi's buttons for two months, and if she could afford it, she would have moved yesterday. But a boatload of debt has her locked in her lease, and stuck with Danny. But in true Bradford tradition, odd albeit over-the-top circumstances somehow bring Danny and Jodi together. But is their attraction enough to overcome the dislike, and do they have enough hope and love between them to overcome the damage each has suffered from their pasts?Danny drove me crazy in the beginning. But when Danny puts his mind to something, whether taunting a girl or wooing her, he gets the job done. As Danny and Jodi walked the frenemy line, I found myself really liking them together. Mathewson took some interesting direction with this story, and while I found some things repetitive, I found other things really creative, keeping me on my toes.  Danny and Jodi were quite adorable, and I loved the changes in Danny. I loved the banter between them. We also get the normal Bradford food issues, but I absolutely loved the twist on how Jodi handles medication. That was a hoot!I also liked that we got some nice depth and insight into Danny and his family, his relationship with his father in particular. Jodi also developed her character, and though the secret she was keeping drove me bonkers, I genuinely liked her and how things eventually came about. Danny and Jodi's lives kept the book interesting and more than just a funny romance. There were some greats twists toward the end, and I loved what Mathewson did with these characters. Great ending!'The Game Plan' can be read as a standalone, though you do get to see some characters from the previous books. Though this wasn't my favorite of the series, I still really enjoyed it. I love the Bradfords and always look forward to more from them.

"Overall: 4.5 StarsWow! This book was totally addictive. I've had this on my kindle for a while, and finally took the plunge. But now that I've started this series, I'm hooked! And I'm so glad I decided to buy the other books in this series, because I'm going to fly through them.So what's ELITE all about? It's the mafia, new adult style. It's secrets and lies. It's the push and pull of attraction and trust. It's a world turned upside-down. We've got friends, family, enemies or a crazy mix of all of the above. We've got painful humiliation combined with tender feelings and saucy humor. We've got violence and mayhem, but also calculated control and commendable sacrifice. Questionable choices? Yes. Irreparable choices? Unfortunately, yes. Heartache? Another yes. Combine that with exciting writing, and you've got the makings of insta-love. No, not insta-love between the book's characters. I'm talking insta-love between me and this series!We've also got hardcore fascinating characters.†Trace is entertaining and brave, yet vulnerable and honest. Nixon is practically bipolar, walking the line of psycho and sweet. And Nixon's group of Elite are just itching for their own books, because each is so unique and engrossing on their own. What makes these guys tick? What is the good and bad in them? What, if any, are their redeeming qualities? And when you see how it all unfolds, you might feel a little crazy alongside these guys. If I were Trace, I might have pulled a gun on them myself. This life is not easy. Not by a long shot. But oh so captivating. I stayed up until 2am to finish it, despite my early travel plans the next day. I just couldn't stop. And then I immediately wanted to start the next book. And the next. And the next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R306190I6537FP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTUHMPE#wasThisHelpful","R306190I6537FP","A324QY39RJ9A4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A324QY39RJ9A4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ENFORCE is basically ELITE from the guy's POV. But instead of being all repetition of the original book, I found this to be one of the best companion books I've read. While ELITE was just from Trace's POV, ENFORCE is not only from Nixon's POV, but from Chase, Phoenix and Tex's as well. And let me just say, if you liked ELITE, you have to read this book. It is completely eye-opening. It's the dark side of ELITE, and just Wow! The perspective, the fresh take on things, the glimpses into these men, their past and present, their upbringing, their mindset, was riveting. I learned things I hadn't a clue about, and it added layer upon layer to the storyline. I can't even imagine going through the rest of this series without reading this book.

"Another hit from Jay Crownover and my favorite of The Point series so far. Of course Titus, the hot cop, would be a major draw to reading this book. I've been wanting to know his story since Bax punched him in the first book. But I've also wanted to know Reeve's story ever since she walked back into The Point in the last book. So knowing these two power players were finally going to go head to head made the anticipation tantalizing. But the real deal and how it all played out was well worth the wait.'Better When He's Bold' left us in a crazy place, knowing some psycho was out there trying to quite literally burn down The Point. But Reeve's sudden appearance is what starts this book with a bang, because Reeve knows who the culprit is. Problem is, how to catch the bad guy and what destructive wake will it take to finish him off.Titus did not disappoint. Crownover's portrayal of our hero cop trying to save the innocents of The Point, taking on burden after burden, fighting his attraction to who many would consider the wrong girl, while he himself has his own monsters locked up deep inside, was perfect. I could feel Titus's struggle, his longing, his convictions, his loyalty, his intensity, his heart. And the man that came out on top after all the craziness was even better than he was at the start.What I liked about Reeve was that she wasn't some damsel in distress. She was fierce, and independent, not just a survivor but someone who wasn't afraid to carve her own path. Now, while the choices she took along that path weren't always good ones, she also had the humility to seek help, the vulnerability to ask forgiveness, and the heart to straighten herself out and seek love in her life anyway.The attraction between Titus and Reeve oozed off the pages from the very start. But what I loved was the beauty of their burgeoning relationship. On paper these two should not have been together. But instead they came together to be the perfect yin to the other's yang. Did they have sexual chemistry? Yes, big time! But even more than that they came to a deep understanding of the other, and the depths they went to were beautiful. I loved them together.There's also tons of action and suspense in this story. We're hunting the bad guy, of course, but he's also a psycho bad guy, so we never know what destruction he's going to come up with next. Plus, we also get some real gems to enjoy or ponder for the future in our past and hopefully future other couples. Yes, love has hit the point, but as is so eloquentally spoken by Titus, ""Love can look really strange in the Point. In fact, if you aren't paying attention you might miss it altogether because it doesn't look like love at all.""This book has it all: vengeance, forgiveness, hope, sacrifice, friendship, family, violence, sweetness, betrayal, trust, redemption, and love. The Point is gritty, seedy, dirty, corrupt, but also littered with seeds of love, loyalty, hope, and people just wanting more, wanting better, and learning how to find that within the confines of gray boundaries. Can't wait to see what happens next!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AFN3JYH4HMVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062385925#wasThisHelpful","R1AFN3JYH4HMVC","A324QY39RJ9A4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A324QY39RJ9A4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok. So I really wanted to like this story. There was a lot of intrigue about the two main characters from the start. Honey was sweet, just like her name. She had a heart of gold, and I hoped for her to find true love. Her new neighbor, Hal, is a real piece of work right off the bat. But, of course, jerky but attractive boys are intriguing, so we definitely want to know what makes this guy tick and why he has such a huge chip on his shoulder. Plus, Honey has some fun friends, who are sure to make her journey to love interesting. Particularly, since Tash and Nell have their own plans for Honey's lackluster dating life. Hence, the Piano Man Project. So lots of good potential here.Unfortunately, this book didn't quite go the way I'd hoped. While I did find it entertaining, and actually read through it quite quickly, I had issues with the overall story. For one thing, the romance between Honey and Hal didn't end up working for me. Between Hal being such a reclusive jerk and Honey being a total doormat, I found myself not necessarily wanting them to end up together for much of the book. There were moments, particularly in the end, where I really needed Hal to grovel. A lot. A whole lot. So while I appreciated that Honey's character played such a pivotal role in turning Hal's life around, I really needed her to stand up for herself more.There were also lots of little stories mixed throughout and within Honey and Hal's story. And while some of them were pretty interesting, this is one of those occasions where less would have been more. There were just too many things going on, and it slowed down the overall story and pace. I will say that the side story between Nell and Simon was my favorite. I could have easily read an entire book about them.Then it just ended. Most of the stories were resolved, but I felt a bit bereft. This book could have really used an epilogue. I don't think all stories need epilogues, but perhaps because I already had issues with the romance, I really wanted an epilogue to give me moreclosure and confidence in this relationship.So while I did find this book entertaining, and it certainly held my interest, it wasn't a favorite of mine. But there are a number of more positive reviews out there, so perhaps you would like it more than I.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HAAPB945BDV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T2HWI2K#wasThisHelpful","R3HAAPB945BDV5","A324QY39RJ9A4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A324QY39RJ9A4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went into this story having not paid much attention to the synopsis. My draw was simply having been a fan of Amber Belldene's 'Blood Vine' series, which I loved. So knowing Amber had written a new book, I knew I wanted to read it. Fortunately, it only took me a few chapters to become totally engrossed in this story.'The Siren's Touch' felt like I stepped into a modern day fairy tale, but a fairy tale with a very dark and twisted path and characters teetering on the edge of a deep abyss. This was a supernatural tale revolving around revenge and vengeance, but also second chances, redemption, and love. I also loved the mix of past and present, Ukranian culture and mythology.I was spellbound by Dmitri and Sonya's story and figuring out how they were going to solve Sonya's issue and what the consequences would be. And at the same time Dmitri had his own revenge plot he was trying to fulfill. But plans have a way of changing, particularly when new information comes to light, and the plotter himself starts to make personal changes as well. When a book revolves around revenge, it can be difficult to know how to root or your characters or if you should even cheer for them. There were certain moral questions that came to light, and I loved how Belldene handled it all, and how the ultimate plot unraveled and concluded.I also fell in love with Dmitri and Sonya. Each had tragic pasts. Dmitri had been raised in a very difficult environment, and had unfortunately made some poor choices in his life. Sonya had been murdered, and while she was innocent then, now, as a rusalka, she has vengeance in her blood. Both are faced with incredible choices. But the beauty of this story is how these two souls find each other, and in the midst of helping each other, end up saving themselves. Dmitri makes the biggest changes, and I loved his transformation. For such a hard character, he turns out to be the sweetest. And for Sonya being so out of touch with the present, she turns out to be the perfect match for Dmitri. Their love story was beautiful, and I was on the edge of my seat hoping for a happy ending for them.I loved 'The Siren's Touch' and Dmitri and Sonya's story. I was also excited to find out there would be sequels to this story, featuring some characters introduced here. I can't wait to read more in this fascinating series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FFJ43RMA0ZKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PP2ZXBY#wasThisHelpful","R2FFJ43RMA0ZKK","A324QY39RJ9A4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A324QY39RJ9A4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I LOVED THIS BOOK! Sorry, I had to get that out of the way. I can't even describe how much I loved 'Falling for June.' I was expecting a love story, given the title of this book. But what I got from this story went beyond my wildest imagination. 'Falling for June' is a gorgeous, touching, beautifully rendered story demonstrating what a gift it is to fall in love, to be in love, to love beyond fear or sickness or even death. Not only that, it is the inescapable beauty of friendship and kindness, compassion and comradery.In this gorgeously written book, we follow Elliot Champ, solitary bachelor with big dreams of escape, as he goes about his life to finally gain his childhood dream. But plans often come to unexpected paths, as was the case when Elliot's job brought him to the doorstep of Echo Glen, and into the company of a charming, elderly gentleman named David Hadley. For Elliot, business today is not as-usual as he spends the afternooon with David learning about the charming, breathtaking, unforgettable love story between David and his wife, June. But what Elliot gains through this visit goes beyond a day and a story, and unexpectedly challenges the very depths of Elliot's life.The beauty of this book was multi-layered, which is my very favorite type of book. Trying to avoid major spoilers, I will narrow down this book in a very small way. But this is only a brief taste of what this story entails. Just the tip of the iceberg.*First of all, we get Elliot, our main protagonist, whom we learn about not only his present, but the foundation of his past that got him to where he is today and the reasoning behind his life's goals and dreams. Elliot is the perfect conductor of this story, with his combined reservations and vulnerability, and a heart of gold.*Secondly, we get David and June's beautiful love story, released to us in a captivating tale that I could not get enough of. This tale revealed so much about David and June, about a history of life and love, and I'm still getting misty-eyed just thinking about it. I easily fell in love with them.*Then, we get this newfound friendship between Elliot and David. Watching these two men from different generations bond and find a kindred spirit in the other was incredible. I'm getting misty-eyed again thinking about these lovely men.*Lastly, we get Elliot's love story. Or potential love story, I should say. Because Elliot's world is thrown a bit on its head during this story, and we get to see how what he has learned about life and himself affects the choices he makes for his future.I cannot praise 'Falling for June' enough. It's a new favorite of mine, and I've fallen in love with this beautiful story and its equally beautiful characters. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to follow endearing characters and a captivating storyline, who likes beautiful and engaging writing, who loves to fall in love with characters and wish they were sitting beside you. and who wants to be taken on a very special journey, that will leave you deeply touched and incredibly happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HRJMF5P5YW2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476771278#wasThisHelpful","R2HRJMF5P5YW2H","A324QY39RJ9A4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A324QY39RJ9A4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! I absolutely loved 'Willing Captive'! To be honest, it took me two attempts to get past the first chapter to get into the book. I guess it felt a bit info-dumpy and I wasn't sure about Lily. I thought maybe there was too much hype about this book and I'd be the odd-man-out not liking it. Well, thank goodness I got past all that! Because not far into this book I did not want to put it down. I was completely sucked into Lily and Nox's story! It's a new addition to my favorites shelf.Lily was a hoot. For being basically a locked away princess, she had buckets full of personality and wasn't about to be stuck in a corner. After years of compliance, she blooms in the presence of Nox, Boo, and Rock. I found it entertaining how one moment she could be immature and whiny, the next sensitive and compassionate, then next fun and crazy, and then next bold and loving. I think it's because of her varying personalities that I liked her so much, because I could completely relate to having wild moods. Then watching her come alive with Nox as the catalyst was simply delightful.Nox was his own special form of awesomeness. I loved that we got a few chapters or scenes from his POV, but not too many. I like a bit of mystery, and don't need every detail spelled out for me. So the bits from Nox were perfect. And Nox, being so different from Lily, was perfect. He's the stability to her crazy, the patience to her spazzing, the calm to her storm. But she also brings out the side of him that seems to have been locked away, bringing him back to life and happiness and a future. And let's just say, an uninhibited Nox is a sexy, sexy Nox.What I really loved about this story was the combination of blooming romance, sweet friendships, and life-threatening suspense and danger. Let's not forget that Lily is a captive and the danger is unknown but relentless. But somehow this story was able to balance all these aspects with the perfect combination of humor, sass, secrecy, intensity, suspense, sweetness, chemistry, sexiness, danger, shyness, heartbreak, friendship, and boundless love. I won't go into detail, but I will say that I was completely absorbed in this story, needing to see how it all turned out and taking the ride till the very end. (And I loved how it ended!)All I can say at this point, is that I loved 'Willing Captive.' It exceeded any expectations I had. I fell in love with Nox and Lily, big time. I felt like I was right alongside them during the suspense, and cheering them on in the game of love.

"This was the first book I read in this series. I was intrigued by the cover because I love inter-racial couples. Plus, it's a novella, so it was an easy way to see if this series was for me or not. Well, I'm so glad I did. I felt like I could jump right into this series and get caught up quickly without feeling out of the loop. Yet, now I am also intrigued to read the previous books, if not for the story set-up, then for the love stories of the previous couples. So this can definitely be read as a standalone, but if you like it like me, you may get hooked into the rest of the series.As for Easy and Jenna, I loved them. There is an age gap, but it didn't bother me. Probably because they are so great together, and I know couples with age gaps and it isn't a big deal. These two have a great connection, and I loved their chemistry as well as the sincere bond, respect, and consideration I felt between them. The beauty of their relationship is also how well they help and heal each other. Jenna has just been rescued from a kidnapping, but Easy has been struggling with suicidal ideation since his military discharge. Easy's situation was the most compelling for me. I'm really glad that the author used this story to bring to light the suicidal struggles so many military and ex-military go through, and I thought Easy's story really did it justice.Now, if you don't like a quick romance, than be warned that these two fall fast and hard. But if you like a whodunit where this group of ex-military are trying to clear their names, find out who set them up, and get into all kinds of suspenseful situations, combined with couples like Easy and Jenna finding love in the midst of these intense situations, then you will love this. I'm looking forward to catching up on, and continuing this series.Overall: 4.5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NL7A9TW60R8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMHS6EU#wasThisHelpful","R3NL7A9TW60R8K","A324QY39RJ9A4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A324QY39RJ9A4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Phew! I've survived dating boot camp! I'm not sure how I'm feeling. I think I may be suffering from a hypoglycemic episode because that ending has left me a bit light-headed and weak in the knees. What I love about Kaitlyn and Martin's story is the incredible character development. These are not weak, one-dimensional, cardboard cut-outs. They are a wealth of depth and emotion and layers, and I love how deeply Penny has delved into them, and I imagine will continue to delve right through Capture, the next and final book of this trilogy.I absolutely love getting to know Kaitlyn and Martin, and watching them get to know themselves. And they are not perfect. Martin was a rough start for me from the beginning of Attraction, but he really grew on me here, flaws and all. I liked Kaitlyn from the start, but even Kaitlyn has her limitations and imperfections. Penny really captured their youth and inexperience, despite their high intelligence. And their naÔvet√© in the ways of love they are experiencing. They are short-sighted and prideful in their own ways. And this makes for some fascinatingly frustrating fights and some super steamy sexy times. Actually, lots of sexy times. The title of this book is ""Heat"" for reason! Because when your passion comes out in one way, it comes out all over the place. And then there's the drama. The crazies and manipulators are coming out of the closet, making for exciting, twisty-turny, where's-this-story-going-next reading. What's going to happen next?! I cannot wait to find out!Note: For those, like me, who hate cliff-hangers, I know you're thinking about just reading straight through the series. But let me encourage you to at least go a few days to a week between books, the gap between Heat and Capture in particular. (I have now completed the trilogy, and say these things in complete honesty.) There is some perculating that needs to be done. Like a good marinade, the flavors need time to set to really make the quality of the meal complete. Trust me when I say that giving yourself some time between book will actually make reading Capture even better. Trust me!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PA392L893OZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UQH820M#wasThisHelpful","R2PA392L893OZX","A324QY39RJ9A4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A324QY39RJ9A4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have truly loved the Marked Men series, and look forward to all my future re-reads. Ending the series with Asa's story was really cool because, though he was not one of the original ""marked men,"" for a country boy with a checkered past, he became just as integral to the group as all of the other boys. And watching him go from where he started to where he ended up - in life, in love, in friends, and in family - was a beautiful thing.I definitely enjoyed Asa and Royal's story, which truly was a journey for both of them, Asa in particular. Having met Asa in Jet's book, and knowing his dark and crooked past, I was excited and nervous for his story. Excited because I love people getting a second chance at life; nervous because I feared the Southern charmer might make new mistakes he would regret. I didn't know where his journey would take him, except that it would intersect with Royal.I liked that this story wasn't entirely predictable. I fully expected certain things to happen, and when they didn't and went a different direction, I was actually quite pleased. I don't mind certain predictabilities in romances. In fact, sometimes I want them. But I also love when an author keeps me on my toes. Asa and Royal's story was able to fulfill all my expectations and then some.I wasn't expecting so much depth from Asa. Well, maybe I was expecting the depth, but not all the inner conflict. But it was so important. He had so much from his past to deal with and consider, reflect upon and repent of, forgive and learn from his mistakes. I admire all the consideration on Jay's part to display all of Asa's dimensions, and make his present and future legitimate considerations. I admired Asa's intentions, and even as he doubted himself, you could feel him becoming the man he was always meant to be. And the man Royal needed.Royal had her own journey, and though perhaps it wasn't at the same magnitude as Asa's, it was just as important. I love that she held on to her integrity. Just because you fall for a boy with a criminal record, doesn't mean you both are going to go in that direction. Royal was so good, and yet knew how to let loose just the right amount. Then watching Royal and Asa together, how well they worked and helped each other. Even with their hang-ups, you could tell they would have a beautiful partnership at the end of all the struggle.It's sad to see the end of the Marked Men series, but what a great way to end it. I agree with Asa when he said things came full circle -- full circle for Asa, full circle for the series. I leave the Marked Men with utter contentment, wistful of my time with them, grateful for the journey, and hoping for glimpses of them in the spin-off series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21U0TMB86BUSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062333070#wasThisHelpful","R21U0TMB86BUSZ","A324QY39RJ9A4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A324QY39RJ9A4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love Bites is my favorite of the series so far. Is that because it's about Calder and Ricki? Maybe. I was first introduced to this series with Ricki and Calder's novella, One Little Bite, that appeared in the Shiver anthology. After getting a peek at them, I've been eager for the rest of their story ever since. But their story led me to this entire series, which has been fantastic.But what makes this book so great is that it encompasses so much. I mean, it feels like this puppy has a bit of everything. And in a good way. First, we have Ricki and Calder's love story. From their previous novella, we know they had a one night stand. But Calder isn't about to settle for just one night. With a past like Ricki has, however, she is in no hurry to trust this werewolf who is all up in her life, and not to be deterred. Watching these two maneuver around and about each other, working through their issues - whether be control, trust, doubt, fear, attraction, love - and learn how to be a better, stronger couple was great. Plus, they are super sexy together.I really loved getting to know Ricki and Calder on a deeper level, watching their two very different worlds collide, and then seeing how great they were together. Ricki, a no nonsense gal, tired of being hurt by the men in her life, but skittish of trustworthy men, had a habit of running, and not in the track and field sense. Calder, finding the woman he wanted, had to work through how to deal with the idiosyncrasies of the female human mind, which was no easy task. I loved watching him work so hard to be the best he could be, and win Ricki over. Calder was definitely a keeper. And when Ricki figured out how great he was, and let down her walls, she knew he was a keeper, too. Truly, Calder and Ricki together equals awesome.Then, there's this whole Faction trying to take over the world thing. This isn't just some small footnote. Big things are happening here plotwise to the overall series. Great stuff. I won't give away anything. But I love the direction being taken. Uncovering all the crazy stuff happening with the prophecy, who can be trusted, who cannot, and what the heck is going to happen next - all exciting stuff. Add in the other couples, plus Lachlan and Chloe, and this story had so much goodness.And then the ending! Ahh, it all came together and set up the future in one big swoop. Not only was this a great book, but it also left me with so much to look forward to. I loved this book - love, friendship, intrigue, intensity, mystery, suspense, hope, and all. This is such a great paranormal romance series, and I can't wait to see what happens next!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GHCQKER47WBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WAJKF36#wasThisHelpful","R1GHCQKER47WBC","A324QY39RJ9A4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A324QY39RJ9A4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a cute, sweet story about two childhood friends discovering that a few years of growing up can mean a whole lot more to their relationship. Aimee had a childhood crush on Miles, her brother's best friend. But Miles always saw her as his friend's little sister. When Miles hit the big time, joining a boy band and leaving home to travel and tour, Aimee tosses her crush out the window and tries to move on with her life and her heart. It's now been two years since they've seen each other, and two years can do a lot to people. Not only do they look different (yep, lots of physical attraction), but their personal experiences over the last few years have changed and molded them, leaving them wary and self-protective. But when you reconnect with someone who knew you way back then, can you let those walls down? And what if your personal walls aren't the only barriers to your happily ever after?Aimee and Miles are very cute. There is definitely a youthful feel to this novel - word choices, abbreviations, and all. The entire time I was reading I had a One Direction song (the only song I know from them) playing in my head. Yep, Miles is in a boy band, and this story definitely gives off the boy band vibe. But in a cute way. Aimee has youth and the emotions of a renewed crush going for her. Miles is the band's ""heartthrob"" and has a reputation as a player, though there is more to this cutie that meets the eye (and the gossip). Seeing these two reconnect and see each other in a different light was a lot of fun. Though their relationship is pretty superficial, I could still feel their connection and how sweet they were together. Basically, they are cute and sweet and fun to read, giving off all those gooey feelings of first love, though I would have liked more depth.As for the story, this was really a build-up of discovery, of feelings, of trust. We get the tour bus experience, the band lifestyle, the varying band member personalities, the nosey manager, and of course, the super protective big brother. There is a bit of drama, but mostly toward the end, but don't expect a big angst-fest. Overall, the pacing is pretty steady, and I was never bored, reading the book fairly quickly. It was a fun read. There are some sexual references, lots of kissing and making out, some minor mature language. There also appears to be more books about some or all of the band members planned for the future. It appears that Ryder, the bad boy, is getting his own book, but written by a different author. So if you like to follow boy bands, this could be the series for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LSTPDOU5IOR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URTLZ44#wasThisHelpful","R1LSTPDOU5IOR2","A324QY39RJ9A4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A324QY39RJ9A4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Confession #1: This is the first book I have read from the Rosemary Beach series. The last Abbi Glines book I read was Just For Now from the Sea Breeze series. Because of Low is my favorite of Abbi's. But despite owning several of the books in this series, time and content factors have kept me from reading them.Confession #2: I cheated a bit before reading When I'm Gone, looking at some reviews and minor spoilers. I may have also done some peeking ahead while reading. Why? Because one of my obstacles to pursuing this series has been the reality that I'm tired of the boys-behaving-badly trope. The player/cheater character diary is emotionally draining, so due to some spoilers on previous books, I just haven't gotten around to them. I also don't love that each couple has two books complete with cliffhangers.But...Despite the above issues, I was feeling like I needed to give Abbi another fair shot. My confessions also contain assumptions and fears of the content of stories that I have yet to read. Some of these are valid as I have read through spoilers. But some are just personal and may or may not be valid. So when I saw the blurb for When I'm Gone and got a good feeling about Mase's character, I knew I had to give it a shot. And I'm so glad I did!!!My Review:I thoroughly enjoyed When I'm Gone. Having no backstory on Mase, all I can say is that in this book he is completely swoonworthy. I loved Mase! He's the sort of hero you want, especially for such a tenderhearted soul like Reese. Mase is a true cowboy, with the horses and ranch to boot. But he's also a big softie. From the moment he meets Reese he's done for. But he's so gentle and patient, and that's one of the qualities of this book I truly admired. Yes, Mase can also dirty talk with the best of them. But he truly knew how to handle Reese and her boundaries, and earned all the trust we had in him.Reese had an awful childhood, which we get some glimpses into (including abuse, bullying, and a learning disorder). But despite how broken people tried to make her, she is a gem. She's shy but strong. She's skittish, but for good reason. But she has a heart of gold and still tries to see the good in people. And despite all the hurts of her past, she was still able to see the good in Mase. She was a great balance between having enduring internal strength and fortitude combined with needing the support and love of others to give her that last glimpse of hope she's needed all her life.These two could not have been more perfect for each other. The way their story unfolded was very sensitively handled. Watching them bond long distance was just so sweet. I truly enjoyed watching them grow as friends and as a couple. And despite Reese's past, there are still some great and creative sexy times. Now there is a bit of drama, but I would not label this as high angst. While some issues may take longer than others, they are all resolvable and none are unforgiveable. As a bonus, for those who have followed this series, you get to see many of the previous couples, which even for a newbie like me, was really sweet.And yes, there's a bit of a cliffhanger, but it's not bad. I felt good about where Mase and Reese's relationship was in the end. I still don't love that there are two books per couple. I don't like unnecessary drama and worry about what Glines will do to this couple next. Without the cliffhanger, I would have been happy with this as a standalone. But I definitely want to find out what happens to Mase and Reese and root for their HEA.Overall: 4.5 Stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7WM0F5WVO2HF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OO0C#wasThisHelpful","R7WM0F5WVO2HF","A324QY39RJ9A4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A324QY39RJ9A4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ahhhh, Penny Reid, such a well-played cliffhanger. She warned us it was coming. There's no sudden surprise here. And I know there is more to the story. I know. I think I know. Maybe I don't know. Maybe I'm hoping I know because I'm an optimist. But, regardless of my hopes, I feel like a junk-punch is in order to a certain character in this book.¬†Or does it? That's the beauty of a good cliffhanger.But did I like Attraction, Part 1 of the Elements of Chemistry series? No. I loved it! Yes, I am a long-time Penny Reid fan. But when your author-crush delves into new territory, you never know what you're going to get. Would this live up to the pedestal I've placed Penny on? Well, yes it did. Huzzah!Kaitlyn and Martin are quite a pair. Are they a good pair? Jury is still out. I need the rest of the story. But what I love about this book is the fascinating and deliberate exploration of character. Kaitlyn is my kind of girl. Awkward, honest, naive, smart, kind, and an unapologetic nerd. I love being in her head. I love the way she speaks her mind. I just love her. Then there's Martin, who is this mysterious player-type, but I know there are a ton of layers beneath that surly, sexy surface. So very many depths to this boy, and I love the way we see Kaitlyn trying to see past the surface. Now some things Martin does, I'm like ""Um, what do you think you're doing there, buddy?"" Because we may not know all about the depths of Martin, but I don't think he knows himself very well either, and that is what is both fascinating and frustrating about him.¬†But together, I definitely felt the ""chemistry"" between Kaitlyn and Martin. There's no denying the attraction and bond going on there. And not just with the sexual tension. Though let me assure you, the sexual tension is through the roof. But there is also this potential friendship and potential for kindred spirits that is there, but how will all that potential play out? Can these two opposites attract? Or will their differences repel them?

"What's not to love about this story? Two ""older"" people meet by chance, both single after years of widow/widower-hood. She's from the rich life, he's from a simple life. Both have loved before but still have plenty of life left in them and are open to finding love again. But can it really be that simple? Perhaps not. And this is where Katy Regnery weaves her magic. One of my favorite things about her writing is the great character development. Getting to know Grace and Tray on a deeper level, and in particular watching Grace find herself again and open up to potential with Tray, was touching and thoughtful, with just the right amount of suspense and the perfect dose of steaminess. I fell in love with Grace and Tray, and my only wish is that I could read more about them. Seriously, they were fabulous! Don't let the fact that they are ""older"" dissuade you from their super sweet story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO74NAWTR76KY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TU5E16K#wasThisHelpful","RO74NAWTR76KY","A324QY39RJ9A4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A324QY39RJ9A4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Glycolic Acid Cream works!I have uneven, hyper pigmented skin from old acne scars that just refuse to fade away. I also have adult acne so I'm always adding to the dark spot collection. What I can stand the most is that my pores are the size of craters in the moon! It's almost impossible for me to wear makeup because it pools in my pores and just makes me look horrendous.Glycolic acid works wonders to treat these problems along with dullness, dryness, and early aging signs. I love that InstaNaturals added Vitamin C because it synergizes with the Glycolic Acid to both soften and nourish the skin for an even, brighter, more radiant glow. In addition to these two powerhouses, they also added Bearberry extract! For those that aren't familiar, Bearberry extract is an astringent that minimizes pores and lightens pigment and has a history as a way to fade freckles. These three ingredients along with some very powerful hydration g ingredients (Hyraluronic acid and CoQ10) make for a cream that is working wonders for my skin! I use it at night after I've watched and toned my skin. The results have been instant although they're not where I want them yet. I've had coworkers comment that my skin looks brighter and one person even said I had a pregnancy glow. Still trying to figure out if that was a backhanded weight remark...lol anyway here are some tips I've learned and though to share so you can get the biggest benefit from this amazing product:* I apply the Glycolic Acid Cream to clean and dry skin after my toner and serums but before my night cream* I gently massage a quarter size amount of cream onto my face, neck, and up behind my ears until it has completely absorbed in* Make sure you really rub it in since it is orange! The orange color will quickly disappear as you apply the lotion.* I have sensitive skin so I only use the cream once a day and only at night.* After the product dries apply a moisturizer with sunscreen if you use it during the day! THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST! This product contains an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that may increase your skin's sensitivity to the sun and particularly the possibility of sunburn. Use a sunscreen, wear protective clothing, and limit sun exposure while using this product and for a week afterwards.Overall, I absolutely love this Glycolic cream and can't wait to see how radiant my skin will look after I've used the entire bottle!

"If you're one of those ladies that uses the flimsy tweezers that come in manicure sets PLEASE throw those away and get yourself a decent pair like these from KlipPro! I own around 15 pairs of tweezers but only use two, this one and my expensive pair from Tweezerman. I love these because:- Zero hand fatigue! I have lots of wanted hairs that require tweezing and it doesn't take long before my hand starts to cramp up. Not the case with these KlipPro tweezers. The wide design and brushed finish make these ergonomically one of the best tweezers I've used.- They grasp the hair the first time around! I don't have to keep trying to get a grasp of short hairs over and over. This considerably cuts down on my grooming time- Easy to keep track of! I get a little anxious when I can't find my tweezers. However,  you might say these stick out like a fish out of water....sorry, that was corny. As someone who has those pesky thick chin hair that look like they belong on an old man, having tweezers easily accessible is a must- They're just so darn cute!Overall, these are great for eyebrows, chin hairs, and even for applying false eyelashes!

"This dry ice whiskey stones combo set would make the perfect gift for Fathers Day! It comes in it's own plastic case that snaps securely shut and has it's own little metal tongs too!How to use: Simply freeze the stones. Add three to your next drink, let stand for five minutes and enjoy.Why should you use Whiskey Stones instead of ice?Whiskey Stones are ideal for drinking with high quality whiskey because they keep it at the perfect sipping temperature (50 degrees), whereas ice cubes can make the whiskey too cold and ruin the flavor.A handful of ice will take a drink to just under 40 degrees, and to deep freeze a drink quickly, there is nothing better. But some drinks you neither want to dilute nor deep freeze. Temperatures in the high 30s are far too cold for good whiskey. Reason being that the wood oils in the whiskey, which have leached into the liquid from the carefully selected cask it was aged in and which carry all the flavor, tend to congeal and ""close down"" the flavor of the drink itself when the temperature goes below 50. The stones are specifically designed to ""take the edge off without diluting or closing down the flavor."" Specifically, 3 stones in a glass containing 2-3 oz. will take the liquid temp from mid-70s (room temperature) to the 50s. Not designed for use with a large volume of liquid.I received this product in exchange for a honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TOVRG26USNGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SUELMMS#wasThisHelpful","R2TOVRG26USNGD","A328G38HUWRLXJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A328G38HUWRLXJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Retseliney has quickly become my favorite skin care line for quality vegan products and this exfoliant cream is no different! If you're familiar with St. Ives Apricot scrub then you know how harsh and abrasive it can be. This is the exact opposite. The exfoliating particles are small and gently  exfoliate the dead skins off the top layer if your skin that are often the main culprit in your skin looking dull and lifeless.There's also the addition of so many beneficial oils like Grapeseed oil, hempseed oil, avocado oil, and jojoba oil. This and Shea butter helps to moisturize the newly exposed skin and also gives it a young, dewy glow. I use this by putting a quarter size amount in my wet hands and then rub it in circular motions across my face, avoiding the mouth and eye area. I rinise off with lukewarm water and then use my usual toner, serum, and moisturizer afterwards. I do this twice a week max and it has made a major difference in my skin!

"These Tweedz earbuds are my favorite! I know that everyone, myself included, probably uses Bluetooth headphones now but there are still some situations where traditional cord earbuds are needed. I know that for me it's at the gym.

"Bed bugs are hard to eradicate once they're established, and when you travel, you don't always know if you'll be staying in an infested location. Apparently the problem is so widespread that even hotels you'd think are immune to pest infestations are experiencing embarrassing bed bug activity.This is why I have this product.

So I take this whenever I travel and spray down every piece of bedding, couches, carpet, etc.I'm all about using essential oil instead of nasty chemicals and I love that one of the active ingredients in this product is Geranium Oil.

"I wasn't sure about this OrganicRaw Yacon Syrup at first. I mean, I wasn't really sure what a Yacon was to be honest. So I did a little research and found out that adding this to my diet was one of the easiest and simplest ways to help jump start my weight loss. Here's just a little of what I learned about this miracle vegetable:Yacon syrup is extracted from the roots of the Yacon plant, which looks just like a sweet potato. The Yacon plant grows natively in the Andes mountains in South America.This plant has been eaten and used for medicinal purposes for hundreds of years in South America. People there believed it to have powerful medicinal properties, leading to improvements in diabetes and helping with kidney and digestive disorders.Because a large part of Yacon syrup isn‚Äôt digested, it has only a third of the caloric value of sugar. For this reason, it can be used as a low-calorie alternative to sugar. When the active ingredients in Yacon syrup reach the large intestine, they feed the friendly bacteria in the digestive system. This is where Yacon syrup works its magic‚Ä¶ in the gut. The friendly bacteria in the gut are actually incredibly important for the health of our bodies. Having the ‚Äúright‚Äù types is associated with a lower risk of diabetes, better immunity and improved brain function‚Ä¶ to name a few.When the bacteria digest the Yacon syrup they also produce short-chain fatty acids that have powerful anti-obesity effects, at least in rats. There is also some evidence that Yacon syrup can lower the hunger hormone ghrelin, helping to reduce appetite.What I love about this Yacon syrup from Peak Fusion is that this taste no different from molasses. So if you're hesitant about the taste like I was, please don't let that hold you back. When you add it to recipes, you really don't notice the taste except it adds a bit of sweetness. My favorite way to consume the Yacon Syrup is to add it to a smoothie since I drink one every morning and it's just sort of a no brainer. The receipe is:- 3 cups raspberries- 1/4 cup spinach- 1‚ÅÑ2 cup Greek yogurt- 1 teaspoon Peak Fusion Platinum Yacon Syrup- ice to thickenAnd it's that easy! I have noticed that my energy is higher than it was and that I don't crave sweets like I used to. Also I'm not as hungry as I used to be - once I eat I feel fuller longer which has helped me cut on my snaking. I'm not one for the scale but I have noticed that within the month of using this that my clothes don't feel as restricting as they used to! I haven't really actively try to change my diet and exercise but I bet if I did I would see some decent weight loss!

"I bought this thinking it would be great for my super oily skin. Wrong!Pros:- 330 toffee matched my NC40 skin tone perfectly!- Looked nice immediately after I applied itCons- Not matte at all! It's not as dewy as regular foundations but it's not matte at all. Not even semi-matte.- Made my face look like one big oil slick after 30 minutes. I tried a finishing powder to no avail.- Transfers very easily- Catches on to uneven patches of skin. If your skin is baby smooth, expect this to highlight that fact- Claims to minimize pores. Wrong again! I have fairly large pools but this pooled in them and made them look like CRATERS!I had high hopes for this but if you don't like their previous Fit Me foundations then you probably won't like this one either.

"Infuser water bottle have become all the rage lately and have flooded the market. Not all of them are worth  it but this water infused bottle is top quality.

"Technically, growing a beard requires nothing more than a face, swarthy genes, and time. However, there are a few additional items you‚Äôll need to maximize your beard‚Äôs potential. Beard oil, for example, can keep your mane soft and help stave off unwelcome itchiness. A good beard oil is especially important during the winter months, when cold winds can make your beard brittle and your skin dry. You don‚Äôt want just any product, however; you want the best beard oil there is. That‚Äôs where Smooth Viking's beard oil comes in.Made with Avocado Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Moroccan Argan Oil, Olive Oil, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Castor Oil, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E and Pure Essential Oil. These oils moisturize and replenish damaged hair, smooth itchy skin below, and most importantly ( as the girlfriend of the guy that uses this) softens rough scratchy beards!The essential oils are subtle but there is a slight fragrance that I would describe as clean, woodsy, and mysterious. There's just enough so that when someone is close enough, they'll want to lean in and get a better sniff!Love how this has a glass dropper - makes this neat and easy even for those with butterfingers. It arrives gift packaged in a burlap drawstring bag with a hanging gift tag, making this the perfect gift for Father's Day.I did receive this product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIQJO0M71RCRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXIDW2G#wasThisHelpful","RIQJO0M71RCRR","A328G38HUWRLXJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A328G38HUWRLXJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a big tea drinker. At all. But I am a heavy alcohol drinker. Enough so that I figured I need something for those groggy, hungover Saturday mornings. I already take a Milk Thistle (great for the liver) but I wanted something else since my liver needs all the help it can get lol. I like the idea of this tea since I'm replenishing my body with fluids (most hangovers are just your body screaming that it's dehydrated). The dandelion root is supposed to help detox the liver. The addition of the hibiscus and cinnamon also are supposed to help with blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar and just about everything else that are common health problems. I steep one bag in a 16 oz mug for 5 minutes and gulp it down. For tea, this actually doesn't taste that bad. Doesn't taste great either but I don't like the majority of teas anyway.So, does this help with my hangovers? Yes!

"Probiotics are ‚Äúgood‚Äù bacteria that help keep your digestive system healthy by controlling growth of harmful bacteria. Prebiotics are carbohydrates that cannot be digested by the human body.

"This Tumi luggage is beautiful, functional, and durable.  I‚Äôm not sure what else anyone could want. I think James Bond would be happy using this bag.  Note:  This is a short trip bag, not a carry-on.1.  It‚Äôs extremely well made and very, very lightweight.  It‚Äôs recessed wheels and reinforced corners mean that this will be very durable, and it spins in 360 degree circles.  Love that!2. It has just the right amount of compartment separators and ""strap downs"" inside the bag to be extremely functional, but without all the silly gadgets you will never use.3.  It has a built in tracking device so if the bag ever gets lost you can recover it.  The Tumi Tracer Bag Recovery Program assures that your bag can be found. It requires that you register your bag online, which was easy and seamless.  You will receive a 20 digit unique code that is affixed permanently to the bag.  That number, along with your contact information is entered into their Tracer database after you register it with them, and used to help aid in the recovery of your bag should it get lost.  Yikes... who wants a lost bag!  Love this feature!4. It also has a TSA approved lock so only authorized employees can access your private possessions.This bag should last a long time and will function extremely well.  It is super stream lined and beautiful.  It is a bit pricy but if you travel a lot this bag can handle the pressure!  It also has a One Year Limited Warranty.  After that from year 2-5 you can take the bag to any Tumi store, or ship it to them for repair.  Most of the time for free.  This is a great company with a lot of integrity and will stand behind their products.

"I run a busy Recording Studio and own many microphone stands.  The best microphone stands are those that you can put up and take down easily as you are needing to change out your equipment for another record session.  This is why I give this product 5 stars. I love this Microphone Stand!  In a busy situation with lots of continual setup you need to save time.This Stand is a lot more solid than the $20-$30 microphone stands that are out there.... so it certainly worth the price.  Period.There are usually 5 spots on any Microphone Stand that are necessary to adjust for the right height to record an instrument.  When setting up a stand I start from the bottom and move up.  This stand has 6 adjustments!-The bottom adjustment on this stand has a soft and much larger adjustment twist clamp that works quite beautifully.  Most cheaper stands have a screw type adjustment that takes a ""ton"" of time to adjust.-The 2nd adjustment on this stand is a rubberized clutch handle that you only have to use one hand to adjust the top part of the stand.  Normally on other Stands to tighten this you will need two to four turns... with this handle one turn is -enough to test out the height.  The second turn tightens it perfectly.-The 3rd adjustment is the Boom part of the stand.  Again, to adjust this there is a nice rubber twist clamp instead of the screw type of clamp that takes ""forever"" to adjust.-The 4th, 5th and 6th adjustments are the final boom part of the stand which is the most important. There is a screw that easily adjusts to extend the arm out and then there are two other screws, (where there is normally only one more), one that tightens the boom all the way out where you need it, and then the last one that you can tighten AFTER you have used it to turn around and around to attach your clip or microphone mount.  This is truly why I love this stand!!!!I have also found it much easier to wrap my microphone cords around this stand, especially the boom part of the stand, and the bottom legs of the stand are solid and the base is MUCH bigger than cheaper stands.This stand is well built, super sturdy and I will order another one.  I will then use these two stands to record my upright piano and it is perfect!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROGO8E78W4MJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOSBS58#wasThisHelpful","ROGO8E78W4MJO","A2VDZ27CMLJVVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDZ27CMLJVVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a super soft and very well made Doll (Teaching Toy) called ""Kira."" It is part of a product line created by the well known Pop Star Singer ‚ÄúShakira‚Äù for her Barefoot Foundation to raise money for the impoverished areas in Latin America.  I like this Cat Doll.I recommend that before you start using it, make sure you adjust the sound control behind the velcro flaps in the back of the toy.  Open the flaps and remove it from of ""Demo"" mode, by moving the button to the middle selection of the 3 different modes.  This is soft mode, all the way down is loud mode, which you really don‚Äôt want.  This Learning Toy can be somewhat loud.Pressing the bottom of the left foot turns the device ON/OFF.  Make sure you do this to save on the batteries.  I did not see this until after I had the doll for a couple of weeks. Every time I moved it, it sang or giggled.  Turning it off is good and saves batteries.  It takes 3 AA batteries.Also, You must exchange the batteries the doll comes with.  The instructions say the included batteries are only for demonstration purposes only.  The batteries do work, and I exchanged them out, but didn‚Äôt see any difference with how the doll performed.The toy doesn't come with a very detailed instruction book, so I did a lot of guessing about how it would work. Here is what I came to.There are 4 Activation points on the doll.1. Pressing the left foot after (you turn it on) only makes the doll laugh, and turns the doll on and off.2. Pressing and HOLDING on the heart in the middle of the chest plays through ALL the songs.  I counted about 10 complete songs.3. Pressing the dolls right paw takes you through learning songs, like the ABCs that you can sing with, and this selection is instrumental music only.  There are about 4 songs here.4. Pressing the left paw are songs with lyrics.  The Doll giggles periodically after songs too.  There are about 4 songs on this paw.The songs do alternate between English and Spanish.  You can hear a sample of the voice of the doll on the top of this page.  It is a good sample of the vibe of the doll.It is marketed as bi-lingual but I don‚Äôt get a lot of that.  There are a few phrases but NOT a lot of Spanish.  I was expecting more.  But for a child under 5 years old, this is a great doll.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SYEUVH8URS2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ST80HO4#wasThisHelpful","R1SYEUVH8URS2Q","A2VDZ27CMLJVVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDZ27CMLJVVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a wonderful and very useful Car Trash Bag.  Here is what I LOVE about this product:This Bag closes COMPLETELY!  The top of the bag has a metal closure, which seamlessly bends to the other side, and then there is Velcro strip on the inside that you can press the bag closed completely.  There is nothing worse than having a Smelly Garbage Bag in your car with stuff sticking out and also smelling.  This assures that you will have a choice to close the bag so your car will not smell!  LOVE THAT!The Bag measures 14 inches high and10 inches wide and is really nice and big!!! You can put lots of BIG things inside here.  I was very surprised at how deceptively big it is, and even with how big it is, it actually  looks nice and small in my car.The Bag hangs over my headrest, and there is an elastic piece with a hook that hangs from the bottom of the bag so you can anchor or hook the bottom of the bag to the bottom of the front seat.  This is well thought out.  The bag now stays stationary and doesn't ""Swing around"" in my back seat.The material is strong and a neutral grey which looks really professional and clean.  Also, the bag is plastic lined on the inside.  So, I tested it by pouring a drink inside.  Wow!  It wipes out super easy and looks nice and clean.  There are also two black mesh pockets on the outside to put water bottles inside, or perhaps additional trash.This would be a fantastic Road Trip Bag because it is so big and will clean easily.And for the price, I just don't think you can go wrong with this product.

"These simple towels are just the Bomb!!!  There are 3 different textures that come in a package of 6 towels.  Soft, Scrub, Scour!-Soft.  The soft towels are for polishing and for use with drying.

"How often have you labeled something only to find that after a while..... you cannot read it?

"As a Recording Engineer I find Digital Audio Workstations (or DAW) can be somewhat difficult to review.  Why?  Because having used so many different types Workstations, (Pro Tools, Logic Pro, Ableton,Cubase GarageBand) and also having worked with many different Professional Sound Engineers, what I have learned is that each DAW, as well as each Engineer creates, and over time develops a personal ""work flow"" that is unique to many of the variables to their ultimate and unique vision with music.  It can also depend on what kind of music you are recording or mixing.  So, there are many variables to consider when spending a lot of money on a DAW.Here is what I found with this program.First you will have to download the software from the Internet and it will take a while.  I suggest that you use an Ethernet Cable instead of a Wireless  Connection for a more stable and faster download.  Expect the software to take at least a DAY to completely download.  This is not unusual.  I have spent this amount of time downloading quite a few DAWS.  That said, you don't HAVE to download EVERYTHING to get started.  You have the option of ""checking"" the items that you want to download.  To do that.... go to the Studio One Tab and check ""Studio One Installation.""  Here you can check only the additional items that you want to install and do it within your OWN time.What is different about this DAW?  Essentially the program ""looks"" the same as Logic and has the same interface ""feel"" with many of the same components as the other workstations.  It is really a personal preference in the end.  What I do like about this program is that there are a TON of loops and sounds that come with it.  This is why it takes so darn long to download.  And you can ""try"" this program for free.  You can download the professional Demo from their website too.  You don't get that with other DAWS.  Also, there are a TON of tutorials they provide, and their company and support tis GREAT!! Their website is very clear and user friendly.First thing I suggest you do when you open it is to go the VIEW tab and click on all the windows.  This will give you a good idea of what is available to you within the program.  If this is your first DAW, read the manuals.  A lot.  It takes a long time to understand how to record, edit, mix and master.  But, you can get going fairly quickly within this progam.If you are doing this as a hobby, then buy a Mac and use GarageBand first.  Then upgrade to Logic (which at the time of this review it is $200.)  If you are working to be a professional recording engineer then go straight to Pro Tools and learn that.... because in most Recording Studios that is the Industry standard.  Then try out these different DAWS and decide if you like the interface. I like this interface but it is fairly standard, and of course you may love it.  I would try the FREE version first before you decide to buy this.  Again, Recording Engineers are like Artists, it is important to find the program that best suits you visually and that you can develop a good ""work flow"" within.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GOQ73PS4IOLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XOPKPMQ#wasThisHelpful","R1GOQ73PS4IOLR","A2VDZ27CMLJVVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDZ27CMLJVVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very compact and beautiful little shaver!!  It completely fits in the palm of my hand.  See Photo.This shaver is 4 inches in length and is really well made.  It feels heavy in my hand even though it is so small.  It comes with a plastic protective cap that goes over the top to protect the wet/dry blades.  See Photo.Even though this is for men, I have used it on my legs and it works great.  It is a smooth and seamless shave for me, and my boyfriend loves it!  This is also great little Shaver for TRAVEL.  It uses two AA Batteries and you put the batteries in the bottom of the shaver.  Turn the bottom to the left and the bottom pops off to expose the battery well.Great job Panasonic!

"I wish I could just not give this 0 stars because this watch is now worthless...  please read my review....  When I received the watch I was very, very impressed by the beautiful packaging, and the instruction guide.  I was not expecting my next experience.This is a very LARGE woman's watch.  I took it to my local watch repair man to have the links taken out so that it would fit my wrist.  (Yes, I have a very tiny wrist and am used to this). The repair man took out the all the links he could and it still would not fit.  Yikes!!!  Really??  I have other watches that I have done this too. He tried adjusting it.... but alas... It was still too big.  Do not buy this watch if you have small wrists... but read on... there is more....Then I asked the watch repairman to please set the time for me, if he could.  He said, ""Well, I wish I could but... this watch is actually broken.  It will not set, the pin just spins around and around.  I am so sorry, maybe you can return it and get your money back.""  Having gotten this product through Amazon Vine, this watch is a product that I receive in exchange for compensation for using and reviewing it.  Now I cannot review it.. sigh...  but that is not all.... there is more...I told the watch repairman that I was receiving the watch in compensation for reviewing it on Amazon.  He then said, and I quote, ""These are the worst watches on the market.  The company has terrible support.  They are always getting sued by everyone.  The parts are made in China, the parts are NOT Swiss made, but they will say they are... and the company is a bunch of crooks.""  My mouth dropped open..  What?  Really?  He was fairly adamant about HIS review. And who am I not to trust someone who works with watches everyday?  But I am not one to ""dog"" a company when I have not actually had a bad experience..... so....Needless to say, I now have this watch and wish I could return it.  So, I looked inside the directions to see what THAT process is.There is a 1 year warranty on this watch.  You must register the watch on their website, To return the watch for repair, you must send it, along with your copy of you original purchase invoice and a check payable to Invicta Watch in the amount of $28 to cover the cost of shipping, or you can pay that fee on their website for the service order to get started.  This is  for all watches.  And then you must wait 90 days for them to fix the watch...  What?I am super frustrated with this watch.  I don't think I will pay to send it to them quite yet to have them fix it.  It doesn't fit in the first place so I am going to put it away.  I can't imagine that anyone would want to pay another $28 to have a watch fixed that they only bought 4 days ago??Egads...  Save your money.  Buy a watch locally.  And don't buy Invictas.  They seem like a big headache when they don't work.Oh, they do have a phone number you can call from 9-5 EST.  I will do that and report back.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF0Y2THTLK4KH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011N5OW1I#wasThisHelpful","RF0Y2THTLK4KH","A2VDZ27CMLJVVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDZ27CMLJVVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are a lot of Computer Sleeves out there, and I was very unimpressed when I got this one.  But it all depends on what you are looking for, and what you want.  This is a piece of Neoprene with a zipper.  Thats it.For the price I think you could find something else that would help you to feel more confident with protection of your computer.. I might pay $10 for this, but certainly not $20.This is not padded.. It is ONE layer of Neoprene.  Really?  Why no padding?  There are no pockets.  What?  Why no pockets?

"This is a great case!  Sturdy, Strong and very, very Durable. The construction on the case is really well done.  It has a handle on the outside for carrying and I can fit a few files in it as well.I use it on mu older MacBook Pro 15 inch Laptop which runs Lion software (5years old) and it holds it perfectly and very securely.  The outer case is super hard and I feel confident putting it inside a bag that is more lightweight and made of fabric.  Makes sense that my Computer is in a hard shell and my bag is in fabric.  Love that.I tried it on my newer MacBook Pro Laptop (3 years old)  and it does not fit at all. Bummed about that.  But I know this is specifically made for Chrome Books, so I wasn't expecting it to fit.What I don't like about this case is that there is no bag on the outside to put cords etc.  That would have made it  a Five star product for me.  But I feel confident that my laptop computer is safe and protected. That is what is great about this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R184VV7IWFOCH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVZPTOU#wasThisHelpful","R184VV7IWFOCH9","A2VDZ27CMLJVVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDZ27CMLJVVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As with most Memoirs, this book is about a young woman and her early life story of the tragedy of being raped and the growth after that tragedy. The basic premise is about how she moves out into the world from her very safe and idyllic town of Newton, Massachusetts and into the world.  She writes that she has an overprotective family, two accomplished parents and grew up with plenty of money.  She was also the baby in her family.After her second night of college she is raped.  Devastated she decides to hike the Pacific Crest Trail across California, Oregon and Washington.  From there she describes her trek across the Trail and all the people she meets along the way.I wish I could give this book a better review, but in some parts it reads like a journal, and then there are places where I felt an editor had tried to come in and cleaned it up a bit....  I have to say that Aspen does have some potential writing ability, but I just could not ""get into"" the story.  It felt a bit ""all over the place"" and I was not sure of her point.  Even at the end I felt a bit confused. Yes, there is some growth on her trail, but I guess I wanted more.  That said, I just found myself not wanting to finish it.There is some good information about the PCT, and if you are interested in that I suggest you read this book.  This book comes out after the best seller ""Wild"" which was written by Cheryl Strayed.  That book is an amazing and incredible read with layers of psychological and spiritual wisdom.....  It was hard to not keep thinking about how amazing THAT book was when I was reading this book.  So, maybe I was not the best reviewer for this book.  It lacked some depth for me and I think that is just the authors lack of experience and overprotected childhood.I did give it a chance, and if I am being honest it was a struggle for me to read it.  That said, I am just one person's opinion and you may love this book.  Give it a chance.  The writing is good, not great.  You may find something of interest too, especially if you are thinking of walking the Pacific Coast Trail.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8NNY0X8UIB3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062291068#wasThisHelpful","R8NNY0X8UIB3N","A2VDZ27CMLJVVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDZ27CMLJVVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I use 2 sets of speaker with it to switch back and forth to listen to the sound quality.  The dim switch is great for automatically lowering the music in my room when talking to a client, but still having the music on.  Its super easy to use and I love it!!The setup was SO easy that I could hardly believe it.  There are 4 headphone plugins that you can use for mixing.  LOVE THAT!!!

"This is a very well made piece of furniture that you must assemble yourself.  It took me about 40 minutes to put the entire piece together, and the finished product is quite beautiful.  This is NOT your local office (press board) store product, so you will be getting a lot MORE for you money.  It is a piece of furniture that is sturdy and well made.Having assembled a lot of furniture I was ready for about an hours worth of work.  The directions were ok.  There are NO written directions on how to assemble it, only PICTURES. So if you have not assembled furniture before the directions might be challenging.  But ON EACH PAGE of the directions, there is a phone number to call if you get stuck.  They encourage you to call if YOU DO get stuck.  You must study the pictures carefully and understand all the parts before you begin.  Each part is well marked.  In fact each part has both letter AND a number identifying it.  Just in case you get confused, the booklet that comes with the product is fairly clear.  The directions also tell you if you may need an assistant on a certain step.The cubbies are a nice size.  Actually BIGGER then most cubby type furniture.  The wood is a nice mocha brown color that will look nice in any room. I highly recommend this beautiful piece of furniture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSY4SINUCKWCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DWWARK6#wasThisHelpful","RSY4SINUCKWCH","A2VDZ27CMLJVVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDZ27CMLJVVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This seems like a good iron.  Its nice looking and works fine.Here are the Pros:Made by Black and Decker. They stand by their products and this one is made true to that standard.Gets really hot!  LOTS and LOTS of steam.  If you are looking for an Iron that produces steam, this is for you!!!!  My Rowena Iron does NOT put out this much steam, at all!!!The place that you add water, on the top of the product is super easy to open and REALLY easy to add water to. The well that holds the water is see-through so you always know if there is water in there, and how much you will need to refill. The buttons that you press are big and right by your thumb.My Iron has two big buttons, not shown in the product picture. Water shoots onto the fabric with the right button, and steam shoots out the left button.  These work great and are right at your ""thumb-tips""I have a Rowena Iron that I bought for $100, this has all the same features and is half the price.Automatically shuts off.  Love that!Here are the Cons:I was super amazed at how hot this iron got.  BE really careful with this.  I burned the first t-shirt that I tried with it, and had to scrub the fabric off the front plate.  I was a bit shocked by that.It gives off  a LOT of steam and you can get really HOT while ironing.  Its heavier than my other Iron.  That can be a bummer for some people.  I didn't mind that too much.  My housekeeper didn't like these two things and likes my other iron better because of this.Overall I love this Iron because it gives off a lot of steam.  When I need steam FAST I will use this baby!!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26ZFEIW9ZWOT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5ILD0K#wasThisHelpful","R26ZFEIW9ZWOT4","A2VDZ27CMLJVVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDZ27CMLJVVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rising Strong is both relevant and informative.  Brene Brown has proven (once again) with her newest book that she is committed to providing information that will actually help and heal those of us who are interested in doing the REAL work.  This book comes after having received a lot of success with her book, ""Daring Greatly.""  Which is .... by the way...  a great book.....  And I Dare to say for sure..... this book is her BEST book yet.  I have numerous pages marked because I want to go back and glean more deeply the concepts that she brings to light in this wonderful read.I liked Daring Greatly.......I LOVE Rising Strong.  Rising Strong is for those individuals who want to know what their REAL work is. Through personal stories within her own life, as well as stories from those she has interviewed with her research, this book provides a TON of Grist for the mill!!  Plowing through our own stories, getting UP after YOU FALL is what this book will help you to do.This book is honest, courageous, brilliantly written, and a book that has opened ME up.....  I will read it again.  And again.  You are going to stumble and fall in life.  Period.  This book helps to bring light to what you will need to do AFTER that happens.  And it will.  It brings light to those of us who WANT to stand up. Who HAVE to stand up.  And this book helps to convey HOW to do that.  How to HELP yourself and see what your STORY is, and how you can change it.As a Spiritual Counselor, I am always looking for books that I can refer to my clients.  This book I have already referred numerous times within my practice.  There are a lot of Self-Help books out there...... most of the time they are very dry, and without any wisdom or ability to emotional present the material in a succinct and grounded way.  This book does all that, and you will want to give it away and tell others about it.Bravo Brene.  I salute your ability to cohesively and coherently broach a subject that is both sensitive and extremely needed in our world.  You are a new hero of mine.  Thank you for writing this fabulous book!ADDITIONAL NOTE ON MY REVIEW .....  I work to write my ""Vine Reviews"" from my Heart.  After posting this review, I noticed that someone checked that it was ""not helpful.""  The Fabulous Irony here is that after reading THIS BOOK I now get to ""check in"" and see whether ""I"" thought my review was helpful and look to what triggers of shame I may have with my authenticity about writing reviews.  I did just that.  My review stands.I loved this book and think that everyone who wants to RISE STRONG should read this book. Brene teaches reality checking.  She also helps you to work on practicing critical awareness and rethinking expectations that tell us what being imperfect means.  In our world of ""likes"" and ""helpful"" or ""not-helpful"" votes her book will help you to conquer the fears you may have of putting yourself out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U7NY8BE7ECL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812995821#wasThisHelpful","R1U7NY8BE7ECL0","A2VDZ27CMLJVVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDZ27CMLJVVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the absolute bomb!  I am a Recording Engineer and wear a lot of headphones.  These are very, very comfortable!!!!! They are extremely compact and definitely noise canceling.  You wouldn't think by just looking at them that they would work to cancel out all noise but when I put them on, my jaw dropped.  I took them off and looked at them.  Put them back on, and was like, Wow!!!  I couldn't hear a sound!!!Then when I plug them into my computer and put music on..... Double WOW!!  There is a strong bass sound that comes through these that I can feel in my head.  The music sounds warm and beautiful.  And my husband has had to come over and tap me on the shoulder when I have them on.  I like to work a lot with headphones on, and these are now my go-to for that!CONSIf you have smaller ears, (like me) they fit exactly over my ears, so if you have a larger ear size, these might not work for you.  I wish the cord was a little longer too.  The cord measures 4 feet long, but feels a bit short for me.  I had to buy an extension for using them at my computer.PROSGreat sound.  Very comfortable.  Extremely NOISE canceling. I plug them into my IPhone and can use them to talk.  There is a microphone on the cord that you press to talk on. They come with a nice bag that you can carry them in.  The bag is a soft material that feels luxurious.Great Headphones, and for the price.......  Well, if you are looking for compact, these are great.  Bigger headphones may sound better, but then, how will you travel with them.  If you want compact, great sounding headphones you will get what you pay for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EOF4ISGHKOZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3A0LRS#wasThisHelpful","R1EOF4ISGHKOZ9","A2VDZ27CMLJVVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDZ27CMLJVVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, this is a very high quality bike rack, and perfect for the wall of my man cave.  It's just to the right of my flat screen TV, so I can remotely turn the light on occasionally while watching a game with my friends, just to bust their chops.I have no real complaints about the rack itself, but have a couple recommendations:1. Drill a pilot hole for your screws, since I pretty much stripped them putting them into the stud without a pilot hole.2. Be careful putting the batteries into the light.  The instructions don't really tell you how to do it and I can see how someone might damage the light by thinking it's velcro'd on there.Basically, snap off the light from the plastic base.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TBRCCK3KULXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NCJPXEO#wasThisHelpful","R3TBRCCK3KULXD","A2VDZ27CMLJVVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDZ27CMLJVVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:24 Mins Holy Moly!  These are AWESOME!!!  I do a lot of gardening and have been looking for pruning shears that are really easy on my hands.  These pruning shears cut through some of the thickest branches in my garden!!!  I was like, ""WHAT?""What is so darn awesome is that the main gear that operates the entire mechanism rotates out and has a cam mechanism unlike I have seen in any type of pruner I have ever used!  Being a girl, sometimes I wish I was a bit stronger to cut some of the bigger branches in my garden.But I tried these out, and I was like, ""Whoa!!!""  What?  I didn't have to squeeze harder on the handle, they just cut!  The cam mechanism rotates on the left side of the sheers if you are cutting the branches with your right hand,  so I could see as one reviewer mentioned that if you are using your left hand to cut, the mechanism could actually get in your way.  Check this out on my video!  So these are for right handed folks... not left.The engineering design is so simple and so brilliant!!  Wow!

"A Good Memoir.  Not Great, but Good!  I didn't really ""get into it"" until about the middle of the book.  I kept waiting for it to get better.... it did toward the middle.What I liked about the book was that Jamie's voice is definitely his own.  He seems sweet, and innocent ... but having the type of mother that he had was hard. Which is most of what this book is about.  And also his alcoholism. Alcoholism is a tough road, and much of the book focuses on his addiction and the strong connection his addiction had to a lot of his choices, and also to his mother.  He is also gay, and that factors into the storytelling too. Some of the stories are interesting.... but at the end of the book I felt for Jamie.  Life is hard when you have the kind of mother she did.This is a good read, but I have to be honest that the praise on the cover made me anticipate more than what I got.  That is unfortunate because I did like the book. But I did not love it.  Sigh.  It wasn't the book that in the morning I run over to read every day.  In fact, I was wondering why I wasn't doing that... there was so much praise for this book on the cover.I have read a lot of books that make me jump up and want to read them...  And yes, I've read ALL of Augusten Burroughs books.... he's fantastic.  Brilliant actually. I would warn new Authors not to compare themselves to highly with really well known authors.

"This product is numbered from 1-8 on the bottom of the tabs.  The tabs are shiny and well made. They are a nice weight too... Not too heavy of paper, and not too light so you don't feel like you just bought paper.These dividers fit into a folder with  metal claps on both the right and left side of the folder.  NOTE::  The folder does NOT come with the product when you buy the dividers.  You have to buy Folders separately.Since I already use the folders with metal holders at the top in my client practice these are great.... I use this particular divider for the days of the week.  I put Mondays projects in 1, Tuesdays in 2, Wednesdays in 3 etc.  Number 8 I use for my ""To Do"" list.I am sure if you are into research these dividers would be fantastic.  The numbers are clear and easy to read.  But this is a very specific product.  You could put tabs on the bottom over the numbers and write on the tabs what you want...  that is probably what I will do.  Numbers are not really my way of organizing.  But this is a good quality product .... and for the price it ROCKS!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XP0XMD6QIRV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFWC2SK#wasThisHelpful","R2XP0XMD6QIRV0","A2VDZ27CMLJVVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDZ27CMLJVVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an office product that I wish I had a while ago.  I am a big ""To Do"" list person and I use the wire type folders for clients that these dividers work with.... so these dividers are great.  There are 8 tabs, and the fact that you can add MORE to each individual folder works really great for me!I did tried to write on the tabs with a pencil.  But I don't like how ""light"" the writing of the pencil is.  Then I tried to  ""wipe it off"" as they say it can do. It does wipe off really great.  If you are a person who needs to change the tabs all the time, these will work great for you!!!But, the pencil is not very ""stand out"" so I don't use a pencil on the Tabs now.  Then I tried to use a pen on the tabs  but it wipes off too easily ......  So now I use ""Note Tabs"" that I can pull off when I want to change the label. And the tabs are certainly big enough to put those on.I love the versatility of these dividers.  The price is a ""little"" steep for me but I do like the product.

"This is the easiest way to take your Blood Pressure!  Wow!! Wow!! Wow!!This product comes wonderfully packaged and containing a beautiful unit that is 6 1/2 inches tall by 4 1/2 inches wide. It includes an arm cuff that you plug easily into the base and there are two settings on the base for two separate daily measurements. You can either use 4 AA batteries to run it (which are NOT included), or plug it directly into the wall.  It has a date setting too.It took me 5 minutes to figure out the product.  And that is truly because the instructions are amazing.  They are 4 steps you have to take and you are done!What I love is that you the can store two separate measurements in the device and have a daily reading and history of your readings.  There is also a heart rate indicator that tells you what your heart rate is.  That is pretty cool.The simplicity of this device is astounding to me.  I tried it on my husband, and he said the only issue he had was the ""bossy"" assistant who guided him through the process.  That would be me.  Its fun to know what your heart rate and blood pressure are.

"A good memoir with lots of detail and depth.  And a story about the struggle to ""fit in"" as a young woman.  It is also a daddy and daughter story that details and documents that struggle and the desire for a young woman to want to please herself while being somewhat emotional dependent on a nonexistent relationship with her absent father.I did enjoy this book. But I don't think it is for everyone.  Many young woman will find its pages relevant to their own lives, but many may not deeply understand why Sarah shared her emotional story.For me,  it was like picking up Sarah's journal on her bedside table and reading the intimate pages beneath.  I like to read about other's lives and found this enjoyable and interesting.  For me it was is a ruggedly honest story which recounts a very unconventional upbringing and also the intense desire to have a father in her life.I felt for Sarah's loneliness and disappointing relationship with her father, but I think that relationship molds her into a strong woman with no need to have a father as part of her ultimate construct which makes her a very unique individual.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EILL9B5ICD0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476748969#wasThisHelpful","R1EILL9B5ICD0H","A2VDZ27CMLJVVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDZ27CMLJVVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Dubs ear plugs are very comfortable and do seem to create a nice balance between hearing nothing... and not hearingeverything.  They have a noise reduction rating of 12, which cuts the voice a bit.  It really does seem that they allow things (like voices) to be heard more clearly than the rest of the surrounding noises.I wear earplugs when I study, and these seem just about perfect for the job of not being distracted by outside sounds.I have not yet tried them at a concert or on an airplane yet. But I have used them in my office with noise going on outside and they really cut that outside sound pretty well.  If that is what you are getting them for - then this is a great price for that.They do not work as well as my $300 pair of noise canceling headphones, but they are hidden well in your ears without having a big headset on your head, and that I like!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YP4V21CNZ2UY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NW1IZ5Q#wasThisHelpful","R2YP4V21CNZ2UY","A2VDZ27CMLJVVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VDZ27CMLJVVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I will be the first to admit that I am lazy when it comes to grilling, I grill then shut off grill and walk away to eat, the next time I clean my grill is often the next time I need to grill.  So this means whatever I was grilling usually ends up burnt and fused with the grill itself so I need some intense harsh metal cleaning brushes to scrape my grill clean.  This Anear Grill brush is very abrasive and has a very large surface, so it can scrub a grill well.  It works even better when the grill is on for a few min and hot, scraping old residue off with ease.  I like the long handle, my previous grill brush was too short and my hands almost burned a little while trying to clean the grill.The included basting brush is your average silcone basting brush, it is nice but I always found that thinner liquids don't adhere too well to silicone basting brushes, perfect for thicker sauces and spreading that last bit of marinade, but thinner sauces not as much.  Still when basting over a hot grill you can't afford to use a real brush or it may catch fire, so the basting brush is nice.  Now, I baste while it is on the grill, I wish the basting brush had a longer handle or extending handle so you can more easily baste the top parts of meat while they are grilling in back of grill, the brush handle is a little short but it works fine.Disclaimer:  Innoo did send me the Grill Brush and Basting Brush to do a thorough and accurate review, all opinions are 100% mine and mine alone.

The single fan though large just doesn't seem to move a ton of airflow though, it is fair but I have had better airflow from triple and quadruple smaller fans vs the 1 larger fan.  It would have been nicer if they made an identical frame model with higher number of fans or faster speed for better airflow.I also wish the 4 USB ports were USB 3.0 and not USB 2.0, some devices won't work in the USB hub in the laptop cooling pad, mouse works fine, but my USB headset won't work from the Laptop cooling pad ports for example.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36KB94CP547B1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STPOLIA#wasThisHelpful","R36KB94CP547B1","A16JT7E5121OAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16JT7E5121OAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 9:44 Mins In my video I show opening the case, and installing it on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9"" model, it installs in seconds, provides protection on all sides front and back, and the hard shell cover protects the screen when you put it in a bag and acts as a stand too.  The only thing I would include is they could have added a tablet screen wipe so you can clean your screen before applying the protective case, but that is a minor detail.  I also would have loved a hand strap on the back so you can insert your hand and hold the Kindle with one hand easily but only a few cases have this feature.

" 3:36 Mins The Symmetry case is your lower level of cases that provide minor protection but more style/cosmetic appearance matching for your iPhone 6 Plus, they don't include a screen protector so highly recommended you get their specific Alpha Glass screen protector because regular screen protectors won't be cut to match the Symmetry case the way their own protectors do.  The protection is average, but it does have better and less slippery grip than other iPhone 6 Plus cases I have tested.

"May have been nice in theory, but terrible in practice as suction cups don't hold onto plastic laptop bottoms, therefore it falls off and is completely nonfunctional. The rubberized vent grasps are all warped and misshapen, it may have worked ,but because it couldn't affix to any laptop that has plastic bottom it was completely non-functional.  They should use some sort of adhesive instead of suction cups to adhere the thing to the bottom of a laptop, maybe some sort of locking clasp to side of laptop instead.  When plugged in it appeared to draw a fair amount of air, and I have no doubt it may have been a good product had it worked in installing and staying put on a laptop.

"Yes, they are super bright and much brighter than you would think from LED, but the LED is little tiny bulbs on a flat board, it is direct mini beams of light right into your face, single direction.  It really could have used a little ""hood"" or mechanism to helps soften the direct light or make it a slightly wider area of projection.  My kids used this to record gaming videos at night where their faces were lit up, but the shorter arm length means you can't really optimize the light to be high above the laptop screen, and ends up being at eye level shining the light beam right in your eyes.  If you tilt to where the light is up or down, it brightens keys fine, but the light is very ""single direction"" specific so if you face it up or down, it won't brighten your face much.  It could have used a dome or globe to help distribute the light more evenly and avoid directly pointing it at your face, or perhaps longer cord and clip or something to help it go above your laptop lid.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJAFIYPOR40MI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PAA1EFK#wasThisHelpful","RJAFIYPOR40MI","A16JT7E5121OAB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16JT7E5121OAB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great contrast and a market-busting price, along with a software update that largely fixes its video processing woes, help make the Vizio P series one of the best value 4K's available, but it's worth comparing to this model here: http://amzn.to/1REavT9 to ensure you are future proofing yourself once 4K content is rolled out across all mediums.THE GOOD:Vizio P series delivers 4K resolution for significantly less than other major brand TVs.

"This book wraps around you like a warm blanket on a cold day.  I loved it!  It was gentle and lulling and full of warmth.I love that this book was based on actual events of a village in Wales.  It may seem like a relatively small event in the whole historical scheme of things, but for this one village it was the largest, hardest thing in their history.  They literally had to pack up and move their whole village.  Can you imagine?Gwen is a sweet, gentle creature.  She has never had the praise and emotional building up that children and teens crave as she was raised by a no nonsense aunt who was more prone to criticize with a sharp tongue.  Gwen is lonely and a more solitary creature, especially after her brother leaves to follow his dream of adventure on the seas.  She is intelligent and artistic and spends many hours drawing and thinking.I loved the gentle progression of events in this book.  It was like I sat in the pocket of the story while the events unfolded all around me.  You really get a deep sense of community as the villagers come together to support and help each other, especially in times of need.  It all felt so real and well defined to me.  So well done.  I really loved this book!Content:  Clean.

"This is a novella and it doesn't take much time to read.  If you are in the mood for a quick romance set around Christmas, this might perfect for you.This book doesn't have the typical romantic feel to it.  This one is more melancholy and even a bit sad as you get to know Henry a little bit.  He lives a sort of pathetic life where he works as a security guard at night so he can spend time with a painting of a woman he is obsessed with.  He has no real life outside his work and the art he creates at home when he is not at work.  He is middle aged, never married and isolates himself from everyone in the world, with one exception.  See?  Sort of pathetic.  And sad.Oh, I just realized that the feel of this book, the melancholy emotion and single focus on a painted woman in the past sort of reminds me of Somewhere in Time.  Yeah, it really had that sort of feel to me.I liked the ending.  It was a bit surprising and yes, romantic.  It was an interesting diversion from the usual holiday romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMM0R079VFBJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHWQHYS#wasThisHelpful","RMM0R079VFBJY","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was just before bed and I had just finished reading a book.

So, I had a light bulb moment and remembered that I had just been sent this little gem of a short story.  It was perfect for those last few ""me"" moments before heading to bed.An Unexpected Proposal is part of an ongoing short story series.

She doesn't want him so far away but she also doesn't want to leave her favorite place to live.These short stories remind me of little pieces of chocolate.

"A Healing Heart is what I would summarize as a YA clean romance.  It is simplistic in delivery and told in the first person from multiple points of view.  I would say that the overall feel of the book would lend itself to be on the younger side of the YA range.Bailey is a character you cannot help but have sympathy for.  She has suffered greatly in her young years and lost much.  As a reader, I could see growth in Bailey and that is always important.  Bailey really is on a journey of healing in so many ways.I liked this book but I never really had that emotional connection to the characters.  It felt more like telling the whole time.  We did this and then we went here and then I did this and so on.  First person can be tricky that way, I think.  The book felt a little long to me but as I said before, I did like it.Content:  Some instances of mild swearing.

"This book started out with a well thought out and executed escape.  It had me interested and excited about where this book was going.  Then it just dropped off.  Everything slowed down to a snail's pace and I was so frustrated!  So my advice to anyone reading this book is expect a cozy mystery with a slow moving plot set in a small southern town.I've read lots of other books by this author and many of them set with these same characters.  The older women in this book have made appearances in the other Haggerty books so in a way it was like visiting with old friends.  I really liked Mac.Presley's story starts off with a bang and then fizzles as she gets to Haggerty.  Her back story comes in little bits as she and the other residents get caught up in the mystery surrounding a human skeleton found in her aunt's backyard.  Of course things pick up toward the end, the gaps are filled in and the whole story breaks loose, but it takes some patience to get there.This book is a clean, cozy mystery.  It is big on southern charm and quirky characters.  Small towns know how to rally around their own and that is exactly what the characters in this book do.  It has all sorts of feel good things going on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12E4501SGFBDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017HTVFYQ#wasThisHelpful","R12E4501SGFBDS","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book was just full of all the elements that make up a great story.  The characters were well defined and I really felt like I knew them.  The places and events were so clear in my head and I could easily imagine everything playing out like a movie in my head.Rosamund is a sweet and gentle young lady.  She has been treated poorly most of her life by her distant relatives whom she has lived with since her parents died.  This part of the story has a very distinct Cinderella type feel to it with an aunt who can't stand her and cousins who treat her cruelly and spitefully.  But then Rosamund has the opportunity to help a neighbor and it seems an answer to her prayers.The next part of the story has more of a Beauty and the Beast feel to it as Rosamund tries her best to bring Aubrey back from the brink of death.  Aubrey is depressed and has lost his will to live.  Slowly but surely Rosamund coaxes Aubrey back into the land of the living despite his cruel words and temper tantrums.  Somewhere during Aubrey's transformation, Rosamund finds herself in love with him but is sure that he will never be able to love her back for she is so far beneath his station.I really enjoyed the growing relationship between Rosamund and Aubrey.  The transformations for them- together and separately- as they both grow stronger and fight to find their way.  The ending was fairy tale worthy and made all the struggle to get there worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H85WLRS48N4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013F08MP6#wasThisHelpful","R1H85WLRS48N4O","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Happy Release Day to this new book by Lara Van Hulzen!  ""Rescue Me"" is the third book in the Men of Honor series.  I don't think you need to read the other books to follow this one but I think it would help enhance your reading experience to have some back story on the characters.  Besides, if you haven't read the first two books, you are missing out!  This is such a fun series and I have loved reading every book.Keith and Torie are both such strong characters yet there is a vulnerability to them as well.  Both have been hurt and betrayed, each carry secrets.  I really loved how well Keith and Torie were matched- physically and emotionally.  Torie is a police officer and she is tough stuff.  She knows how to protect and serve other people.  Keith is a marine.  He's been through more than he can say.  He is also a physically strong and dominating presence.  He knows how to protect and serve others as well.  There was something so satisfying in seeing two equally matched, strong individuals coming together in a give and take situation.  I loved it.The pacing of this book felt good, the characters were real and easy to relate to.  I felt like I knew them myself.  As the secrets unfolded, my anticipation increased.  I was compelled to keep reading until I had finished the book.  Yeah, not much else got done that day.  :)This book does have some Christian elements to it, but I would call it more inspirational than Christian fiction.  There was some mild swearing but was otherwise clean.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DUDUXIG4TCL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013S2B4MO#wasThisHelpful","R2DUDUXIG4TCL6","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so super-dee-dooper excited that one of my fave's in the writing world dipped her foot into the YA genre!  Yay!  This YA novella tells me that she should do more than dip, she should immerse.I think the two words I would use for this novella are ""so cute"".  From the cover to the sweet story inside, cuteness is everywhere.Kylie is one of many teenage daughters in her family.  She often feels lost in the shuffle of everyone else.  Her teenage insecurities shine through- spot on.  The whole anxiety about getting asked to a school dance and watching everyone else be asked?  Yeah, that has happened in my house on more than one occasion.  I felt like I was reading a story about my daughter!Kimberly Krey nails the whole thing because Kylie's voice is perfect.  I loved Kylie and I loved Kole.  What a sweet, sweet story.  It made me smile.And now Kimberly Krey has starting something.

"This book had so many elements that I just love.  I was really looking forward to reading this book and it definitely did not disappoint.Fatal Exchange is the third book in this Christy series.  Christy is a spy and a good one at that.  I love her spy team because they are so fiercely loyal to each other.  They are friends and they look out for each other one hundred percent.The pacing of this book is fantastic.  It was fast and I felt like I was on a fantastic ride where I hold on for dear life with a smile on my face the whole time.  There is danger and suspense almost around every turn.  It was great fun.There is some light romance, but it isn't a main focal point in the book until toward the end.  I think this book probably could stand alone, but I would recommend reading the whole series because that is really how you get to know the characters.  I'm sure this book wouldn't have been so good to me if I hadn't been following the series and had that connection to the characters with the background of knowledge that comes with it.This is, by far, my favorite series from Cindy Hogan.  She has found her groove with these books and I am a fan.Content:  Clean- no swearing or sexual content beyond some kissing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WFTJDSRTXH96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CYHHD6#wasThisHelpful","R2WFTJDSRTXH96","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the final book in this Unveiled series and I'm very, very happy to be at a conclusion and resolution for Emma and Riley.  The road to happiness has been long and hard for them both as they've grown, made choices, and fought to stay together.In this book, even more real life problems face Emma and Riley.  I liked the feel of this book as Emma and Riley face more of the difficulties together instead of apart.  They became a better support to each other.  Riley has finally reached his limits with being far away.  He finally put his foot down and headed back to Emma so they could be there for each other.  I liked his determination to figure things out while together instead of apart.  Their relationship was the most important thing to him.  That is what changed the tides of the book for me.  That was the moment that Riley became a grown up to me.  He wasn't sacrificing his music career, he was just finding a way to make it work within his relationship with Emma.I have enjoyed this series and the journey of Emma and Riley from the first meeting, through the bumps of their relationship and now to the end here, which is really just the beginning.  It's been a good ride, filled with emotion and real life drama.  I love that this series is clean- no swearing or sexual content beyond kissing.  It is now time to say goodbye to Emma and Riley but I do so with satisfaction and contentment.  :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PQME95T7H02U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014MM5A06#wasThisHelpful","R2PQME95T7H02U","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's sometimes hit or miss for me in these Year of Weddings novellas but I knew that this one would be a hit (or at least I had high hopes!) because it was by Becky Wade and I love her.  I knew I had to read this one.Holly and Josh.  Josh and Holly.  In love but then she dumps him unexpectedly.  He is angry, she is sad.  Years later they cross paths again and the sparks are still there but so are the hurts.  It's not a new idea for a book but I it felt fresh to me.  The characters were real and driven by real emotions.  I liked Holly and Josh.  I liked their story and I liked the re-connection journey.  It was a sweet romance.Today is release day for Love in the Details!  You can pick it up and read it today.  :)  My thanks to the publisher, Zondervan, for allowing me to read and review for them.  And also my thank to the author who let me jump on board her review team for this novella.I said above that I just love Becky Wade.  The Porter Family Series is one of my all time favorites!

"I just love novella collections.  Especially ones revolving around a certain theme- like this one.  This collection is perfect for the month of October.  Here you get five different stories from five different authors but each one revolves around castles and/or ghosts.  It's the perfect Halloween treat!  Read them one after another without stopping or breathing (Ha, just kidding.  You must breathe.) Or, read them one per sitting, whenever you have time.  That is the joy of anthologies.This time around I slipped one in at a time.  It was better for me with the whole ghost theme.  I'm not really a fan of ghost stories, even the tame and sweeter kind, so for me one at a time was perfect.  Not every story has a ghost, but every one has a sweet romance.  That's the part that I really love.  Each story is unique and different.  So much fun!Content:  Clean- some kissing","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V6WOIBBB6W3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153LE9KW#wasThisHelpful","R1V6WOIBBB6W3D","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The pictures in this book are sweet and full of peace and love.  The world can be such a hard and cruel place some days but our homes can be our refuge.  We can make our homes a place where love prevails.  This book does a fabulous job of reminding us how.  As we work together, pray together, learn together and play together, our families and our homes become stronger.This book has a music album that goes along with it.  Jenny Oaks Baker is an amazing violinist and her music just makes me feel.  The violin is such a beautiful instrument.  I love the track list on this album.  This music is so soothing and peaceful and so, so beautiful.  My favorite was Jesus Once Was a Little Child, I think.The world needs all the beauty it can get and this music and this book (together or separately) definitely add to the good things of the world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CGMH02WCK3JL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629720992#wasThisHelpful","R3CGMH02WCK3JL","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm just going to start this review by saying this was the perfect holiday romance book.  I really loved it.  I'm pretty sure it should be a Hallmark show.Ruby starts out the book expecting a proposal from her boyfriend.  She is fully focused on doing whatever it takes to make this happen and so comes off in the beginning rather self centered and snotty.  Maybe to some extent, she is.  When Ruby's mother gives her an assignment right before Christmas it is both an answer to her prayers, and a nightmare.I loved North even with his problems because that's how most of us usually come.  He has a kind heart.  Ruby and North are great characters.  There was a spark or two between them and I loved feeling the push and pull of attraction and interest as the book went on.The whole holiday theme of this book really put me in the mood for Christmas.  It was a good reminder that there are so many people out there that could use a helping hand and extra love and kindness.I read through this book so quickly.  It really was like a Hallmark movie playing in my head.  Just perfect for this time of year!Content:  Clean","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L9RKXAO9R4RY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1462117473#wasThisHelpful","R1L9RKXAO9R4RY","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is set up perfectly to come out in the middle of a very political year for the U.S..  It's so easy to imagine this book actually happening right now.Katie is red.  Republican all the way and in full support of her father's run for president of the United States.  Drew is the son of the Democratic nominee for president.  And while he isn't into politics like Katie is, he still finds himself in the middle of all kinds of media attention.These characters felt really young to me.  Maybe even younger than the 16 years they were supposed to be.  Katie is socially awkward and a bit naive when it comes to making friends and talking to boys but she is also endearing.  Katie and Drew form a new kind of friendship that takes some navigation because they are on opposing sides of a very big election.I liked that Katie and Drew developed more of a friendship than a romantic connection.  It seemed very appropriate for two sixteen year olds.  Even when the storm of misunderstanding came, it still felt very on point for the age.This was a sweet story of a boy and a girl and first love.Content:  some kissing","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IGJX2W6G43Z4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145Q2XDQ#wasThisHelpful","R3IGJX2W6G43Z4","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book held a few surprises for me as far as genre goes.  I was expecting a historical fiction with some romance but I also got a bit of the dark magic, haunting ghost thing as well which added some flavor to the story.Eleanor is an interesting character.  She has spent a lifetime being abused by her father which makes her distrustful and wary of others.  But, for some reason, she believes what her father tells her about everything.  Which is just crazy.  Why would you believe the person who hurts you the most?Eleanor expects the worst from Brac Goch.  He is the enemy.  Even though he is nothing but kind to her.  She has grown up believing he is the worst of the worst though and when the ghost of Brac's first wife shows up with creepy messages in blood, Eleanor can't ignore them.  Eleanor is torn by what she believes and what she sees.  It makes for a bit of suspense and intrigue and it kept me wanting to read the whole book through.  I was caught up in the story and I was equally frustrated by and proud of Eleanor.  The pacing of the story was really good; the characters flawed but believable.  I really enjoyed this book!Content:  Clean.  No swearing or sexual content.  There is dark magic and some violent scenes in regards to that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36LF948BSP3FX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1680472372#wasThisHelpful","R36LF948BSP3FX","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the cover for this book!  It's so cute and it makes me want to eat cookies.  Actually, I wanted to eat cookies throughout this whole book.  One of these days I am going to get to the bakery spotlighted in this book because it is an actual place.  How fantastic is that?!This book is lighthearted and fun.  I enjoyed the interactions between Rachel and Henry- the banter and the little zing pinging back and forth.  Rachel thinks she knows Henry and she does to some degree but not entirely.  Henry is generous and caring.  He has such a soft heart and he uses the resources at his disposal to help and take care of other people without announcing it to the world.  I love that.I read through this book quickly because it was so fun and I didn't want to put it down.  It was the perfect little romantic escape for a summer day.Content:  Clean!

"Beck's Peace is the second book in the Harmon Heritage series.  I read the first book, Rori's Healing, not too long ago and really enjoyed it so picking up the next book for review was a no brainer.  I think Beck's Peace can stand alone but I think you will enjoy it more if you read Rori's Healing first.Beck took off years ago leaving his family and friends behind.  He's been wandering the country, working and running from his past.  One of those people Beck left behind is Savvy, his friend, his love and his sister's best friend.Savvy thought Beck loved her but then he saw her burn scars and took off, leaving her heart devastated.  Now he is back and trying to make amends but Savvy doesn't trust him but she still loves him.Now Beck is trying to prove himself worthy.  He is fighting to help Savvy see her beauty- inside and out.I loved this book.  I thought it was full of emotion and that tension that makes you want to keep reading.  Beck works so hard to make up for his absence with his family and Savvy.  He wants to be there for them.  The family connection was fantastic and I was really rooting for both Beck and Savvy the whole way.Today is release day for Beck's Peace!  Yay!  No waiting, only reading.  :)  I hope you all enjoy this series as much as I have!This is a clean romance.  Christian Fiction.

"Not long ago I reviewed the first book in this series, Eyes Unveiled.  (You can read my review HERE.)  Light Unshaken is the second book in this series and I would really recommend reading Eyes Unveiled before starting this book.  The emotional back history is something you need to understand.What I love about this series is the emotional pull it has.  I am drawn into Emma's world and I see and feel things with her.  Emma is a character people can relate to- her emotions, her desire to make a difference, her vulnerability, and even her mistakes.Emma and Riley are engaged in this book and fully in love but then Riley is made an offer he cannot refuse and suddenly they are worlds apart and fighting for the love they thought was so strong.  Emma feels far away and left out of Riley's busy world.  She fights loneliness and doubt.  Emma keeps herself busy though and tries not to wallow.  She has a goal, a place and people that need her.  She wants to make a difference but it is hard work and the danger that surrounds her seems to be escalating.  The emotions are high in this book for sure.Falling in love is easy to do.  Staying in love and fighting for that love when things get hard is something else entirely.  I enjoyed this book and I read through it quickly.  It has a fantastic forward momentum with that emotional pull that I love when reading.  This book left off in a place that surely cannot be the end so I am assuming that means another book is to come.  I hope.  :)Content:  Clean","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SBMI2YSVWMN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAH76MY#wasThisHelpful","R1SBMI2YSVWMN5","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am always, always positively giddy when I get to read a new book by Rachael Anderson.  She is one of my all time favorite authors.  The way she writes just clicks with me and takes me right to my happy place.I've been looking forward to reading Sam's story from the beginning of this series.  Sam is a fun loving, happy girl.  She knows how to enjoy life but she also knows how to work hard and love well.  She is someone I would like to be friends with.  Colten is more like Sam than she thinks.  He also is loyal and hard working.  Not to mention handsome.  There is just something about cowboys.The connection between Sam and Colten is fantastic.  I liked how things progressed between them.  It felt natural and normal.  I bought into their relationship and felt personally invested in their outcome.  It was also good to have characters from previous books around in this book.  It really felt like settling in with old friends.I loved this book and I love this series.  If you haven't had a chance to read it yet, you really should.

"I didn't realize when I started reading this book that it was the second book in the series.  I haven't read the first book (The Skeleton in My Closet Wears a Wedding Dress) and I don't know if that affected my reading or not.  I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything big and I was never lost as to how the story was going but I was probably missing out on knowing the characters better since they were also in the first book.Sophia has been through a lot of emotional turmoil in her young 19 years.  While she seems to be making some headway in moving forward, she keeps looking back.  She just cannot seem to let go of the hurt and worry.  I liked Sophia, but I didn't fall in love with her.  Maybe that's where not reading the first book comes into play?  I found myself frustrated with her a lot of the book.Luke is like the patient prince of the kingdom.  He is gentle with Sophia and he is kind.  But everyone has their limits and Luke reaches his and finally gets as frustrated with Sophia as I did.I liked this book.  It was a firm like for me but it wasn't love because I was frustrated by Sophia for too much of the book.  This is an LDS fiction book so religion plays a large part in the book and in the character's decision making.

"This is a regency, time travel, fantasy romance.  All in one.  Crazy stuff, I'm telling you.  It was interesting to see how the author meshed all those genres together.This book was on the shorter side, I thought.  It starts off a bit slow but it did pick up and it didn't take me long to read through it.  The end is a bit of a cliff hanger so it leaves you wanting more.I thought this was a good book, mostly surface for me as my emotions never got involved, but I appreciated the creativity as the author is obviously trying to create something different from most books out there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LKZ277MNUNB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WFDZSIE#wasThisHelpful","R3LKZ277MNUNB8","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have been reading the Timeless Romance Series, you will be familiar with Annette Lyon.  She has contributed to many collections and her novellas are always fantastic.  In this book all her novellas are compiled into one place, which is awesome!There is a new novella, ""Our Song"" in addition to those novellas found in previous collections.  I actually hadn't read Golden Sunrise either so that one was new to me.  All the other novellas are ones I have read before (and really liked).Our Song was such a good story.  Cassie wonders if her relationship with Matt is stagnant and boring when compared to her friend's flashy romances.  I love how she realizes that love is many different things.  Comfortable and dependable are two very important parts of love.  It was such a sweet story.  I really loved it.Golden Sunrise is about a second chance at first love.  The relationship moved quickly but they had a history to draw from and I really enjoyed it.  I loved how Adam pursues Natalie, reminding her of all the good parts of their young love.  It was romantic and fun.You really can't go wrong reading all these novellas.  They each have a different flavor- a few contemporary, a few historical but all clean and sweet.  You will end each one feeling good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R66J7Y29SFER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106WTIMM#wasThisHelpful","R66J7Y29SFER","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I wanted more.  Seriously, it felt like it took me 20 minutes to read.  But those few minutes sure gave me some romantic happiness.  :)  Heather Moore sure knows how to pack it all in a short amount of time.

"Once Upon a Friendship is part of the Harlequin Heartwarming line which means it is sweet and clean.  This book is more about friendship and family than romance though.  The romance is barely there and when it does show up, it is mostly suppressed until the very end.Gabi and Liam have been friends for a very long time and consequently, know each other very well.  Neither one of them want to ruin the best friendship they've ever had by acting on the feelings of attraction that have suddenly bloomed after more than a decade of friendship.  But Gabi is helping Liam fight a legal case and they are spending a lot of time together.  It gets harder and harder for them to fight the attraction they feel.I did enjoy the cast of characters here.  It was easy to feel their camaraderie and loyalty to each other.  Friendship is the best base for a romantic relationship, I think.  Well, friendship and attraction.  :)  This was an easy going book.  It was gentle in nature and never really got my heart pounding but it was solid and had a good flow to it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CU8QGK5VPFR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFS2FY8#wasThisHelpful","R1CU8QGK5VPFR7","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in the Wedding Planner Mystery series by Rachelle Christensen. If you haven't read the first book, Diamond Rings are Deadly Things, you might want to before picking up this book. While I believe this book could stand alone, you would really get a better feel for it if you have read the first book. The backstory that is a huge part of understanding Adri, is explained in depth there.This is a fun, cozy mystery set in Hawaii. You just can't go wrong with a Hawaiian setting. It made me long to be there. And I will be soon. I just hope my trip is nothing like Adri's. I really don't want to find a body while snorkeling!!!!Adri is a great balance of strong and vulnerable. She is good at standing up for herself which I really like. The romance in this book is light- slow growing and very spread out. The focus is more on the mystery part of the book.I really enjoyed this book. It kept me interested and focused which is always a good thing. This is a fun series and I'll be looking forward to the next installment. Oh, and it's squeaky clean! Yay!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A1KSOEN73CEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPVXF2Y#wasThisHelpful","R1A1KSOEN73CEO","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm so excited I got to read this book!  There was a bit of pre-buzz surrounding it in my book circles so of course it was on my radar.  I was told when I signed up to review this book that I wouldn't have that long to review it.  A week, I think.  Ha.  I didn't even need a day!This is the kind of book that just makes you keep reading.  There is no putting it down, there is no conceding to sleep or children or dinner making.  So, pick up this book when you have plenty of time to read it through or you will be unhappy.  Like me.  Because I made dinner and the whole while I was cursing the fact that we have to eat.  :)There is build up and tension in this book.  There is banter and sass.  It's sparky (like sparklers) and I loved it all.  I just couldn't help myself.  Now I want more.  More I want now.  I think I have a problem.As far as content goes, this book is a clean romance.  There are references to the MC's past sexual relationships with other people but nothing of detail.  There is some sexual innuendo.This is the perfect summer by the pool or the beach or enjoying your AC book.  Happy Reading!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FNZLAPQ0TBZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZONLBVK#wasThisHelpful","R2FNZLAPQ0TBZC","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to read Jennifer Moore's books.  She writes great romances with engaging characters.  Her books are clean but with a few sparks.  This book was fantastic.  I loved the shifting scenes- from the slopes in Colorado to the farm, to Middle East.  Each place had such a different feel and I could picture the places and people so easily in my head.  It was like a movie!Shelby has such spunk.  Her energy and intelligence make her a well rounded and fun character.  Hakim is swoony.  So generous and kind.  Loved him.I read this book cover to cover in pretty much one sitting.  It was a fantastic diversion and I was happily content in the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R355AFFJ3AZTTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VU8L9KQ#wasThisHelpful","R355AFFJ3AZTTG","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was immediately drawn into this book simply based on the setting and the events happening.  Emma and Jake meet because of a powerful hurricane that has left behind devastation.  Emma survived it and Jake is there to help people rebuild what was lost.Emma and Jake meet and it's basically attraction at first sight.  They delve right into a physical relationship (sex but behind closed doors) without the friendship and trust any relationship needs to be strong.  I think this led to the crazy back and forth game that drove me nuts in this book.  One chapter they are together.  The next chapter they are not.  Then they are.  Then they are not.  It was so back and forth I wanted pull my hair out.Jake definitely has a lot of drama in his life.  A LOT of drama.  Emma gets sucked into the drama by default.  This book for me was more plot driven than character driven.  While there were many ""things"" going on, I lacked the emotional pull to the characters.  I just couldn't connect with them.  But, I did like the basic plot and Jake's devotion to his daughter.  I just wish there had been less of the back and forth game between he and Emma.Content:  Sex behind closed doors between an unmarried couple.  Drug and Alcohol abuse, child abuse, mild violence and fighting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W963YEOVYP3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T7278XE#wasThisHelpful","R2W963YEOVYP3Q","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love reading Karen Witemeyer's books.  I know just what to expect when I pick one up.  It always feels like sitting down with an old friend.  And isn't the cover cute?  I love it.This was such a fun story.  I loved the interactions and spark between Stone and Charlotte.  Stone would surely like you to believe that he is as tough and unyielding as his name may suggest, but really he is kind and he definitely has a weakness for the teacher, Miss Atherton.  He had his work cut out for him gaining Charlotte's trust.Charlotte is firm but so kind.  I loved her tact and her ability to think quickly in surprising and tough situations.  The children under her care bring life and credibility to the book.  It was a great setup.  Charlotte has some fierce determination when it comes to her children and as a mother I could completely relate to that.I was interested and entertained by this book the whole way through.  It was classic Karen Witemeyer and I loved it.  I'm so glad I got to read and review it.  My thanks to the publisher, Bethany House, for allowing and providing for it.Content:  Squeaky clean.

"This book is a young adult sci-fi, fantasy/paranormal kind of mix.  I would say it would probably please the younger end of the YA spectrum better, maybe even middle grade readers.  The story here is very simply written.  It had more telling and less feeling but it was a good story with a lot of imagination.  I can imagine a 12 or 13 year old (boy or girl) reading this and enjoying it.As for me, I felt it lacked the tension and emotional build up that I like to see in books. I could easily picture the places and scenes described which was a fantastic thing, but I just wasn't feeling it. There were points that I did some skimming and was still able to keep up with what was happening.  The ""history"" read from the scrolls went on for pages and it was hard to read. It felt like the author needed to explain a whole bunch of things and needed a way to do that in one fail swoop.  It read just like a history lesson.Bentri probably had the most character development.  He has always been taught that ""natives"" are lesser beings with little intelligence and he treats Summer accordingly.  Actually, he treats her abominably.  Gradually he realizes that ""natives"" are intelligent and gifted.  His prejudice's diminish and he becomes kinder.  There is a good lesson in that.  What we think we know may not always be correct- especially regarding people.  The more time we spend knowing and trying to understand others, the better off we will be.  Prejudices are never good, and rarely correct.This book is clean- no swearing or sexual content, which I always greatly appreciate.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRCW645IVE47G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YHUC2A0#wasThisHelpful","RRCW645IVE47G","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a book that is emotionally driven, this is your book.  I went through a whole array of emotions while reading this book.  This is a story about self-discovery, friendships and love.I loved the immediate interest and attraction Emma had when she saw and heard Riley sing.  He spoke to her soul and I loved that.  Riley and Emma share a connection through music but they develop a friendship that expands beyond just music.Emma was an easy character to relate to.  She seemed very human although maybe just a titch naive.  She doesn't ever expect the worst of people.  Emma has good friends and a good relationship with her brother.  I liked that support system for Emma.  It was good to see Emma grow and strengthen throughout the book.  Her struggles made her stronger.There is a huge love triangle in this book and love triangles aren't my favorite, but I know they do happen in life and I can accept that.  The resolution of the triangle in this book seemed a bit unrealistic to me though.Overall, I enjoyed this book.  It was clean (no swearing or sexual content) and I'm always grateful for that.  I hear the next book in the series is coming out in July so I'll be looking forward to that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NXNH6FYZXDP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R9MB8OY#wasThisHelpful","R2NXNH6FYZXDP1","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read ""Remember Me"", the first book in this series, and I loved it and I saw that this second book was out and I wanted to read it really badly.I first met Dane in ""Remember Me"".  I just knew I wanted his story and I knew it would be good.  It sure was.  He is yummy.The chemistry between Dane and Aimee is palpable.  It had me silently (or maybe not always silently) begging for those those charged moments and physical connections.  Lara does an excellent job managing the lightning.Here's what you get with this book: a clean romance with sparks, a bit of suspense and a little faith thrown in for good measure.  I was pulled into this book from the very beginning and I didn't want to put this book down.  The settings change from San Diego to the Lake Tahoe area- both places that I am familiar with and love.So yeah, I really liked this book.  I'm so happy Lara Van Hulzen let me read and review this book for her.  I cannot wait to see what she does next!  Hopefully she is madly working at it right now.  ;)There may have been a couple instances of mild swearing.

"Super cute cover, right?  I love it.This book has a weightier feel to it as most of the book Georgie is struggling to connect the pieces from an accident that haunts her.  She cannot remember exactly what happened leading up to the accident but she remembers enough to know that it wasn't good.  Georgie is haunted by all sorts of what-if's and guilt over poor choices she feels she made.  She doubts her judgement, her abilities and herself.  While the physical effects of the accident are fading, the mental and emotional ones remain.Jace is also a bit haunted.  He's had a couple rough breaks but all in all he is paving a way for himself and reaching for his dreams.  Jace has quite a task ahead of him trying to win Georgie over.  Trust just doesn't come easy for either of them.I enjoyed the growing friendship between Jace and Georgie.  They were both fantastic characters who I cared about and liked.  The supporting cast was great as well.  I loved the setting and the way things revolved around the restaurant and food - yummy sounding food like the chocolate cake Jace makes.  It had my mouth watering.All in all this one was really good.  It is squeaky clean.  This is an LDS fiction book so there are some religious themes of forgiveness and seeking God's help.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GNPNUDPZIQB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YW5UIJ2#wasThisHelpful","R2GNPNUDPZIQB8","A35JGHMCMZIMW4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35JGHMCMZIMW4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are great bottles. I have used 3 out of six already and I am very pleased. I needed these bottles for making my DIY poo-pouri, deodorant spray and anti chew dog spray. The size is so perfect for what I need and the bottle's cobalt blue color is elegant enough to keep it laying around the house. As for the stickers, they are great extra bonus but I do not find them functional as the chalk marker can be easily rub off if not the person using the bottle is not handling it the right way. I think I will print out a white label stickers next time instead. It will also stand out more. But back to the bottles, they are really great quality. I really love them and enjoy using them.

"I have 2 dogs. A golden retriever and an English bulldog.. and the past couple of months, they have been licking their paws, scratching their body and rubbing the nose. After taking them to the vet, found out it's allergy. We're not exactly sure if it's food or what but we changed their food and gave them the prescription medicines. After 2 weeks of still scratching, I decided to look online for other remedies and I found out that salmon oil can help reduce skin inflammation due to allergies. Luckily, this product was available for testing and reviewing so I thought I should give this brand a  try.My dogs has been on this oil for about 2 weeks now. They seem to not mind the oil in their food. In 2 weeks, I can really tell the difference in their health being. They are definitely scratching less (I'm a stay at home so I keep an eye on them all the time) and no more rubbing the face on window  ledges. My bulldog's bare spots where he has been scratching are finally healed up too. Their coats are a lot shinier and another thing that I really noticed is that they leave so much less hair on the couch when they lay on it at night. I really believe that the oil is helping their skin and their coat's well being.With the positive things I see from my dogs, I can say that I highly recommend this oil. I will keep on giving it to them and if I see more positive outcome, I will definitely do an update. But right now, we are really happy with this product. Give it a try. It is truly good for our fur babies.*I bought this product at a discounted price for the purpose of testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR53SRESD1PWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WZZQ46C#wasThisHelpful","RR53SRESD1PWV","A7G7V7WHL445F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7G7V7WHL445F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a bad acnes on my back after giving birth to my son. I don't know if it's hormonal change or just dirt trapped in my skin. I have used brushes and soap but they still keep on coming back. few weeks ago I was offered to test this at a discounted price in return of what I think about it (honest/unbiased review) so I said, sure it won't hurt to try it.What I do is I scrub my back with an italy towel, then I lather it with this Humane wash, and leave it for a good 3-5 minutes then rinse thoroughly..  I do it once a day. It has been 6 days now and the pimples on my back doesn't seem to be as tender as they used to and they don't itch as bad anymore. I still have a long way to go.

"This awesome portable charger from Innogie is really handy and helpful. I take this charger with me when I am bowling so I can connect it to my usb fan and it works great! I powers my mini fan till I finish the game without a problem.I am also using this charge my iphone and ipad and this charger holds 10400 mah which is really good.

"This pillow is amazing! I was able to buy this at a discounted price to test and give my honest review and I am so glad I bought it because this pillow is so huge and comfy! It is as wide as my queen bed. The pillow is well stuffed with shredded memory foam so it is very fluffy. When I first got it, it was in a sealed plastic and you need to leave it out for few hours to let the foam rise. Mine actually fluffed up in no time.Now using this at night is wonderful. If you are like me who loves a body pillow, then this is truly for you. Unlike other pillows that makes you sweaty at night, this pillow will keep your body cool. So you don't have to worry about sweat on the pillow.This pillow, according to the description is hypoallergenic and dust mite resistant. So if you are prone to allergies, or getting clogged nose all the time when laying in bed, it could be that your pillow is causing it.Overall, this pillow is a 5 star quality. It is not too firm and not too soft, it is just right. It is very comfortable not only as a body pillow but also as a head pillow if you want to use it that way.

"I received this product free for the purpose of testing and reviewing.I cannot believe how much space I am saving using this space saver bags!!!! I did one comforter, and two regular pillows, and they shrunk into a really compact small package. It is amazing! I was really worried when I first got it that the plastics might have hole in them but so far, the two ones that I tried was really good. No problems with holes or anything. It did the job exactly what it supposed to.The only downside is the pumping part. This does not uses a vacuum cleaner hose to get the air out. It uses a pump like thing like the one you use to make balloons, except this one takes out air. Because you have to pump it, it will take a while to get all the air out so don't do this if you are in hurry. The pump screws on to the green ring on the bag. Make sure you take the lid off the ring first and seal the end of the plastic, then start pumping. You will be pumping a lot so just take your time. It's a great exercise for the arms.So far I like mine. I was able to keep my son's bedroom looking neat by using this space saver bags.

"First let me disclose that I received this product at a discounted price for the purpose of testing and reviewing.This lantern is really awesome! It can be charged 3 ways- solar, charging cable or batteries. I like the solar because it's the easiest. Except when it's cloudy outside, you will have to use the batteries or plugging it in to the wall to charge. It also comes with a charging cable. Now my charging cable prong broke right as I was trying to plug it in. I contacted the seller and they were very nice and very helpful! I really appreciate their great customer service. Now back to the product, I have left it out in the rain for days and it is holding up really well. No damage or whatsoever. This lantern is also cool because it's collapsible. Just push it together to close or pull it apart to turn it on. Can't get easier than that. The led lights are really nice and bright too! It will light up a whole room without a problem. It is not overly bright but it's bright enough for you to see things and do things.With that said, I definitely highly recommend this product. Tested indoor and outdoor and it passed my expectations.

"I got my compression calf sleeved few weeks ago and was able to use it while running on the treadmill. It helps so much with muscle pains and spasms while I am running for a longer time. It is made well and easy to put on too. The size I got is a little big on me but it's ok because I wanted it to actually go above my knee. It works for me that way.

"I ordered this for my son's bedroom at a discounted price for the purpose of giving my honest review.It is a very nice framed wall poster. The colors are very vibrant just like in the pictures. It is very sturdy and I like that it's wrapped in a plastic for protection. I might just keep the plastic in there since it is not so obvious once it's up. It is a very nice motivational words to read in the morning when you wake up. The only thing I wish is that the size was a lot bigger so I can easily read the smaller words from a distance.

"This is a great quality cake/cupcake tower stand. It took only a few minutes to assemble but once it's up, it's not going anywhere. it is very sturdy.

One bag of crystals lasted one week (triangular corner fit litter box available from Amazon). A positive with this litter is that it doesn't track.

One can use a small stick on air freshner to the outside of the box . . . baking soda doesn't help. The size of the crystals is too large for the usual scoops. Easy fix? Remove a few tines with scissors or pliers.The cats didn't have any problems with the change from their usual Fresh Step Crystals (use half an 8 lbs bag a week).

"BAGHDAD ER deals with the medical trauma found in a combat zone. It is beyond the scope of one's imagination . . . certain aspects cannot be recorded. This is specific to the medical care received after arrival at hospital and does not include the care given by 'on the scene' medics who make decisions that are crucial to saving lives. Wounds caused by any form of IED are both physically and emotionally traumatic.

The scope of injuries sustained varies from those with no physical trauma to the 'buddy' that is killed in a horrific manner . . . not a simple thing to reconcile.If you are not familiar with military medicine, this offers an accurate description of injuries and treatment . . . a good overview of in hospital care.

"The format has been designed to portray the disconnected thought processing associated with the reality that so many combat veterans experience. They have been trained for a single purpose but what happens when that 'purpose' ends? Admittedly, that response varies irregardless of 'support.' Note the attitude of responsibility and concern for those comrades still in action. 'Charity?' This is an aspect that I have always found of interest . . . for some of these men, self worth is defined by their ability to function within a unit in a combat situation. The 'fadeout' format allows time to fill in the missing time but it may be difficult for some viewers.For those who have some experience with veterans, this may add another dimension. If you are not knowledgeable, try to understand the reasons for the format. For those of us with experience the storyline will be familiar. Recommended for those with an interest in human behavior and in the realities facing combat veterans.To find FRAY 'boring' or the acting skills lacking just might mean that you do not understand the intent of this video.

Internally, it is a saline type laxative and antacid.  As little as a 1/4 teaspoon can help reduce stomach acidity. If you are using this as a laxative, understand the importance of not exceeding the recommended dosage. If too much is taken as a single dose it can cause dehydration and serious consequences. Please ask a pharmacists or your physician if there are any interactions with Rx medications! This is one thing that I try to emphasize in my reviews. Retirement doesn't always preclude experience. Taken as directed, this is a safe and gentle laxative for most people.

"The basic premise of the book is that Earth is only one of many, many worlds 'seeded' by an alien race which originated in another dimension. Eleven beings - no, twelve - were exiled because they had created the twelfth. The twelfth was the creature called Bane. Holo does an excellent job of beginning the book with action, threading his world-building in and around that action and slowly unfolding it.bane of the deadBane of the Dead is pure Space Opera. Discard all your puny notions of the laws of physics, and just enjoy the almost cinematic descriptions of machines and men melded into seraphim, the protectors of humanity and their titanic clashes with the ironically bureaucratic Fallen. In a universe where not one, but two 'spare' planets have been set into orbit around Earth (and one leaves abruptly) without any mention of that mass affecting the Earth, it is not a surprise to learn of mental powers that can extend to... but that's a spoiler.This isn't a story about the characters, who remain elusively aloof from the reader. Although they are well-enough described, I was never quite able to connect with them emotionally. The dialogue is lacking flavor, but that's not why you read books like this. This one is a fun tour de force of chaos sword battles, hand-to-hand Mecha combat, and the dead world hiding terrible secrets at the center of it all. If you enjoyed Saberhagen's Berserker series, this may appeal to you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L6CKWCBBJAA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZO1K910#wasThisHelpful","R3L6CKWCBBJAA0","AJGQQNYTHF5VT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJGQQNYTHF5VT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up Tales of the Minivandians by Tom Rogneby and was tickled with the sweet and funny vignettes. Told by a Bard, they are done in the style of medieval or Renaissance-reenactment stories. But the Bard uses high technology like holograms in his tellings, letting us have a glimpse of a very strange far-future world in which present day is history, but as if only the SCA and such survived some cataclysm to repopulate the world. The Minivandian, of course, is a suburban guy with a wife and kids, but it‚Äôs been a little altered in retelling over the passage of years‚Ä¶I‚Äôd recommend these for when you only have a few minutes, or as a palate-cleanser in between other books.

"This was one that I had picked up because I was intrigued by the premise. A lost colony lands on an Earth-like planet, and decides to keep their sleeping scientists, engineers, and soldiers as sort of a living library. Only once every fifty years is a sleeper awakened to pass on their knowledge. When a threat builds up against the colony, the sleeper awakened is a soldier, who is not content to submit to life as a virtual slave, cut off from his wife and friends.While I was able to subsume my sick self into this story as I was reading while I had a fever, there were any number of loose threads left dangling that make me hope to see at least one sequel. We are never shown the true face and motivation of the external enemy, for instance,. only the internal enemy of the king who refuses to relinquish his hold over the sleepers. I have seen Montgomery‚Äôs work begin to smooth out and become more effortless, but this was still stilted in places, with wooden characters that felt as though they were being posed to suit the author rather than moving on their own paths with true motivations. I can still recommend it, it is a pleasant story, but it is not yet a fully-realized world. I hope that with the next book, I will see even more growth from this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AM7L44PICURP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z1Y2QYI#wasThisHelpful","R1AM7L44PICURP","AJGQQNYTHF5VT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJGQQNYTHF5VT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"the second book in the Laredo series, is a solid space opera with well-thought out plot, great characters, and enough action to keep you reading. The author has spent a lot of time thinking about the economies of a war in space, that is evident, but he‚Äôs inserted just enough to make this book feel thoughtful without making it dense and unreadable. The murthering great space battle at the end (I don‚Äôt think this is a spoiler‚Ä¶ it seems inevitable from the beginning, but I‚Äôm not telling you who won!) is reminiscent of Weber‚Äôs finely detailed missile-by-missile accounts of space battle without falling down the rabbit hole of too much, which make my eyes cross and I start skimming.As my review followers know, I am in it for the people. Here, Grant excels. His portrayals of the two sides of the war are superb. You get motivations, allies, and enemies in a complex web of intrigue that ensnares people you like and are rooting for‚Ä¶ on both sides of the equation. Rather than falling into the trap of ‚Äògood vs evil‚Äô he has given us sympathetic characters on the side of the enemy that we can feel conflicted about not liking‚Ä¶ and he has given us traitors that we don‚Äôt hurry to hate. It would be easy to simply write the Bactrians all off as mustache-twirling villains, but Grant doesn‚Äôt allow that. He knows that people are not that black-and-white, and that comes through in his writing.This isn‚Äôt a light, fluffy read.

"A wonderful collection of work that shows the true breadth of Hoyt's imagination. Here you will find tales of humanity, monsters who are all-too human, and some who claim human while showing their true colors. From cute kittens that aren't what they seem, to vampires, this is a selection of stories that will pull you in and onward. If you're already a fan of her Darkship world, you will find stories that hold the keys to some of her characters and their motivations in those novels. If you likewry humor, then you will find it in the story of Heart‚Äôs Fire, where the young heroine is reading a paperback novel, the key to her downfall. Sarah and I share a love of reading, and furthermore, reading stuff that everyone tells us is trashy and why aren‚Äôt you reading works with great and lofty messages?Because sometimes it‚Äôs not about the message that blinks and flashes like a giant neon light tearing the quiet night apart. Sometimes it‚Äôs about the little stories, the lives of people who work and love and live quietly, never thinking they could make a difference until they have no choice. Because that is a message in itself. Stories give us hope, which enables us to continue. Stories show us how heroism really works, and romance, and all the big things that make us human and keeps us going onward into the future which might hold magic in the form of technology. Or maybe not, it could be things we haven‚Äôt even dreamed of yet, writers nor readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EIKRXG4M88MM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y26BXRW#wasThisHelpful","R2EIKRXG4M88MM","AJGQQNYTHF5VT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJGQQNYTHF5VT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As an avid reader of the YA genre and magnetically drawn to post-apocalyptic/ Dystopian tales such as `The Hunger Games', I could not help but be drawn to this exciting new novel that encapsulates the genre perfectly! In this riveting read and epic conclusion {to `Shore of Monsters'} main protagonist `Sky' embarks upon the ultimate mission to reunite with her true love and save humanity. Richly evocative and founded on searing vision this extraordinarily remarkable fantasy is a truly breathtaking feat and one that I thoroughly enjoyed reading. David J Nix's tale may be targeted towards the younger reader, but I found it full of depth and substance as strongly presented as in well-known books {many traditionally published}.After such an intriguing start and initial premise in the author's first two novels, I was somewhat sceptical as to whether the sequel would maintain the same momentum and intensity as its predecessors. Luckily, David J Nix's novel doesn't fall into the trap of some books as the intricately woven plot certainly `packed a punch' as to keep me firmly interested in the unfolding storyline! Fast-paced, exciting and sprinkled with shocking twists and turns...this entertaining romp through a wondrous world is a spectacular story from beginning to end. The deliciously dark narrative exceeded all expectations and I was left feeling a sense of supreme satisfaction at the end.I was most impressed by such a compelling saga that I cannot wait to re-read, and so I would like to thank the author so much for providing me with a copy of his book to read & write an honest, non-biased review on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R303OGUKU4B9HE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0075XKWT4#wasThisHelpful","R303OGUKU4B9HE","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"`Emily's Destiny' is a bewitchingly beautiful story of sublime subtlety and wonder that will enchant both children and adult alike. Swept into a magical realm of moral values, mythology and fantastical otherworldly concepts Dan Sander's stunning story was a delight to behold! Delving into the past and entwining it within our present day, Dan presents a fascinatingly rich representation of Easter and background history of the Easter Bunny.As a symbol of Spring; rebirth, vibrancy and hope EMILY fills you with warmth and kindles a flame within that lights up the darkness.Questions such as ~Where did the Easter Bunny come from? What is the significance of the Easter Egg?are explored!  Refreshing originality is encapsulated within the deftly woven narrative containing a hypnotic blend of magic, myth and mystery as to keep you firmly glued to the page. With a cast of colourful characters; legendary beings called upon in times of darkness on the land (Emily; the Rabbit, Daimon, the Prince, Sabina, Lupi and the fire-tiger) this resonant tale of times past will linger on in the mind...Emily's tale of courage, adventure and friendship is one that will leave you with lasting memories and so is a story that I envisage being re-read and handed down through the generations for many years to come! Similarly to master-mythmaker JRR Tolkien I loved how the author draws inspiration from the past {both fact and fable}, with a profound emphasis on the natural environment.A special mention to Aaron Pocock (Illustrator) of this stunning picture book; as it is the striking images that bring the author's extraordinary visionary masterpiece to life.*I would like to thank the author for so kindly providing me with a signed copy of his book to read & write an honest, non-biased review on *","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M0F6JHG7NXL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=099229830X#wasThisHelpful","R1M0F6JHG7NXL2","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This exquisitely beautiful, heartrending tale took me on an unforgettable journey of the heart. Laura Roppe's delicious debut is a novel of great impaction and everlasting resonance, as she captures with such acute precision and depth an embroiled teen and her first love. Piercing a hole, I bled inwardly; thrust into a compelling saga wrought with such fervent intensity and heartfelt sincerity as to reduce me to tears...The author dexterously captures the dramatic voice and mind of a 16-year-old girl caught in a maelstrom of grief, loss, love and heartbreak. Fans of Colleen Hoover or books containing teenage romance will find this enchanting, dazzling story something rather exceptional and wonderfully unexpected!`Heart shaped rock' is quintessentially a Coming-Of-Age' tale that explores romantic and family/ friend relationships, loss and (acceptance of loss) and heartbreak. The captivating storyline was unmistakably impressive, with main protagonist Shaynee's personal journey of self-discovery one that I was really able to connect on an intimate level. Reminiscent of 'Letters to Juliet' this unmissable story merges together humor, happiness and sorrow for a greatly moving and evocative outcome. Left laughing, crying and gripping the pages tightly this sublime story was not only heart pounding but also a reflective and very thoughtful literary work of impressive substance.This has to be one of the most soul-stirring, emotional and deeply heartfelt stories I have encountered. The author's incredibly witty, funny and thoughtful prose is so captivating you cannot help but feel empathy towards the characters. I simply LOVED the special soundtrack  for the novel and the different songs, which were presented as an accompaniment to listen to alongside the book & which enhances the reading experience. This truly beguiling book is a must-read and so I cannot thank Laura enough for providing me not only with an e-copy of her novel to read {*and write a non-biased, honest review on} but furthermore the soundtrack - individual songs too!!!To find out more...[...]*To celebrate release of Heart Shaped Rock the novel, download the soundtrack to Heart Shaped Rock for FREE at [...] at the HSR MUSIC tab until June 10, 2014.*","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTV6W4UCEF25P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=099601361X#wasThisHelpful","RTV6W4UCEF25P","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The shore of monsters is David J Nix's second YA novel that despite being self-published was an unexpectedly well-written, ambitious literary work of note. The intricately woven plot containing in-depth description and engaging dialogue, blended seamlessly together for a well-crafted tale that pleasantly surprised me. The fantastic main protagonist and heroine faced her challenges with such strength and spirit, to present an epic journey of self-development of resonance and impaction. Additionally, the convincing sequence of events containing ingenious world building added to the overall fluidity of the prose. Nix has written a wonderfully entertaining story highly appealing to fans of Dystopia and post-apocalyptic tales, set within an altered Earth {alternate reality} envisioned with panache and idiosyncratic flair.Short synopsis-This Dystopian story is set within a fictional Earth that was destroyed and plaque filled the entire world. Somehow, men have this plaque that kills every single of them leading to extinction. The heroine was a survivor of the group called Committee that lived in the other part of the world where they claimed to preserve humanity. Of course, there is more intricate depth and substance to the background history of past events.The moment that protagonist 17 year-old Sky believes that she is going to face Death, a mysterious man shows up who resembles a monster and shockingly saves her life. It is not until then that she encounters a man for the first time in her entire life! However, she didn't anticipate that would experienced the feeling of love that was never exist in her philosophy...This heartrendingly poignant and acutely touching exquisite romantic tale was a joy to behold and a book that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to friends. I cannot wait to read the concluding sequel (as it is a story in 2-parts), having been left teetering on the edge of an unfinished cliffhanger ending in suspense and anticipation. Full of thrilling twists and turns in the plot and unanticipated revelations this excellent, exhilarating tale is sure to be of interest to fans of books such as Suzanne Collins ""The Hunger Games"".*I would like to thank the author for providing me with a physical copy of his brilliant book to read & write a non-biased, honest review on *","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R260UWSZI1UJF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1470038862#wasThisHelpful","R260UWSZI1UJF2","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an avid reader of fantasy fiction I was intrigued upon encountering this uniquely divergent read, with its well-plotted story and intricately woven storyline. The convincing storyline and believable characters brought this author's visionary masterpiece to life, plus the remarkable ending was a sure sign of a good story as it left me wanting more. The entire idea of how Gods are created by their followers I found absolutely fascinating, as too was the irony imposed upon the Pantheon Gods {who compete for stature through their own personal popularity created by their followers}. Main protagonist Gwen was a character whom I was able to warm to easily, and so I felt a part of her journey and more connected to the narrative.The fantastic fantasy world that Patrice Sikora has created is bewitchingly beguiling and full of texture and depth as to enchant rabid readers. I am so pleased to have been presented with the opportunity of reading this entertaining story, as it was greatly appealing and hard to put down. To be able to escape from everyday life and immerse yourself totally in another world is wonderful, and this impressive story was a real escape and joy to behold! I found the strong, interesting characters and curious creative concepts made me want to keep reading...right up to the distinctly memorable, explosive ending.Patrice Sikora's accomplished debut novel was a thoroughly compelling read and one that I am very excited about, as I cannot wait to read the sequel in this new series. I would recommend this story to fans of fantasy and readers seeking something entirely new and different.3.5 Star rating!*I won a physical copy of ""The dream king's courier: Payback"" through a first-read giveaway on Goodreads. *","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVAQUTHMWOFQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1493614827#wasThisHelpful","RVAQUTHMWOFQX","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 stars`Catch me falling' is David J Nix's fourth YA novel about belonging and finding your place in the world. It's a profoundly poignant tale that speaks with heartfelt sincerity and warmth, which teenagers could certainly connect with through the main character's personal journey. Catch me falling is also a touching love story of a human girl in a (quote) `what-if' world, whose considered an aberration because of her human face and behaviour. The beautiful, fluid prose contain such profundity of depth and meaning that greatly impacts upon your current outlook on life so as to leave you with lasting memories. Amid the thought-provoking narrative was a heartrending tale of substance; that touched me inwardly and left me feeling empowered and moved.I was able to identify with the fantastic main protagonist and many of the themes explored within the story, such as for instance isolation and exclusion (namely in connection with bullying and/ or how others judge you on outer appearance). David J Nix delves ultimately into the core of our hearts by extracting the essence of what it means to be human by touching upon humanity itself. Living life is hard and tough times are shared with others through love. This stunning story transcends boundaries by transporting you on an unforgettable journey of wonderment, enlightenment and discovery (including on a personal level) so as to reach out with resolve!Crissa's story from caged animal to freedom, set within a magnetic post-apocalyptic (changed) world is one of sweeping magnitude and epicness. From the `Tal-Bern's brutality and mindset, to the disturbingly bloodthirsty and inhumane Rite of Long Moon this shadowy world of terror and torment is a place of divergence. Soul-shaken and with the hairs on the backs of my arms standing up on end, this remarkable novel was an astonishing read and one that I certainly wont be forgetting for a long time. Fans of YA post-apocalyptic (or Dystopia) fiction will be enchanted and beguiled by this unique novel.*I would like to thank David J Nix for providing me with a physical copy of his novel `Catch me falling' to read & write a non-biased, honest review on. *","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SBQNMOQOIZ8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=149533354X#wasThisHelpful","R1SBQNMOQOIZ8F","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Devon Ashley's new romantic suspense novel is an exciting edition to the New Adult genre. Ideal for the 21st Century readership this classy contemporary story incorporates many relatable current issues and elements, which many readers will be able to identify with on a personal level. Recommended for older readers due to the explicit language: mature and disturbing situations and sexual content* Edgy realism that's chillingly acute and exacting, makes this profoundly evocative {rather bold} read certainly a singular one that is not for the feint-hearted! Steamy, sultry and full of heated passion and intensity...the relationship between Megan and Nick tugs at the heartstrings and leaves you hot under the collar.Not normally a book that I would pluck from the shelf, I was intrigued by the `Nearly series' having herd high praise for the author and her hugely popular published fictional works. Nearly Mended is a poignant, controversial and rather impacting story that delves into the dark world of Sex Trafficking and examines the way women are regarded. Main protagonist Megan Whitaker has had her fair share of physical abuse and internal scars that are deeply rooted within and so trying to let go of the past is an enormous feat. I felt such an overwhelming tumult of emotions as her story pierced me inwardly, so as to cause me to care greatly about what happened and eager to read on... Nick {Megan's long, lost love} shows such heroism through his strong bond and love for her; as to melt the heart and really make you think.The thought-provoking narrative is full of such profundity, depth and insightful sincerity as to leave you a lasting mental memory of this unforgettable story.I cannot begin to express into words how unexpectedly shocked I was by Devon Ashley's extraordinary novel, as not normally a reader of NA Contemporary dark romantic suspense and realism. I would compare this series to something of a mix between `TAKEN' {film with Liam Neeson} and `Fifty shades of grey', as the combination of explosive erotica and dazzling romance is as addictive as Chocolate - and my guilty pleasure!Sadistic nightmarish dreams linger on in the mind as one contemplates the true horrors of shaded societies - so relevant to today, which makes for an eye opening read of distinction and striking idiosyncratic prose.*I won a copy (+bookmarks) of `Nearly Mended: Nearly #2' By Devon Ashley through a first-read giveaway on Goodreads. *","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZOY7KDYZ203U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497321514#wasThisHelpful","RZOY7KDYZ203U","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! This astonishingly epic ending to one of the most unforgettable Young Adult romances of the 21st Century, has to be the most impressive fictional novel I have read in 2014. Having had such high expectations after reading book 2: Delirium in The Parallon trilogy I was stunned by how such a magnificent final instalment evokes such passionate intensity as to leave me in sheer awe of the author. A series I shall be re-reading and enthusiastically recommending to friends, as an addictive page-turner ideal for both young/ teenage readers and adults alike! Taken on a thrilling rollercoaster ride of evocative resonance and impacting memorability, Dee Shulman's phenomenal novel is an accomplished and ambitious work of pure joy to behold.AFTERLIFE is the heart-stopping finale in a gripping saga {following on from book 1: Fever and book 2: Delirium} that concludes Eva and her soul mate Seth's journey as the fate of the entire Universe comes into fruition. Two worlds. Two Millennia. One love...Eva is on the brink of death. Ripped from her own world she's woken in another, only to discover the devastating truth about the lethal fever she's been fighting - and the enemy that's chased her and Seth through time. Now the reckless twenty-first century girl and the fearless Roman gladiator must face the final battle. But it's not just their love at stake; the fate of the universe is in their hands...Not since Stephenie Meyer's Twilight  have I felt so emotionally connected to the main characters, nor so dazzled by an addictive sci-fi/ Dystopia story with a fantastic main protagonist. AFTERLIFE is an intoxicatingly rich; compulsive read that tells a tale of such profound depth as to melt the heart.  I had tears running down my cheeks as Eva and Seth's story pierced me inwardly with such everlasting impaction that's a sure-fire sign of unmistakable brilliance for any romantic at heart! Reminiscent of ""All our yesterdays"" wherein such a strong bond between two people is tested to the limits, AFTERLIFE just shows how two star-crossed lovers can reach out to a wide readership and touch all those who encounter them. Without a doubt Dee Shulman's sensational series has to be at the top of my favourites list and a book which I would not just merely recommend...but strongly enthuse about as an exceptional and very special  rare gem of a book!!To find out more go to ~ www.feverbook.co.uk*I won a signed ARC copy of Dee Schulman's novel ""AFTERLIFE"" {book 3 in the Parallon trilogy}, through a first-read giveaway on Goodreads. *","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RIIZITDY05NR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0141340282#wasThisHelpful","R1RIIZITDY05NR","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having clapped eyes on the exquisitely beautiful mauve and amethyst cover, I was magnetically drawn to Ch'Kara Silverw√∏lf's first fantasy novel in the style of classic high/epic fantasy for Young Adults.Books transport you to other realms of discovery, places of wonder and enchantment which bring dreams to life so allowing the imagination to soar...yet, despite the promising premise of this novel I alas found it somewhat lacking in content. Containing references to Medieval folk lore, magik (not `magic'), mythology and fantasy expectations were high as I plunged into a complex storyline that was packed full of so many magical creatures and supernatural elements it was unnecessarily overpowering - - to the extent of excess. There are Wizards, Healers, Elves, Faries, Wolves, Dragons and Dark Lords etcetera. The sentences were also very short and choppy hence the narrative did not flow very well, which in addition to the simplistic language (that's more for the Younger reader/ middle-grade) all enhanced the amateurish feel of the book.Main character Montayna is gifted with a concoction of magical abilities and psychic powers, who embarks on the imitative `quest' as someone special who will endeavour to protect her people and planet. Unfortunately as I continued to read I found the entire storyline lacking in originality as many established elements within fantasy literature kept cropping up. What vexed me greatly was how the author went beyond drawing inspiration from other notable works within this genre, with marked comparisons in her work; disturbingly derived not from innate independent thought and so lacking in vision.For example {does this evoke something recognizable?}... ""even the smallest child has wisdom to impart...""The use of Elvish writing which Ayyuk then translates into the `common tongue' once more leant towards epic novels such as JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, with the slant on Tolkien-esque excessively potent for my personal liking. Likewise the fact that the main protagonist is destined to become the Chosen One yet again confirmed my discernment on the lack of individuality, despite trying my hardest to be impartial and regard Ch'Kara's book as something entirely singular. Unable to overlook the grammatical errors within the writing, it was rather difficult to get `under the skin' of the various characters whom many had unpronounceable names that were divergent to the target readership.Aspects of interest within the story included the various magical abilities for instance `the source' and `the skill' as well as healing powers through use of magic, herbs and plants and the wielding of the elements so closely connected with Mother Nature and the Earth. <u>The negatives of this debut novel far outweighed the positives in my opinion</u> and so I regrettably cannot consider this to be something I would advocate to other readers of the genre seeking something of complexity, uniqueness and depth.*Having been so kindly provided with a paperback copy of `Prophecy of Nitesh: Book One - Daughter of Light & Dark' from the author*, I do feel terrible as though this is perhaps be an insensitive review in view of how hard it is to write and publish a novel - - such a noteworthy achievement that many can only aspire to.I REALLY WANTED TO LOVE THIS NOVEL but it was just not for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NGHKV6UFNZ71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481982001#wasThisHelpful","R1NGHKV6UFNZ71","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Upon opening a world of wonders I plunged headlong into a fantastical creation of sheer individualistic style and exquisite supernatural ambience. Blending seamlessly together `classic' (high/ epic type) fantasy within a thoroughly contemporary, modern backdrop this atypical novel is like nothing I have ever encountered before! Written in a warm, friendly and light-hearted style and sprinkled with touches of humor I instantly felt at ease with the prose and likeable Lizzie. Alongside the cast of colourful characters and a spunky, quirky main protagonist are otherworldly creatures and magical objects to enchant and intrigue. In a world of Lycan (or more commonly known as Werewolf), magic, spells and power-hungry masterminds is an archaic mystery and lost Library that holds the key to astonishing discoveries...As I opened this book and began reading I was struck by the punchy beginning that grabbed hold of my attention and sucked me into the compelling storyline. Each subsequent chapter left me sat in animated suspense, desperate to read on and find out the answers to many questions (as though a mini-cliffhanger). This story explores the definition of `normal' and identity through the main character's remarkable journey of self-discovery and enlightenment that as a reader I was able to connect with due to the sublime storytelling and transcendent adventure.Lizzie's average outlook on life and self-regard is altered so dramatically when drop-dead-gorgeous, sexy Alpha John and a curious leather-bound, green book enters her life...nothing will ever be the same again! Swept away by the smouldering, fervent intensity between Lizzie and John and the mystical undertone to an edgy urban fantasy story, I was unable to put this astonishingly appealing novel down -- not even for a split second.The convincing complexity of the fantasy world which the author has created (slotted so seamlessly into our everyday life), was so impressively ambitious that I was left in awe of the author. What I also LOVED about this story was how not only how it is so different from anything else within this genre, but that it instils/ re-ignites a passion for books and reading that will animate any bibliophile or rabid reader!!My sole disappointment with this novel was that it came to an end; otherwise I would state how truly tantalizing this transfixing tale was!Kate Baray's take on magical creatures and concepts is certainly distinctive, with the writing verging in places of erotica and contemporary fiction that chick-lit readers will like. Henceforth I would recommend this not only to fans of supernatural stories or TRUE BLOOD lovers, but equally to those who seek a strong female lead and a dash of melting romance that will leave you breathless!*I would like to thank the author for providing me with a physical copy of her debut novel to read & write a non-biased, honest review on*To find out more about LOST LIBRARY go to...[...]","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FP02M7IWUX34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPJ4MBU#wasThisHelpful","R3FP02M7IWUX34","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The initiation is coming...This exquisitely woven, beautifully mesmeric tale (almost dreamlike quality to it) about forbidden love literally melted my heart. As a fan of fantasy and a  `Twi-hard' who loves Young Adult romance, I found this beguiling book utterly irresistible and a perfect read! The new Elemental Enchanters series is a supremely singular edition to a hugely popular genre; filled with inspired concepts, intriguing ideas and fascinating premise all that is blended seamlessly together. I was most impressed by how 17 year old Ava and her group of outlandish friend's story grabbed my interest instantly, pulling me into a thrilling adventure reminiscent of X-Men for a younger audience! The human/ Immortal forbidden love between the main protagonists avoided all common clich√©s due to the nature of the world-building and extensive, detailed history that the author had incorporated within the complex narrative so as to make the story convincing and feel `real'. Fans of books about Witchcraft, magic and mystery (like for instance Beautiful Creatures) will simply love this compelling and highly readable supernatural story.Under a blood moon by Carrigan Richards is an enjoyable edition to the Young Adult paranormal romance/ fantasy genre and definitely a recommended read. It contains all the elements that you would typically associate with teenage Witchy tales and yet is written in a distinctive voice and warm style. I do consider that the storyline could have been expanded and more depth displayed within the fast-paced action scenes {that were a little snappy and choppy in places}, yet overall it is an accomplished first instalment within what I confidently predict being a successful and entertaining new series.*I would like to thank the author for providing me with an e-copy of her dazzling debut to read & write an honest, non-biased review on*My rating - 3.5 stars","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R64UQAH6SFNDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1495238199#wasThisHelpful","R64UQAH6SFNDR","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But what happens if that door is stuck? Some choices you are forced to confront, no matter how ugly or dangerous...'With an inclination for the mysterious, an evidently deep-rooted fascination with magic and a romantic at heart Kristin Groulx is an innate writer of supreme aptitude. The remarkably sensational start of this new series is simply breathtaking; containing great premise for the subsequent books to follow henceforth. New girl in town Alyson Bell reminded me of Lena Duchannes {from Beautiful Creatures}, whose shrouded in sinister secrets and yet you feel instantly drawn to her dark magnetism! A ghostly spirit supposedly haunts Hollow Creek town and so instantly the scene is set for a mesmeric supernatural mystery of creepy curiosities and intensity. With archaic ruined mansions, superstitions, curses and spells this young teenager is tasked with vanquishing an evil soul-stealing Vampire before the next full moon!! The well-written, complex plot is richly evocative and seeped in delicious detail that transports you to the heart of a most extraordinary world of otherworldly wonders.I simply loved how this book contained a beguiling blend of mystical ambience, magic and dazzling romance that melted my heart! The cast of captivating characters lured me into a deftly woven tale of supreme singularity and refreshing originality, which is a welcome edition to such a hugely popular genre. I wouldn't hesitate in adding this brilliant book to your reading list - - as I now plunge into book 2 with eager enthusiasm and pent-up anticipation for what treats await. Never before have I felt so inwardly shaken by a story that's unlike any YA Paranormal romance I have encountered before.

"4. 5 STARS!KHARISMA is an exquisitely multi-layered novel of extraordinary depth and everlasting impacting resonance that is truly impressive. Jenny L R Nay has produced an accomplished debut of substance that is excellently written and full of delicious details (descriptively evocative). Sat in suspense throughout unable to put this book down, I was swept into a mystical world of remarkable wonders of what dreams are made from. The hauntingly mesmeric, surrealistic narrative really tugged at the heartstrings and left me feeling as though a great wave of sensations had washed over me. The delicate ambience and striking settings transported me to a place of enchanting mystery, complete with mystical creatures and otherworldly beings of fascinating conception.At its core KHARISMA is a tale of two star-crossed lovers whose irreversible bond entwines, forming an impenetrable mark between yourself and their personal journey. It is however also a Young Adult novel that explores the importance of family and relationships through humility, self-discovery and love versus hate. Written with sincerity and candid truth-drawing acuteness the author is able to really `get under the skin' of her readers, by impressing upon the importance and power of believing in oneself. This tale left a lasting impression - - It was a highly memorable, unforgettably poignant read of magical enchantment and literary greatness!

"Being a normal family is a state of mind...Eccentric, outlandish ideas and creative concepts fill the pages of this supremely singular story for Young Adults & Teenagers. The well-written narrative explores pain, joy and growth with acute poignancy and a deeply resounding look at self-evaluation. I was shocked by such an impressive and rather extraordinary read, so full of heart and containing many valuable lessons that strike a chord in us all. `The Monster Junkies' approaches bullying, peer-pressure, adolescent decision-making and many other strong themes which teenagers encounter with sincerity and touching truism. I can recall those feelings and anxieties that many of the characters within this book experience when I was this age, and so found the storyline highly relatable and current. ""Everything you're looking for lies behind the mask you wear.""Blending together the bizarre and brilliant in a fantastical fusion of colour and imaginative flair this quirky, idiosyncratic debut is a compelling read like nothing I have encountered before! Crow and his sister Indigo are likeable protagonists whose assured sense of inner-self and identity is something to admire and draw courage from. Finding acceptance and approbation of self (and self worth) is one of the most powerful topics within YA literature that can be examined, and so I would recommend this sensational story as a noteworthy edition to the genre. Refreshing originality along with a modern `twist' {contemporary feel} makes this novel incredibly relevant for the 21st Century and target readership. Similarly to books like  `This song will save your life' this story highlights how we are all Monster Junkies: in that faÁade's threaten to overwhelm us and lead us from the path of finding true meaning in life.This empowering tale encourages readers of all ages to let go of insecurities and concerns as to how others perceive you, so as to expose your inner-self and strength of heart. Through the cast of spunky, engaging characters I was able to draw meaningful connotation and impacting depth from the plot  - - messages of hope, warmth and honesty. Not all about teenage angst and agony this story marks a clear path so that impressionable minds might not sway towards jealousy, but rather live life to the full through a comforting read. This striking story (with fantastic eye-catching, magical cover!) is a richly evocative tale that lingers on the mind and seeps into the soul...*I would like to thank  `Ark Watch Productions'  (www.arkwatchproductions) publishers and author Erik Daniel Shein and Theresa A.

The author's love of Vampire folklore {from Bram Stoker's Dracula to Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla and Polidori's The Vampyre} adds to the authenticity and substantial storyline full of realistic details. The convincing narrative contained such an exquisite blend of fact, fictitious creativity and subtle nuance so rich and beguiling as to paint an everlasting picture in your mind.(Quote: Stephenie Meyer's Twilight...)

"The Danforths of Lancashire: London Dawn by Murray Pura is an exquisite historical novel of remarkable premise and incredible profundity that shakes the soul. As a fan of the hugely successful drama Downton Abbey, I felt this well written and deliciously detailed story encapsulated the past perfectly on the page so as to present a vividly evocative and authentic picture. I was drawn into the dense plot that was so beautifully interwoven with passionate intensity, intriguing sub-plots and thought-provoking resonance as to keep me firmly glued to the page!  Within this complex story were well-developed characters, interesting, overlapping storylines and descriptive settings all of which made for a compelling and undeniably fantastic reading experience.Not customarily a reader of Historical- Christian fiction I was most surprised to find how readable this sensational sequel was, hence I cannot wait to discover books 1 & 2 in The Danforths of Lancashire series!Set within 1930's+ in England during the Second World War this impressive novel took me on an illuminating adventure of memorability into the past (that I shall not forget!). Character-driven at its core `London Dawn' may be a part of a series, although I enjoyed very much reading it as a stand-alone novel that was supremely easy-to-read. In this third instalment Murray Pura tells the compelling story of a loving family who face tough times to come, as Hitler and his Nazi regime are on the move from Poland to France, heading significantly towards Great Britain. The sense of impending danger looming on the close horizon adds to the nail-biting suspense, with the War deepening as those fighting for their Country battle on with the aim of preserving freedom.Anyone interested in ambitious literary works of fiction related to WW2 {i.e. Students, historians, bibliophiles etc.} Or those who appreciate the finer qualities of the genre; for instance Jane Austen or classics, I highly recommend this distinctly impacting novel & series. Melting romance, human tragedy and poignant exhibitions of immorality all highlight the inhumane acts of Warfare and how the Second World War left such a lasting impression upon families and society - - so as to shape our world today.*As a devout Christian and having my own blood relatives fight and fall in both WW1 and also WW2, I was able to connect to this novel on a very personal level. *I won a signed, physical copy + postcard of Murray Pura's extraordinary book ""The Danforths of Lancashire: London Dawn"" (book 3 in a series) through a first-read giveaway on Goodreads.To find out more...

"The Circle of Six is the first book within a remarkable new series that explores an archaic pagan myth surrounding Eostra day (Easter day). This fantastical imaginative tale explores the rebirth of Earth by attempting to answer those multi-layered questions that have intrigued and baffled us for thousands of years, in a totally unique and illuminating way! Incredibly detailed and vast world building that's mind-blowing, it is evidently clear how Dan Sanders draws inspiration from classic epic fantasy writers {such as for instance master mythmaker JRR Tolkien}. I loved the strikingly beautiful cover that incorporated Elvish language, plus the exquisite interior illustrations that made this book a gem to behold and treasure.Book 1: the circle of Six is a wonderfully wrought, compelling adventure that's not only action-packed but which takes you ultimately on a hauntingly unforgettable journey of self-discovery and enlightenment. Profound resonance moved me inwardly, as I was swept away by the powerful character-driven narrative that spoke to the heart with sincerity and truth-drawing depth. Emily's Quest is a tale of high adventure, grief, fear and friendship with the main protagonist (at the core of the storyline) proving that against all the odds her inner strength and indomitable spirit will shine forth.

Similarly to my favourite author of all-time JRR Tolkien I loved how the author used the pagan myths as foundations for a fantasy tale of refreshing idiosyncratic voice, which appeals to a wide readership both adults and younger readers alike.I am stunned by such an ambitiously grand literary work of creative flair and quirky panache, ideal for a children's bedtime story or likewise the bibliophile seeking a sensational story of complexity. Emily's quest is a satisfying, fulfilling and entertaining read with underlying nuance relating to faith (religious?

"As a Twi-hard and romantic reader my heart was melted by this hauntingly mesmeric novel! Angels and Demons and archaic Vampire lores are blended beautifully into a richly complex narrative that's original, eclectic and takes a new spin on common preconceptions. Angel's breath goes beyond boundaries by not only including classic elements of paranormal fantasy, but by interweaving entirely new concepts and singular slants of remarkable divergence. Not only is this truly extraordinary story a fascinatingly detailed read, but it is also a novel of thought-provoking depth and resounding profundity so as to really make a lasting impact.

"This quirky, highly original thriller is a vividly evocative novel of extraordinary wonder and exquisite depth. Full of dry wit and irony the entertaining narrative swept me off into a darkly sinister, supernatural world of wonder and enchantment! The truly inspired concepts within Ben Aaronovitch's remarkable debut captured my imagination; blending together chilling crime and archaic magic within a 21st century backdrop. London is my home and so I felt at ease exploring the iconic places and landmarks, which were so acutely captured on the page with that added touch of mystery. I was ever so impressed by such a refreshingly innovative literary masterpiece of pure genius and substance, which I confidently predict becoming a new bestseller for this genre.RIVERS OF LONDON is the first instalment within the new PC Grant series; a book that blends together the author's love of London with touches of tension set within a spellbinding, mystical backdrop. Aaronovitch provides an exclusive glimpse into the fascinating and fantastical underbelly of the city of London that feels entirely believable and convincing. As chaotic events unfold to shock and surprise, I undertook both a Geography lesson as well as a riveting read of memorability and magical moments. The richly detailed, sweeping narrative I felt was reminiscent of Deborah Harkness' book `A Discovery of Witches' as it similarly contained those elements from classic fantasy fiction within a modern setting.As I surveyed all of London before me from high up on the royal opera house balcony that faces Covent Garden market, I could clearly envisage in my mind PC Grant's shadowy underworld just waiting to be discovered...I was compulsively addicted to this terrific tale and glued to the pages for many hours on end, to both my astonishment and overwhelming delight!

"J A Southard's idiosyncratic sci-fi story encapsulates the eccentricity of the genre, with a contemporary milieu that targets the 21st Century readership. The remarkable concept of HIVE QUEEN was truly inspired and well conceived, due to the depth and detail (regarding background history, rules/ traditions etc.) that the author delves into. Capturing perfectly on the page all the elements within a typical Young Adult novel you would expect to find, including sparkling romance and teenage dramas, the author has evidently produced a masterful debut. Containing cool feminist undertones and a healthy dose of teen angst, many readers will be able to relate and connect on a personal level to the spunky main protagonist and truth-drawing narrative.`Queen and Commander' is reminiscent of FIREFLY for YA readers, as it balances spectacular world building with character depth for a convincing, credible outcome. Unprepared, impulsive and naÔve the cast of `real' characters were simply fantastic and so made the story seem more authentic and easy to envisage. Told in a refreshing voice, J A Southard's addictive first instalment (in a series) was an engrossing, unputdownable read of scope and creativity. Gwyn and Victor's magnetic relationship wrought with such impassioned intensity melted my heart, as too did many of the other outlandish and rather quirky, spunky characters! It is the main protagonist's flaws and vulnerability that pulled me into the plot, and made me care about what happened so as to leave me on tenterhooks for book 2.Containing elements akin to Divergent the multilayered, intricately woven narrative was beguiling and will undoubtedly catch the attention of any YA Sci-fi fan. Cymraeg (Welsh language) was a twist of the unexpected, as too were many other intriguing ideas and metaphorical lyricism that made the story so different from the norm!

"the soul is eternal...In this chilling contemporary thriller an inspired supernatural undertone sets the scene for a hauntingly unforgettable reading experience of enlightenment! Secrets of the past are blended together; from 19th Century London with notorious Jack The Ripper to ancient China during the Han dynasty. The delicately interwoven narrative is wonderfully complex and detailed; so as to keep you guessing throughout and on tenterhooks as to what more shocking revelations may unfold. Entwined within a labyrinth of character-studies that cleverly interconnected, I was sucked into a scintillating story of substance and deep philosophical wonderment. The scope of the plot is vast and visually `epic' as though imagined for the big screen!I felt like this novel was a mixture of modern, 21st Century super-sleuth SHERLOCK and ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" (with hidden clues and perplexing puzzles) all wrapped up into one addictive masterwork. Lindahl's unique perspective opens up such possibilities and really allows you as a reader to personally place yourself within the plot, thus you're left feeling enlightened and in awe.

"K M Woodard's debut fantasy novel ""Wizdom and Pandora: The quest for the blood jewel"" transported me into a richly evocative, imaginative world of sheer scope. Encapsulating all the elements of fantasy fiction including a concoction of creatures, flamboyant characters and remarkable settings this is an assured literary work of substance. Fire-breathing Dragons. Wise Wizards, magic and mythological references all intermingle within a far-reaching, atmospheric backdrop of eye-opening imaginative wonder as to leave you aghast!Indie novels are not usually at the top of my list for noteworthy, accomplished works of fiction (as you often find something lacking in the detail/ storyline or editing), and so I was quite taken aback by how well written this book was. Intentionally targeted towards the younger reader/ middle-grade, the simplistic writing style and easy-to-digest narrative I feel wouldn't appeal to Adult fantasy readers...or myself in regards to this (hence my lower than 5* rating). Despite being a classic children's fantasy story, I was seemingly surprised by how in-depth the storyline was and how packed full of detail, background history and depth.Taken on a spellbinding, magical journey and epic quest full of danger, secrets, sorcery and evil I was thrust into a thrilling read that I'll never forget! Wizdom and Pandora are fantastic main protagonists who have found a place in my heart, and I am so pleased to have won a signed copy of this brilliant book","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBV9VPVH9K79S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1468538020#wasThisHelpful","RBV9VPVH9K79S","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was delighted to discover this refreshingly innovative debut through Strange Chemistry publishers; who have an array of tantalizing treats and addictive reads! This is a fast-paced, action-packed adventure that's richly evocative and containing a cast of vibrant characters. Targeted towards the younger YA/ teenage reader, Eliza Crewe captures the hearts and minds of her audience with a compelling, deftly interwoven saga of uniqueness and interesting concepts. Her ideas were wonderfully conceived on the page and I found myself being sucked into this convincing tale, which built in tension and suspense right up to the most thrilling conclusion. Fans of fantasy and paranormal fiction will find `Cracked' a markedly `new' edition to a hugely popular & highly competitive genre.Favourite quotes- ""I eat souls. The packaging can be tricky, but fortunately I am blessed with special skills to pry my meals from their pesky shells. My teeth rip skin; my jaws snap bones.

Unlike those common clich√©s or recognizable `love triangles' within the majority of YA fiction, Cracked is a supremely singular story of uniqueness and creativity like nothing I have encountered before to compare. My presuppositions regarding this book were decidedly far from the mark, as I had thought that Cracked would contain similarities to Rachel Vincent's `Soul Screamers' series. Exceeding and surpassing all expectations with an entertaining plot this edgy, quirky tale was an astonishing surprise! Throw in demon hordes and a (surprisingly) secret society with a healthy dollop of carnage and this book ceased to be simply a distraction...and more of a compulsively hypnotic page-turner!I am so excited about the new ""Soul Eaters"" series and look forward with zealous enthusiasm as to book 2.*I would like to thank the author and Strange Chemistry / Angry Robot publishers for providing me with a physical copy of `Cracked' to read and write a non-biased, honest review.*","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IY5N64EHHIC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G8S6LGU#wasThisHelpful","R1IY5N64EHHIC2","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a keen equestrian enthusiast and a pony-mad child (whose love of books began with Bonnie Bryant's The Saddle Club, Heartland, Jinny and Canterwood Crest), I was inexplicably drawn to this exciting new story for YA's/ Middle-grade readers. Chris Platt clearly captures not only the strong bond between horse and human that's so magnetically alluring for many, but the responsibilities of owning a horse/ pony of your own. This is an ideal book for any pony-mad child and all those who are thinking about horse ownership, as it's an insightful and wonderfully illuminating read of profundity and depth.With a cast of unforgettable characters (and horses!) I was sucked into an intense storyline of multi-layered meaning and addictive magnetism. Totally unputdownable and highly readable `Storm Gazer' is a touching tale that speaks to the heart with warmth and sincerity, as the author gets `under the skin' of her characters to expose such realistic emotion and thought. The enormous (literally and figuratively speaking) responsibility that 13 yr old Jordan McKenzie takes on in the form of gorgeous Percharon mare, encapsulates the ups & downs and emotional connection that compels horse owners to buy a horse.This is not only an entertaining read but an educational one, including aspects of horse care for heavy horse breeds, in addition to exploring horse care and riding for all children. Horses give us love and confidence that's unrequited, unconditional and very special...I would highly recommend this gripping page-turner to both young and older readers alike, as a fantastic horse story containing profound inner resonance and depth that transcends boundaries as to your typical `pony tale'.

"A divine secret, a loyal protector And a forbidden love...REVELATION is a darkly sinister, supernatural story of hypnotic profundity and fervent intensity. I lost myself entirely within this compulsively addictive, chilling tale of inspired imaginative concepts and fantastic characters. The author blends together a cleverly woven, magnetic mix of heartrending romance and mystery for a truly original outcome. As a fan of this genre and authors such as Charlaine Harris, Kerri Arthur and PC Cast, expectations were high as I delved into this exciting debut novel. Therefore it was a delight to behold such an exquisite, multi-layered narrative of brilliant detail and substance! Within the deftly woven plot are innumerable twists and turns that kept me sat on the edge of my seat in suspense throughout, additionally to the dynamic action and shocking secrets. Anyone seeking a sensational, scintillating story of memorability and a dramatic, explosive ending that will leave you flabbergasted just has to add this to their to-read shelf.In book 1 of the Revelation Series...Eve begins her freshman year at College blissfully unaware of the magnitude of unexpected events that are about to unfold. Her future, family and life are about to change so drastically that all notions and perceptions on `the norm' (in life) are utterly misshapen. The `love triangle' between Eve and the dark, enigmatic Gage versus mysteriously detached Asher is enthralling and tugs at the heartstrings with intent. In this extraordinarily evocative, truth-drawing journey of one girl's self-discovery you cannot help but be inwardly moved and shaken by such a story.(Quote) ""Asher stops in front of me, bends down and forces me to look him in the eye. My eyelids flutter just the tiniest bit at his body's nearness to mine. Damn traitorous body.  The corners of his mouth lift smugly as moves closer. So close I can feel his minty warm breath on my lips. Chuckling quietly, he takes off his jacket and my heart begins doing back flips. His shoulders are really broad up close. Slowly, he leans forward,  wrapping his leather coat over my shoulders and engulfing me with warmth and his intoxicating scent...""REVELATION is a story that highlights the meaning of sacrifice and of true love, speaking to the soul with resonance and meaningful insight as to make it all the more personal to you. As fantastic main protagonist Eva stands on the pinnacle of a greatly consequential turn of events that lead to her `destiny', it makes one evaluate the weight of love and how it holds such sway over our choices in life. As the exciting first instalment of a new fantasy series for both YA's and the older reader, I was most astonished by how such a work of fiction could leave such an indentation upon my memory.Randi Cooley Wilson is an accomplished author whose debut novel is an assured, masterpiece of great premise and awe-inspiring creativity.

"Having been blown-away by Markelle Grabo's incredible debut novel ""The Elf Girl"" I could not wait to delve into the next instalment of this exciting series!  `The spell master'  is a brilliantly conceived creation and fantastic follow-up, full of fun and thrilling drama that takes you on the most extraordinary adventure. Addictive and unputdownable, book 2 is a wonderfully wrought saga containing a cast of captivating characters whose magnetism lures you into such a gripping tale. I did not think that the author could produce a sequel of such awe-inspiring profundity and depth, yet ""The Spell Master"" is even better than all I could have imagined or hoped for. What I loved so much was the heartrending love triangle between Ramsey, Nathan and Stellan that made me melt and literally (reminiscent of Stephanie Meyer's twilight) had my emotions tugged in two directions constantly! Another additional layer of depth was added to book 2 and so I cannot contain my optimism as I predict an explosive, unforgettable ending for this terrific trilogy. Only one KEY can unlock the secret...In book 2 the romantic elements of Ramsey's story (aka. Elf Girl) steps up a notch, with her heart being torn into two pieces by her boyfriend who is away at war to alluring Elf with a strangely sarcastic sense of humor. As dark and dangerous times lie ahead, Ramsey is thrust headlong into a dynamic adventure that will test both her magical abilities as well as her strength of character to the limits. Character-driven at its core and full of fervent intensity, sparkling magnetism and heated rivalry this sensational sequel is a real page-turner.Once again I would like to thank the author for providing me with an e-copy of her brilliant book to read (& provide a non-biased, honest review on).

"In a land of myth, and a time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young Elf. Her name is...Ramsey.Plunging into a darkly mesmeric world of sweeping imaginative concepts and awe-inspiring vision, I encountered a concoction of characters and creatures amid an enchanting backdrop of singularity. The journey I took into this fantasy realm was one of impressive epicness and memorability that ultimately left me inwardly shaken. Not since JK Rowling or Phillip Pullman have I encountered a remarkably distinctive children's/ Young Adult fantasy story of such divergence to all that is commonly found within this competitive, popular (and rather overcrowded) genre! As fantastic main protagonist Ramsey set out to save her sister, unveil her past and discover herself...I could not help but be compulsively pulled along by such an addictive and intriguing multi-layered tale.How many books are there about Elves? Certainly not many despite being a common creature within both high/ epic fantasy fiction and children's literature! This was the main element that makes this incredibly exciting new series standout a mile from other books, and so I give sanction for you to behold something supremely singular.I did not expect to be so overwhelmed by such a well-crafted and brilliantly realised storyline nor by the intensity within the extensive narrative. Not only did this dazzling debut exceed expectations but surpass them by the refreshing originality and avoidance of common clich√©s. Ramsey is a likeable heroine whom I instantly warmed to as she faced many difficult challenges along her path of self-discovery, and grew and developed into a strong individual. This undeniably addictive adventure will delight fans of fantasy both young and old, and so I cannot thank Markelle Grabo enough for providing me with an e-copy of ""The Elf Girl"" to read.I eagerly await delving into book 2 with keen interest...","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28L2V3URAVQDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006DNYNII#wasThisHelpful","R28L2V3URAVQDI","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fantastic YA paranormal romance is hauntingly beautiful and full of heartrending poignancy. With eager enthusiasm I kept turning the pages, lost within a wonderfully wrought tale of emotive connotation and lasting memorability. The characters were intriguing and the love interest was so enchanting, I could not help but melt over these two star-crossed lovers! Book 3 of this well-written series is a compelling, engaging read full of intensity and passion all deftly woven into the action-packed plot.The inspired creation of `The Sary' (a race of Angel-type beings who protect humanity, namely from committing suicide) is simply brilliant, and so I loved finding out more about this within the novel. Gabby and Jassen are two well-crafted characters whose profound connection and relationship is undeniably striking, and so it is very hard not to become entangled within their story.There are a few grammatical errors within the writing and in places I felt there could have been a bit more detailed description, to balance out the action & dialogue. Overall I was kept glued to the pages throughout this highly readable novel and loved the convincing saga that unravelled, to reveal unexpected surprises and `twists'. In this YA/ teen romance you gain an insight into the consequences of immortality and a glimpse at how fragile life is, additionally to how love transcends all boundaries. Surrender the Sky is a stand alone title that follows COLORS LIKE MEMORIES and THE CHEMISTRY OF FATE, with cameos from several of the characters in the first books! It will be available in May wherever ebooks are sold!Emotionally impacting and wonderfully wrought this stunning sequel is a gripping read and one that I thoroughly enjoyed. Meradeth Houston's spectacular story is a brilliant page-turner and one that has sparked an interest as to the subsequent novels within this series.

"Having had my doubts with book 1 of this new Young Adult sci-fi series, I was pleasantly surprised to encounter such a brilliant sequel and similarly a sensational ending to what has been an unforgettable rollercoaster ride. Some tales take time to get `under your skin' and this one was at first slower than what I regularly read, and yet without doubt contained within was an eclectic concoction of intensity, drama and inspired ideas that fused magnetically together. I wouldn't hesitate in re-reading `The Bloom Trilogy' in an instant and recommending it as a refreshingly original creation with highly imaginative elements. Furiously fast and action-packed this scintillating story is a perfectly realised fitting ending to what has been an extraordinary adventure!In book 3 of the Bloom trilogy -COLTON ROSS is taken to the villain Alistair's jungle base, where he is to become the prey in a deadly game of survival--but Colton is not alone in the jungle. Alistair has been collecting other Sources and Conduits for the hunt. To save the lost, Colton must turn the tide of battle and put an end to Alistair's psychotic plans once and for all...A P Kensey's comic-book style story is ideal for the younger/ teenage reader who enjoys explosive danger, action and adventure within a fabulous futuristic setting. I was swept along at an almighty pace that led to the most mind-blowing, tense climatic ending that caught me completely unawares. I certainly did not envisage how this tantalizingly tempting tale would end as it did, and so I commend the author for such a spellbinding finale to her intense narrative. Character-driven at its core, the main protagonists grew and developed so much throughout this instalment of the trilogy so that when I had finished reading I was left feeling a strong sense of emptiness that their journey had sadly come to an end. Anyone who is able to place themselves within the plot alongside the characters, is a sure-fire sign of how well written a novel is with its truth-drawing sincerity and realism.A thoroughly entertaining, enjoyable read that I would urge you to seek out and stick with!

"This compelling contemporary romance is a deeply beguiling tale of true love, heartrending truism and sincerity that speaks to the soul. Full of emotive, truth-drawing and often rather raw candidness I was touched and moved by Jezebel's journey. Unlike the clich√©, stereotypical `chick-lit' fluffy romance between two people this novel contained a deeper layer of poignancy and expression. The vast personal journey of growth and self-discovery that the main protagonist embarks upon is so remarkable that it really reached out to me on an intimate and resounding level. Never before has an author addressed such controversial, challenging issues and managed to instil such a strong sense of `self' within a story that I could almost extract from the words a intimate response.With its affecting quality and in-depth characterization, tender romance and vivid imagery this wonderful tale is truly sublime! The connection between patient, tender Matty and vulnerable Jezzy is so beautifully mesmerizing that you cannot help but become entangled within the storyline and the delicately interwoven narrative. Dreamlike fluid prose flows through you as an intoxicatingly heady aura... I was reduced to tears with my soul shaken by this empathetic love story, about healing and enrichment. ""My beautiful, vulnerable, heartbroken Jezebel..."" ""No matter how she tested his boundaries, no matter what buttons she tried to push, Matty never once wavered. So instead he became her soft place to fall, a treasure to be cherished.""As a tormented soul consumed with grief and guilt, Jezebel is a true heroine whom I greatly admired and was able to empathize with so easily. Alongside the broken promises, excruciating pain and dreams for a brighter future is a clear message of hope and of how spontaneous unexpected events can alter and define our lives. The strong bond between humans and equally between our animals and us is irrevocably as binding as our souls inside of us, hence I could also warm to the stunning Stallion `The Reverend' (whose now nestled in a corner of my heart forever!). I would highly recommend this exquisitely wrought, haunting story to readers of romance and those seeking a sensationally insightful exploration in life.A J Nuest focuses on some tough issues, for instance abuse and depression and so I would regard this as you encounter some perceptive, sensitive parts. *I would like to thank the author for providing me with an e-copy of her enchanting and thoroughly enjoyable novel to read & review.4.5 Stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S8KKHUUU545/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WG2XRG#wasThisHelpful","R3S8KKHUUU545","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Spellbindingly sinister supernatural themes are interlaced within a contemporary YA story of self-discovery. With the main protagonist's journey of growth & development full of heartfelt sincerity and profundity, I was able to connect and relate to `Shade' and her story. The deftly interwoven storyline is full of nail-biting tension, suspense and twists that keep you in constant wonderment as to what may happen next. Shade (aka. Galactic Shade Griffin) is an intriguing character, whose magnetic liability and warmth instantly captured my heart and made me care about her character. Well-crafted characters pulled me into a deliciously addictive, compelling saga that was full of inspired ideas and interesting concepts. The author cleverly fuses together a diverse mix of paranormal mystery with high school/ teen drama and family drama that's refreshing.Unlike typical YA Fantasy novels this supremely singular story is not only set within a realistic, modern backdrop (so no other worlds or signs of Wizards and Dragons) but it also addresses many issues that teenagers can relate to. Such as for instance bullying, family, friendships, romance and most notably finding a sense of self at such a testing age/ time in life. Nostalgic thoughts were brought to the fore, as I was able to empathize with Shade and the trials that she encounters, which ultimately make her a stronger person. Marilyn peake is an author who reaches out to her target readership and `gets under the skin' of her characters, so as to leave you emotionally moved and inwardly touched by this tale.Truth-drawing and containing thought-provoking, meaningful connotation this sensational debut novel is an impressive work of fiction. I was literally left feeling a sense of fulfilment, satisfaction and despondency as the book came to an end...with thoughts lingering on in my mind. As beautiful as the eye-catching cover `Shade' is a sensational, awesome story of unforgettable premise and remarkable depth of mind-blowing epicness!

"Similarly to master mythmaker, the legendary JRR Tolkien this truly remarkable debut novel is a masterwork of refreshing originality and breathtaking scope. What the deftly woven narrative lacks in profundity and intricate details (as to the world-building), more than makes up in imaginative concepts and inventive ideas. The use of metaphorical nuance as an undertone to Kasper Beaumont's fantasy world is brilliant, as it enhances the believability and realistic `feel' to his creation. I was swept away into a mystical realm of Halflings and curious creatures; from Elves to Dwarves, Sorcerers and dark enemies (as found in ""The Hobbit""). I felt sure that the author draws his inspiration and concepts from children's classic fantasy tales such as The Hobbit and Narnia, yet with a distinctly contemporary twist and idiosyncratic style.Elven Jewel is the first instalment within `The Hunters of Reloria' trilogy and an exciting new edition to the genre, targeted towards the younger reader (middle-grade/ YA) and yet is something that can equally be enjoyed by adult alike. This fantastical creation containing myth, magic and fairies is an adventure story of a lifetime, which takes you on a dark perilous quest into the unknown that you'll never forget!*The purity and simplicity of this story is what makes it stand out within such a crowded, hugely popular (and competitive) genre in which many self-published works can get overlooked.As far-removed as one could possibly imagine from say for instance those darker, grittier fantasy novels like George RR Martin's epic sequence  `A Song of Ice & Fire' (which is something many fantasy readers of the 21st Century seem to expect these days). The light prose is slanted on the naÔve side, so as to appeal to the younger reader and so expectations are met if you seek a sensational `children's' fantasy that's wide reaching and extensive. This captivating and hugely entertaining, riveting read was a pleasant delight and one that I would highly recommend. *I would like to thank the author for providing me with an e-copy of his debut novel to read & review. *[...]","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDPF4GMIHWVHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPQVEJC#wasThisHelpful","RDPF4GMIHWVHA","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A P Kensey's novel Fade is an action-packed comic book style adventure for the young adult/ teen reader, reminiscent of `Artemis Fowl' and `X-Men'. Swept off on a thrilling journey that's highly imaginative and compelling, I was greatly impressed by this brilliant book which I felt was much better than AP Kensey's debut. The detailed narrative contained a lot more depth and substance, with the extraordinary world-building a concoction of wonder and enchantment.

Left feeling a bit deflated and somewhat disappointed by book 1, I was unsure of whether this series would improve as the plot thickened and the author expanded the tale. I was therefore pleasantly surprised to encounter a multi-layered profundity to the story, as the characters grew and developed in this scintillating second instalment. I would advise that you `stick with it' as book 2 certainly improves and enlarges upon the slightly simplistic (basic) storyline as encountered in BLOOM.As a middle-grade/ tween novel this trilogy is certainly a worthwhile read and one that will keep you entertained for many hours. As a fantasy tale it is clever and interesting, with many elements of brilliance amid the drama as to keep your attention firmly fixed to the pages.

"Book 2 in the Exilon 5 trilogy is a well-crafted, imaginative tale of mind-blowing epicness and inspired originality. The multi-layered sub-plots that entwine to form the incredibly detailed narrative, keep you glued to the pages of such a vastly complex story. Following on from book 1 (Becoming Human), I plunged deeper into a world of Indigenes versus humans in a battle for survival full of heart pounding intensity and danger. Lives hang in the balance, sanity is pushed to the limits and the selfish desires of the few and powerful continue to threaten the existence of the Indigenes in this thrilling instalment! I was kept sat in suspense throughout, clutching the pages as I was sucked into this deliciously dark sweeping storyline of vast premise and scope. `Altered Reality' is a truly remarkable novel and equally as engaging and addictive as book 1...perhaps even more so!Eliza Green is a accomplished writer whose extraordinary creative flair and concepts continue to astound and intrigue.

"Book 2 in the Tanith Prophecy series is a scintillating story that's furiously fast-paced and packed with wonderful descriptive details. Delving into a land of darkness, black magic, heroes and hope I was once again swept away by the compelling, well-written saga and fantastic plot. Once again Leandra Martin fuses together an eclectic mix of high/ epic fantasy elements with heartrending poignancy and overwhelming emotion, so as to really tug at the reader's subconscious and lure you into this literary masterpiece! Deliciously dark and full of fervent intensity, anyone who loves an engaging adventure within a world of wonder will find this story highly readable. The unexpected twists within the narrative left me aghast, as I did not think it possible for this novel to exceed my high expectations from having read (and been blown away) by book 1.Following on from Dark One Rising in book 2 you are able to connect even more with the characters, whom you have grown attached to and in doing so becoming deeply entangled within the story. I was sucked into the nail-bitingly mesmerizing saga due to unavoidably caring for the characters, and so when a tragedy or something unforeseen occurs it felt all the more `real'. The beautifully multi-layered, woven narrative contains evocative nuance and such substance as to grab your attention and never let go.

"Last Light Falling: The Covenant (book 1) is a hauntingly mesmeric story of profound depth and a sinister `surreal' quality. It speaks to the soul by capturing quintessentially the fragility of human life and a remarkable perception on death, God and all that lies beyond our current existence. I felt like I was floating in a sea of subconscious thoughts as the events within the book highlighted how one might personally reflect upon their own life span. By blending together an eclectic mix of genre J E Plemons' novel will appeal to fans of YA fiction as well as chilling horror, sci-fi and post-apocalyptic/ distopian. Religious references add substance to the story, as too does the epic journey that the main characters Arena and Gabriel embark upon. Not all heroes are one's who (clich√©) `save the world' as some can show a fragility as you or I, yet it is their actions in the final days of the world that hold such impacting resonance.Here's an intriguing, philosophical question...If your fate has already been chosen for you, would you change it?.One part of this extraordinary story that I can take with me, is how it is not what we say or do that matters as it is ultimately our choices that define who we really are.In a world filled with unspeakable tragedy, darkness and a lingering wickedness that taunts us 15 yr old Arena accepts the destiny before her with courage.

"This wonderfully wrought fantasy is intricately detailed and full of original, unique concepts and ideas. It was instantly evident how the author has drawn inspiration from many highly recognizable writers of this genre; namely the legendary mythmaker JRR Tolkien {who embodies classic fantasy fiction} to the more modern, contemporary slants such as works by Brooks and Luke Skull. The delicately woven plot is richly evocative and packed with fervent intensity that's acutely magnetic and wonderfully dramatic. Fast-paced and action packed, the sweeping storyline kept me sat in suspense throughout with the thrilling dynamic events leaving me breathless. A character-driven narrative through-and-through, the human-centred storyline is one that speaks to the soul with truism and which captures the essence of humanity on the page. The gritty, rawness to this brutal tale was a surprise as too was the medieval backdrop that lent towards a more `Joe Abercrombie' approach to fantasy {rather than the classic Wizards/ magic etc.}. In the ancient land of the Realms, where armies clash and heroes arise, only the most cunning and courageous can redeem a war torn land from certain annihilation...This searing story is furiously fast-paced, pulling you into a remarkable tale of fascinating characters and inventive conception.Igor Ljubuncic's sensational debut novel is an impressively ambitious work of scope and substance, and a full-on fantasy story that appeals to all ages. By deftly interlacing parallel plots, Igor forms a layered tale that transcends boundaries by entwining characters, settings and action into one extraordinary and majestic masterwork. The bloodthirsty battles, violence and volatility form the backbone of such a convincingly believable saga that you're able to clearly envisage it in your mind. The first instalment within the lost words series is undeniably well written, and so leaves me in tense anticipation as to the subsequent stories that follow. Fans of both classic high/ epic fantasy fiction and more contemporary, eclectic works will find `The Betrayed' an addictive read of immense premise.4. 5 Stars*I would like to thank the author for providing me with a physical copy of his novel to read & write an honest and non-biased review on*","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R241SDG2MF82Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VXJH8U#wasThisHelpful","R241SDG2MF82Y3","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an avid reader and lover of high fantasy, I was incredibly excited upon encountering this masterwork of great imaginative premise. Exceeding all expectations, Journey of shadows is set within a richly imagined world containing classic creatures (Witches, Wizards, Sorcerers and all kinds of creatures of darkness) and sweeping settings. The intricately detailed map of `Pal√¢dnith' is wonderful as it compliments the remarkable world-building perfectly; transporting you to a place of magical wonder. Solid, in-depth background history regarding each individual character adds to the realism of the story and convincing plot. The background information on the epic battle between the Sentor√¢n and the Esquill is enough to make an idea about how magic works in this world. The complexity of the plot is so intricately woven and fascinating; I was able to completely lose myself within the assured, confident writing.The attention grabbing and intense narrative takes you on an unforgettable adventure full of danger and exploration. Having felt so attached to the characters on their journey, as they grew and developed throughout the book I was left disappointed by the rather abrupt ending which seemed to cut the story short. It just...ended. I am certain that the author could have `fleshed out' the last chapter, as it would have if not been the most sensational story reminiscent of JRR Tolkien or Terry Brooks. Hugely ambitious and containing such scope and substance this outstanding character-driven fantasy was an enthralling read and one that took me totally by surprise! As a self-published author I was so impressed by Sam J Charlton's writing.This epic adventure of discovery, fear, courage and bravery with a great destiny awaiting three men is a story of magnificence and awe-inspiring proportions. The magic of Paladnith (a land ruled by ruthless Lords) is captivating, and I could quite happily remain in this magical world. Spectacular landscapes take your breath away while exquisite descriptive passages paint a vivid picture of such a totally unique world.

"This dazzling debut novel is an exciting edition to the genre, as it combines an eclectic mix of Victorian-esque glamour and futuristic technology in an exquisite historical backdrop. The thrilling drama and fast-paced, sweeping narrative took me on the most astonishing adventure of wondrous delights. Amid a world of technological enlightenment and innovation was an acutely contrasting character {Sam Bowe}, who kept the entire storyline well grounded with knives (instead of guns) and spunk & eccentricity! Set in 1810, the familiarity of the recognizable world that moves into a more typical steampunk Victorian era was captured perfectly, creating a vibrant world of fascinating modernization.The mind-blowing scope and premise of this spectacular series left me in awe, as too did the detailed descriptions that brought the past so authentically to life. This `deep' book is one that you can lose yourself within; from the dramatic unfolding events to the lavish details. Fans of classics such as `The League of extraordinary Gentlemen' and `The Golden Compass' will simply love Jeffrey Cook {& co-contributor Sarah Symonds) brilliant story set within an alternate reality. ""I imagine they were quite surprised to find a woman armed with a pair of mismatched knives, in a torn dress and her undershirts, fighting on their behalf...""- Excerpted from the letters of Gregory Conan Watts to his fianceeVolume one in the dawn of steam trilogy is a highly readable novel and one that leads the way in a fantastic genre, due to the in-depth world building and intricately detailed plot.

"Anyone seeking a sensational story with extraordinary world building and breathtaking imaginative vision will find this novel an unexpected delight. Atypically set within a modern-day setting this highly unusual fantasy blends seamlessly together current, contemporary fiction with a sprinkling of otherworldly enchantment. Due to the 21st century setting that hides secrets about magic, it makes the well-crafted storyline even more convincing and believable as you can relate to the characters easily. The fine line between fantasy and reality is so beautifully blended that the dark Wizards feel a very much a part of life; and so I found it easy to lose myself within Sharon Bayliss' convincing tale. `The December People' is a series that will appeal to fans of edgy Urban fantasy and ""Charmed"", who like how magic is interwoven within the fabric of our own existence...therefore making it seem all the more real as a part of our world! (Opposed to classic fantasy worlds).David Vandergraff is a loving husband and caring father whose clever fa√ßade hides beneath a dark, sinister secret. He is a Wizard with an enigma surrounding a second family; all of who are Dark Wizards like himself. Not only does David have to come to terms with the realization that everyone he loves, including himself, may be evil but that his has a challenging task ahead to keep his family togetherThis character-driven, poignant tale is about love, loss and family as it highlights the inner-strength we all are in possession of. The intriguing concept and breathtaking premise of this story is utterly phenomenal, and I was certainly not expecting such an engrossing read that kept me sat in suspense throughout. The heartfelt sincerity and warmth within the deftly woven narrative reaches out to the reader, so as to touch you inwardly and make you care about the characters and their personal journey. I liked how the main protagonist grew and developed throughout the book, with the hardships that tested him only making him a stronger person. Hugely impacting and inspiring this spellbinding story is wonderfully woven and brilliantly realized on the page, so as to leave you with memories that linger on the mind for a long time afterward.The characters in this book feel very real due to the profundity of depth and emotional resonance within the storyline. Deliciously darkchilling tension, the bleak backdrop of this novel is hypnotically magnetic and so you are drawn into this strange new world. At times I almost forgot that I was reading fantasy fiction, as the family drama and characterization seemed to take precedence.4.5 Stars!*I would like to thank Sharon Bayliss for providing me with a physical copy of her new novel ""Destruction"" to read & review. *","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWVVGAA0OT9OQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JO0GDRG#wasThisHelpful","RWVVGAA0OT9OQ","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Founded on facts this acute, profoundly evocative fictional work is something that lingers upon the mind. Inspired by the tragic murder of Sophie Lancaster this heartrending story is about love, loss, hate and forgiveness and about standing up against prejudice and believing in who we are. Impacting and full of thought-provoking resonance, I was struck by how Alan Gibbons' extraordinary novel touched me and left me most surprised. I was not expecting such intensity, rawness and gritty content to affect me in such a way as to reduce me to tears {as a result of becoming attached to the characters}. This `deep' book is a fitting testimony of Sophie Lancaster's unjustifiable, horrifying murder and is certainly a very BOLD and striking tribute. I respect Alan Gibbons so much, as I noted how personal this fictional literary work was. Containing horrific truism and sincerity, HATE honours all victims of bigotry and prejudice with reverence.For reflection, there is an additional section at the back of the book on pointers to take note of once you have read the story. It explores one's identity and self-evaluation, as well as the power of music, groups {social} and the importance of family. All these things hold such sway within our lives and even more so within teenagers.I was able to connect on a personal level with the fantastic main protagonist and empathize & relate to her, as nostalgic thoughts were brought to the forefront of my mind. During such turbulent teenage years it is easy to lose sight of yourself, as outside influences can impress upon a receptive mind that's open to manipulation. We naturally look to others for guidance, insight and direction and so I would highly recommend this notable novel to YA/ Teen readers.If only we could live in a more just world...*I won a copy of HATE through a Goodreads, first-read giveaway *","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DT7QGPSW90M2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9HZLQA#wasThisHelpful","R3DT7QGPSW90M2","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This riveting read fuses together an eclectic mix of advanced technology and remarkable creatures, within a distopian setting that's utterly extraordinary and breathtaking! The terrifying, chilling nuance to the narrative keeps you intently on edge as the sweeping saga pulls you into the delicately woven plot. The highly engaging and dramatic storyline is full of otherworldly goodness, and out-of-this-world innovative concepts like nothing I have encountered before. The deliciously detailed, metaphorical prose gave such realistic depth to the writing; so that you are able to clearly envisage the horror, bloodthirsty gore and dark sinister edge. The substantial storyline contains sci-fi/ futuristic elements with a sprinkling of romance and a dash of idiosyncrasy for an astonishing outcome.Gift of Prophecy is set within Nevermore; a world of deadly danger hidden in the shadows which sends shivers down the spine. Darla Rune a psychic reverse-engineer is set on tracking down a purely evil dictator, who is intent on crushing all hope left in humanity upon the Earth. If she fails in the consequential task laid out before her, she will lose everything that she holds most dear - including the love of a man whom she never expected to love.Lina Gardiner's explosive novel is wrought with intensity so contagious; you are instantly sucked into an addictive story of mind-blowing, epic proportions and great premise. The entire concept of the distopian/ post-apocalyptic world is sheer brilliance as too are the vibrant characters that are equally unforgettable. I loved the likable, gutsy main protagonist whose strength and determination was commendable. The fated, star-crossed lovers caught me entangled within a web of profound poignancy and emotive bliss that was so heartrending I felt intimately attached to their personal story. Whilst reading this novel I experienced a wave of divergent sensations; from nail-biting suspense, to heartbreak and wonder...The Prophecy is an intriguing concept that ensnares the senses and bewitches the mind! I was so impressed by such an ambitious work of all encompassing fantastical innovation and truth-drawing sincerity. Gift of Prophecy will appeal to fans of ""I am number four"" and those seeking a sensational, atypical novel which blends a variety of genre for a truly original tale.*I would like to thank the author for providing me with an e-copy of her brilliant book to read & provide a non-biased, honest review on*","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KK0ICNG8FXR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7L6ZW2#wasThisHelpful","R3KK0ICNG8FXR9","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anxiously awaiting the next instalment within the phenomenal `The Forest Lord' series, I dived in with tense trepidation as to whether the follow-up to such a noteworthy first novel could be matched. Dramatic and wonderfully wrought with fervent intensity, book 2: the wolf and the raven doesn't disappoint! McKay's compelling writing lures you into a magnificently splendid historical backdrop, of authenticity and exquisite detail captured deftly on the page. His refreshingly contemporary version of Robin Hood transports you into the heart of Medieval England. I was once again blown away by an absorbing, addictive story full of fantastic depth and realistic elements.Robin Hood {& his men) are fugitives with a price on their heads, being hunted down by Guy of Gisbourne. Set in the terrifyingly turbulent time of 1322, the fast-pace and dynamic plot thickens as Robin finds himself in even more danger. Undeniably well written and engrossing, I was sucked into this riveting read unable to tear my eyes away from the pages. In a darkly magnetic world of passion, heated rivalry and revenge and uncertainty is a iconic hero painted in a new light. The unjustifiable brutality in such harsh times was captured acutely through the narrative, which contains such substance and in-depth characterization as to bring the past boldly to life.Once more I am extremely impressed by this author whose brilliant book has surpassed and exceeded all expectations, by keeping me firmly fixed to the pages with interest. I would highly recommend this sensational series to all who seek an illuminating and profoundly evocative insight into medieval England, including a fresh `take' on the tales of Robin Hood.4.5 Stars*I would like to thank the author for providing me with an e-copy of his book to read and review. *","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XAHLGRC00CZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5JMY4M#wasThisHelpful","R2XAHLGRC00CZ","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amalie Howard's dazzling book is a scintillating story of breathtaking imaginative vision, scope and substance that doesn't disappoint. The striking, eye-catching cover pulls you into a magnetic tale wrought with remarkable concepts and fresh vivacity. With a gutsy, spunky female protagonist and cast of colourful characters the confidently assured narrative exudes authenticity that's designed to captivate the target readership. Enthused teens will be clamouring to pluck this exciting story from the bookshelf; compulsively drawn to the storyline of great premise. Fabulously fun, action-paced and fast-paced I was taken on an intense rollercoaster ride and into a sweeping saga of depth and ingenuity.By blending together an eclectic mix of genre {from futuristic to Dystopia} `The Almost Girl' is an explosive fusion of diversity that appeals to a wide readership. Equally fans of Divergent and Enders Game will be enamoured by the intricately woven plot and sublime storytelling, that's beguiling and utterly addictive. Amid the chilling tension and suspense is heartrending romance and profoundly evocative family drama, which touches you with truism and sincerity. 17 year old Riven has to be one of my favourite YA heroines; she is instantly likable and her fierce determination is inspiring to behold! Within the brilliantly crafted world is a smart, clever tale of out-of-this-world magnificence.The first instalment in what I confidently predict to be an outstanding series, takes you on an adventure into a parallel universe full of deadly danger, magic and mystery. Neospes is a well-crafted and brilliantly realised world, founded on strength and a will to dominate over all. The hypnotic connection between Riven and Caden is so endearing and an element within the saga that adds a touch of enchantment within an intently uncertain backdrop.

"This truly remarkable literary work of inspired originality and vision was an extraordinarily unexpected delight. I can honestly state that upon encountering this unique book I was not sure what to expect, and so I began reading with trepidation and uncertainty. Rob Dircks cleverly combines an eclectic mix of genres; from comedy to slightly satirical sci-fi {in the vein of Douglas Adams} with spellbindingly heartrending romance for a fantastical fusion! This certainly is a bizarre book that incorporates the weird, wonderful and `way out' in an exciting character-driven story.Written as a type of journal, this is the story of Nikola Tesla; a noteworthy visionary and inventor. In part one of the notebook the main protagonist `Chip' explores the visionary behind the spectacularly shocking and rather outrageous ideas. Each individual concept {for instance the ""Interdimensional transfer apparatus""} is intricately conceived and envisioned, so as to open up the possibilities for a limitless horizon of innovation. I was blown-away by the eccentricity and peculiarity of some of what was written, and you are left contemplating as your entire perception is altered.`Where the hell is Tesla?' is the most astonishingly, incomparable novel I have encountered which doesn't slot into one particular genre. The vibrant and metaphorical prose is enlightening and quite refreshing, and will appeal to fans of Pratchett and Adams with its quirky individualism. The funny traits and qualities that each character embodies, makes this highly readable tale a truly unforgettable one. Taken on a profoundly poignant journey and emotive rollercoaster ride, I was reduced to tears of both joy and laughter throughout.*I am so pleased to have won a copy of this fantastic book through a first-read giveaway on Goodreads, as I cannot wait for part 2...*","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LE8THHZR0RU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZNVS9G#wasThisHelpful","R2LE8THHZR0RU9","A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIR7WQ20GXQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Amazon Echo (Alexa as we refer to her) creeps some people out. From my mother-in-law in her late 70s to my 18 year old daughter, some people just aren't ready for what appears to be sentient (self-aware) technology.  But, I love Alexa.First of all the voice recognition is really good. There are seven microphones built in. Alexa can hear me from over 20' away, even with the television playing. She almost always recognizes the wake word ""Alexa"" (and sometimes responds even when you don't call her, but that's rare).  Basically anything you can Google (I think Alexa actually uses Bing though), Alexa can answer for you.  We keep ours in the kitchen which works for us most of the time since we can talk to her from the adjoining family room.  I sometimes find myself wishing I had one in the bedroom and in the basement, where I work.The speaker is pretty decent so you can use Alexa to play music. She can play anything in Amazon Prime or anything you've uploaded to Amazon Music.  Any music you buy from Amazon, including CDs because I used to buy those, is available to play through Alexa.  She can also play Prime playlists- music pre-selected by genre.I use Alexa quite a bit for checking the weather.  Current temperature and forecasts.  That's at least daily. She is also extremely convenient for adding things to the grocery list when you're in the kitchen.  Never again will we run out of something and forget to add it to the list; because while you're throwing the bottle in the trash can you just have to say ""Alexa, add ketchup to the shopping list.""  Alexa is helpful for converting measurements ""How many teaspoons in a tablespoon?"" . The timer is SO nice for cooking.  Just say ""Alexa, set the timer for 20 minutes"". There is a daily news briefing you can get which you can customize. You can play PodCasts.  And, I've had mine for about four months now and I'm constantly getting emails from Amazon adding new features. The possibilities are virtually endless.Now, the shortcomings- unlike Siri, Alexa doesn't tie in with my calendar or my contacts. I wish I could use Alexa to make appointments on my calendar. Using Alexa for phone calls or texts would be nice.  I'm an all Apple household. Alexa can't access my iTunes library where the vast majority of my music is. (Alexa can operate as a Bluetooth speaker, so I can just say ""Alexa turn on Bluetooth"" then use Siri to play music through Alexa using my iPhone or iPad.  The shopping list is OK, but there is only one.  The app I was using before had multiple lists, so I could add something to my Costco list or my Lowe's list. The search isn't as intelligent as I'd like it to be.  Alexa ends up saying she doesn't understand the question quite a bit, but really not bad given the fact Alexa hasn't had nearly as much time to mature as Siri. I will sometimes ask Alexa something, she says she doesn't know and Siri will give me the answer.I got the Echo as part of the early release program and for Ω price. It's certainly worth $99. I'm not sure I'd pay $179 for it though. It looks like Amazon has already dropped the price from the initially announced price of $199.  I do think it's a bit overpriced. If you have an Android phone, you could use ""OK Google"" for a lot of things Alexa does.  I can use ""Hey Siri"" if my phone or iPad is plugged in.One final thing, there are already some tie ins from Echo to home automation products. This is going to be an exciting new category of product.  The Echo is just the beginning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B53QWUI4IETL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9EOQCO#wasThisHelpful","R3B53QWUI4IETL","A3IL4WNBMGBJRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IL4WNBMGBJRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a most impressive case. I have an iPhone 5S and I've probably tested a dozen cases over the year and a half I've had it.  I am very picky, so most of them go into my pile never to be used again.  I've tested minimalist cases, sturdy cases, battery cases.  I always go back to my clear, cheap minimalist case that maintains the sleek feel and look of my iPhone. This case comes close AND provides a high level of protection. Then, there is bonus of the price. The construction is exception for the price.The case is a three piece case. There is a hard piece you snap onto the front of your phone. This includes a screen protector. That is maybe good maybe bad. The good news is you don't have to buy and install a separate screen protector. The bad news is if you get a scratch on the screen protector it's not easily replaced like the disposable ones.  The back part of the case is a silicone that fits SNUGLY around your phone. It takes a bit of an effort to get it on just right, but when you do the case becomes virtually seamless. I had to get a knife to pry it from the front piece to start the removal process. It is extremely well done.  The third piece is strictly cosmetic and is a panel that goes on the back of your phone. The case itself is black. My phone is white/champagne.  From the front the only visible part of my phone left is the home button. The frame of the hard piece is black. At least on the back I can put the champagne plate.The case provides excellent protection.  Rubberized corners. Screen protector. Every port is covered.  There are flaps over the mute switch on the side and the headphone jack and power port.  This provides protection and (they don't claim this) maybe just a bit of water resistance if you drop it is in water and fish it out very quickly.  The drawback to this is it a bit of an effort to plug it in to charge as you have to pull the flap back with one hand and plug the adapter in with the other. What I found more troublesome though is my favorite headset has a 90¬∫ angle on the part that plugs into the headphone port. Because of the flap on the case and the fact it protrudes out from the phone, my headphones will not plug in with the case on.  Some case manufacturers provide an extension for the headphone port for this situation. The Trentium case does not.  I'm pretty sure this would only be a problem with headphone that have that angle as the opening in the case is large enough to allow most normal headphone jacks to pass through.Overall, this is an amazingly well built case at this price point. It's not waterproof and I wouldn't throw my phone against a brick wall with it on, but it should provide protection from life's everyday bumps and bruises, won't break your wallet and doesn't make your phone weight 2 pounds.  I really thought I might use until I discovered my headphones won't work with it on- a problem you most likely won't have.Full disclosure- I received this case for $1.00 from the manufacturer and they hoped I would do a review on it.  If I didn't like it, I would tell you, but I would actually recommend this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REGQST6QOO6WG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6WDYPO#wasThisHelpful","REGQST6QOO6WG","A3IL4WNBMGBJRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IL4WNBMGBJRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in Cincinnati and I am a big fan of Montgomery Inn's Barbecue sauce. Sometimes I buy Sweet Baby Ray's. Both are sweet, but at least they have a tomato base that balances it out a bit. This sauce is SWEET.  As someone who lived in Kentucky, I am a big fan of bourbon. So I was excited to try this molasses/brown sugar/bourbon sauce.  The first four ingredients are:  ""Corn Syrup, Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup and Sugar.  That's three types of sugar and water.  Next is soy sauce then finally molasses. If you're keeping score, that's less molasses than soy sauce. There is no bourbon to be found (there is Etyhl Alcohol however).There is a bit of cayenne pepper flavor (a bit) and some garlic and onion, but not much. The ethyl alcohol and whatever artificial flavors they use do mimic bourbon.  I will give it a second star for the bourbon flavor.Given that this is Minor's and Nestle Professional is on the label, I was expecting something with a lot more complex flavors and better ingredients list.  Barbecue sauce isn't health food, but this seems to be a big old jug of corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup.  I got it for free and I'm glad I didn't pay for it.  I probably won't use it again.  I'd rather take some regular barbecue sauce and put a little of my own bourbon it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNPIFLBGSHCYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CFO7H2#wasThisHelpful","RNPIFLBGSHCYW","A3IL4WNBMGBJRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IL4WNBMGBJRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love studying the history of the Bible, on a certain level anyway. This book went way deeper than I wanted to go with a lot of names, dates and details on who discovered the discrepancies in the manuscripts our Bible is based on, etc. I learned quite a bit in the first few chapters about how long copying by non-professional copiers went on (something I frankly had been lied to about).

"I'm giving this four stars because while I find the product completely unnecessary, my wife likes it. She would give it five. I wouldn't even have ordered it for free.Full disclosure- I was offered this product in exchange for my honest and frank review.  If you've read my reviews, you know I pull no punches.  I don't take things I wouldn't use. This product just didn't appeal to me and I was going to pass on it, but when my wife saw it, she got excited. So I got it to see what it's like.  It works as advertised.  It's a shelf attached to a pillow so that when you have your tablet and your legs are propped on the couch or you're in bed, you can read hands free.  It's fairly large- 18 inches across. For some reason, she got excited about the prospect of taking it on vacation. That's a lot of room in a bag when you're flying.  It's not something I would take.The construction is decent. I think the price is a bit high for what it is. And, be aware, if you have a case on your tablet, you will (most likely) have to remove the case to use this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X5QF5IUIBQUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9RNATK#wasThisHelpful","R2X5QF5IUIBQUZ","A3IL4WNBMGBJRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IL4WNBMGBJRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a Beach Body fan. I've done Insanity, P90X, T25 Alpha and Beta and been doing them for five years. T25 Gamma is the most challenging I can think of since Insanity.  It's also a big step up from T25 Beta. I can pretty much get through Alpha and Beta with no breaks, but Gamma is no joke.  There is a focus on strength- particularly upper body. Some of the workouts are a bit easier than others. Speed 3.0 takes Speed 1.0 and Speed 2.0 and puts them on steroids.  The burpees... oh the burpees. Every type imaginable.  Burpees with push up jacks.  Burpees with pike ups. Burpees with spider lunges, you name it...I just completed week 4 of Gamma and will not do the hybrid which mixes in some of Beta. Then, I think I'm going to give my body a break.  Gamma really hits the chest and shoulders hard almost every day. There are times when I'm doing it one day and can still feel the workout from the previous day.

"I don't know why there are so many versions of this product on Amazon. I received these free of charge from the manufacturer and I'm pretty sure these are the ones I have, even though my box says Bluedio as the manufacturer, not Bestfire. They are S2 V4.0 Bluetooth and they look just like the picture.I have now at least six pairs of Bluetooth headsets. The sound quality on all of them is just mediocre. My understanding is Bluetooth compresses the sound and none of them are high quality sets- all selling for less than $50, most less than $30. One of my pet peeves with Bluetooth is on most of them the controls are on one of the ear pieces making it nearly impossible to operate them while you're on the move. These solve that problem by putting the controls on the strap between the ear pieces. It still sits uncomfortably high compared to the controls on a normal wire paid of earbuds, but it's better than most Bluetooth.The earbuds are unlike any others I've ever seen. More similar to Apple than to most. I don't see a big advantage, but one downside is the silicone pieces I have with my of my earbuds are interchangeable. If I lose or break one, I can grab or buy another one easily. These are a proprietary shape so you can only use their silicone pieces.Overall, these are pretty good, for the price. Not great, but maybe a notch better than others because of the placement of the controls.The manufacturer provided the item in this review to me for my frank and honest review.

"I have received no less than half a dozen Bluetooth headsets/earbuds for review.  I've been less than impressed with them.  And, frankly they are all practically interchangeable. I keep picturing a factory in China cranking them out by the dozens and just putting different manufacturers' names on them. These, however are different and worthy of some sort of design award.You'll notice when you look at these a unique configuration. There is a band that goes around your neck and the earbuds are attached to cords that reach up to your ears. The result is amazingly little downward force on the earbuds which causes all other earbuds to eventually pull themselves out of your ears, unless they are attached very well like some of the $150 corded pairs I have.But, the real benefit to the neckband is the placement of the controls.  On most headsets that are corded, the controls are on the cord dangling a few inches below your chin.  Easy-ish to get to. On the other Bluetooth sets I have the controls are on one of the earbuds making them nearly impossible to control while they are in your ear, even if you can remember how the controls. That has been of my major pet peeves with the Bluetooth sets I have. This one puts a large Play/Pause button on the part of the neckband that ends up resting on your collarbone. There is a small fast forward and rewind button on that same side.  On the other side is a button that with a single quick push launches Siri (on my iPhone), answers a call or, with a long push, calls back the last person you spoke with.  This is ingenious.  I can actually control my music with these without having to take them out of my ears or get my phone out of my pocket.The manufacturer provided the item in this review to me for my frank and honest review.

"I actually just bought the smaller version of this monitor for my father after my brother recommended it. They both really like theirs.  I received this one through the Amazon Vine program so I decided to replace the 22"" monitor that came with my HP computer.  The monitor is bright, sharp and flicker free. It looks nice on the desk.  It was a breeze to install.One advantage over the HP is the built in speakers. So, I could take the speakers off of the desk and just use the speakers in the monitor.

"I have reviewed several Bluetooth headsets. This one falls right into the middle of the pack. I just imagine a factory in China cranking these things out and putting different manufacturers names on what are exactly or almost exactly the same headsets.Having said that, there is nothing wrong with these, if you want Bluetooth earbuds.  My problem with the category is general is it is solving a problem that isn't really a problem for me and introducing two more at the same time.  With all of the Bluetooth earbuds I own (I'm up to four pairs I think), I always reach for my ones with the cords.  The reasons are:1.) The Bluetooth ones have to be charged. While they stay charged for a quite a while. It's just another thing I have to remember to plug in.2.) The Bluetooth ones are more difficult to control.  Rather than having buttons on the wire dangling down near my chest area, there are fewer buttons (making control actually more complicated) and they are located in the ear bud, which if of course impossible to see when it's in your ear.The advantage of Bluetooth earbuds is no cord leading to your phone, but they, of course, have a cord between the two of them.  I sometimes have a small problem with the cord leading to my phone (especially if it's not long enough- I'm 6'2""), but it's a minor problem.  The problems introduced by being cordless outweigh that problem for me.  Even my daughters (who are constantly coming to me for earbuds), won't use the Bluetooth ones.Having given that caveat, I would say as Bluetooth earbuds go, these are good one.  The price seems to be in line with the others I have and they are practically indistinguishable. So, why not?The manufacturer provided the item in this review to me for my frank and honest review.

"I have reviewed more earbuds than I can remember, including several pairs of Bluetooth earbuds.  These are the first headphones I have been provided to review and I have to say I am quite impressed.Like their earbud competitors, they paired easily with my iPhone. But, a huge advantage is access to the controls. All of the Bluetooth earbuds have the controls, such as they are, on the small piece that fits into your ear. Most of them have only a single button and a volume rocker. So, to do anything you have to remember how the button works.  I find it's actually easier to just pull out my phone and do what I need to do from there. With the additional real estate on the ear cups, the manufacturer has been able to give you controls that are actually usable.The headphones are really comfortable and the quality is higher than you would expect for the price.

"I'm not an expert on Nutella, but that is the product people are going to compare this to.  I had my daughters taste it also. They are Nutella experts.  My understanding is this is less sweet and more deep in chocolate flavor than Nutella, both good things for me. It has an excellent, deep rich chocolate flavor.  My daughter who loves sweet things likes Nutella better.  My daughter who loves dark chocolate likes this better.  My only suggestion would be to add more hazelnuts.  I'd say it's chocolate flavor with a hint of hazelnut.I have a little concern with this is the all natural claim. It's sweetened with erythritol, a naturally occurring sugar alcohol. A sugar alcohol is a sugar molecule that has been fermented. While erythritol does occur in small quantities in some fruits, for commercial use it's generally obtained by a fermentation process.  The fermentation process allows the molecule to retain its sweet taste on your tongue, but your body doesn't not absorb it. Therefore it's extremely low in calories (in the US considered to be zero calories) and doesn't spike your blood sugar levels.  Erythritol, is less likely to cause stomach upset than some other similar sweeteners because it is absorbed through the intestinal tract and eliminated in your urine. The ones that pass through the digestive tract can cause discomfort and erythritol can to- in some people, if ingested in large quantities.Anyway, enough of the science lesson, but if you're eating this because it's Paleo and vegan and all that stuff, I thought you might want to know.  I wouldn't eat it in large quantities anyway, but it's a great sweet snack.  I'd buy the jars rather than the 100 calorie packs.  Why have all of that packaging and struggle to get the last bit of deliciousness out of these little packages?  Just don't eat massive quantities if you get the jar.The manufacturer provided the item in this review to me for my frank and honest review.  The opinions expressed here are solely my own.

"I have a coated cast iron Dutch oven which I love. So when I got the chance to test this I jumped on it.  If you don't have one of these, you should get one now. They are great for roasting meats in the oven. The heat capacity makes them fantastic for searing also. The semi-non stick surface will last many, many times longer than Teflon-type nonstick surface. The only way this thing won't last forever is if you chip the coating, which isn't really all that easy to do.I haven't heard of this brand, but I would say it's comparable to the one we all know.  My other dish is a Kirkland (Costco brand).  If you'd looked at the name brand version before you know these are insanely expensive.The finish is beautiful with a ruby red fading into black near the edges. Construction is exceptional.

The jerky is moist and delicious. My only complaints are the bags themselves are very small.  This stuff is premium priced. And, there is way too much sugar in it. 12 grams of protein per serving and 6 grams of sugar.  Not only is that too much sugar in terms of health, the jerky is actually kind of sweet.  Now I should say I only like a touch of sweet even in my desserts and snacks. This is way too sweet for me to eat on a regular basis.  A little sugar to balance out the spice is fine.

"I got this hose because I am tired of wrestling with stiff hoses that take up a lot of room.  I bought a hose reel/cart that was so bad I ended up tossing it out.  I looked at the collapsible hoses, but based on reviews, they seem like they aren't very sturdy and some actually seem to reduce your water pressure at the nozzle which would be frustrating.This hose, is advertised as flexible.  It also has heavy duty couplings that are crush proof or crush resistant. I don't know about you, but in my 25 years of home ownership I have never crushed the coupling on a hose.  As for being flexible, this isn't any more flexible than most hoses I've owned.  It does seem to be very tough and it has a lifetime guarantee to back it up.  I can't vouch for it being kink free, but it is similar to other hoses I've bought and not one of them has been kink free, even though they claim to be.Overall, I would say this is a good quality hose.  It seems to be very durable and the couplings should last for an eternity. But, if you're looking for something super flexible and easy to maneuver, like I was, keep looking.

"I've been on a quest of sorts to find the healthiest way to live without changing my lifestyle so much that I wish I was dead.  I've got to find something sustainable.  In that quest, I've been looking at nutrition and exercise.  Nutrition especially these days is pretty much like religion and politics. Everyone has an opinion and you can find people strongly holding polar opposite views.Eat Meat and Stop Jogging lays the framework to convince you that much of the conventional wisdom you've heard your entire life is wrong.  The types of fats they told you to eat you should avoid. The types they told you not to eat are healthy. Whole grain? Forget about it.  Load up on animal protein instead.  Do hours of cardio to burn fat?  Nope.  Build muscle to burn fat.The author does a good job of backing up his claims with data and studies.  Almost half of the book (45% according to my Kindle) is references to the studies and other authors that he cites. The book doesn't give any specifics as to what you are supposed to do instead of hours of cardio. And while he does spend the majority of the book telling you that you've been eating all wrong, you'll have to buy book 2 (Live It Not Diet) if you want the specifics.Overall, the book did get me to think and reinforced some things I've been kind of coming around to anyway. As Americans, we eat WAY too many carbs. I've noticed that the exercise programs I do (Beachbody) have cut back on the long, intense cardio workouts and are focused on High Intensity Interval Training (which the author endorses).  I'm don't have the time to run or swim for 2-3 hours at a time anyway. So, the advice to not do that was well received by me.The author gave me the book in exchange for my honest and frank review. I would recommend it as one more data point on this never ending quest to figure out just what you should be eating. I don't see any of the advice in the book as being particularly potentially harmful.  Of course if you're on medications, discuss it with your doctor before discontinuing anything. Based on this book and some other input, I asked my doctor about getting off of my statin and we're going to try it.I'm just starting the second book which gives more details on the eating plan.  My plan is not to do anything TOO crazy but to try to reduce (not eliminate) the harmful stuff) and increase the good stuff.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D1A9JOGPTSPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0993745547#wasThisHelpful","R3D1A9JOGPTSPS","A3IL4WNBMGBJRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IL4WNBMGBJRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So, you- the human- knows you're getting the ingredients they tell you you're getting on the label.  Your dog, maybe not so much since they tell me dogs are color-blind.  I have two dogs, a 60 pound lab mix who wolfs down ANYTHING and a 20 pound poodle mix who is pretty finicky.  The smaller dog was on puppy chow while we gave our other dog regular food. The smaller dog always wanted the adult food. So, when we transitioned her and mixed the two, she would take her puppy chow from her bowl and lay it on the floor. She would eat all of the adult food, then go back and clean up the puppy food. Also, she rarely eats her food as soon as we put it out.  Well, yesterday when I introduced her to this food, she went straight for the bowl and immediately started chowing down. She pulled out the pieces of her old food, laid it on the floor and ate the Nutro food first.  So, I guess she liked it!I'm pretty frugal, so I buy a good quality food I can feed both dogs and I buy it in bulk. This is pretty pricey for me, but I like giving them something special every once in a while because they do enjoy the variety. Plus, from a nutrition standpoint, I think it's good to have different sources of protein, etc. every once a while. I would buy this for my small dog on occasion.The manufacturer provided the item in this review to me for my frank and honest review.  The opinions expressed here are solely my own.

"This little waterproof shower speaker will have you singing in the shower in no time.  It was easy to set up- pairing it with my iPhone was a snap. It's certainly powerful enough to fill the enclosed space in your shower.  It even has volume and music controls so you can repeat or fast forward songs.  As a bonus, you can now take calls while in the shower.It's not a speaker for true audiophiles, but for the price and the size, it's probably better than you'd expect.The manufacturer provided the item in this review to me for my frank and honest review.

"I really wanted to try the beard balm which, from the description, sounds like it has a masculine fragrance.  Frankly I've never used product on my beard.  I never really felt the need, but when offered the product to try in exchange for my review, I thought ""Why not?""The first thing I noticed is I had a heck of of a time getting the pump primed to get this stuff out of the bottle.  If it doesn't work for you at first, keep trying.  Finally, I took a big old whack and it and it's fine now. The product itself isn't greasy. It's a thin ""lotion"".  It only takes a very small amount.  It does make my beard look better conditioned and I can imagine if I had a problem with frizzy hairs, would help with that by weighing them down ever-so-slightly.Think of this as a very light conditioner for your beard.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29HI27FNSJZM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SONWI8W#wasThisHelpful","R29HI27FNSJZM9","A3IL4WNBMGBJRY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IL4WNBMGBJRY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mr Downing has written a series of novels about a spy operating during World War II.  Jack Russell was a succesful adventure set during that war, and surely prompted a series of adventures about  Jack McColl, a spy working for his Majesty's Secret Service during the period of World War One.  One Man's Flag is the second in this series and picks up McColl when he is working in India for the British government.  In the first book McColl meets and falls in love with Caitlin Hanley an American-Irish Journalist looking to make a name for herself during a period of momentous events including the First World War, as well as the planning and initiating of an Irish revolution against Great Britain.  That book ends with Miss Hanley's brother thwarted when involved with Irish separatists by her lover Jack McColl.  McColl's supervisor sends him to Ireland to look into the probablity of an unrising during a period when England is involved in a major war with Germany.  Jack and Caitlin, of course, meet again and find that their love continues especially when it comes out that McColl made an attempt to help Caitilin's brother escape.  Their adventures are recreated using an extremely well researched knowledge of events and places that existed during the period.  Caitlin uses her American citizenship to visit Germany as a neutral, and actually gains her way very close to the front lines.  It is her opinion, obviously that of David Downing, that the people were very much with the military and the soldiers feeling that their cause was the right one.  Her postings from the war zone assure her of success as a Journalist.  McColl, on the other hand takes a trip to the western front in Europe in order to visit his brother serving on that front.  Downing, through the avenue of McColl states the opinion that England had a cadre of incompetent officers leading their army.  They tossed away lives by ordering massive charges against artillary and machine guns.  And if the first charge failed they would  simply order another one.  The comment is made that the loss of life approximated 5000 men a day resulting in a stalemate of monumental proportions.  Both sides worked to entice the United States to enter the war on their side and this second book ends at the end of 1916 with the widening war soon to include America.  Downing's writings are very clearly tailored to bring out the probable thoughts and opinions of an era now a century away from us.  I have no doubt that these novels will allow readers to sympathize with people living and acting in those days.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHH51WV4S76YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616952709#wasThisHelpful","RHH51WV4S76YI","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The norm for a couple when having a baby is for one to be working, and if financially possible the other to take some time off to get the child off to a healthy start.  All well and good unless you have the type of occupation that the ""Silver Bear"" . a.k.a. Columbus and his partner Risina have.  Both were introduced in previous books by Derek Haas.  They are a contract killer and his ""fence"" who is the planner and guide in the assassinations.  An interesting new assignment arrives for the duo.  They are to kill someone named Castillo, who is strangely another assasin currently on the rise in the field.  Castillo is aware of them and as a person as qualified as Columbus looks forward to taking him out reducing the competition.  He is also aware that Columbus has a partner and a baby to take care of .  And the part that is of most interest is that Castillo has studied the methods of his rival and models himself after him.  Columbus' orders are clear, i.e., kill Castillo and in an extremely choreographed battle of wits goes after him.  The book is short , but manages to keep the reader glued as one move results in a counter move throughout the descriptions.  The ending is not telegraphed by any means and leaves a cliffhanger that just must be resolved in a later novel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QLSRIGVIEEKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605988995#wasThisHelpful","R2QLSRIGVIEEKF","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On various occasions newspaper articles, TV spots and other public forums announce that countries are working on magnetic weapons of war.  This would be a method of destroying the manufacturing and distribution of any and all electric power.  There would be no deaths directly attributable to the loss of power, although many would be caused by the consequences of said loss.  Buildings and other installations would remain standing, and the population of the area receiving the attack would survive in the main to become subservient to the attacker.  Powerless is a well thought out novel describing the aftermath of a total loss of electrical power in the entire world due to explosions on our sun and energy generated by those sunspots.  The book focuses on the United States and several groups of people and how they are affected by  the catastrophe.  While Luke Marshall an army veteran is singled out by Mr Washburn for closer examination other people are introduced and followed as their lives are affected by the loss of electricity.  Cars stall, water is not pumped into homes, phones including cellular are rendered useless, planes fall out of the sky and nucleur plants begin inevitable meltdown.  A journey undertaken by Luke Marshall to pick up and bring to his home family living at a distance from him subjects him to all that has failed as a result of the loss of civilization.  Lawlessness reigns, it is everyone for himself, and it's survival of the strongest and those that have access to weapons to utilize for both protection and to use as strong arm tactics.  The president of the United States attempts to restore some sort of order but finds that the loss of electricity subjects him as well as all others to an inability to function normally although an interesting aside involving the destruction of an enemy of the country is a rewarding prospective.  The main thrust of the book is the description of destruction and devastation, but the ending is a logical method of restoring the material aspects of the civilization we now enjoy.  An excellent and thought provoking exploration of what could happen if we have our civilization taken away by an outside force.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SMNUGHAIIN2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786036532#wasThisHelpful","R1SMNUGHAIIN2T","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brian Freemantle comes out with an intricate novel concerning attacks on both the U.S. and Great Britain by Al Qaeda.  An Iranian computer genius launches attack after attack on both countries via the internet and social media.  Sally Hanning, a brilliant MI5 agent is seconded to the CIA task force to help in finding and stopping the Iranian attacks.  She meets with and works with the CIA's master code cracker Jack Irvine in finding answers to the continued onslaughts. The pair find an unusual communality in that Jack's father  instigated an ambush in which Sally's parents were killed. In spite of this past event while in the course of foiling attack after attack the two develop a sort of love affair which while attractive to both does not develop into something major.  Attack after attack by the Iranian terrorist and master computer expert is defeated until it appears that one final attempt looks like it is going around MI5 and the CIA's best efforts and will be successful.  I found that Mr Freemantle's propensity to delve deeply, very deeply into the thought processes of the protagonists becomes a spoiler when one deviation after another is described ad infinitum losing me at times in the wordage. The action that should be constant and breathtaking is not present in a plot that calls for it.A book that in the hands of an author with the talent of Brian Freemantle should be an exciting read is held down by the overabundance of description after description.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R240QWL0MDSJ5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250066239#wasThisHelpful","R240QWL0MDSJ5V","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jake Carter, a former special forces operative, now works as a New York City subway electrician.  As the book opens Jake is contacted by a woman that he hasn't seen or talked to in over a decade to advise him of an international plot to take over the world.  Almost immediately he encounters two young men apparently spreading graffiti on the subway walls. He realizes that the graffiti are actually messages in a lost language and that the Hidden are communicating with each other.  He finds that the Hidden are groups of the richest and most powerful people on earth that his ex girlfriend is alluding to and the messages are a call to arms for them.  A raid is launched against Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn by a band of terrorists supported by the Hidden.  At the same time thousands of birds begin falling out of the sky. Dogs begin running wild and howling on the streets.  Jake begins an investigation of his own which is seemingly against all logic with his life being threatened at every turn.  How do you fight against an enemy that can't be seen?  How do you stop the richest and most powerful people on the planet from taking what they want?  A conundrum almost impossible to solve but Jake goes against these impossible odds.  The book is pure entertainment which requires more than a little stretch of the imagination to imagine that one person can prevail against the might stacked against him.  Given this stretch makes Sunfail an entertaining read and one that will keep the reader going until the end.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1STH8PCPF704/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617754064#wasThisHelpful","R1STH8PCPF704","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robin Cook made his bones years ago with the novel ""Coma"".  That novel has continued to be considered Mr Cook's high watermark.  So much so that he has apparently utilized a good bit of the format in writing ""Host"".  Not that it detracts from enjoying the present book, but if you haven't read ""Coma"" it makes it easier to become mesmerized by ""Host"".  Lynn Pierce, a fourth year medical student at Mason-Dixon University has an otherwise happy life with a very bright future thrown for a loop when her boyfriend Carl enters the hospital for what appears to be very routine surgery.  Due to some unforeseen complexion Carl fails to return to consciousness after the procedure, and an MRI scan confirms brain death.  Lynn enlists the help of a friend of hers Michael Pender, a fellow medical student to try and find out the truth of what really happened to Carl while under anesthesia.  What they discover is apparently a far reaching conspiracy going very far beyond an isolated occurrence during Carl's operation.  What is really behind Carl's unfortunate result during a routine procedure and the reasons for it form the major part of the story.  Along the path to the truth Mr Cook's ""distrust"" of big Pharma becomes part and parcel of the plot involved.  Medical procedures, cause and possible effect, are explained so that the reader who has no medical training can readily understand what has transpired.  An all nighter if there is ever one and a willingness to want to read future novels by Mr Cook.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LG00ZVM4T1NJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399172149#wasThisHelpful","R3LG00ZVM4T1NJ","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Richard Ben Sapir passed away several years ago leaving a legacy of exceptionally engrossing novels. Among these was ""The Quest"" first published in 1987 and currently being reprised for today's reader. It is still a novel that grabs the reader and carries him or her into a story that is unusual, exciting, and definitely informative about the world of precious stones.  Queen Elizabeth I commissioned the construction of a Saltcellar which was completed while the mighty Spanish Armada was defeated by the English fleet changing the makeup of world powers.  Spain lost its place as the master of the seas while England began several centuries of eminence on the oceans of the world.  A Saltcellar was a decorative piece designed to hold the salt on dining tables.  In many cases it was built incorporating precious stones making it an item too valuable to actually be used for the containment and sprinkling of salt.  Elizabeth's Saltcellar was hidden by her in a safe place, and not seen for centuries.  The action of the book opens when a man attempts to sell it in New York and is killed in the process.  His daughter, Claire Andrews. travels to New York from her home in the midwest and finds herself in a conspiracy beginning with Elizabeth I and traveling to present day New York.  She consults with detective Artie Modelstein of the New York police Frauds/Jewels squad and the two form a mutual attraction leading to love.  Claire researches the Saltcellar and learns a great deal about the world of rubies, diamonds, emeralds and other precious stones in the process.  Ben Sapir obviously did a great deal of research in this area and imparts this knowledge through Claire to the reader.  It is, by itself, a fascinating topic described in an interesting manner by the author.  The question of how the Saltcellar was taken from England and ends up in the collection of a man from the United States midwest, and what the piece really covers are skillfully woven into a very unusual plot.  Certainly, an all nighter for the reader and the definite prelude to looking for additional works by Mr Ben Sapir either republished or found at a bookstore or library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWSSOCXQ2B72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141UPCRU#wasThisHelpful","RWSSOCXQ2B72","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Florence, Italy 1986, the setting for this novel by David Hewson is described as a city replete with art, paintings and sculpture done by masters of the Renaissance.  It is home to Pino Fratelli a detective with the Florence Carabinieri currently on extended leave due to illness.  A visitor to Italy at that point is a young English lady, Julia Wellbeloved, an art student interested in touring the Florentine  artistic points of interest.An attack on a church fresco of Adam and Eve bring Pino and Julia together to look at the incident.  Since it appears to be a relatively minor crime the police do not give it much attention, but Pino puts two and two together and ties it to the murder of his wife twenty years ago.  A major flood had hit Florence in 1966 and Pino had been working with others helping  people in need during the high waters that hit the area.While he was away from home helping the public an intruder breaks into his home, rapes and murders his wife and leaves Pino desolate with the loss.  The crime has not been solved in the period between the flood and the 1986 setting of the novel.  Pino begins talking to Julia about the history of the city, and then with her comments begins to get together facts and ideas about the attack on the church fresco and his wife's murder.  The book is not a love story but one in which the young art student finds a great deal of interest in Pino and believes that he indeed has developed the real reason for the desecration of the church fresco as well as possibly coming up with the facts surrounding the crime against his wife.  Hewson shows a great deal of knowledge about Renaissance artists and the Florentine school of art imparting  this to the reader at length.  Julia and Pino are well fleshed out and display normal good and bad traits of human beings looking at a traumatic situation.  The book itself may delve too deeply into the art and artists described, but that does not detract from the fact that is a good mystery set in a different locale than one normally encounters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REHUGSAGWKM2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0727885251#wasThisHelpful","REHUGSAGWKM2X","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter May gives us a two part fascinating story.  One a  tale involving murder.  The other a love story spanning a hundred years.  The two sections are woven together in the most mesmerizing fashion it has been my pleasure to read and enjoy in a long time.  Entry Island is a small piece of land, only 1 and 1/2 miles long and a mile and 3/4s wide situated in a group of small islets along the St. Lawrence river in Canada.  Its population is just over 100 people who eke out a living from fishing.  The story begins with the murder of the most affluent man living there.  The only suspect is his wife who was interviewed covered in blood and telling a tale of a masked man breaking into their house, attacking her also, but fleeing leaving her dazed.  Sime Mackenzie is a detective attached to the police department in Montreal under whose jurisdiction the murder falls.  He is sent along to aid in the investigation as the only true English speaker in the group which due to residence in French speaking Quebec province mainly speak French.  The investigation seems just a formality since the widow was covered in blood, and the masked intruder is seemingly something made up by her.  Sime goes to question the widow and is astonished at the fact that he seems to know her from somewhere. This appears an impossibility, until his insomniac nights turn up dreams of a relationship from another time and another place.  He places their relationship in Scotland in the past with  both having roles to play.A very important fact in the story is that the widow has never left Entry Island in her life, nor did her mother and grandmother.  In spite of the great deal of evidence against her Sime gets the overwhelming feeling that she is innocent.  A mutual attraction develops between them with Sime doing what is his duty as a policeman but working to prove her innocent.  Set in a locale that is not part of most of our experience the novel adapts a somewhat surreal atmosphere which adds to the enjoyment felt by the reader at finding this book and an author such as Peter May.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28E5JNGEE8P3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=162365663X#wasThisHelpful","R28E5JNGEE8P3S","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Clearly a writer with the credentials of Joshua Hood should deliver a novel about men (and women) in war that brings the reader into the heat of battle with all the horror, killing and personal trauma that such experience entails.  And Clear By Fire certainly does.  Mr Hood is a five year combat veteran of the 82nd Airborne division and saw action in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  He is currently a member of a full time SWAT team in Memphis, Tennessee.  Clear By Fire is his first novel and reflects a background of exposure to being  placed in harm's way by his profession.  Mr Hood brings two protagonists into proximity in his book with the obvious intention of keeping them together in future novels.  The first is Mason Kane who was a member of the army's Anvil Team, a special ops group working in the shadows on missions assigned to them.  He enters the book as a disgraced warrior since he had refused to kill an Afghan family when ordered to do so by his commanding officer.  That order originated due to the officer having some twisted idea about prolonging the war in the middle east.  The other protagonist is Renee Hart a female special forces operative with the army who has chosen the military as a career and has an excellent reputation with her commanding officers.  Kane and Renee find themselves in a fight against a conspiracy that leads all the way to the U.S. president's inner circle.  They must battle against rogue U.S. soldiers that are among the best in the world in order to stop them from completing their dangerous plan.  As expected action in the book is described Mr Hood has no problem in bringing the reader into it with apt descriptions of battle, the equipment used in fighting the battle and outcomes involving killing and being killed or wounded.  It's real - an author should concentrate on writing about what he is familiar with and Joshua Hood was there.  The weakness I found was a tendency to move too rapidly from one scene to another.  And most important since Kane and Renee will be placed together in future novels there is no real character development.  There is some insinuation that a love affair will develop between the two but who are they aside from being  professional soldiers?  These are factors that should be corrected as new books involving the duo are written and there is no doubt that they will be with experience on the part of Mr Hood in writing.  The book is an adrenaline rush from the get go and certainly introduces situations that are real and well described.  Looking forward to the next novel by Joshua Hood which is scheduled for 2016 publication.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVPFKX6HJF11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=150110571X#wasThisHelpful","RVPFKX6HJF11","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brian O'Grady brings his readers into a world that introduces the concept of forces that act as Yang and Yin in the course of human events.  They can prevent massacres, on the other hand arrange for murders and guide the actions of humans.  These are not just abstract entities, but humans, long lived, 2 thousand year old humans that can interact with normal people if they so wish.  Mr O'Grady puts a doctor and his family into the paths of two of these entities when they are part of a major accident and a seemingly old man arrives on the scene.  In spite of what appears to be advanced age and consequent weakness this individual saves many lives and appears normal once the deed is accomplished.  The novel is both perplexing and enticing.  What is the motivation of these people since there is more than one.  Are they truly the Yang and Yin of our world representing opposite reactions to events, or they are part of the same  following similar patterns and drives.  The answers are not so clear but do cause  thinking that might admit that such forces exist and influence events. A compelling read and certainly stimulating a desire to read more of Brian O'Grady's books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXHUG9X8AELEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611882168#wasThisHelpful","RXHUG9X8AELEE","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blake Crouch is noted for his many suspenseful novels and most recently Wayward Pines made into a successful television series.  Abandon is the name of a small midwestern town that in 1893 saw it's entire population suddenly disappear on Christmas day.  No trace was ever found of any of these people and their houses were found with food on the tables, personal belonging in place, no messages left and no answers to what had happened.  A history professor in present times hires two guides and enlists the aid of his journalist daughter with whom he has been estranged from to try and find out what did happen to the people of Abandon.  They travel to the town and begin attempting  to find answers.  Mr Crouch sets up a scenario in which events are described back and forth between 1893 and the present day search.  The reader is introduced to the two sets of characters, their motivations and finally what happened by rapidly changing the scene from one group to the other.  The differences between the professor and his daughter, Abigail, are part and parcel of the novel with a logical making up between the two as the search goes on.  The book is suspenseful, but not otherworldly as was Wayward Pines.  The plot development and the method of using both sets of events - 1893 and the present day keeps the reader glued to the book and anxiously awaiting the next steps in both periods.  Very well done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26HS2MU1YKP8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503946193#wasThisHelpful","R26HS2MU1YKP8X","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chimpanzee is a look at what might be the future of the U.S. based on current trends and misguided government policies.  In a society that has collapsed, with unemployment being the norm for most workers Benjamin Cade an expert in cognition has just lost his job as a university instructor.  Like most people he is forced to default on his loans used to finance his education.  The government with no hope of recouping these funds now due to advances in cognitive science and chemical therapy can repossess their property, i.e., Ben's education.  A medical advance allows the government to utilize the process of ""Repossession Therapy"" as this is termed to treat mental disorders and improve the cure rate of these disorders.  But Ben is not going to take the loss of some of his knowledge to the government without a fight.  He begins to give free lectures in the park in order to distribute some of his learning before it is gone.  And as a result of these lectures ""Chimpanzee"" arrives.  As a protest Chimpanzee's icons begin to appear spray painted all over the city.  Young people wearing Chimpanzee masks start massive rallies against the government and it's economic failures.  And the finger for the blame points directly at Ben.  Bradley utilizes a ""stream"" of consciousness"" in his writing succeeding in properly describing the thoughts and actions of Ben Cade.  A frightening but logical look at the possible consequences for a society that has lost sight of what are really the costs involved in massive giveaways without considering  the price  for doing so.  People become financially overextended and cannot buy goods and services to keep the economy healthy giving rise to a society with no way to insure the growth of that society.  A book guaranteed to leave the reader with much to think about in terms of where we might be going with trends as they currently are","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QITBZ34AKT2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630230146#wasThisHelpful","R2QITBZ34AKT2B","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In an afterword of the book Mr Bailey writes a tribute to Paul ""Bear"" Bryant world class football coach at the University of Alabama.  While he did not play for Bryant known as the ""man"" Bailey echoes the adoration many have for him.  The novel begins when Tom McMurtrie who played for Bryant and a brilliant law graduate in his own right accepts a position with a major law firm.  Prepared to begin work for that firm he is approached by ""The Man"" who strongly suggests that Tom take a position at the law school of U of Alabama as a teacher.

Bitter and angry at the fate that pushed him to the sidelines he passes on a case offered to him.  The young family of a friend of his has been killed in a truck-car accident and Tom feels impelled to offer the case to a former student of his, Rick Drake.  There is some bad blood between the two since Tom had prevented Rick from receiving a job offer that would have been the making of his legal career.  Rick does accept the case and while working it finds that the facts are muddled by the trucking company owning the vehicle involved in the accident. They resort to arson, murder, bribery and greed to disguise the truth of the matter.  A pertinent factor for the trucking company is an impending extremely advantageous merger that would be cancelled if a lawsuit was successfully filed against them.  In a fast and engrossing read the main portion of the book involving the trial of the trucking companyis described and the reader treated to an excellent plot and a look at the characters, good and bad, involved in the process of the legal proceedings.  The book is indicated as the first of a series of legal novels about the prospective law firm of McMurtrie and Drake.  These should be well worth the wait.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5PDEV2M7XN8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1909223581#wasThisHelpful","R5PDEV2M7XN8R","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thomas Fleming, an author of both historical fiction and well researched historical tomes published this book in 2004 making it in all probability one begun in the 1990s.  It is a revised look at the 1917- 1920 period in U.S. history; the period of our involvement in the First World War, the war to end all wars.  He presents a portrait of Woodrow Wilson the U.S. president during that period and rakes him over the coals in no uncertain terms.  Wilson won the presidential election of 1916 based on a campaign slogan of ""He kept us out of war""A side bar to this election was the campaign of former president Teddy Roosevelt at first looking to run on the Republican ticket.  At some point Roosevelt got disillusioned with the GOP and decided to run as an independent.  The Republican vote than became divided between the GOP candidate and TR which threw the election to Wilson.  Seven months after his reelection Wilson went before Congress asking for a declaration of war against Germany.  What happened is well documented by Fleming.  Wilson was courted by both sides of the combatants both promising that as a reward for entering the war with them the US would be rewarded by having a hand in the realignment of territory sure to come with victory.  It is made clear that there was really no strong reason for the Americans to enter the conflict.  The US was in no danger of being attacked directly by either side.  Groups in America allied with both sides pressured the government; i.e. Wilson to enter the war allied with the countries they favored.  Both England and Germany set up propaganda machines to concentrate on America to get them to enter the war on their side. No real reason to go to war.  One of the factors influencing Wilson was the place of an unofficial advisor: Edward M House who gave himself the title of Colonel House in spite of the fact that he had never been in the military.  He had an almost hypnotic hold on Wilson who seemed to make no move without him.  House had published a book called Philip Dru: Administrator, which had to do with a fictitious war between the East and West of the United States.  Dru was put into power and promoted a program somewhat similar to Machiavelli's The Prince in controlling the people.  Fleming implies that House kept the character Dru in mind in his advice to Wilson.  When the US went to war on the side of England and France it was with the promise that in all likelihood American troops would not have to be sent to France to fight.  Obviously not so.  A more direct picture of the U.S unreadiness to fight a war was that not one single American made plane or tank entered combat.  A final note on this segment was apparently a stroke or other incapacitating physical attack that sidelined Wilson for seventeen months and allowed his second wife Edith and his personal physician to actually act as president using illegal authority.  Fleming alleges that this alone allowed the victorious combatants in Europe to enact a peace treaty that placed all blame for the war on Germany and set reparations on her that crippled that country totally and led to the Weimar Republic and the rise of Adolf Hitler and the second world war.  Why the reading of Fleming's book at this time will probably become apparent to the reader who should come to the realization that truly history repeats itself.  Going over the contents and just changing names of the participants will bring out a picture of what could and probably is happening again. The style of writing is in no way dry and does allow the reader to enjoy only the book itself without fitting in the pieces into today's world.  Very timely again after 10 plus years since publication.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZDSUZTHMD1EY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465024696#wasThisHelpful","R2ZDSUZTHMD1EY","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mr Cleave presents us with the most unusual and commanding book to come along in many years.  His principal character is an author who has written extremely successful crime novels involving murder and dark retribution by characters in the books.  Jerry Grey writing under the pen name of Henry Cutter has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's at the height of his career and Paul Cleave picks him up while confined to a nursing home.  Jerry's memories flow in and out of reality and he believes that he has committed the crimes depicted in his books.  He also believes that he has murdered his own wife with whom he is madly in love.  Written in the first person Cleave takes Jerry and his persona Henry Cutter in and out of his conceptions of which crimes he has committed.  Very ably done the novel has every ingredient of a first class description of a serial killer who seems to remember certain details of his crimes.  He also loses his grip on these memories from time to time, and we do not know if he is indeed a mass murderer, or a murderer or innocent.  Medical staff at the nursing home he is confined to keep insisting that the crimes he recalls are memories of the situations and characters in his books and are not real.  But Jerry finds more and more evidence in articles found, copies of his diary, and physical discoveries that lead him into thinking that he is a serial killer.  The twists and turns in the novel's plot make doubly sure that anyone reading the book will not be able to put it down until completed.  And afterward enjoy a sigh of pleasure at finding such a novel to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N2ALCFZNDB8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476779171#wasThisHelpful","R1N2ALCFZNDB8S","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The proverbial Fountain of Youth is a legend that has filled the minds of mankind for centuries.  The Spanish conquistador Ponce de Leon is reputed to have looked for it on his trips to the new World five hundred years ago with no success.  Suppose a group of Conquistador's had actually found it.  Would it have brought them great happiness as well as financial rewards, or would it prove to be a curse making living forever a horror because of it's unnatural state.  Christopher Farnsworth brings us a novel based on the supposition that it was discovered by a group of Spanish soldiers 500 years ago in what is present day Florida.  The soldiers kill the Utiza, i.e., the indians living around the fountain in order to keep the prize for themselves.  The only survivor is the Chieftain' daughter, a girl named Shako who commences to hunt  her people's killers down through the ages to our times.The source of the fountain is destroyed in our day and Simon de Olivares, the leader of the conquistadors is forced to try and get the water fabricated in order to continue life.  The Spaniards have evolved the means to set up a very successful company and hire David Robinton, a  scientific genius, who has been on the verge of a great discovery to come work for them in order to replicate the water needed to continue eternal life.  While David goes to work for the group the battle between the former Spanish soldiers and Shako nears a climax.  Shako sets up a meeting with David and the two initiate a love affair while events move forward towards a climax  between her and the Spaniards.  The reader must postulate the possibility of an actual fountain of youth in the hands of a group of people, but doing that will allow for a fast and rewarding read.  An engrossing novel, that while not an all nighter is entertaining and keeps the reader entertained.  Certainly a book that will cause further investigations of present and future novels by Mr. Farnsworth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PVLWLELD7QFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062282921#wasThisHelpful","R1PVLWLELD7QFZ","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Matthew Reilly sets up a  unique  novel with an unusual plot incorporating two different themes.  The first subject is the use of Queen Elizabeth I as a young girl of 13 and the third of three individuals in line for the crown when her father Henry VIII passes away.  During this period of her life, possibly due to the small chance of  becoming Queen little was written about her  and Reilly freely postulates her presence at the other event the book is concerned with.  The Sultan of Constantinople (now Istanbul) Suleiman, sends an invitation to  rulers of several nations inviting them to send contestants to a Chess tournament to be held  at his court.  King Henry selects an individual to send and invites Roger Ascham a noted scholar emof the period and Elizabeth's tutor to accompany England's contestant.  Elizabeth begs for permission to travel with the group and goes along.  While historical records seem to indicate that she never traveled very far from London during her lifetime Reilly takes a long leap with literary license to chronicle her trip.  The adventures the party encountered during the trip as well as those experienced during the visit to Constantinople, if really occurring, would have certainly contributed to Elizabeth's worldly attitude towards her subsequent  rule.  Elizabeth's friend and companion Elyse goes with her and seems to be seeking sexual adventures at every turn.  She manages to capture the imagination of the heir to the Russian throne and sleeps with him imagining that he will select her as his bride.  The unfortunate turn of events in Elyse's adventure is suggested as being the reason for the  later designation of Elizabeth as the virgin Queen.  The chess tournament is described in a way indicating the deep feelings adherents had about a game that mirrored battles and required skill and not luck.  Murders of leading people occur during the tourney  and Suleiman asks Roger Ascham to solve the mystery of who the murderers are.  Ascham does so and introduces the probability of unethical and certainly evil conduct on the part of the sultan and mbers of his court.  Obviously there is a free use of literary license by Mr Reilly both in the events postulated as well as the interjection of world famous personages such as Michelangelo attending the tourney but the novel is an entertaining read.  It should be read as ""possibly"" occurring and providing a picture of events and action in 1546 with a young Elizabeth experiencing a set of circumstances which would have molded her later character and actions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZW8X0PX7QOSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147674954X#wasThisHelpful","RZW8X0PX7QOSQ","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Brad Meltzer has used the character of Beecher White, the book's main protagonist in several previous novels.  White is a member of the staff working at the National Archives in Washington and has as his function the safekeeping of important documents as well as on occasion secrets important to the nation.  He is also secretly a member of the Culper Ring a group founded by George Washington.  The Ring's mission is to protect the presidency, both the incumbent and the institution.  The current President calls for the help of the Culper Ring when not one, but two severed arms are found on the grounds of the White House.  Each arm is holding something, clearly not meant for the President but for Beecher himself.  The questions of how did the person bringing the arms get past White House security, what do the messages mean and why deliver them there when they were meant for Beecher, and not the President.  The answers are found after an investigation that goes back to a period three decades ago when Beecher's father, than in the army, was stationed on an island off the coast of Key West, Florida.  It is the island that political prisoners were held on, and in particular, Dr Samuel Mudd.  Dr Mudd was implicated in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and sentenced to life in  prison on the Island.  He was later pardoned when he fought a disease which hit the island and credited with saving many lives.  What is the secret, and why is it brought to life today comprises the theme of the book.  Mr Meltzer creates a very taut plot revolving around the answers to the questions about the severed arms.  There is no need to have read the previous novels involving the Culper Ring since references to these are sufficient to understand the current situation.  At the same time this book can stand alone and be enjoyed by the reader.  There will certainly be additional novels surrounding the Culper Ring.  These will be looked for and enjoyed by most readers of Brad Meltzer's books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12JJG5BL24V91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=044655393X#wasThisHelpful","R12JJG5BL24V91","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Grippando sets up what is really a prequel to his books about Jack Swyteck an attorney working in Miami.  Andie Henning, who will become Swyteck's girlfriend and later his fiancee and eventually his wife is transferred to Miami from Seattle.  She is a new member of the FBI and has evolved a liking for undercover work.  Her first major assignment is to work on a theft of several million dollars in cash.  The cash is part of a weekly shipment from Germany that is sent to the Federal Reserve bank.  Ruban Betancourt, happily married, and apparently not mixed up in shady business, has his home and his restaurant business  seized by his bank to satisfy past due debts.  While Ruban has generally played by the rules he comes up with a scheme to get back at the banks, and make a lot of money doing it.  He sets up a well planned theft of a part of the cash that has been shipped in from Germany. With the help of his brother-in-law and two ex cons he executes the theft getting away with about 7.4 million dollars.  The four begin by agreeing to bury the money for a period allowing the heat from the robbery to die down.  Grippando is a master of following the parties involved in the heist, from the thieves and Andie Henning who gets on their trail and also the mob learning about the theft and wanting to get  their hands on the money.

Obviously not all of the four involved with the job is satisfied with keeping their hands off the money while immediate desires are unfulfilled.  And Andie understands that in order to get the robbers the best way to act is to follow the trail of the money.  Satisfying read with good plot and explanations of how all parties react to what is going on.  The ending is logical, following the details outlined in the novel, and without divulging something totally unexpected it ends with Andie about to meet Jack Swyteck.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O7C90F14V1UJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062295454#wasThisHelpful","R2O7C90F14V1UJ","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the writing of ""The Fateful Lightning"" Jeff Shaara brings to a conclusion his monumental work about the Civil War in the West.  The book follows the style of the preceding presentations in the series.  It is painstakingly researched and documented.  Studied examinations via writings, written accounts and third person descriptions of a select group of participants bring them to life for the reader.  Using literary license based on careful study, thoughts, conversations and opinions read, conversations and remarks of the characters involved allow supposed dialogs to be attributed to the leading protagonists  presented as pivotal to the story told.  The book opens as the city of Atlanta is captured by union forces, burned and creates a departure point for general William T Sherman's famous march to the sea.  In the eight months covered by the book there are no major battles fought, but a long series of skirmishes between the opposing forces that push the Confederacy back and lead to their ultimate surrender.  Leading characters involved and followed in the narrative go from General Sherman who was second to Ulysses S Grant  commanding the Union armies to General Joseph Johnston Confederate general who agonized over the need to surrender to Sherman in order to avoid further unnecessary bloodshed.  The adventures of a slave freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, named only Franklin are included, indicating his need to follow Sherman's army in order to eat and find protection.  Franklin's adventures are chronicled in later reports about him, indicating that this man actually lived and experienced the trauma of becoming a free man and finding a place in society for himself and his wife.  Shaara's disdain for the Southern president Jefferson Davis and his inability to recognize talent is evident in the blame placed on him for his major contribution to the defeat of the Confederacy.  The normally accepted surrender by Robert E. Lee to Ulysses Grant is shown to be just the first surrender of a southern army.  Sherman and Johnston's later dialogs and decisions regarding surrender are considered by Shaara to be of greater import than the short meeting between Grant and Lee.  The attempt by the Union's Secretary of War to impose harsher sanctions on the south and Sherman's fight to retain the original conditions met in the surrender at Appomattox courthouse are an obstacle not covered by most historians.  A brilliantly conceived and written series of historical works delineating the agonizing conflict of Americans against Americans is brought to a satisfying conclusion by ""The Fateful Lightning""  One wonders if Mr Shaara can find the proper field to bring forth his next book.  I hope that his energy level will permit this to be done in the near future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F4V2PJ8P1JJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345549198#wasThisHelpful","R3F4V2PJ8P1JJL","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What would cause a man to escape from prison one day before he is to be released?  A perplexing question seeing that if caught escaping he faces another 20-25 years behind bars.  Audie Palmer does just that.  After 10 years in jail, subject to constant physical and mental harassment, and without telling anyone Audie escapes.  He was imprisoned after being caught at a holdup of an armored car carrying seven million dollars in which four people were killed.  He pleaded guilty to participation in the crime and a plea bargain sent him away for the 10 years.  During the robbery he was shot in the head by police arriving at the scene but survived after months in the hospital.  Michael Robotham in a mesmerizing novel answers the questions posed and treats his readers to an excellent read.  The seven million dollars stolen from the armored car never reappeared and Audie is suspected of knowing where it is.  Moreover, the cash is old bills, unmarked and destined for destruction by the authorities as a normal activity to keep the money supply clean. This means that it is easily spendable and untraceable. The armored car company has a contract to collect these bills from several banks at set periods and transport them to the site where they will be burned.  Robotham fleshes out the characters involved in his book quite well.  Audie is a complex individual with a very high I.Q. who thinks things out and does not act rashly.  We meet the authorities chasing him and learn to understand their motives in what is happening.  This is definitely a book to finish in one sitting in order to satisfy the interest in what is really happening.  Easily a five star novel and one that, if the reader has not read a book by Michael Robotham yet,  will make sure that his future writings are anticipated and obtained.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18E18BU0QOCCI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RWSGXSG#wasThisHelpful","R18E18BU0QOCCI","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andrew Klavan presents a dark tale incorporating detective work with a twist of the supernatural.  For those that like the genre the book is one of the better and more satisfying horror novels to come out recently.  Zack Adams, a homicide detective from Houston, and Martin Goulart, a New York Police Department detective are working together with a Federal task force to capture Dominic Abend.  Abend is a European gangster that has virtually taken over the American underworld.  A brutal murder provides the pair with a lead on Abend but comes with complications.  First Goulart's on the job associates begin to suspect him of corruption.  Next Adams is led to a visit to Germany where a visit to a forest with the person he is contacting subjects him to an encounter with a monster.  The transition from a detective story to the macabre is well done with Klavan making it the reason for the action in the novel.  There are some incidents with extremely gory details being over described, but these are shown as contributing events leading to Zack Adam's motivations and actions in chasing down Abend.  Glossing over these events is possible without losing the continuity of the book, but in the final analysis they give a better picture of what is happening to  him and what are his changing motivations.  A good read, with knowledge of the dark atmosphere  created, and the need for it in this adventure into the supernatural.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R230ZBWNJRZT16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605986984#wasThisHelpful","R230ZBWNJRZT16","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Tom Bettany was formerly an agent for MI5 but walked away from the job several years ago. He supports himself by doing low level jobs just to earn enough to eat and have a place to sleep.  The book opens as Tom receives a voice mail from a woman that he doesn't know advising him that his son Liam has been killed in a fall from the balcony of his apartment.  Apparently Liam was smoking dope and lost control, falling off the balcony.  Tom leaves his job at a meat packing plant in France and returns to England where he is from to try and find out what really happened to his son.  He meets with mob bosses, the head of MI5 and encounters not just the reasons for his son's death, but a much wider plot.  Tom uses all of the tradecraft he learned as an agent to get to the bottom of what really happened to Liam.  ""Nobody Walks"" is an action novel, moving quickly from one point to another.  Herron brings the reader rapidly into the who what why and where of the plot and keeps him there.  It is a book that is to probably read in a few evenings and enjoy the action.  The characters are not fleshed out as one might hope for since they populate a very different segment of society that most of us are accustomed to, but this does not detract from what is a very readable book.

"Possibly the final book about the individual nicknamed The Condor beginning with the 1974 novel ""Three Days of the Condor.""  That book was made into a motion picture starring Robert Redford and concerned a man that worked for the CIA reading books looking for illegal codes or information that should not be in print.Condor is still working reading books when his employers name him as a traitor for releasing information to the enemy and order his death.  Condor runs evading the hit men hunting him.  On his path to escape the unjust fate that condemns him he allies himself with several people.  First, is a woman, young enough to be his daughter who is a CIA agent and who helps him due to not believing that he is guilty of any crime, than a lady who he admired but never approached.  Merle, the second lady is dragged into the action when her apartment is taken over by Condor and the young agent to hide in.  Finally involved is the man that is supervising the hunt.  As with the other books involving Condor action is super fast and carries the reader along at breakneck speed.  Grady introduces a factor at the ending which while not absolutely necessary for the story makes for another insight into the world of spycraft.  The author has allowed Condor to age and show infirmities and disabilities associated with the period of life he is depicted as being in.  This factor makes for a more realistic approach to the descriptions and reactions of the Condor.  A good read and one that will keep the reader moving along with the action and conditions described.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29TAULDYL3FH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076537840X#wasThisHelpful","R29TAULDYL3FH1","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dutch Shaw is a former soldier that had seen action as part of a special operations command direct action team. This hard hitting novel tells it like it is when soldiers are deployed into a war zone. They experience moments of calm in which there is horse play, kidding around and the comadre of men at war. Then they are ordered into action against an enemy that has experienced fighting for centuries against assorted enemies. Wives and children of the enemy are just as suspect as the men that enjoy a seemingly peaceful life while waiting to go into action. Ritchell describes several sorties against a poorly defined enemy. Children are part of the forces arrayed against these special forces, and are killed as self protection. Women are just as much the foe as the male guerrillas that exist to kill the Americans as invaders of their country. Dutch Shaw is a team leader in one of these groups and goes into action burdened by the recent loss of his grandmother who actually raised him and was his only living relative. Ritchell makes us privy to Shaw's thoughts and reactions while on station. We see the wounds and death of his own men, plus the pictures of an enemy that has no behind the lines mentality. The Knife is one of the most hard hitting novels of men in a different kind of war. The action and thoughts of the combatants enter the mind of the reader and allow him or her to see the reality of what is the lot of men involved in guerrilla action with no heroics and no apparent victory or defeat.

"Michael Sears worked on Wall Street for 20 years and  is therefore more than qualified to bring us a novel involving white collar crime in the financial world.  His main protagonist, Jason Stafford, has appeared in two previous thrillers and is presented as a person with flaws but very well equipped to work on problems associated with the complex world of high finance.  Jason served two years in prison for insider trading while working for a Wall Street firm. Now, not able to return to his trade, he is dedicating himself to helping others  who find themselves involved with problems within his previous field.  Stafford is a complex individual fleshed out very well by Sears.  He is a single father raising an autistic son and involved with a woman he is falling in love with while attempting to rebuild a life changed radically by prison time.  Philip Haley, an engineer whose company is close to developing a biofuel breakthrough, has been indicted for insider trading based on the projected increased value to be derived by the development.  He asks Jason to help him prove his innocence and convinces him that the accusation is false. Stafford does take the case and finds himself involved not only with a white collar criminal accusation, but with murder and hitmen attempting to do so.  Sears is extremely good at fleshing out his characters and allowing the reader to see them as human beings that are real and react  to situations as most normal people would.  He holds the reader's attention by building towards a logical climax. The one flaw that I noticed is the use of overlong descriptions of various details which are extraneous to the plot and not essential in moving the action forward.  While the novel has an overage of these details they should not cause the reader to lose interest in the action.  An interesting and basically well written book, excellent characterizations, and one that delves into a world that most of us know little about but with descriptions that do allow the reader to understand what is involved.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBIGMR4BJLEWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399166718#wasThisHelpful","RBIGMR4BJLEWN","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pierre Boulle noted author of books like ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""Planet of the Apes"" passed away in 1994.  Among his other works is a dystopian science fiction novel of a world controlled by pure scientists retranslated and published again.  Boulle postulates scientists from all over the world getting together and deciding that all the problems that exist on earth are due to leaders who do not understand what they are doing. That they are men and women with no grounding in science and lack the perspective of what people really need.  The physical scientists propose that they take over all governments on earth and have the current leaders step down and just enjoy life without the stress of governing.  Said and done, the scientists quickly choose a  president by a method of formal testing, along with advisers and other officers.  All governments are disbanded and countries are consolidated into a world wide organization.  The scientists begin working on eradicating the pressures of disease, strife and conflict quickly allowing all mankind to work less and have more.  The required workday is cut to about 2 hours with plenty of time for recreation and rest.  The new leaders, the physical scientists, believe that they have achieved the optimum conditions for all the planet's inhabitants and everyone is happy with the new status quo.  In a short time it is noted that the rate of suicides has gone up and it is quickly determined that these are due to the lack of challenges for the people.  The scientists decide that they will provide games to entertain similar to those held in the ancient world.  Namely fights to the death between trained individuals.  This works for a short time until the rate of suicides again climbs.  The answer, of course is to increase the participation and number of fatalities in the games.  Continuing on to staging great battles based on real incidents  fought throughout history.  Namely massive assaults such as the D-Day invasion of Normandy and the world war I battle of the Marne.  While the tone of the book is tongue in cheek and has some similarities to ""Animal Farm"" it can also be taken as a serious condemnation of allowing any group to achieve absolute power without normal checks and balances on it.  It was true while Boulle was alive, and just as true today where philosophies of one group are forced on others causing strife and war.  If the book had received more publicity at the time Boulle wrote it it has the potential to be part of works like ""1984"" and ""Animal Farm"" and taken it's place as a classic example of power run amok.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A3EAF1LWTU7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1843915359#wasThisHelpful","R3A3EAF1LWTU7M","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Chinese Government is always anxious to come first with an original idea to lord it over the U.S.  Mr Reilly sets up a very unique scenario that depicts a wonder the Chinese have labored over for 40 years.  It is an immense, highly original zoo featuring creatures that trace their origin back through time and are depicted in the legends of many peoples throughout the world.  In an afterward Matthew Reilly indicates that he was fascinated by Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park. There is a similarity to that book, but we are not dealing with dinosaurs by any means.  The Great Zoo is quite original and the rapid fire action that it is replete with is peculiar to this book.  A group of VIPs and Journalists from the U.S. are invited to tour the Zoo in order to set up publicity to attract tourists.  Among the group is Dr Cassandra Jane ""C.J"" Cameron and her younger brother.  C.J. is a writer for National Geographic as well as an expert on reptiles.  The visitors are assured that they will be struck with wonder at the collection housed by the zoo and brought in to see it with a lavish care and luxurious accommodations befitting the group of  VIPs. Safety measures are described as the latest technology available to control a population that is free to roam loose in the huge area available to them.  Things, of course, run out of control during the VIP visit with mayhem and violence let loose on the staff of the Zoo, as well as the VIP visitors.  In these descriptions Matthew Reilly proves to be a master of setting up a plot that is filled with constant and violent action.  The reader is pulled along from one crisis to another.  And the admonition that the book can't be put down is as true as can be.  The center of the action is C.J. who goes from place to place and scene to scene coming up with instant answers to the problems arising for the group trying to escape the dangers of the zoo. The ending comes with a sigh of relief for a reader caught up in the action.

Moreover, the cash is old bills, unmarked and destined for destruction by the authorities as a normal activity to keep the money supply clean. This means that it is easily spendable and untraceable. The armored car company has a contract to collect these bills from several banks at set periods and transport them to the site where they will be burned.  Robotham fleshes out the characters involved in his book quite well.  Audie is a complex individual with a very high I.Q. who thinks things out and does not act rashly.  We meet the authorities chasing him and learn to understand their motives in what is happening.  This is definitely a book to finish in one sitting in order to satisfy the interest in what is really happening.  Easily a five star novel and one that, if the reader has not read a book by Michael Robotham yet,  will make sure that his future writings are anticipated and obtained.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YBJG94STRKYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0751558869#wasThisHelpful","R2YBJG94STRKYF","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She goes to the jungle in Oaxaca in the southern part of Mexico to enjoy rafting and hiking in company of a few other tourists. They are staying  at a small resort run by a Mexican couple.  She is immediately flung into the adventure of her life when she spots a man living alone in the Jungle near the resort area.  While peering at him, she finds a camera, picks it up and takes it with her back to her group.  She also finds a prescription bottle with the name Teresa Hamilton on it.  From this chance sighting and the picking up of Hamilton's property Hurwitz accelerates the pace of the book to breakneck speed.  The man she sighted does not want to be seen by anyway and begins a campaign against Eve's group involving murder and terror.  A sudden violent storm wipes out all roads and in effect closes down the area leaving Eve and her group at the mercy of a dangerous predator who proves that he will stop at nothing to keep his presence there a secret.  The group realizes that he has already killed Teresa Hamilton and they are at his mercy with no way out or any means to call for help due to the damage caused by the storm.  The book leads the reader through a maze of secrets and terror.  A definite all nighter with answers seeming to elude everyone and leading to mayhem and all powering fear.  Who is the man living there?  What does he want to do?  Questions that Hurwitz answers logically while keeping the reader glued to the book.

"Thayer has written several other books featuring his detective Armond diPino who operates in New York.  This novel opens with DiPino working in a relative's store in San Francisco in order to fully recover from a gunshot wound received in another book.  Why in San Francisco and working in a relative's store is beyond me but there he is.  He has relatives conveniently living in Frisco and gets involved in helping them out of a criminal conspiracy involving human trafficking.  Along the way he meets several women including Emily an ex love who is filthy rich and involved with the family in the plot.  Perhaps if I had read the other DiPino books I might have a better understanding of what is going on in this one.  But I didn't and won't.  This novel is helter skelter and leaves the reader pretty confused with what is going on.  Especially when DiPino's partner from New York appears in California to help out.  Wonder if his supervisors know that he is not in New York during these trips. Does he magically have jurisdiction in San Francisco?","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ7T27SZPETES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0095ZJS2W#wasThisHelpful","RQ7T27SZPETES","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Linwood Barclay consistently delivers excellent reads featuring ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances. No Safe House is not an exception.  The reader is caught up immediately by the rapid opening of events based on murders of seven years before the opening of the story.  Terry and Cynthia Archer were saved from death by a man who is a known killer in his own right and live with the memory.  Cynthia pursued by her demons of the past moves out of her home leaving Terry and their daughter together.  Grace, the teenage daughter, is rebellious fighting the overbearing supervision of both her parents based on the horrendous events of the past.  She gets mixed up with a boy who has criminal tendencies.  The young man convinces Grace to accompany him on a break in of a home in order to take out a luxury car for a joy ride. Things immediately go wrong and the boy is shot to death by someone else entering the house at the same time as they do.With this set of events occurring the Archers find themselves mixed up in a wider and wider conspiracy involving several distinct groups, all apparently trying to find certain valuables in different houses.  The ending is typical Barclay, logical and bringing together all events in a satisfying conclusion.  But wait, there is an unexpected development at the very end which ties together several loose ends which were not very apparent prior to bringing this out.  Well done, another all nighter by a master, and the only question is when will we get another one from Mr Barclay..","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FYE0TX7Q8PZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451414209#wasThisHelpful","R3FYE0TX7Q8PZI","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Daniel Trent and his fiancee are partners in the unusual business of guiding families of kidnapped victims in dealing with the kidnappers.  They have the expertise to help the families understand what the kidnappers really want, and what amount of money they will accept to return the victim unharmed.The action of this very fast and taut novel is set in Marseille France.  Aimee, Daniel's fiancee has just advised him that she is pregnant when she mysteriously disappears.  Daniel knows that she has been in contact with Jerome Moreau,a wealthy potential customer for their services to sell him a policy to protect him and pay a certain amount if he is kidnapped.  Daniel proceeds to follow Jerome to find out where his fiancee is when he becomes a witness to Jerome's kidnapping as he is driving to his home with his wife.  Daniel contacts the wife indicating that he knows about the kidnap policy and is obligated to help them recover Jerome.  Events move rapidly as clue after clue  to Jerome's location surface with no success.  Ewan is a master at keeping the reader up all night biting his or her nails while devouring the book.  The ending could set up a situation allowing a followup book to appear, and if so I would expect anyone reading this to grab it and get into it immediately.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE1T21VWSP6LZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250047072#wasThisHelpful","RE1T21VWSP6LZ","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently read the second book in this series and was fascinated by the theme, the descriptions and the plot.  I, therefore, accepted this book from the publisher and was as fascinated as with the other.  The theme is actually one that should be labeled Science Fiction which it incorporates very well with logical action and motives.  The opening depicts a young Mayan girl living in what is now Belize about 1100 years ago coming upon a cache within a tree when fleeing a Jaguar hunting her.  She climbs the tree finding a control panel which in desperation she operates and enters a passage which opens into a chamber containing marvels unknown to the world.  She uses the tools found that she masters and becomes a priestess to her people, and sets up a diary of her actions and discoveries.  Shifting to present day, the diary is translated and gives enough information to direct a team of UN investigators to go to the area and attempt to open the chamber.  The problems encountered by the team consisting of Mary Ellen Rollins and Dr John Morgan are logical and don't depend on any super human abilities of the two.  They find a way into the chamber discovering marvels placed there by aliens that visited the earth about 180,000 years ago.  Interludes in the story indicate that these aliens are still monitoring our planet, and it is unclear if they are benevolent or enemies.  Representatives from China become aware of the tree and the material within it.  They decide that they must be the ones to acquire it, and attempt to steal it using advanced cloaking technology and weapons.  The book is engrossing, a fast read and is notable in that it uses ""normal"" situations stretched only with materials that are currently being developed in the world as well as the devices left by the aliens.  I will, certainly read the other books in the series, and recommend this as an interesting and well written book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27DUVEQNKE1V7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1493554352#wasThisHelpful","R27DUVEQNKE1V7","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Buckell was raised in the Caribbean before he returned to the U.S.  His novel provides an insight into the politics and problems of the islands that are currently mainly tourist areas.  It is set a little into the future and brings the islands into a setting that has made them economically much different than they are today.  They have improved their infrastructures due to the finding and selling of large oil deposits in their offshore waters.  Most important, an agency termed the Caribbean Intelligence Agency was formed by a consortium of the islands' governments, trained by the CIA and British MI6.  It consists of highly trained and capable agents fighting the enemies of the Caribbean.  Prudence (Roo) Jones was an agent of the Caribbean group until he built himself a personal fortune,retired and decided to dedicate his life to beach combing and traveling on his boat.  Events that occurred prior to this novel's opening made him the caretaker for his orphaned teenaged nephew.  He is immersed in making sure that the boy goes to school and takes an interest in making sure that his nephew grows up to be a good citizen and adult.  A message is received from a former colleague marked ""You will get this if I am dead""  Roo had worked with that man while both were agents of the Caribbean Intelligence Agency and were firm friends.  Roo goes after the package indicated in the message in the interest of following through on their friendship.  Shortly after the message arrives a beautiful young lady knocks on his door announcing that she is his  deceased friend's sister.  While Roo knew that there was no sister he goes along with her to try and determine what she is after.  Buckell creates an atmosphere of constant action both with bad guys coming out, and several hurricanes starting up in a Caribbean whose weather patterns have greatly changed.  The book retains the reader's undivided attention and is definitely an all nighter as the various blanks are filled in including the young lady's intentions and definitely setting up the next book in this series.  Excellent read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NB2T0F1HAMLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765319225#wasThisHelpful","R2NB2T0F1HAMLO","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thorp, the author of Nothing Lasts Forever, which was made into the movie ""Die Hard"" gives us a short novel filled with excitement and the fast moving action of the other book.

"A continuation of Sakey's novel ""Brilliance"" in which we learned that beginning about 1980 approximately 1% of the population was born with gifts formerly only dreamed of.  Some were very high level geniuses, some could sense the inner most thoughts of people they came in contact with, move around virtually unseen or make fortunes predicting the movements of the stock market.  There arose a divide between the ""Brilliants"" as they were termed and the remainder of the populationdeepening over  the 30  years that followed.  Present day and the opening of this book finds a terrorist organization composed of Brilliants launching attacks against the normal population crippling three cities by preventing communications, deliveries of goods to stores, no answers to 911 calls for help and fanatics among the group actually burning people alive.  Nick Cooper, introduced in ""Brilliance"" is a Brilliant, working for the U.S. government, opposed to the people launching war against the normals volunteers to help the president combat the revolutionaries.  He works against them as the country moves inexorably towards civil war with the revolutionaries determined to change the status quo even if it means destruction and devastation of the nation.  The ending abruptly sets up a third book in the series and like book one leaves the reader either awaiting the next book or uninterested in continuing.  Sakey is a master writer and the middle part of ""A Better World"" is well executed, but leaving the reader trying to put pieces together.  Well written, but spoiled by abrupt beginning and ending which brings the expectation that the whole would be better if written as one long novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D3YSL6BZK1YV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477823948#wasThisHelpful","R1D3YSL6BZK1YV","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third book by Shaara about the Civil War in the west.  I feel that it is the best so far, reading almost like a novel rather than a dry history of battles fought by people long ago.  Shaara has come up with descriptions of factual events that he imparts interpretations to making them come alive to the reader. The Union army of the Cumberland under the command of William Rosecrans captures the rail hub at Chattanooga.  Pursuing the fleeing Confederates Rosecrans loses control and is beaten at Chickamauga Creek causing him to retreat back to to Chattanooga.  The Confederate commander Braxton Bragg is confident of destroying the Union forces but is shown as a major  cause of dissension among his subordinate officers.  Abraham Lincoln has become disgusted with Rosecrans and removes him from command appointing Ulysses S  Grant to become the officer in charge of the entire Union army.  Grant, in turn, puts General George Thomas in charge of the forces at Chattanooga, and orders troops commanded by William Sherman and Joseph Hooker to meet up  with the army at Chattanooga creating a huge force poised against the Confederates.  Backed by historians studying the period Shaara describes Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy as a man devoid of ability to properly evaluate the people reporting to him and one of the possible causes of the south losing the war.  For example there is documentation of officers under Bragg writing to Davis requesting change in the position of the General commanding; that is Braxton Bragg due to his inability to plan proper military operations. Davis does not listen and leaves Bragg in command setting the stage for a northern victory at Chattanooga.  The descriptions of the battles fought is, as always, done very well by Shaara.  Men are sent to fight often by leaders who are not knowledgeable of what is going on and are the cause of death and suffering of those forced to follow their orders.  The descriptions of conditions of the battlefields speak of a lot of research in journals and newspaper reporting of the period being described.  The next book in this series, which might be of Sherman's march through Georgia and to Atlanta is set up very well by the author and creates interest in that project.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D8BLMK6FRAMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GQABWFK#wasThisHelpful","R1D8BLMK6FRAMS","A1A4NDHTPGTBGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A4NDHTPGTBGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just got an iPhone 6 and I needed to buy a good protective case. When I saw this item listed on Amazon I thought it was very clever and useful. I did not like the color options, but decided to get the case anyway. The product arrived very quickly and was very well packaged. I purchased the product during a one time promotional offer and decided to leave a review based on my own words.First off, I chose the blue and grey case and I absolutely love it! The pictures do not do it justice. The combination of the colors looks great and I have been using the case for months and the colors do not fade at all. The case is much thicker than I expected which I like because it protects my phone from drops. The case is very sleek and fits nicely in jean pockets, purses. The case is lightweight and great for travel and all on the go adventures.The secret compartment has become my best friend. I love it! I usually place my ID and credit card and is a wallet and phone case in one. The compartment is easy to open and close and does not break or open when I drop my phone. This phone case has become my favorite case and I have bought other cases but always end up using my iMODE case.I am very glad I purchased this case! It is very protective, unique and the colors are great. The secret compartment is fun and very convenient when traveling and for all on the go needs.

"I am a HUGE fan of vitamin C serums and absolutely love the skincare benefits of vitamin C. One of the main reasons why I decided to test out the Valentia Skin Care serum is because of the combination of antioxidants and nourishing ingredients of the serum. The serum has key ingredients such as Organic Rosehip Oil, Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil, Green Tea Extract and Botanical Hyaluronic Acid. These ingredients come together to make the ultimate skin care elixir, helping the skin look younger and smoother.I have been using this serum for several days now and all I can say is WOW! I love the natural and very mild scent of the serum and it is very evenly and quickly absorbed by the skin. The vitamin c serum is a white color and is thicker than most vitamin c serums which I really like because it is easier to apply and spread. The serum is very gentle on my sensitive skin and my skin looks radiant and younger after each application.So far I have seen a reduction in skin redness, uneven skin tones, wrinkles and even puffiness under my eyes! I love that the serum is all natural and filled with nutrients and antioxidants that make my skin feel and look alive. I have received compliments from friends and family about the appearance of my skin and I love that Valentia Skin Care Vitamin C serum is natural, organic and made out of top quality ingredients. I am very glad to have received a free sample of this serum in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.The packaging is also very impressive. The box is sleek and modern and is perfect for a gift. The bottle is made out of dark glass which is perfect for keeping the serum pure and fresh and a glass dropper is included which is perfect for dispensing the right amount of serum. The serum is toxin and chemical free and can be taken anywhere on the go!

My favorite is the banana muffins and I have made then about a dozen times now. The pans are very light weight and easy to clean! The cups can be pushed in making the cleaning process much easier than with metal pans. I also like that the silicone pans are durable and do not burn me if I accidentally touch the pan.I will never go back to any other pan! Silicone is simply the best.

The scent is very pure and has a spicy, lemon, floral scent. I absolutely love this oil, I use it everyday for aromatherapy, relaxation and meditation. I diffuse the oil in my essential oil diffuser and my home turns into a meditation/ prayer temple. The scent is soothing and allows my thoughts to slow down and think about all that is divine around me. This oil has revived my prayer and meditation life!Frankincense has been used for years around the world to connect mind, body and spirit. I am very glad that I purchased this oil from Majestic Pure because this oil is pure, organic and 100% natural. The scent is very fresh and pure and even reduces my cousin's allergies to my cat's fur.I would highly recommend this oil for anyone in search of a premium quality frankincense oil!

"I purchased these gloves for myself and was very excited to try them on. I have very small hands and usually fit into a small or extra small. Since Ixion Gear did not offer an extra small choice I decided to go with the small. When the gloves arrived I was excited to test them out and I ran to the gym. The gloves were well packaged and arrived very quickly.To my disappointment the gloves were too big for me! I really wish they would have fit because they are so beautiful! They are all black and have a flower pattern on the inside of the gloves and along the side on the front. The gloves also have a line of red rhinestones along each side that look delicate and very feminine which  absolutely love!The gloves are so nice that I will not be returning them but keeping them to gift to my little cousin (who has bigger hands) for her birthday!

"My husband lifts weights several times a week and desperately needed a new pair of gloves. This was my first time ordering something from Fitoby and I absolutely love their high quality materials! I received a free pair of these gloves for free in exchange for my honest review. My husband was thrilled to test them out and he put them on right before a long session of weights, pull ups and jump rope.After the gym session I asked my husband how he liked his gloves, and to my surprise he still had them on! He said the gloves provided the right amount of protection during his weightlifting session and were light enough for jumping rope as well. The gloves fit my husband perfectly and did not irritate his sensitive skin.My husband also liked that the gloves allowed his hands to breathe and added great wrist support for heavier weights. The gloves are perfect for cycling because they protect the hands from rashes, irritation and give extra cushion for long bike rides.My husband wears his gloves to the gym everyday now!

"My husband loves LANIAKEA products and has been looking for a chest strap for his Go Pro for months. When I saw this item, I knew I had to get it for him! I purchased this product during a one time promotional period, this review is written in my own words. The package arrived quickly and all the products are made of strong materials.The packaging on the products is not the best, I ordered this package because I wanted to give it to my husband as a gift but the packaging made it difficult to wrap. Each item is sealed in a plastic bag, the selfie stick is the only product that comes in a nice box.Each item fits great on the Go Pro and is very easy to use. My husband really liked the selfie stick because it has a strap at the end which makes it easy to carry and the stick is easy to pull out. My husband uses the chest strap while surfing and the videos on the Go Pro look amazing! I am very pleased with the products and the durability of the materials!I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality outdoor set for the Go Pro. The items are very portable and perfect for trips, hikes, water sports and biking. Each item is well made and keeps my husband's Go Pro secure and in place while shooting. I wish the packaging was nicer because this would make an awesome gift for anyone, other than that this bundle is perfect for capturing adventures on the Go Pro!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18U1ZUWT0S9WQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVT0TCG#wasThisHelpful","R18U1ZUWT0S9WQ","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have very long hair straight and it can be hard for me to find a good shampoo and conditioner duo that wont leave my hair flat and dull. I usually purchase shampoos at natural beauty shops because my skin and hair are very sensitive. I have purchased other products from Triple Thread and absolutely love their brand. Each bottle is 33.3oz and they come wrapped together. Each bottle comes with a pump which is perfect for dispensing the shampoo and a lid. I purchased this item during a one time promotional period, this review is written in my own words.I am a fan of lightly scented products and love that the Volumizing duo smells gentle and is not too strong. The shampoo smells like a summer flower garden and is very sweet. The shampoo is a transparent pink color and does not irritate or over dry my hair or skin. The conditioner smells very similar to the shampoo but is a little less sweet and is a whitish/ pink color. The conditioner has aloe vera, shea butter, cocoa and mango butter which leave my hair hydrated and give my hair extra volume throughout the day.I have been using this duo for over two weeks and my hair looks shiny, smooth and I love the extra volume! I love that Triple Thread shampoo and conditioner smell like sweet summer days and have hydrated and brought back the oomph and given my hair new volume. The duo leaves my long hair soft and smelling amazing all day long.I love that the duo does not contain harsh chemicals, parabens or sulfates that damage my hair and skin. I would highly recommend the Volumizing duo to anyone with flat and dull hair. This duo will bring life and volume to anyone and the ingredients are safe and natural. I am a Triple Thread addict and will not buy any other shampoo or conditioner!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UBIVCVGIF9OS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q0NIPL2#wasThisHelpful","R3UBIVCVGIF9OS","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Each battery is nicely made and the materials feel sturdy and strong. I used my batteries for my fan and the batteries worked right away! The charge lasts a pretty long time, but I have owned other brands of rechargeable batteries that last longer.Overall I am satisfied with my rechargeable batteries from SunLabz and absolutely love that they are very economic and environmentally friendly!  These batteries help keep waste levels down and recharging them is simple and quick. I do wish they lasted longer but I am still very happy with my purchase.

"My best friend has been taking Garcinia Cambogia for years and she absolutely loves the results. I was hesitant to take this supplement because I didn't think it would work for me. Once I did further research and found that Garcinia Cambogia is a natural fruit that helps burn fat and boost the metabolism I had to try it out! I was able to get a free sample from VidaZen in exchange for an honest review. The bottle arrived quickly and well packaged and I was impressed at the HUGE size of the bottle! The bottle contains 180 soft capsules which is 90 servings.The capsules are soft and easy to swallow. I take two capsules a day once a day 30 minutes before breakfast. I have been taking the supplement for about a week and I have seen an increase in energy and a huge reduction of appetite. The Garcinia Cambogia helps reduce hunger and cravings throughout the day which help me intake less calories a day. Less calorie intake is helpful for long term weight loss and a healthier lifestyle.I am very excited to continue to see more results from VidaZen's Garcinia Cambogia supplemet. Each capsule contains more Garcinia Cambogia than most leading brands and VidaZen uses all natural organic ingredients to insure top quality capsules. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to help reduce appetite and loose unwanted fat naturally!My best friend has now also turned to VidaZen because of their high amount of Hydroxycitric Acid (HCA) which is the main ingredient that helps suppress appetite and boost your metabolism!

"I try to eat as healthy as possible and workout several times a week on a consistent basis, but sometimes it can be very difficult to get rid of unwanted belly, arm and thigh fat even with a healthy diet and exercise. I have tried buying detox teas, slimmer belts, wraps and other supplements and I dislike the side effects or they simply don't work. This is the first colon cleanse I have ever sampled for free in exchange for an honest review and I absolutely love it!I was very eager when the product arrived and put it to the test right away! I absolutely love that the cleanse is made off all natural and organic ingredients. My favorite ingredients in this cleanse are the aloe vera which is great to soothe stomach irritation, bentonite which absorbs toxins and gentian root which helps promote a healthy digestive system. All these ingredients help detoxify and rejuvenate the digestive system with natural herbs, roots and vitamins.The capsules are all white and very easy to swallow. I take two every morning and two at night and my stomach or body does not feel any unwanted side effects! In just 5 days I have seen an improvement in my mood, energy level and I have even lost 3lbs. I have lost significant belly fat and I am looking forward to more results.I would highly recommend this cleanse to anyone looking to lose weight, cleanse their system of toxins and impurities.

The shampoo is very refreshing and leaves my hair soft, hydrated and clean. The shampoo is a transparent light blue beach water color and smells like sweet coconut beach water. The shampoo has aloe leaf juice which helps heal my hair naturally.The conditioner is a creme blue color and has a stronger, sweeter scent than the shampoo. The conditioner has shea butter and avocado oil which both help hydrate my hair, reduce frizz and give my hair nutrients to reduce split ends. I absolutely love that both the shampoo and conditioner are paraben and sulfate free! The duo does not irritate my scalp or skin and I am loving my hydrated long hair.I have been using this duo for several days and love the scent and quality!

My mind feels more focused and alert and my body is prepared for an intense workout. My husband and I usually go to the gym at night and sometimes have a very hard time getting energy to hit the gym.

I have also seen an improvement in my mile times and the C4 keeps me hydrated and focused during my entire workout. The powder makes it easy to take on the go and we keep a smaller container with C4 in the car.I would highly recommend this product to anyone.

One of my favorite snacks is a cup of organic plain greek yogurt, a tablespoon of Jade matcha powder and a tad of honey. I then add granola and fruit, this makes a delicious green tea parfait.The matcha powder helps me feel more energized throughout the day and does not give the coffee jitters. I have seen a huge improvement in my mood, energy levels and I have even lost 5 lbs. The matcha powder has antioxidants that boost your metabolism and produce natural energy. The size of the matcha bag is perfect for traveling because it is light weight and very portable. I also love making matcha green tea lattes with almond milk and coconut sugar! There are tons of recipes online to make cakes, muffins, teas, fruit bowls and smoothies.Jade's Leaf Organic is great because their powder is USDA certified organic, vegan and 100% natural and pure! I love the extra boost if energy I get from drinking this every morning. I will be buying another pack of Jade matcha green tea once I run out :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YDIAJ3DU9JSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFDH0IC#wasThisHelpful","R2YDIAJ3DU9JSS","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I try to be very conscious when I purchase sweeteners due to the fact that most sweeteners are detrimental to one's health. This is my first time purchasing coconut sugar and I was eager to taste it. The sugar arrives very well packaged in an easy zip bag which makes it easy to store the sugar after each use. The sugar is a brown with a very grainy texture. I purchased this item during a one time promotional period, this review is written in my own words.I love the fact that the sugar is made of all natural and organic coconut palm. The sugar is very sweet and has a light taste of coconut. I have completely stopped buying all refined sugar and will only use Morning Pep's organic coconut sugar because it is less harmful and has more nutrients than refined white sugar. I use this sugar to sweeten my teas, bake and even to make facial and body scrubs. I use one cup of Morning Pep coconut sugar, one cup of organic coconut oil and 6-9 drops of organic lavender essential oil to make an organic facial scrub. This scrub leaves my skin smooth and removes oil, dirt and dead skin!I would highly recommend the coconut sugar to anyone looking for an alternative sweetener! Coconut palm sugar is great for those who have high blood pressure or anyone trying to loose weight. I have done some research and learned that coconut sugar is healthier than regular sugar and is more whole and healthy to consume. I absolutely love Morning Pep's all natural and organic products and would recommend this product to anyone!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW9U096UJQGLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAVO8Q0#wasThisHelpful","RW9U096UJQGLZ","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an airline employee and have to wear tights as part of my uniform everyday. I constantly have to purchase new tights because I get runs on my tights very often. I bought this pair of tights during a one time promotional period, this review is written in my own words and experiences. When the tights arrived I was very impressed with the packaging and the high quality of the tights! The tights are a solid jet black color and very soft.I wear these to work all time and the tights are very strong and durable, they have not ripped once. I got the medium pair and I am 5'3"" and weigh 120 lbs and they fit me perfectly, I usually like getting tights a bigger size because they seem to last longer if they are less tight. The tights look very nice and are extremely soft. The tights are not see-through and have a tummy control lining at the top which gives a slimmer look. I have also worn these tights for dates, parties and other special events! The tights are great for professionals or fashion lovers.Overall I am very pleased with the tights and can say that they are the nicest pair of tights I have ever owned! The tights are comfortable even during long 16 hour shifts, they do not tear or run and they are not itchy like many other tights I own. They are also easy to wash and do not shrink or get ruined in the washer or dryer! The price is great for such a high quality durable pair of tights.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33OXNC5NG93JZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RG6V0W8#wasThisHelpful","R33OXNC5NG93JZ","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The pump arrived nicely packaged with a reusable plastic bag that protects bike pump and keeps the bike pump clean.This pump by Red Gecko Fitness is very easy to use and does not take a lot of effort to pump air into my bike tires or soccer ball. The pump is very durable and sturdy due to its aluminum base and it does not break or bend easily like cheaper products. The screw in feature is perfect to take on the go and is very easy to attach to the side of my bike. I have helped several strangers with my pump and they even asked me where they could get a pump like mine! This pump is very handy for long bike trails and works great on exercise balls, sports balls or bike wheels.This product was a complete satisfaction to my biker needs. I would recommend it to anyone who owns a bike and loves to bike short or long distances. The pump is very light weight and compact, perfect for on the go and travel!

"I have been anxiously waiting for this headband to arrive. I ordered two of these headbands because my husband has been asking me to get him one to use under his motorcycle helmet. Once the headband arrived I put it on right away and I wear it on a daily basis. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All words and pictures are my own.I am so excited to for this headband! There are so many uses for it, I mostly use the band to keep my hair in place when I am riding my motorcycle. My husband got the blue print band and absolutely loves it! We ride everyday and the headband is very light weight and fits perfectly under any helmet. We have tried using bandannas in the past but they are bulky and uncomfortable. The MuzeLi band is great because it doesn't pull my hair or cause a headache due to pressure. It can cover all of my hair and keep my hair in place with my helmet on.I also love this headband for travel, the headband looks fashionable on and it can hide unwashed hair and messy hair during long trips. It stays in place and can be worn in several styles. If you are an active person this band is essential, the headband keeps my hair in place while running, biking, hikes and can also be used as a hair tie. The headband can also be worn as a scarf, wrist band and I have even worn it as a bandeau!I love the pink color and very unique design of my band. The band is also very easy to wash and carry anywhere, I won't leave the house without it. This is a great buy for gym, travel, runs, motorcycle or as a cute accessory. The band is very stretchy and fits even my husband's big head! This band is definitely a must have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D7HGFNYGCJ6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOXWN18#wasThisHelpful","R1D7HGFNYGCJ6R","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big fan of natural organic products, they are simply healthier for people and the environment. I was thrilled to test out the soap from Alaffia and was lucky enough to have gotten a free sample in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. The packaging has a beautiful tribal design and made from recycled materials. I have been using the same bar of soap for about two weeks, and have noticed that the bar will last for a very long time! I also love the fact that the fair trade soaps do not contain any added chemicals, pesticides or toxins that many soap companies add to their products.The soap I makes my skin feel moisturized, smooth and clean after each use. The soap is great for all skin types and has made my skin softer in just two weeks. The set includes 6 different soaps and each one smells pure and natural! I love that the soap makes your skin feel rejuvenated and I don't feel like I need to apply lotion right after I shower. My favorite scents are the Lemon Grass Citrus and the Sandalwood Ylang Ylang soaps, it is like having an aromatherapy session every time I shower! My skin is thankful for the soft butter like feel each time I shower and I absolutely love the variety of scents and natural colors. Each soap is unique and has a different color, texture and scent.The main reason I support this product is the fact that Alaffia is a fair trade company which helps African families, giving them more money on wages which helps their communities. This statement alone made me a fan of Alaffia and their products. The soaps smells amazing, leave my skin smooth and moisturized and help empower the West African communities! This has become my new favorite brand, not only do I get to enjoy a high quality product on my skin, but also contribute to promote equality around the globe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ND4ZPW5RFMX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMWXPUC#wasThisHelpful","R1ND4ZPW5RFMX4","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been looking for a diffuser for weeks and when I saw this design I knew I would love it. I have purchased InstaNatural products in the past and  was convinced this item would be great! The item arrived well packaged and in a colorful modern box. The diffuser is very easy to use and comes with simple easy to follow instructions. I was able to set it up within minutes after opening the box for the very first time. I purchased this item during a one time promotional period, this review is written in my own words.The diffuser is made up of three parts, the base, the top cone and the wall plug. The bottom base is filled up with water with 3-4 drops of essential oil, the cone is then placed on top of the base and then you press the on/off bottom to turn on the diffuser. The diffuser has three options, the blue LED light with the diffuser, the diffuser and no LED light and the off function. I like the LED option because it reminds me that the diffuser is turned on, which keeps me from leaving the diffuser on overnight or when I leave the house. The diffuser is very strong and will make my entire house smell amazing. The design of the diffuser is like a volcano and a dry vapor comes out of the top of the volcano top and turns my house into an aromatherapy spa.I absolutely love the easy to use design and the sleek look of the diffuser, not only does it diffuses my essential oils but is also a beautiful decoration in my house. I use this product everyday and wash the diffuser after every use. The diffuser is very light weight and easy to clean and store. I wish it had an auto off function because sometimes I fall asleep to the diffuser. Overall, this is my favorite diffuser and I use it all the time. The materials feel sturdy and I know it will last me many more years!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KI284OPVGVDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OOBEQWY#wasThisHelpful","R3KI284OPVGVDX","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Morning Pep is one of my favorite natural brands. I purchased the orange essential oil for my oil diffuser because I enjoy citrus scents. I was able to purchase this item during a one time promotional period, this review is written in my own words. The oil arrived packaged in a dark glass bottle which  helps maintain the freshness and purity of the product. The oil does not come with a glass dropper or pump which makes it difficult to dispense the product. I usually use the cap to measure the oil but this can be messy and time consuming.The oil has a pure orange scent and has a clear liquid consistency. I use this oil for everything! I have only had it for about two weeks and I am almost out. I use the oil to flavor my tea, cakes, water and for cooking. The oil tastes like natural orange peels and adds a delightful citrus taste! I also use the oil to freshen my furniture, sheets and bed. I add a couple of drops to the dryer and the clothes smell fresh and clean. My favorite use for this oil is aroma therapy. The oil makes my house smell like an orange garden and it helps lift my mood after a long day at work. The oil has a bright and peppy scent and brings positive energy into any room.This multipurpose oil is 100% pure and natural and helps release anxiety and stress. The oil is 100% pure and natural and premium quality. This product is a hit in my house and my cousins love coming over and placing the oil in their water bottle when we go on hikes.

"I have always been a huge fan of eucalyptus oil and absolutely love the scent. This is my first bottle of eucalyptus essential oil and I am beyond thrilled with the amazing benefits of the oil. I have been a Morning Pep fan for months and I was excited to buy this product during a promotional period. The bottle arrived in a glass dark bottle which is perfect because it keeps the oil fresh and pure. I was a little disappointed that the oil did not come with a pump or dropper because it can be difficult to dispense the oil. This review is based on my own experience.I have two cats and I am slightly allergic to their fur. I decided to add a couple of drops of eucalyptus oil into my humidifier to see if it would help with my allergies. As soon as I turned on the humidifier, I could feel the eucalyptus oil opening my throat, nose, chest and head. The eucalyptus oil is clear and has a mint leaf soothing scent that is calming and helps put the mind at ease. I use this oil on a daily basis because I have asthma and it helps me breathe and relax. I carry this oil in my purse and apply a dab of oil in my hand and inhale when I feel anxious, stressed or feel an asthma attack coming. The oil is great for aroma therapy and helps to breath easier and makes my house smell like a luxurious spa!I love getting a hot towel and adding a drop or two to the towel and placing it over my face. The eucalyptus oil can turn any average day into an at home spa experience. I take my oil on my trips and while I am on the go. The oil can also be added to baths, foot soaks and massages and helps to clear your sinuses when you begin to feel sick! I would recommend Morning Pep because they use organic and all natural products :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRH75LERLYGB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W69DQMC#wasThisHelpful","RRH75LERLYGB5","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been exclusively using Retseliney products for over a month and I am absolutely obsessed! After being introduced to the cleanser, toner, and moisturizer, I had to get the hyaluronic acid serum. I have owned other hyalurinic acid serums in the past, but this is the first hyaluronic acid I have used that had a high organic component. Retseliney's hyaluronic acid contains 72% organic ingredients. The organic ingredients make a huge difference in facial products and my skin craves the antioxidants on a daily basis. The bottle is very elegant and has an easy to use pump that helps dispense the right amount of serum. I received this item for free in exchange for an honest review.I usually use 1-2 pumps after washing my face with Retseliney's cleanser. I can feel the tightening effects of the serum as soon as I apply it to my face. The serum is a clear color and has no scent. The hyaluronic serum is quickly absorbed and my skin looks bright and smooth for the rest of the day. I love this serum because of the antioxidants and Vitamin C that help rejuvenate the skin and reproduce skin cells. The serum has reduced fine lines around my eyes and mouth. The serum is very gentle and is quickly absorbed onto the skin. Hyaluronic acid helps restore damaged skin naturally and helps promote elasticity. My skin does not break out with Retseliney products and the oiliness on my skin has greatly reduced.Retseliney offers some of the best skin care products I have ever used. I have seen such an improvement in my skin that I purchased a serum for one of my friend's and she ended up buying the cleanser and toner. I am a huge fan of Retseliney's hyaluronic acid and I am looking forward to see some of the long term benefits of using all natural and organic facial products!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17N5VFDSTRL3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VF4LZFO#wasThisHelpful","R17N5VFDSTRL3B","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My husband has skin psoriasis and constantly complains about itchy skin. He has gone to the doctor and was prescribed a cream which he never uses because he dislikes the toxins and chemicals in the cream. I have been searching for an all natural solution and have tried tons of oils, creams and rubs for his skin. My husband was very happy with the oils, but would never put them on because they were messy or difficult to apply. When I saw Vi-Tae's all natural mist I knew my husband would love it!When the bottle arrived I was beyond excited and my husband tested the soothing relief spray and loved it! He uses it every night now and he loves that the solution comes in a spray bottle because it is very easy to apply and the mist spreads evenly on his skin. The only thing my husband did not like is the scent and I simply added a couple of drops of tea tree oil and lavender which made the treatment smell great! My husband has now been using this spray for over a week and is very pleased with the results. His skin is less itchy and the appearance of the skin has also greatly improved. I am very happy that we have found an all natural solution to my husband's skin condition.The spray is very gentle and does not irritate my husband's skin and has been the natural easy to apply solution I have been searching! I would highly recommend this product to my loved ones and vouch that the mist reduces itchiness, discomfort and improves the appearance of skin psoriasis. The mist is quickly absorbed onto the skin and provides and almost immediate relief in skin discomfort.

"I am a huge fan of candles and aroma therapy. When I saw the Fresh & Clean set from Old Factory I had to get it, specially because of the lemongrass scent. I have two indoor cats and sometimes it can be very difficult to keep my house smelling clean. I purchased this item using a one time promotional code, this review is written in my own words. The candle set comes in a very nice vintage looking box, ready to gift and each candle comes in a glass container with a twist on lid. I absolutely love the labels on the candles! Everything about this candle set shouts out handmade and I simply love it. The set is perfect for a gift, I almost gifted mine to my aunt but decided to keep them because they smells great!The candles burn for up to 20 hours and the scent is amazing! I can honestly say my house smells cleaner after I burn an Old Factory candle. My husband who is very picky about scents really likes the lemongrass scented candle. He says it smells like a lemongrass tea his grandma in Honduras used to make. The lemongrass candle is definitely my favorite, it has a great citrus sweet scent that takes over the room and causes me to relax every time I light the candle. The fresh linen scent is perfect for our guest bedroom and smells very fresh. I was very surprised at how great the olive blossom smells! I almost like this one as much as the lemongrass candle. It has a sweet blossom scent and also makes my house smell amazing! I love that the set comes with three candles because I can place one in each room in the house and each room has its individual scent!I absolutely love these candles! They are very well made and the scent of the candle lasts for hours even after I put the candle out. I also really like that the candles are hand poured in the USA and made out of soy. The candles are natural, toxin and chemical free and I can be sure that my house will smell great when I turn one on. My house now smells fresh and clean and the very natural aroma of each candles helps me relax and unwind after a long day at work! I will be buying another set of Old Factory candles since they have tons of very distinct scents.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IITEN6MJ4VTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NR8LBIM#wasThisHelpful","R3IITEN6MJ4VTC","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in Southern California and love the beach! The beach is not the same without beach balls. I always end up loosing beach balls or not buying any because they take forever to blow up. I have never seen any mini beach balls and when I saw these I absolutely had to buy some. Luckily, I purchased this item using a one time promotional code, this review is written in my own words. The beach balls come in assorted colors and there are 25 of them per pack.When the balls arrived, I had to blow one up! It was so quick and easy to blow up I ended up blowing up 3 of them. They are super adorable. Each ball is 6"" and can fit in the palm of my hand. My little nephew loves them and thought it was a great idea to play beach ball with the cats. The cats popped the ball in less than a minute. So now I try to keep the beach balls away from the cats. These balls are perfect for summer. I brought a few of them to my office to decorate for the summer and all my co workers love them. They are fun to toss around and play with, even for adults. The beach balls do not deflate even after hours of tossing them around.I love the size and the convince of these beach balls! I can easily carry them in my purse and take them with me to turn any place into some beach fun. They are perfect for kids or adults. I love to take the mini beach balls to the pool and these would be perfect for a beach themed party.

"I bought this tie bar for my husband and he absolutely loves it! He wore it to a very nice  fashion event and the tie clip looks very sleek and professional. My husband got several compliments on his look at the event and I know that the tie clip was the staple. The tie clip comes in a small velvet bag to store and protect the bar from damage and to make it easier to take on the go. The clip is much smaller than I expected, but my husband said it was just the right size to make a fashion statement!My husband wears this tie clip with his favorite silk tie and he loves it because it does not damage or pull the tie. The bar is very smooth and designed to hold the tie in place throughout the night. The shiny bar is lightweight and easy to take on the go. I love the way the bar looks and it is perfect for special occasions or a hot date!This tie bar is the perfect design for men, it looks modern and is easy to slip on and off. The bar does not have teeth like most tie clips which is perfect for long wear and keeping ties looking new. I would recommend this for any guy that wears ties. My husband absolutely LOVES his and when my father saw the Nelson tie bar clip, he asked for one too. I purchased this item during a one time promotional period, this review is written in my own words.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JFUL1GNGKXUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ODOJY1A#wasThisHelpful","R3JFUL1GNGKXUD","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have extremely dry and frizzy hair. I read a few articles on the benefits of pomegranate oil for the hair and was very intrigued and had to buy one. I decided to buy the Leven Rose Pomegranate oil because of it is 100% organic and pure. The oil arrived in a dark glass bottle which is great to keep the oil fresh, pure and toxin free. The included dropper is made out of glass with a rubber handle makes it very easy to dispense the right amount of oil. The adorable pink label on the bottle lists several uses, application and shelf life information. I purchased this item during a one time promotional period, this review is written in my own words.The oil has a very mild nut scent and is a pale yellow color. The oil is not very thick which makes it perfect when applying it to the hair and skin. I have now been applying this oil after I shower for about two weeks and my hair is shinier and softer. The oil helps to de tangle and remove frizz, while providing natural antioxidants and vitamins to rejuvenate the hair. My hair is easier to comb and the amount of split ends in my hair has minimized. My hair also seems longer and fuller ever since I began using this oil. The oil has helped to stimulate hair growth, which makes me very happy!I love the size of the bottle because I can take it with me when I travel in my carry on bag. The bottle is leak free and very compact, perfect for those on the go! I love that the oil is also pure and pesticide free and my hair and scalp feel great after each application. I would recommend this all natural elixir to my friends and family looking for an all natural and organic hair remedy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQFKDW7APIPHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHKDV94#wasThisHelpful","RQFKDW7APIPHM","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love almonds and I have never owned almond oil before. I was very excited to get this item in the mail, specially because I purchased this item during a one time promotional period! The oil arrived very well packaged inside a plastic bag. The bottle itself is made out of clear plastic and the top lid allows the oil to be easily poured onto the hand or finger. The oil is a pale yellow color with a corn like scent and has a pretty liquid consistency. The size of the bottle is perfect to carry around in my purse and while traveling.The oil is very quickly absorbed into the skin and is very gentle, it does not cause any irritation or discomfort. I use the oil everyday as a moisturizer and apply 2-3 drops of oil onto the dry area. The oil does not leave greasy feeling and ever since I have been using this oil on my skin my skin looks healthier. The natural vitamins and antioxidants of the almond oil help recover, moisturize and strengthen dry, itchy and irritated skin. This oil is also great to give foot rubs, not only does it feel great but it also soothes and nurture the skin!I have also read several articles about almond oil repairing damaged hair. I am excited to use a couple drops of this almond oil in my shampoo to soften and naturally moisturize my hair. This is my first time purchasing an item by Beauty Aura and I am very pleased! The oil has no added ingredients and is pure natural oil. This is premium quality sweet almond oil offered at a great price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJDETGAE0R85A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O72VRY0#wasThisHelpful","RJDETGAE0R85A","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge fan of pineapples but usually do not buy them because they are a pain in the butt to cut and the pre cut ones are simply too expensive. When I say this product I knew I had to get it! It looked so easy to use and luckily for me I bought it during a one time promotional period. The corer arrived in a nice box and on the box there are easy to follow picture instructions. The slicer is made up of two parts, the tube with the circular blade at the bottom and the black handle. The black handle can be taken on and in order to remove the pineapple off the slicer. The blades are sharp and the entire tool is very nicely made and feels sturdy.I was honestly not expecting this corer to work so easily and smoothly! I went to the store to buy a pineapple and was very excited to use my pineapple corer. I cut the top off the pineapple and placed the center of the corer on the core and began to twist. The corer works with very minimal force and is very easy to twist as the corer goes deeper. Once I felt like the corer reached the bottom, I lightly pulled the corer up and the inside of the pineapple came out! It was so quick and easy! The black handle is then removed and the cut pineapple comes out in rings. I then cut the ringed pineapple and added other fruits and used the pineapple skin as a bowl! I love that the pineapple can be used as a cup for smoothies or as a bowl for rice, fruit or snacks. The pineapple bowl looks very professional and is a great idea to impress friends and family at potlucks and parties!I would highly recommend this product to anyone who loves pineapples but hates cutting them! The slicer makes it so simple and quick and can be done by just one person. The corer is a great wedding or home warming gift idea. This review is written in my own words and experiences with the pineapple corer. Once I finished using the corer I rinsed it and placed it in the dishwasher, the corer is easily cleaned and dishwasher safe! I cannot wait to have a work party so I can show off my new pineapple fruit bowls!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PM53VNRTOJ86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WIOTNFE#wasThisHelpful","R1PM53VNRTOJ86","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love phytoceramides! I have done some research on these all natural skin supplements and have found tons of positive feedback! One of my friend's is a cosmetic surgeon and she told me that phytoceramides are considered the ""botox in a bottle"" due to their quick and amazing results. Phytoceramides allow the skin to hold water, which allow the skin to be younger from the inside out! Luckily, I purchases this product using a one time promotional code. This review is written in my own words and experiences using this supplement.The supplement arrived in a very modern bottle with a label that contains supplement facts, ingredients and suggested use instructions. I take one every morning before breakfast and I have been using these supplements for about a week and I can already see the phytoceramides working. My skin looks and feels more elastic and my skin is smoother than ever! I have less wrinkles around my mouth and neck and my acne scars are fading. I really like that the phytoceramides work from the inside out and that they target all areas equally, versus creams and serums that only work were applied. The phytoceramides are perfect for travel or easy to take on the go.VidaZen phytoceramides also contain Vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D and vitamin E to help nourish and nurture the skin. I love this supplement. My skin looks rejuvenated and alive! The supplement capsules are easy to swallow and have no taste or scent, which I love! The supplement is a great alternative for lotions and potions that only treat the skin topically! The phytoceramides treat aging and dry skin from the inside by renewing the body's cellular level. I am looking forward to seeing more results as I continue to take VidaZen's phytoceramides as a daily supplement!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EMWSWIMU8VLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WNG5OEQ#wasThisHelpful","R2EMWSWIMU8VLR","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my best friends works at a vitamin shop and he recommended that I purchase tart cherry supplements to help support my joint pain. I looked around Amazon for several options and decided to purchase Sports Research Tart Cherry due to the all natural, kosher and organic ingredients in the supplement. Upon arrival of the product I was very impressed with the packaging. The supplement was boxed in a very nice black box. The bottle is black and the label on contains ingredients and nutritional facts. The bottle had an extra seal to preserve freshness and my favorite part of the packaging is the very easy to use lid on top. It simply flips open and is very easy to dispense the liquid gels. I purchased this item during a one time promotional period, this review is written in my own words.I have been taking this supplement for about a week and I have seen an improvement in energy levels, joint movement and alertness. The vitamins are very small and easy to swallow. The gels are a deep red color and flavorless. Even my husband who strongly dislikes and struggles swallowing pills loves this supplement. My husband has reported that he gets better and deeper sleep every night thanks to the tart cherry supplement. The gels are perfect because they are safe and compact for travel. My joints are more lubricated and the tart cherry has also helped reduce muscle pain after a workout.I would highly recommend this supplement. The packaging is very professional and the gels are almost half the size as most supplements out there. The gels contain 800mg of organic tart cherry whole fruit, I only take one a day and have felt my joints strengthen. I know I will continue to see more results as I continue to take Sports Research's organic tart cherry softgels!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1243NON577JKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TP54IFO#wasThisHelpful","R1243NON577JKQ","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This item deserves 10 stars! I use it every day, sometimes twice a day to reduce tightness and reduce muscle soreness. I have horrible back problems and I have owned a long black foam roller before, but I did not have the same results as with this roller. This is my first experience with a deep tissue massage roller and I am beyond pleased! The roller arrived wrapped in plastic to keep the roller sanitized and safe from damage. The roller is exactly 14"" by 5"" and is a bright blue color and feels strong and sturdy. I purchased this item during a one time promotional period, this review is written in my own words.The roller is very light weight and easy to store. I can easily fit it in a gym bag and take it on the go. The roller feels amazing on my back. I have a horrible back and using this roller twice a day has eliminated the need for me to see a physical therapist. I have better results using this roller than I did with health care practitioners. I place the roller on the floor and sit on it and place my hands behind me, then I start to slowly move my body back and forth. The great thing about this roller is that specific areas can be targeted and the amount of message in one are is easy to control. The bumps on the roller dig deep into my muscles and skin and I can feel my muscles relaxing and the tightness and pain in my back disappearing. My back craves the deep massage daily and I can do this at home at my own convenience. This roller has saved me tons of money, I no longer need physical therapy or the chiropractor because I can now massage my own back and do it for as long as I want! I also love using this roller after a long flight to help reduce muscle stiffness.This roller is also perfect for legs, neck, arms and pretty much a full body massage. The roller is made of very strong materials and it is very safe to use the roller. I have found that using the roller on hardwood floor works best. My muscles recover faster after a gym workout and my muscles are more relaxed than ever. I love that I can use this roller anytime and anywhere! This is one of my favorite items I have ever purchased. It really works and my whole body feels relaxed after use. This is a perfect tool for athletes, travelers or anyone with back pain!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8H25N3K0LY0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6OURUS#wasThisHelpful","R8H25N3K0LY0D","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very picky when it comes to creams, serums, toners and lotions for my face. I have very sensitive skin and look for natural ingredients that will not irritate my skin. I own several Retseliney products and I absolutely LOVE their all natural, organic and vegan ingredients, because my face has a very positive reaction. I have been using the Retselinry peptide serum for over a week and so far I have not experienced any discomfort or irritation. I purchased this product during a one time promotional period and this review is written in my own words.This serum arrives in a white plastic bottle with a pump to dispense the right amount of serum. The serum is a clear color and has a very light aroma. I love that the serum does not have any added unnatural scents or colors. The serum feels very fresh when applied to the face and I can feel a tightening throughout the day. The size of the bottle is perfect because it falls under FAA regulations which means I can carry the serum in my carry on bag when I fly. Ever since I begun using this serum, my face has gotten smoother and I have several acne scars that the serum has minimized. The serum works best when used along with Retseliney's peptide moisturizer, these two products have transformed my face. I have gotten several compliments from my husband and co-workers because my skin is radiating!I would highly recommend this product to anyone in search of a good serum to reduce wrinkles, scars and to rejuvenate the skin. The serum has all natural ingredients and is great for sensitive skin. Ingredients such as peptide allow collagen to rebuild itself and skin to replenish and appear younger and more fresh! This serum is also very effective because it contains natural antioxidants such as jojoba oil, green tea, and vitamin E to help build, nurture and hydrate the skin. The results have been great for me and I look forward to even more results!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WN0BQYFEEXID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0UNPJI#wasThisHelpful","R2WN0BQYFEEXID","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge fan of Retseliney products! I bought this item because I own the Retseliney Retinol serum and it has done wonders to my skin so I had to try out the mositurizer. The mosturizer comes in a travel size bottle which is a huge plus for me because I can take this item with me on all my trips! The bottle is light weight and fits in the palm of my hand. The pump on the bottle is easy to use and I normally apply 2-3 pumps of moiturizer on my face after the retinol serum. These two Retseliney products work so well together and my face looks fresh and rejuvinated.My skin is very senstive and I am so happy that this moisturizer works well on my face, I have not had any skin irritation or discomfort. The moisturizer is very gentle on my face and is quickly absorbed into my skin, leaving my skin moisturized. The cream does not leave a greasy feel and the all natural nutrients have begun to restore sun spots, redness and wrinkles! I absolutely love the all natural, vegan and organic ingredients which are healthy for my face, the cream contains no toxins or pesticides. The cream is a thick white color with a very light citric scent. The cream is smooth and I have even seen a reduction in pores and forehead wrinkles in just one week!I would highly recommend this nutritious facial cream to improve the appearance of the skin by naturally renewing and regenerating skin cells. Ingredients such as jojoba oil, green tea, retinol, vitamin E and shae butter will help heal and build healthier and more elastic skin.

"I love oils and tea tree oil is one of the many oils I like the most due to it's scent and healing properties. I have owned aVo oils in the past and when I was offered this product during a one time promotional period I was thrilled. The oil came very neatly packaged and I could smell the scent of the oil even before I opened the bottle.

The oil has a very liquid like texture and is very quickly absorbed on the skin.

This oil is 100% natural and I do not have to worry about added pesticides, toxins or chemicals when treating infections.aVo Tea Tree Oil is absolutely great! I would highly recommend this brand.

"I received this cap yesterday and so far I really like it. I have been looking for a silicone cap to swim at my gym and to protect my hair from damage. Luckily, I purchased this product during a one time promotional period, which was great because it was just what I needed. The cap did not include a storage case, I had to purchase a separate case to protect my cap from damage.I ordered the black cap because it matches my black swim suit. The cap looks sporty and keeps all my hair in place while I swim. The inside of the cap has small grips that assure that my hair will stay in place while I swim. The silicone is very stretchy and fits all of my very long hair. The cap is thinner than other silicone caps I have owned and I like this because it makes the cap easier and less painful to put on. The outside of the cap is soft and smooth. The only thing I do not like on the cap is the giant logo, I would prefer a more discreet logo on the corner. The logo takes up the entire side of the cap, but this does not take away from the high quality swim cap!Overall, this is a great swim cap. I use my cap once or twice a week at my gym's swim pool. The cap keeps all my hair dry and in place while I swim and I am a satisfied costumer. The cap is light weight and dries fairly quickly. This review is written in my own words and experiences.

"I have seen these travel sticks at the mall but never purchased one because they are so expensive! I absolutely had to get one for my brother's graduation so I figured I would give one a try. Luckily I found this product available during a one time promotional period, this review is written in my own words and experiences. The travel stick is about the size of a chapstick which is great for travel and all on the go needs.When this product arrived I was expecting a twist off lid to pour my perfume, but I was so glad when I saw the easy spray option. Any perfume of choice can be added to the travel stick by taking off the small top of a perfume, inserting it at the bottom of the travel stick and pushing down to get the perfume out. This is an amazing idea! I can now get my perfume of choice on the go in a cute pink color. The travel stick sprayer works well and does not leak. I showed my new travel stick to my family and everyone was blow away! My mom, brother and several of my friends have all asked me to get them one. This travel stick is perfect for travelers! I take mine everywhere in my purse and it does not drip and hardly it weighs anything.This travel stick is a great gift for men as well. Since most men do not usually carry purses, this travel stick is the right size for men's pocket. I bought my husband a black one and he throws it in his pocket along with his chapstick. My husband said he needs 10 more of these sticks, because they are perfect for the car, pockets, carry on bags or any other place! I love that I can carry my favorite perfume on the go without spending tons of money on the travel size perfumes. This is a perfect gift idea, easy to use and it never gets old because you can change the perfume constantly!!

"These are the coolest gloves I have ever purchased! I got these for my sister who loves to go to concerts, parties and raves. The item was purchased during a one time promotional period. This review is written in my own words. My sister was so excited when she got them and put them on and immediately began to turn off the lights and show us her dance moves!When the lights are off, the little LED lights are very powerful! The gloves fit my sister very well, but on me fit a little big. She has bigger hands so I think these gloves come in a larger size. The gloves have to be readjusted once they are placed on and can be a bit difficult to take off due to the wires located at the top of the fingers of the gloves. The gloves have an on/off button which also controls the color and movement of the LED lights. The gloves come with several modes and colors for a better light show effect.I am very glad I purchased this for my sister! Whenever she goes to a concert or rave, everyone asks her where she got her gloves because they look so awesome. The lights are potent and since the lights are located on the fingers, light shows look intense and beautiful.

"I purchased item because my husband is a huge gamer and needed a new headset. I was very thankful that I was able to purchase this product during a one time promotional period. The price of the headset is great, for such a comfortable and nicely packaged item! I was very surprised with the sleek and modern look of the packaging and the gaming headset for only $13.99! This review is written in my own words and experiences.The headset includes the speak-in microphone, mic port cable and the comfortable headset. The sound is great and the microphone also works very well, with clear sound. I have to re-adjust the cable sometimes to get clear sound, but it usually works without a problem. The headphones were a little smaller than I expected, but they fit well and I can barely tell I have them on sometimes! My husband was very excited when I gifted him this headset and uses this all the time while playing with his brother online.

"I absolutely LOVE this vibrator. I purchased this product after buying the Ladygasm Cici 1, which was OK but does not compare to the Cici 2 which for me is absolutely amazing. From the moment I layed eyes on this vibrator I knew I was going to love it! I purchased this item using a one time promotional code, this review is written in my own words and experiences. This vibrator is my absolute favorite!The Ladygasm Cici 2 did not come in a pretty red box like the Cici 1, I loved the discreet packaging of the Cici 1. This vibrator comes in a vacuum sealed plastic bag, which makes it hard to store because the vacuum sealed bag is disposable and does not help to store the vibrator. This vibrator is 6.5 x 2.4 x 2.8 inches, dark pink color and is very soft. I love the uniform softness of the vibrator! One of my major complaints of the Cici 1 was the small size of the clitoris simulator and of the vibrator overall. The Cici 2 fixes both of these problems! The size of the vibrator is perfect! The clitoris simulator feels so good and is the right size! The vibrations are strong, yet very quiet and can be changed by the click of a button. The vibrator has two buttons which are labeled (Cici 1 is not labeled), one is the power button and the other one changes the vibration mode. The vibrator comes with various vibration modes which makes it almost impossible to get bored with the vibrator.This vibrator makes it so easy for me to climax due to the combo of the shape of the vibrator, softness and the rhythmic vibrations! My husband and I enjoy this toy together and I even use this toy when I am home alone. The vibrator is very discreet and lightweight. It can be taken anywhere and easily stored. The Cici 2 also includes a stand for easier storage but does not include any batteries (2 AAA). I would highly recommend this vibrator to any couples or singles out there who are in need of a highly stimulating and quiet vibrator. I absolutely love this vibrator and would buy another in a heart beat!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NS3LYVR216IB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0Q1FAY#wasThisHelpful","R1NS3LYVR216IB","A1TY7UHI7SCS94","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TY7UHI7SCS94?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If, like me, you've experienced storm-induced power outages that have dragged on for several days, you will likely be intrigued by the nightmare scenario that Ted Koppel poses in this important book.  What, he asks, would happen if an enemy state, terrorist organization or even a rogue hacker were able to knock out one or more of the three power grids that keep the lights on in the United States?  And what if this outage went on for weeks or even months?Koppel uses meticulous research into the inner workings of the electrical power industry, including interviews with prominent executive and Government officials to make a convincing case that a well-planned cyber attack on our power grid is a risk that our leaders need to take more seriously.  And he explains how difficult and expensive it would be either to prevent such an attack or develop a suitable response strategy.Even so, Lights Out is far from bleak or fatalistic.  Rather, Koppel uses examples (individual efforts to stockpile and prepare their families for such emergencies, the Morman Church's impressive infrastructure, and England's preparations for German airstrikes in World War II) to show how any efforts toward preparing for extended periods of power outage are likely to pay meaningful dividends.  Hopefully Mr. Koppel's warning will be heard and a combination of individual preparedness efforts and Government initiatives will begin to chip away at this daunting vulnerability.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BPXU30F9AYH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055341996X#wasThisHelpful","R2BPXU30F9AYH9","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Sea Beach Line seized my attention from the opening pages, offering a Jewish perspective on crime fiction. Its hero Issac (Izzy) Edel, ejected from college for drug-related activities and drawn to New York City on a quest to find his estranged father, Alojzy, narrates the novel with an honest voice, that‚Äôs somehow both naÔve and streetwise in equal measure.Alojzi, a street-smart tough-guy who has spent much of his life operating at the fringes of the law, has disappeared from his latest gig as a street vendor and is presumed dead by the hustlers and gangsters who knew him best. Izzy, however, has good reason to doubt the motives of Alojzi‚Äôs buddies and believes his father may still be alive.  After discovering Alojzi‚Äôs inventory storage room and a sketchbook telling his life story through a jumbled collection of portraits, Izzy feels compelled to take over his father‚Äôs bookselling business and figure out the significance of the faces in the sketchbook.  Believing that the secret to his father‚Äôs disappearance lies with a gangster named Timur and his hatchet man, Roman, Izzy allows himself to be recruited deeper and deeper into their service.  Matters are complicated by Izzy‚Äôs budding romance with an enigmatic young lady named Rayna, who bears a striking resemblance to one of Alojzi‚Äôs sketches and is on the run from a family who may be abusing her.  A subplot involving Izzy‚Äôs sister and her fianc√©e add additional complexity to this morality tale.Throughout the novel, Ben Nadler includes obscure references to Jewish novels, folk tales and customs, which often relate metaphorically to Izzy‚Äôs experiences.  Although I‚Äôm not Jewish and would have found even more meaning in these references if I understood them better, The Sea Beach line is an exceptionally well-written and captivating novel that will appeal to anyone who appreciates great writers like Michael Chabon and Dennis Lehane.  In the right hands, I could see this novel being adapted into a terrific movie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P4AK1YVEW38N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941493084#wasThisHelpful","R1P4AK1YVEW38N","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The three Axe products in this gift box--body wash, deodorant and spray-on scent--pack enough punch to keep any active male smelling fresh and clean.  The body wash is perfect, lathering up well and leaving just the right amount of residual earthy scent.  The fragrance, though pleasing in the same earthy way, is extremely strong and long-lasting, so a single quick spray to the chest is all I would recommend.  The deodorant, while leaving a pleasant scent, is not as effective at reducing sweat and odor as my go-to product (Mitchum), making it the weak link of the three.  This would make a great gift for an active teenage boy who may not otherwise be motivated to stave off his body odor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R304J7RHQG7VVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLZJ9SE#wasThisHelpful","R304J7RHQG7VVY","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dawn of Deception, billed as the first installment in a trilogy featuring park ranger David Nbeke, builds a thrilling plot around the real-world criminal enterprise of poaching elephants and rhinos.  Author Dan Fletcher effectively sets his novel in Kenya‚Äôs Massai Mara Reserve during 1996, providing insights into the political turmoil in the country and using authentic details to make his novel come to life.  This thriller employs a classic cat-and-mouse structure, pitting David against Peter Abasi, the corrupt Commander of the General Service Unit (a powerful Kenyan paramilitary organization).  David‚Äôs efforts to unravel the truth behind this poaching conspiracy are aided by investigative reporter Aaron Bernstein and complicated by his romantic involvement with Caitlyn, a veterinarian whose willingness to assist David places her in danger.  The action and suspense level pick up in the last third of the novel, as the extent of Abasi‚Äôs evil deeds comes to light, building toward a page-turning finale.  Be warned that this a violent novel, with graphic descriptions of torture and combat that are not for the squeamish reader.As Dan Fletcher completes this trilogy, I expect he will improve on some aspects of his writing.  In Dawn of Deception he tends to ‚Äútell‚Äù rather than ‚Äúshow,‚Äù often including superfluous phrases telling us what the characters are thinking or feeling.  The pacing is also uneven in the early and middle stages of the story, where some passages overwhelm the reader with details and can be somewhat hard to follow.  More care also needs to be taken in the editing process, as the number of typographical errors exceeds what you would expect in a published work.  These issues aside, Dawn of Deception is an entertaining read and promising start to the David Nbeke series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RL4MWBAE4U1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508717907#wasThisHelpful","R3RL4MWBAE4U1N","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"From the first page of this crime novel, you know you're in sure hands.  Thomas Cobb writes with the same pared-back style as Lehane and Leonard, yet somehow making the setting of dying northeastern town, Lydell, and the lives of its inhabitants so real that you truly feel what it would be like to live there.  Lydell is a place of little opportunity, so when rookie policeman Ronny Forbert pulls over a group of local troublemakers in a routine traffic stop and their ringleader, Matt Lafariere, ends up being killed by a hit-and-run driver while resisting arrest, Forbert finds himself in a desperate struggle to preserve his reputation and livelihood.Matters are complicated by the close connections between the key players in this small-town drama, revealed through a number of well-placed flashbacks.  Forbert, it turns out, used to run with Lafariere's gang, until Forbert ratted him out for arson and town police chief Gordy Hawkins took Forbert under his wing and offered him a job.  Forbert's girlfriend also happens to be Lafariere's old flame, and her father the Town Attorney.  These factors, enable Martin Glendenning, a local politician with a corrupt agenda and dislike for Hawkins, to incite the townsfolk against Forbert despite evidence of his innocence.Cobb's novel had me until the final chapters, as he did a masterful job at escalating the tension and stakes and made be really care about his complex and flawed heroes, Forbert and Hawkins.  A poor ending, however, can diminish even the best of novels, and regrettably that was the case with Darkness the Color of Snow.  For me, the careful character development and psychological dissection of Forbert went out the window, either because the author wrote himself into a corner or wanted a shocking, unpredictable ending.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36S1OD5B5TBHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062391240#wasThisHelpful","R36S1OD5B5TBHM","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Racing the Rain, John L. Parker has completed an addictive trilogy of running novels, all featuring miler Quenton Cassidy.  The first, Once a Runner, which takes place during Cassidy's days at Florida's fictitious Southeastern University, amassed a cult following that propelled it from the realm of the self-published to a deal with a major New York publisher.  The second installment, Again to Carthage, chronicled Cassidy's return to competitive running after years spent practicing law, fleshing out Cassidy's irreverent character and providing many insights into how training and racing remain central to a world-class athlete's persona, even into middle age.Racing the Rain is an origins tale.  Beginning in Cassidy's elementary and middle school years, when he first becomes aware of his speed and endurance in foot races with his classmates, and continuing through his high school years, when Cassidy's running takes a back seat to basketball, the reader comes to appreciate how friends, mentors, rivals, and personal demons all play a role in shaping the personality and drive necessary to become a competitive distance runner. As the father of an eighth grade running prodigy, who is similarly obsessed with basketball, I loved the way in which Cassidy's commitment to running was tested by this powerful distraction.Those looking for a novel dominated by training and racing scenes may be disappointed, particularly during the middle chapters that describe Cassidy's friendship with Trapper Nelson (known as the Tarzan of the Everglades) and his efforts to break into the ranks of varsity basketball.  There are also the usual campy conflicts between Cassidy and a member of the school faculty (this time the villain is his middle school track coach who later becomes the varsity basketball coach).  But those with the patience to appreciate how these influences kindle Cassidy's competitive fire will be rewarded by his glorious return to running in his senior year of high school and will discover the origins of Cassidy's bond with his future Southeastern teammate, Jerry Mizner.Thank you, Mr. Parker, for showing us once again what it means to be a runner.-Kevin Joseph, author of The Champion Maker","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UVETI029TD8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476769869#wasThisHelpful","R3UVETI029TD8H","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Stephanie Clifford‚Äôs first novel, Everybody Rise, offers a fascinating view into the rarified lifestyle of the old-moneyed, East Coast families who summer at mansion-sized ‚Äúcabins‚Äù in the Adirondack mountains, whose daughters still attend debutant balls and are too busy with social events to bother with paying jobs, and whose sons prep at the exclusive Ivy-league feeder schools on their way to making gobs more money at New York hedge funds.  Through the eyes of protagonist, Evelyn Beegan, daughter of a ‚Äúnew-money‚Äù plaintiffs‚Äô lawyer (bearing certain similarities to John Edwards), Clifford shows how enticing this elite lifestyle can appear and how tempting it is to invent a fake persona (complete with phony background details) in order to show you belong.  Using her own prep school alumni network and job as marketing lead for an exclusive networking Website called ‚ÄúPeople Like Us‚Äù to worm her way into these elite social circles, Evelyn is on the verge of the lifestyle she and her mother crave, until her mistruths and father‚Äôs legal entanglements threaten to undo everything she believes to be important.  Once you get past the first chapters, which throw a lot of characters and insider dialogue at you without much context, and come to terms with Evelyn‚Äôs unbelievably bad choices, which seem somewhat out-of-character from the sensible way she is initially portrayed, Everybody Rise will hold your interest and make you grateful that you‚Äôre not trying to run in these treacherous social circles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FCS8OCJD7TOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250077176#wasThisHelpful","R1FCS8OCJD7TOX","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A first novel by writing-instructor Elena Delbanco, The Silver Swan provides an entertaining literary foray into the rarefied world of the professional string musician.  Protagonist Mariana is a promising cellist until her career is cut short by the onset of stage fright and demands of her ailing father, revered cellist Alexander Feldmann.  When Alexander bequeaths his priceless Stradivarius cello (known as the Silver Swan) to former student Clause, instead of fulfilling his promises to Mariana, her struggles to come to terms with this shocking decision are complicated by her romantic attraction to Claude.  And as Mariana discovers the tangled web spun by Alexander's decades-long affair with another married woman, she's pushed to the outer limits of her sanity.Though the plot is predictable in many respects and the ending is somewhat anti-climactic, Delbanco writes beautifully and insightfully about the demanding lifestyle of the word-class musician.  And the way in which she recounts the complex relationship (father-daughter and teacher-student) between the narcissistic Alexander and the overly-eager-to-please Mariana really draws you into this story.  Overall, the novel came across as an autobiographically-inspired piece of catharsis for the author, and I look forward to a second novel in which she is able to construct a plot and characters that stand on their own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OZL15VEAA85B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590517164#wasThisHelpful","R2OZL15VEAA85B","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Revenge of the Krelim is marketed as a ""gripping, tightly-plotted tale of espionage"", and its hero, Malko Linge, is touted as France's answer to Fleming's James Bond.  Gerard de Villiers apparently penned 200 of these Malko Linge spy novels before his death in 2003 and is considered the most popular writer of spy novels in French history, with plots torn from the headlines or even presaging them.Sounds really compelling.  Unfortunately, after two or three chapters, I was disappointed by the awkwardness of the prose, on-the-nose dialogue, barrage of clich√©s, and gigolo antics of Linge.  If there had been a compelling, suspenseful plot, I may have been willing to overlook some of these shortcomings as byproducts of poor translation from the French version published in 2013.  But I'm sad to report that the plot was eminently predictable and largely devoid of suspense.  At bottom, it was nothing more that CIA operative Linge's efforts to fill in a few missing details to round out the file on an assassination and cover-up orchestrated by Vladimir Putin's regime, during which he had to dodge a couple of attempts on his life and accommodate several gorgeous women who couldn't keep their hands off him (described in overly-explicit detail).It may be that this novel is unrepresentative of the quality to be found in the rest of the series, but I've had my fill of Malko Linge.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11QY56TJS347I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804169357#wasThisHelpful","R11QY56TJS347I","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Adam Mitzner's Losing Faith rivals the best of John Grisham.  As a lawyer, I have high expectations for a legal thriller, and this one exceeded them on all accounts.  The action gets underway quickly, when super-lawyer Aaron Littmann is blackmailed into representing Nikolai Garkov, a high-profile Russian mobster with terrorist ties.  Littmann, chairman of one of New York City's most prestigious law firms and a seemingly devoted husband and father, has one vulnerability: he's had an affair with Faith Nichols, the federal judge assigned to Garkov's case.  And Littmann quickly learns that Garkov will expose the affair, along with the fact that he unethically tried a previous case before Faith while they were still lovers, unless Littman pressures Faith to acquit Garkov.Unlike many thriller writers, who quickly lose their way after setting such a tantalizing hook, Mitzner develops the plot brilliantly. The blackmail scheme morphs into something far more serious, exposing Littmann to the possibility of life in prison unless he can somehow clear his name.  Mitzner manages to increase the suspense without relying on far-fetched plot turns or thinly-developed characters, all the while maintaining an admirable degree of realism and precision in his treatment of legal issues.  The novel culminates in a nail-biting trial, in which Littman seeks to overcome damning evidence pointing toward his guilt, and in doing so, ignores the advice to negotiate a plea deal that he's provided to many of his supposedly innocent clients in similar circumstances.If you are fan of legal thrillers, Adam Mitzner is a writer who deserves a spot on your bookshelf next to Grisham and Lashner. Losing Faith has my highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3WLC5XHTJP36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476764247#wasThisHelpful","R3WLC5XHTJP36","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This psychological suspense novel employs a unique narrative structure.  Chapters alternate between Rachel's narration of events immediately preceding and following a murder, and Megan's narration of earlier events.  A third narrator, Anna, provides another perspective on some of the post-murder happenings.Rachel, driven to alcoholism by her inability to become pregnant and her failed marriage to Tom (now remarried to Anna), experiences a blackout on the night of the murder, preventing her from recalling something critical that she observed and calling the reliability of her other memories into question.Setting-wise, this novel is also unique.  Much of the action takes place on or in the proximity of a commuter train that Rachel rides to and from work, and continues to ride even after being fired.  While the train motif enhances the unity of the story, it also tends to fuel the use of coincidence, as the same group of characters repeatedly run across one another in close proximity to the train.The closed setting, alcohol-fueled despondency of Rachel, and dysfunctional relationships that pervade this novel make for a rather dark and creepy reading experience. And while the author takes great pains to dissect the psychological motivations of her characters, she does so in a way that strains the limits of what is believable and bogs down the action just when it starts to accelerate.So this novel was kind of a mixed-bag for me.  I appreciated the creative structure of this psychological suspense novel, but felt that it dragged in places and that the characters' motivations ultimately lacked the believability one expects from this genre.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HT182F15UK84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594633665#wasThisHelpful","R3HT182F15UK84","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This soft rubber flying disc is a fun variation on the classic Frisbee design.  Adapting your throw takes some time and patience, however, as this disc is considerably heavier than the traditional design and tends to slip from your fingers when you try to throw it too hard.  But after a while you will learn to tilt it upwards more upon release and add some extra rotation to hold the trajectory.  The other unique feature, a hole in the center, allows you to catch the disc by poking through your finger tips.  My main issue with the design is that it doesn't seem conducive to long, accurate throws or good hang time, though maybe it's just that I haven't yet put in enough time to hone my technique.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17GK2TXZ9EP3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0086F5D7Q#wasThisHelpful","R17GK2TXZ9EP3K","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

With only 210 calories and 10 grams of protein per bar, this is not a supplement that provides the large protein infusion sought by muscle-builders.

"Ben Metcalf is well known in literary circles as an accomplished editor and writing instructor, and Against the Country is being touted as the masterpiece novel that he's been toiling at for years.  I appreciate the central idea of his work, an attempt to debunk the popular myth that country living is less corrupt and more wholesome than an urban existence.  But the way in which it's executed (a series of short, interrelated, essay-style rants against growing up in rural Virginia during the 1970s and 1980s), does not facilitate great story-telling.There are certain groups of essays that begin to form engaging pieces of a story line (notably, the narrator's school bus-related rites of passage, anecdotes revealing a love-hate relationship with a complex, abusive father, and a bizarre series of interactions with the chicken coop's dominant Rhode Island Red ""B.F.""), yet too many hard-to-decipher rants are interspersed throughout for my liking.  (Be forewarned that Metcalf writes in incredibly long, convoluted sentences, which require all the focus and attention you can muster just to maintain a tenuous connection to the material.)If you have a taste for the darkest of comedies, a mistrust of all things rural, and don't mind stretching your brain to its outer limits, you may want to give this unusual book a try.  But if you're looking for some light, good-natured entertainment, this one's not for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XYNJ8T1WU9LK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400062691#wasThisHelpful","R2XYNJ8T1WU9LK","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Under Armour claims to have redesigned the running shoe from the ground up, fabicating the Speedform Apollo in a clothing factory for better fit and avoidance of inside seams.  These marketing claims are justified from my experience with this shoe.  Aside from a tongue that tends to look bunched up when the shoe is tied (though still feeling comfortable), these shoes truly do fit like a second skin, holding the foot in place and reducing blisters.  They are also incredibly light-weight, rivaling a racing flat.  It's a firm, minimalist ride, however, so if you're used to running in a highly-cushioned shoe, you may need to shorten your runs, especially on hard surfaces, until your legs acclimate.  One beneficial effect I have seen is that the shoe has helped increase my stride rate from 165 to 175, as the firm ride does not allow for overstriding.  And once you are acclimated, you will find yourself running faster times over short and longer distances, with your legs feeling fresher than you expect afterward.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3762WR1VJMUP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GS4VH5E#wasThisHelpful","R3762WR1VJMUP8","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mark McClusky's survey of the scientific influences of sports performance offers a comprehensive look across a number of subjects that other recent books have handled individually and in greater depth.  For example, The Sports Gene offers a deeper look at genetic contributors to performance, and other books examine performance enhancing-drugs and data analytics in more detail.  Consequently, the text moves from subject to subject without putting forth a remarkable thesis beyond the rather-obvious observation that science is affecting the way athletes approach their sports, in much the same way as it is affecting other aspects of our lives. For me, the most groundbreaking portions were those that discussed how science is allowing athletes to train more intelligently and specifically to hone those skills sets unique to their particular sports. That said, the writing style is clear and engaging, and the author makes good use of interesting anecdotes and studies to support his observations.  So I would recommend this book for someone who has not read extensively on these subjects and wants a good, general overview of the intersection between sports and science.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VA94JA5QJQNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594631530#wasThisHelpful","R1VA94JA5QJQNU","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Endgame will feel familiar to Hunger Games fans:  twelve teens are pitted against one another in a violent contest.  Here, though, the stakes are elevated, as the twelve Players fight not just for personal survival but for the survival of an ancient lineage that each represents. To further prime the pump, James Frey has embedded a real-life contest within the framework of the novel, promising a treasure trove for the reader who can solve the puzzle and locate it.Puzzle and booty aside, the story itself is a fast, action-packed read, if you can get past the micro-chapters, clipped prose, comic book-style action, and unanswered questions about why Endgame exists in the first place.  We know there is an alien agenda driving it, and that these are the same extraterrestrials who helped ancient civilizations build Stonehenge and the pyramids, but Frey has deferred the specifics for the next books in the series.It will be interesting to see whether Endgame catches fire like the Hunger Games. I suspect its success may hinge as much, or more, on the allure of the puzzle as the story surrounding it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KT4E4E2PD72Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062332589#wasThisHelpful","R1KT4E4E2PD72Y","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel got off to a promising start.  A young black man (Deesh), imprisoned as a murder suspect, meets a young white woman (Jan)with information that may lead to his acquittal. The author then flashes back, using alternating chapters narrated by Deesh and Jan, to tell the story of how three former high school basketball stars, now working on the fringes of the law, get ensnared in a crime connected to the seedy world of racehorse gambling.Unfortunately, the novel's early excitement and promise fade through middle chapters that are too introspective.  Introspection can be effective in a crime novel if done well, but many of these literary musings come across as forced and awkward, grasping for themes and connections that don't flow naturally from the story itself.  Though there are bursts of action, often the characters' decisions lack plausibility.Other reviewers have criticized Mark Wisniewski's decision not to bring the plot lines together until the very end.  For me, this was not the root cause of the novel's flatness, as the author was seeking to link the disparate worldviews of the two narrators through themes rather than plot points, a risky narrative structure that can be powerful, but only when executed to perfection.  Unfortunately, the thematic connections between Deesh's and Jan's experiences were not established convincingly enough for this novel to come across as much more than two interesting novellas.To be fair, there are some beautiful passages in here, and I have no doubt that Mark Wisniewski is capable of writing great novels in the future.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVZ7L5O91I333/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399172122#wasThisHelpful","RVZ7L5O91I333","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dark Spies, fourth in Matthew Dunn's Spycather series, is a solid spy thriller, featuring a good blend of espionage know-how and page-turning suspense.  Its hero, Will Cochrane, has strong appeal as a spy who follows his own moral compass, even when doing so puts his career and life in jeopardy.  Dunn sets the hook early and hard, forcing Cochrane to choose between a CIA order that he allow a fellow agent to be executed in furtherance of a national security project called Ferryman and his gut instincts that she doesn't deserve to die.  Cochrane's choice puts him on the run and forces him to make his way from Norway back to the United States, where he hopes to expose the truth about Ferryman.As the plot unfolds, numerous twists and turns emerge, several of which veer out of the zone of plausibility.  So my main criticism of Dark Spies is the author's willingness to compromise plausibility in his quest to ramp up the thrill quotient and ratchet up the suspense.  In future novels, I would prefer him to make more of an effort to maintain a realistic feel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JDMT4115LWXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062309463#wasThisHelpful","R1JDMT4115LWXC","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The caffeine content is less than a cup of coffee, but other ingredients (like the taurine found in Red Bull) combine with the caffeine to provide a noticeable energy boost that lasts several hours.  The biggest drawback is that it gives me a slight jittery feeling, though not nearly as pronounced as Red Bull.

"This young-adult novel caught my attention because of its marketing claim to be a story told entirely in lists.  In some ways, it's unfortunate that it sometimes takes a gimmick like this to attract attention in today's crowded literary marketplace.  For while the list-driven structure of the novel is notably unique, the chapters where the lists more closely resemble the traditional literary form and the well-drawn personalities of the characters are what make this coming-of-age story so compelling.Comprised of lists that range from a few words in some instances to the length of a regular novel's chapter in other places, the 640 pages fly by in a surprisingly seamless flow.  (The shorter lists often provide a comic relief between the longer, dramatic lists.)  The narrative is powered by the compelling personality of teenage protagonist Darren, a slightly-overweight ""everyboy"" who's struggling to find his way in the world.  Among the challenges he faces are the revelation that his recently-divorced father is gay, his confusing attraction to an eccentricly-artistic girl named Zoey, and the realization that the older brother he so admires has fallen into a druggy haze during his freshman year at college.As its unusual title suggests, this novel is not so much about plot as about discovering what's unique in ourselves and others, and respecting these seemingly insane differences. And by the end of the novel, Darren begins to make more confident choices about his budding musical career, his relationship with Zoey, and the way in which he relates to his fractured family members. There are lots of good lessons packed in here that would benefit teenagers and adults alike, and this unusual novel should find a broad audience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18VURAVWFENKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442495731#wasThisHelpful","R18VURAVWFENKL","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Following in the comedic tradition of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, The Santa Claus, and Elf, William Hazelgrove's Real Santa is a sure bet to join the ranks of classic Christmas tales. For fans of Hazelgrove's other novels, George Kronenfeldt fits within the familiar mold of his other protagonists: the middle-aged father who takes up a quixotic cause in an effort to restore some semblance of order to the chaos of his professional and family life.The story opens in the run-up to the Christmas season with George receiving news that he has lost his job as a civil engineer and that his daughter Megan's caustic fourth-grade teacher has made comments that make her doubt the existence of Santa Claus.  George, a Christmas fanatic who is still scarred by his father's premature revelation of the truth about Santa Clause, decides he must prove to Megan that Santa is real by staging something so convincing that she can film it on her phone and post it on YouTube.  What follows is a madcap, no-expense-spared project to hire a sketchy movie producer and enlist the engineering genius of his father to help him put real reindeer on his roof and navigate his chimney with a bag full of presents.  As Christmas eve approaches and the obstacles to success mount, George also encounters an enigmatic fellow who may or may not be the real Santa Claus.Although the ending, which crosses into magical realism, feels somewhat out of character with the rest of the story, this is a Christmas tale after all, and a thoroughly enjoyable one at that.-Kevin Joseph, author of The Champion Maker","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FA9Q1FY3F9OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MUKXSIY#wasThisHelpful","R2FA9Q1FY3F9OO","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a fan of The Fourth Realm Trilogy, I was eager for the opportunity to review the latest work from the enigmatic John Twelve Hawks.  For readers new to this author, there has been considerable media swirl over the years regarding Hawks's decision to keep his real identity anonymous, even to his agent and publisher. It seems that the same mistrust of governments and corporations that pervades his fiction writing has also shaped the way he chooses to live.  And for me, that makes his novels all the more compelling.In Spark, Hawks narrates through the first person viewpoint of a seriously-scarred man.  After barely surviving a motorcycle accident, Jacob Underwood's near-death experience has left him with a condition called Cotard's syndrome, which makes him believe he's become a type of living dead, nothing more than a life force or ""spark"" floating in a body or ""shell"" with no meaningful connection between mind and body.  This condition manifests itself in strange behaviors, like an aversion to any physical contact with people, a refusal to consume solid food, and the inability to experience or perceive most human emotions.  It's little wonder, then, that Underwood, a highly intelligent computer programmer whose condition makes him incredibly focused on completing assigned tasks with ruthless efficiency, is recruited as an assassin for a shadowy corporation.What follows is a novel so well-plotted and unique that I guarantee you won't be able to tear yourself away.  As Underwood takes on the most challenging assignment of his career, he begins to undergo a personal transformation in his outlook on the world.  And while Underwood begins to question the merits of his amoral belief system and what this means for completion of his assignment, Hawks has the perfect forum to air his views on metaphysical questions, the surveillance state in which the story is set, and what it really means to be human.If you are a fan of edgy and creative dystopian fiction, Spark is an intelligent thriller you won't want to miss.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R271NNASRXLLI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538677#wasThisHelpful","R271NNASRXLLI7","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was my first Victor Carl novel, and I found it enjoyable as stand-alone read, though not as riveting as The Barkeep, another Lashner novel that I read recently.  What I like most about Bagmen is its irreverent protagonist, who offers a deliciously cynical perspective on politicians, lawyers, and the sordid ways in which they can intersect.  Enter the bagman, a shady figure who couriers illicit bribes from wealthy businessmen to politicians they want to influence, along with pay-offs by politicians to those they need to keep quiet.  When Victor joins their ranks and becomes a suspect in a murder investigation connected to a senator's pay-off of a blackmailer, Lashner dazzles the reader with a plot so twisted and full of corrupt players that it's impossible to tell whether anyone has pure intentions.What I don't like so much is the somewhat forced way in which Lashner tries to replicate the hard boiled writing style of noir fiction (over-the-top metaphors galore), and the increasing implausibility of the plot as it careens toward its bizarre climax with the Big Butter.Criticism aside, this was an entertaining read, and Lashner remains on my short list of briliiant authors in this genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDJUD9S1KC9E4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477822836#wasThisHelpful","RDJUD9S1KC9E4","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"At only 207 pages, Dennis Lehane somehow manages to create a novel bursting with setting (the gritty side of Boston portrayed in Mystic River), populated by multi-dimensional characters, held together by a taut story line, featuring a touching man-woman-dog romantic subplot, and chalk full of meaningful themes.  This is truly a masterpiece, written without a single wasted word, and I can't wait to see the upcoming movie.The protagonist, Bob the bartender, first comes across as a well-meaning loner, who's failure to forge meaningful connections with anyone may be an indication of simple-minded purity.  But as Bob and cousin Marv, the former owner of a bar now controlled by Chechen mobsters, get caught up in events leading to a huge money-drop at the bar on Super Bowl Sunday, Bob gives up his life of reserved seclusion, gradually revealing a worldly, hard-nosed side that nobody sees coming.This book should be required reading for any aspiring novelist in the genre, as it offers a tutorial in how less is often more when it comes to compelling writing.  And for any reader who loves great crime fiction, this one is a must-read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE4LUAK1MI6UR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062365444#wasThisHelpful","RE4LUAK1MI6UR","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once you get through the rather lengthy set-up steps for this filtered water bottle (which involve soaking the filter for an hour and running it under water for 3 minutes), this product is simple to fill from the tap and seems to work as advertised.  The water passing through the filter has a taste comparable to what you find in a bottled water, but at a greatly reduced cost and impact on the environment.  I like to keep a full bottle in my refrigerator, where I can grab it for rehydration after exercise or to accompany a meal.

"The premise of Shaman Elizabeth Herrera's novel is a timely one, as evidence is mounting that our over-reliance on fossil fuels, deforestation, genetically-engineered crops and other economically-driven, but environmentally-irresponsible, practices is posing an existential threat to the planet earth. In Earth Sentinels, the indigenous people of the world revolt, led by shamans who are able to conjure totem animal companions and pass into the spiritual realm, where they learn from a mysterious figure named Bechard how to direct nature's powers against the leaders of governments and industries who are threatening the planet.  As the stakes mount and a violent showdown between the world's military powers and the Earth Sentinels looms, the story picks up its pace and becomes quite engaging.  It is in these creative action sequences that Herrera's writing is at its most assured, and there are some fine set pieces here.While an enjoyable read full of important messages, the choppy chapters (often only 1-2 pages) and numerous point-of-view characters make it hard to become attached to any of the protagonists and detract from the flow of the story.  Herrera also has a tendency to ""tell"" rather than ""show"" and write dialogue that is too on-the-nose.  As she develops more experience as a novelist, I have confidence that her craft will continue to improve.  And I look forward to what she has in store for us readers next.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U5W25Y1J32XH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692225315#wasThisHelpful","R3U5W25Y1J32XH","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jennifer Murphy has written a clever murder mystery based on the premise that a sociopathic man, living compartmentalized lives with three wives, found murdered by wife number one at a beach house on the North Carolina shore, may or may not have been the victim of a conspiracy orchestrated by the three wives.  In addition to the clever three-wife premise, Jennifer Murphy uses multiple first-person points of view to tell the story in a non-chronological sequence.While deserving of 5 stars for its creativity, clean prose style and well-drawn characters, the way in which this mystery is told detracts somewhat from the suspense.  While it is hard to put my finger on the problem, I suspect it's that the classic mystery relies on a single narrator, limiting the reader's knowledge to the knowledge of the narrator.  Here, in order to withold the solution to the mystery, Murphy must limit what certain of the narrators share with the reader until the final pages, which comes across as unnatural and contrived. Also, as noted by other reviewers, some of the plot points strain credulity and seem out of character (most notably, the relationship between wife number one and the detective).These narrative issues aside, this novel held my attention and was an enjoyable read.  I especially appreciated the bond that developed between Picasso (the daughter of wife number one, and in many ways the most interesting character in the novel) and the detective.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSI2E8O3CLZBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538553#wasThisHelpful","RSI2E8O3CLZBE","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When an opportunity presents itself to read and review a new novel by Alan Furst, I have always seized it, having become a fan of his authentic and sophisticated approach to espionage fiction set in the run-up to World War II.  Midnight in Europe fits comfortably into this established mold, but to a fault.Although Paris-based lawyer, Cristian Ferrar, is a complex and sympathetic protagonist whose good-natured womanizing provides a romantic thread that enhances the espionage elements associated with his support to the Spanish Republic's cause, Furst pays too little attention to developing a satisfying or complex plot.  It's as if Furst felt content simply to immerse the reader in the atmosphere of this period.  Perhaps Furst's point is that Ferrar's actions are inevitably inconsequential, yet heroic nonetheless, but I expect more from espionage fiction and from Furst in particular.So depite being well-written, sophisticated, and authentic feeling, I felt that Midnight in Europe's paint-by-numbers plot paled in comparison to Furst's other novels.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25M76QPLW3YEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400069491#wasThisHelpful","R25M76QPLW3YEU","AKHKBZEHJ36FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHKBZEHJ36FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like these pens. I am getting addicted to the adult coloring books and prefer pens over pencils.

"I am doing the iodine protocol that Dr. Brownstein recommends, however he doesn't recommend nascent iodine, which this is. I am seeing results with the protocol but I am doing both lugol's AND nascent. I think that might be why I am having good results. Iodine detoxes bromine especially. Bromine is a halide (halogen) and heavy metal that is in everything these days -- from new furniture and carpet (the anti-inflammable crap they spray on) to clothing, to any store bought bread, brominated flour, etc. It is a filler in many medications in high amounts. So, it can cause a lot of issues with our health, and that is one reason why high doses of iodine are important.When you take iodine, you should ALWAYS take selenium as well. They need each other. Otherwise you can cause a mineral imbalance and throw a lot of systems off. Especially if you have thyroid issues.Anyway, this stuff is easy to take. It is good to have on hand. And iodine is one of the most important minerals for us. It can prevent fibrocystic breast disease, and fibroids, and possibly help prevent breast cancer. Yes, you should take it every day!

"This item comes with 5 interchange able lenses, a carrying case, and a sock. Only one of the lenses has UV protection and it's the black lens.These have worked well thus far. The fit is a little tight on the sides of my head and I usually wear a size M/L hat or helmet. These seem OK so far. But just OK. The frame has a lot of flex so when I'm putting these on, it causes the side of the lens to pop out of the frame, and needs to be snapped back into place. These are only held in place in the middle of the frame above the bridge. Swapping lenses was quick and easy enough. though if you have a high nose bridge, These glasses will sit a little bit higher on your face. Overall I'm happy with these for the cost.

"I would give these a 3 star rating. Mainly because of the awesome travel case. This set came with the goggle, a stiff carry case, and a bag. These goggles look nice and are comfortable to wear. There are rubber strips on the inside of the goggle straps that help hold this nicely to a helmet that doesn't let the strap slip around.My main issue with these (and hence the 3-star review) is that the ventilation on the google is rather poor. The lens has no vents, and vents around the frame are not enough. The little cut-outs on the front of the frame, are just cosmetic. If you fog up the lenses on these goggles you are going to have a hard time getting them to clear up. It's just the nature of the design. I had to remove the lens to take off the scratch protective film that's on the inside of the lens, and getting the lens back into place was a bit tricky, but doable. overall I'm not disappointed with these goggles due to the price point, but I'm not overly impressed by its function to mitigate a fogged lens.

"The allreli HDMI switch is about what you think it would be.  Just like the photo, it has one output and three inputs; a manual switch on the unit itself; and an IR remote with a sensor you can plug in.  The remote comes with batteries also.The switch says it can support 4K, but it also only supports HDMI 1.4.  2.0 is required for most devices to function properly.  My tablet would not output to 4K through the switch, and neither would my Roku 4.  Changing the resolution to 1080p made it pass through appropriately.  In all fairness, I do not own a 4K television, but when I set devices to output in 4K, the TV downsamples it.  It didn't happen at all with the switch and I'm not sure if that's the fault of the switch or my television, but I suspect the former.I did not note any ghosting, which I had seen on other switches.  That means this unit has sufficient electrical insulation within to prevent the signal from ""bleeding"".  In short, it's a high quality unit.The bottom line: if you're getting this for 1080p devices or lower, it works really well.  I would exercise caution if I wanted to use it with devices that output 4K - especially since they require HDMI 2.0 to operate properly.The 4K support thing on the box is a bit misleading.

"This is a great supplement to lower blood pressure. For the last few months I've taken less medication than before (from 5 mg amlodipine down to 2.5 mg). I take the low dose prescription about 8 PM and then I take half a capsule of Arjuna about 10:30 PM. By 11 PM I'm very sleepy and get about 2 hours more sleep each night. Most importantly my average blood pressure reading is around 118/72 rather than 130/85 before taking Arjuna.Why only 4 stars? It's because the cap was loose when I received it and would not screw tightly. The company needs to stop using a cheap bottle cap which will not close. I solved the problem by using an empty jar (with a tight lid) to store the capsules. The expiration date was January 2017 and I received it in July 2015. That's good because this will last for months. It works so well to lower blood pressure that I will definitely order this again.One word of caution. Since everyone is different start with a small dose of about half a capsule. If you take too much it will lower your blood pressure too much which can cause headaches and  make you extremely tired.

"This may be the best over-the-counter pain relief you can get without a prescription. Within a minute after spraying Cryoderm created a very warm heat on the applied area. I used it for neck pain and at first it burned because I used 2 sprays. I didn't realize it was so strong. After about 15 minutes the burning calmed down and it felt great. Most of my pain was gone and I was able to sit at my computer without feeling neck pain. This is a lot safer than swallowing harmful drugs which can take an hour or longer to start working.This works fast but I found that just 1 spray is enough. I would definitely order this again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HMRXR205LL29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GYRC43E#wasThisHelpful","R3HMRXR205LL29","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Each trick and technique is fully described along with appropriate photos which make it easier to learn.

"This is useless because there was no explanation of how to do the so-called trick. All you receive is 10 regular playing cards and 6 gaff cards.

"This is a very good magic trick DVD perfect for amateurs like me. As with most Colombini DVDs you get a variety of 10 tricks ranging from amazing to mediocre. My only complaint is that, although mostly easy,  too many tricks require buying or making other props to perform. I would have preferred most tricks to be impromptu using just an ordinary deck of cards. Nevertheless I found 4 great tricks that make this DVD well worth the price. The 4 best tricks I'll briefly describe below:1.) Wild Card Cash - You show 2 jokers (front and back) which appear normal. When you rub the jokers a $20 bill apears between them. Very easy to learn but you'll need about 15 minutes to create the gimmick. This will get great reactions.2.) Countdown - This is a mind blowing prediction trick involving colored numbers and 12 special cards. Great trick but requires props which you must buy.3.) Divin-Ace-Tion - A very nice mostly self working way to produce 4 aces from a regular deck.4.) Ken's Clock - My favorite trick which will shock spectators. It's a very clever variation of the famous clock trick where you know what hour and card will be chosen on a clock. The surprise at the end will be totally unexpected if you've never seen this. Although you'll need to make a simple prop this can be done without any props other than a deck of cards.Overall a worthy addition to any magic collection. I highly recommend this to all amateur magicians who perform for family and friends.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCEL50A8953TM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008Z26LAI#wasThisHelpful","RCEL50A8953TM","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the perfect amount of light for my basement. I was using a 100 watt bulb but it only lit up part of my basement. With this light I can clearly see throughout the basement which is about the size of a fairly large living room. I checked in various stores but none had a light over 100 watts.

"This is fantastic for doing floor exercises such as pushups, crunches, situps, leg raises and almost any other floor exercise. I went to several local stores and saw mats that were more expensive and very thin (0.5 inch thick or less). This mat is much thicker, softer & pliable. It does a great job of supporting my knees when kneeling. It's very soft and cushions your whole body. The dimensions 24 inches wide, 72 inches long & 5 inches thick are just perfect.

When you spray this on it does a decent job of freezing and numbing the pain for a few hours. However this is highly overpriced for a tiny little so-called 3.3 ounce can (it looks more like 2 ounces). Furthermore, ICY HOT roll on works just as well and lasts longer. Also 4 ICY HOTS cost less than 1 Ethyl Chloride can. Because of the outrageous price I will never buy this again. My suggestion is to try Icy Hot first.

"This book has about 20 simple number tricks. It's definitely not for serious magicians. In fact it should be called ""amateur number tricks for elementary school kids"". I did find one good trick that I liked. However the rest of the number tricks were very basic and would not fool anyone except perhaps 6th graders or below.

"This is extremely thin tape which is not suitable for athletics. The protection is minimal at best. I used it the other day on my knees while exercising. Unfortunately it did not protect my knees as well as KT tape and other athletic tapes do. I am now once again recovering from very sore painful knees due to old injuries. With good tape this has not happened in over a year. I honestly don't know where all the good reviews are coming from because this is definitely NOT the proper tape to use. It's about as thin as masking tape which costs much less than this tape. Perhaps some people don't realize how dangerous this is until they feel pain from past injuries. I recommend spending more money to get REAL sports tape. I truly hope others will learn from my unfortunate experience. I do recommend KT tape or Kinesiology Tape which I have used successfully for over a year.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIL7H6TK96PVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SC9S2XS#wasThisHelpful","RIL7H6TK96PVH","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this from Bayou Fitness back in October 2014 and recently sold it for about half of what I paid for it. There's a reason this is not sold locally in stores. It looks great on video but when you try it in person it's not that great at all. Most people will not be comfortable with this but a small percentage will like it. That's where the good reviews are coming from. I will elaborate below.PROS1. Very sturdy well built machine2. Lots of nice extra parts (some are actually useful)3. Good email support and online chat help from the company4. A few of the exercises are actually pretty good5. Much less expensive than the Total Gym which is very similarCONS1. Some of the exercises are not ergonomically correct. You have to awkwardly reposition your body in unnatural ways to perform many of the exercises. Because of this I pinched a muscle in my neck. Fortunately I have a good doctor who asked the right questions and figured out what was wrong. It took me nearly 2 months to recover.2. The so-called instructions are a complete mess. You get too many papers, tons of forms and 2 videos. Unfortunately nothing except trial and error helps to use this machine. It took several workouts just to become familiar with the proper use. I emailed the company several times and they admitted that their instructions need to be redone.3. It is awkward at best to fold it up and unfold. Definitely not at all easy like they want you to believe.4. Many of the levels feel the same. For some exercises you have to raise it 2 or 3 levels to notice a difference. Also even the lowest levels will be hard for most women mainly because it's very awkward.5. Each exercise moves your body rather than you moving yourself. This can cause vertigo or dizziness in some people.6. The amount of exertion is not actually known. It's more of a guess. The percentage of body weight used is not accurate. It feels way different than the weight you're supposed to be using.7. When I first got it the chords were way too long. I'm 5'8"" and the chords were designed for someone much taller. However, the company did explain how to cut or shorten the chords which was very annoying.In summary I was very disappointed with this machine. I really tried and wanted to like it but it just wasn't for me. My suggestion is to always try an exercise machine in person before buying it. If this unit were sold in stores I truly believe that 95% would walk away right after trying it. It is not a completely natural form of exercise. For less money I recommend a stationary pulley machine from Gold's gym or Weider. You will have better control and know exactly how much weight you're using. Also you will be less likely to get injured due to poor ergonomics. I found out the hard way that simple exercises are the best. No more gimmicks for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MEARI8H8OV1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N2X1AG#wasThisHelpful","R2MEARI8H8OV1C","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This comes with a regular ESP deck of 25 cards and a booklet which explains more than a dozen simple tricks. The cards contain 5 symbols repeated 5 times. Although there were some good ideas the magic tricks were not what I expected. The cards are supposed to be marked but even with a magnifying glass I could see no differences. This eliminates many of the described magic tricks because you would need x-ray vision to do them. Out of the 18 described tricks I found 1 or 2 ideas that I would actually use with some changes. Also there were no self working mathematical tricks which is very often used with these type of cards. The tricks are too simplistic and geared towards a beginner trying to fool children. A much better choice for learning ESP magic is ESP Card Magic (Nick Trost Routines) Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 by Aldo Colombini. These DVDs are both sold on Amazon. They are cheaper and much much better because they provide great visual learning. I have both of these DVDs. Each one has several very strong but easy to learn professional magic tricks.

"I've used at least 4 different brands of tape for my knees. This tape has a bit more stickiness and seems to hold a bit better than the others. It's very supportive and can definitely help prevent further injury to weak or injured body parts. Before ordering I always check the price. This one was a bit cheaper than most of the others. For reasons I mentioned I would definitely consider ordering again since it's very good tape and a good deal.They offer you an ebook with your order which, in my opinion, is almost useless. It's merely a short pamphlet which you download. It does have some simple common sense tips to prevent injury which most people already know. A better bonus would be something people can really use such as an extra foot of tape. Then I would probably place TWO orders.

"I've had this a few days now and for my purpose it's perfect. It is very much like a smart TV but much less expensive. I always felt too smart to get a smart TV because it's a rip off. I got this to get more viewing choices for my upstairs bedroom HDTV without paying extra to cable. With an antenna we only got 3-4 channels. Now we get you tube, 100s of free movies, OVGuide and many many other free choices. Everything plays in high quality HD. Once I figured out how to search on youtube it gave us countless more choices because you can find virtually anything including tons of free movies and TV shows at no extra cost. The best part is that I don't have to pay monthly fees to watch TV in my bedroom. In addition I'm getting even more choices than with cable. Now I'm able to watch what I want when I want at no extra charge. In the past I've tried converter boxes, USB devices and antennas but could never get more than a few limited channels. Now at last my search is over. I absolutely love this device. The more I use it the more I'm learning about my choices. I'd gladly give up cable (downstairs) in a second for this. However other members of my family are addicted to various shows which this device can not easily get.

"YS Eco Bee Farms raw honey was the best honey deal I found on Amazon. Locally I can get honey for about the same price ($7 per pound). However, this honey is creamier, tastier and thicker which is just the way I like it. This has many benefits too numerous to list here. I use it in tea whenever I get cold or flu symptoms. If you drink tea with honey and lemon 2-3 times a day it will usually resolve your cold symptoms within a day or two. You can also use this to prevent constipation. Just use a tablespoon in a small glass of warm water. I do this almost every morning before breakfast. When I forget a get a little constipated.

"This review is based on my personal experience. It doesn't necessarily mean this will not work for you. However be aware that if your door is less than 30 inches wide this will not work well at all. I tried to use this on my basement door which is 26"" wide and about 6 feet high. Here are the problems I encountered:1.) It was about 4 inches too loose. When I tried making it tighter it would not stay in place. As soon as you try to exercise it will immediately become loose. It may only be suitable on doors that are 30"" or more in width. On the other hand it may not work well at all. This is a product that you have to try in person before buying.2.) This device is merely a bunch of belts, straps and buckles similar to car seat belts. I believe this is just not designed well enough to stay in place on any door. I really wish this weren't true but it definitely was when I attempted to use it. Perhaps if it had some material attached to the door it could provide a more secure attachment. As it is it doesn't work well at all.3,) The straps were cramped and didn't have enough room to comfortably fit (top to bottom of the door). If it were 3 straps it would have just made it. Also 4 straps is overkill. All most people need is a high, middle and low pulley for 95% of all exercises. Unless you have a very tall door, well over 6 feet, 4 straps will not have enough room. They will be cramped making this unusable.4.) The time it takes to constantly adjust the belts, buckles and straps is a waste. You'll need to adjust and tighten constantly. It's much faster and easier to simply secure it lower or higher using the bodylastics equipment you probably already have.In summary this is definitely an item that should be tried in person. If your door is not the right size it simply won't work. I find it deceptive that the company would lie by claiming that it works on doors 26"" (or more). It definitely does not work on 26"" wide doors. The concept is great but the execution simply does not work on all doors. The good thing is that I was able to return this to Amazon and get a full refund. The Bodylastics band system is excellent but the Ultranchor is unnecessary and does not work as expected. I think the company should try again because with improvements made this could be beneficial to all. As it is now it definitely won't work with the wrong size door!","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KIMP5PSLLGZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005NAQG0K#wasThisHelpful","R1KIMP5PSLLGZX","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been taking this every night before bedtime for more than a week . Within 30-45 minutes it kicks in and makes you calm, relaxed and able to sleep. I awake feeling refreshed with no side effects whatsoever. This is a safe natural way to help you sleep. After 3 days of daily use I noticed my blood pressure decrease by 5-10 points on average. Another plus here is that magnesium helps relax your muscles and is useful to recover from exercise.I have 2 reasons for giving it 4 stars instead of 5. First problem is that I received a poorly packed item. The zip lock top was partially open and some of the powder had spilled out. I also don't like receiving a pack that's only about 1/3 full. For that they should use a smaller packet and fill it up. Better yet they should use a small plastic container with a lid so it won't spill. Another drawback is that you don't really know precisely how much you're taking when it's in powder form because you're estimating. A better choice, to me at least, is capsule or pill form. That's exactly what I will order when my present supply runs out.Overall I do recommend this type of magnesium which is fast absorbing, has multiple health benefits and is easy to take. However, I think capsule or pill form can serve the same purpose and may be less expensive as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T77UPSZFQHH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F7OZJQE#wasThisHelpful","R3T77UPSZFQHH1","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stevia is very sweet which means only 1/4 of a teaspoon or less will taste like a teaspoon of sugar and be enough for most people. It's 3.53 ounces of pure powder which is a lot and should last for months. I've been using it in coffee and a very small amount gives me just the right sweetness. Those who like a sweeter taste can add a bit more.Unfortunately the packet I received clearly says 90% stevia which to me is not 100% pure. My batch contains something called rebaudiosides and steviol glycosides which, according to foodnavigator-USA website, is not all that natural.Although this tastes good, with no bitter aftertaste, I will not use this one again. I prefer 100% stevia with nothing else added. Next time I will buy locally at Trader Joe where they have 3.5 ounces of really pure stevia 100 packets for about one third the price sold here.

"These are very realistic as shown in the picture. They are about 2 inches in length which is big enough to frighten anyone. I always fool guests in my house by putting a bunch on the sofa. To make them realistic  I add some vaseline. This makes them shiny and more scary looking. Also I place some right side up and some upside down. The bottom of these is also very realistic.

"These do work in my Canon iP2702. The prints, both photos and text, look just as good as with the more expensive cartridges. You may have to reset your printer by holding the top and bottom buttons and waiting about 2-3 minutes.I plan to order again and to fill the empty cartridges with a refill kit I bought. After 2 refills you need to buy more cartridges because you run the risk of leaking ink and ruining the printer.A negative to these cartridges is that they have a little less ink than the more expensive so-called genuine cartridges. I would estimate about 15-20% less ink. Nevertheless, these are still cheaper than the outrageous over priced rip offs from the printer manufacturers who try to force their brand of ink on consumers. There should be a law that forbids this because it's like car companies trying to force you to use only their brand of gasoline. Also, if you do the math, ink sells for about 100 times more than the same quantity of gasoline!","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20BCJJBVEZAW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQ1J2W0#wasThisHelpful","R20BCJJBVEZAW5","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's much much smaller than the photo would have you believe. I bought this because my granddaughter loves Littlest Pet Shop. To me this is an over priced rip off.

"This is a fairly thin playing card made with some metal to attract magnets. It's fairly thin and can easily be placed in a deck of cards with little chance of anyone noticing that it's a gimmick card. The only problem is that there are no instructions whatsoever. Unless you're an advanced or very knowledgeable magician this will be useless. They should have included instructions for at least a few magic tricks. Also they should have  included a small magnet.

"This may be the best card magic DVD ever. It's got 10 great tricks performed and explained by 2 great magicians (Aldo Colombini and Cameron Francis). This is way better than their other DVD called Small Wonders because the tricks are amazing, fairly simple and mind blowing. Unlike Small Wonders, some tricks are pretty easy to learn and some are practically self working. One of the best tricks, which is worth the price of the DVD alone, is Cameron Francis' Improbable VS Impossible. I saw this performed on another site and just had to learn it. It has a double surprise and the end will shock and amaze anyone. Another great trick on the DVD is called Three Impossible Things. It's a great mind reading effect where the magician predicts or reads your mind 3 different ways in the same trick. Fantastic effect and almost self working. Those who enjoy learning card magic tricks will absolutely love this DVD. There are at least 5 tricks (maybe more) that are each individually worth the price of this DVD. I highly recommend this to all regardless of your skill level.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5YKZNUSBFG9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTKA7Z8#wasThisHelpful","R5YKZNUSBFG9D","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the price (less than $5) this is a great deal. Although about 75 of the 101 tricks are simplistic there are a few good classics. There are also numerous math tricks which are basically self working. Some tricks use easy to get objects such as a deck of cards. The book is well written, in large type, and contains numerous drawings and diagrams. If you are a beginner you will love this book. It will teach you lots of good magic tricks that will amaze and entertain. If you are an experienced amateur like me you will still find several classic tricks to add to your repertoire.

"This is actually a good book on street magic. It has at least 10 or more very good tricks that will amaze anyone who's not familiar with the secrets. However, the type is so tiny that it's almost impossible to see. To read it I use reading glasses and a magnifying glass. Even then it's annoyingly hard to see. This is an oversight by the publisher. It would have been at least a 4 star if the print was more readable. There's no excuse for such inconsiderate publishing. For this reason I do not recommend this book unless you want to strain your eyes. There are numerous other magic books that you can actually see. One good one is Scarne On Card Tricks.

"I've been performing amateur card magic for friends and family for many years. I wanted to learn some new tricks and this DVD more than met my expectations. Simon Lovell does a great job demonstrating and explaining some very clever and ingenious card magic.The tricks range from very easy for beginners to very advanced for pros. So far I've learned and found secrets to more than 20 great magic tricks. This DVD has so much great material that you will probably be learning new tricks for many months. A few tricks (not many) are too difficult for me because they require too many sleights. However, of the 30-40 tricks shown, at least half are easy enough for beginners to learn.Another company called Big Blind Media also sells good magic DVDs with great tricks. However, they charge $35-$40 for most of their DVDs. Furthermore, you would have to buy at least 3 of their DVDs to get as many tricks as you get with Super Suble Card Miracles. For all card magic fans out there, I highly recommend this DVD even though the price just went up.

"Over the years my knee problems have improved to the point where I don't need the most deluxe or advanced support. With that in mind I ordered this one. I used it yesterday to play 2 games of doubles handball. This morning I was somewhat sore in most areas of my body except my knees. This means that this support offered good protection and did the job.My only minor complaint is that it's very thin. For that reason I don't recommend this if you have very serious knee problems like I once did. For the more serious knee problems I recommend the Shock Doctor Ultra which is also sold on Amazon.The Captain knee brace has adjustable straps and is helpful for mild to moderate sprains or strains in your knee area. I ordered large, by the way, and it fits perfectly. The circumference around the middle of my knee measures close to 16"". If you're bigger or smaller you might want to consider a different size. Overall I would definitely recommend this for most knee problems. Because it's thin it's also good to use when playing sports such as tennis, handball and raquetball. More physical sports such as basketball or wrestling might require a more deluxe or advanced brace.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M07GETEEUJWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GIQYXI#wasThisHelpful","R3M07GETEEUJWC","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oat bran, like oatmeal, is very healthy and helps lower cholesterol. It is universally considered a heart healthy food. Another benefit is providing fiber and as an aid to digestion.I mix mine with flaxseed, cinnamon and cut up  pieces of fruit for a natural sweet taste & added nutrition. It's a little bitter plain but when mixed with ingredients I mentioned it's quite creamy and delicious.Another added benefit is the price. Hodgson Mill had the best price when compared with other brands. Also it's a lot less expensive than your local supermarket. For the price sold here you get 12 sixteen ounce boxes.

"This is a great product. When it arrived I took one capsule about 7 PM. By 8 PM I felt tired and very relaxed. I took my blood pressure and it was down to 120/73 (about 5-10 numbers lower than usual at this time). At 11 PM I took my usual low dose prescription for blood pressure and went to sleep. That night I slept about 2 hours longer than usual. In the morning, after breakfast, my blood pressure numbers were lower than usual. The numbers read 126/82 instead of the usual 135/85 in the morning.Since then I've used it several times in the evening but I only use half a capsule because it's very strong. This is a great tranquilizer. It really relaxes you and helps you sleep. Furthermore, it definitely lowers blood pressure.I was considering using this instead of prescription blood pressure medication. However, I'm still not sure how safe it is for long term use. I read on webmd that it should be used for up to 3 months at a time. Anyway I will use it as an occasional supplement to help get better sleep and to lower occasional high blood pressure from stress or salty meals.At this price I would definitely order this again. Highly recommended for high blood pressure, anxiety, restlessness and insomnia. However, I'm not sure that it's completely safe for long term or daily use.

"Numerous times so far I've used this Nitric-Oxide complex along with L-Citrulline with very happy returns. You do not have to take it every day. Just use as needed. It works because L-Arginine works better with L-Citruline when taken together.I use this combo about 30 minutes before playtime with a glass of water. Each time it has enhanced the experience. This is much safer than most other supplements of this type. Both of these supplements are sold here on Amazon. Also this will not cause insomnia or jitters. I recommend trying this first using 1 capsule of each supplement taken at the same time.You may want to know that the effect (firmer erections and more joy) lasts about 2 hours or so. Also when it wears off it seems to lower rather than raise your blood pressure. This is another happy side effect of L-Arginine. You've got to be cautious because some so-called natural supplements can raise your blood pressure and even kill you. The ones to watch out for, according to my doctor, are the ones that last for days.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XPP74XSOOU0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUTOKW4#wasThisHelpful","R2XPP74XSOOU0J","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About 10 years ago I started using New Balance sneakers which used to be very thick, durable and strong. However, New Balance have gotten cheaper and cheaper with each new model. The company (New Balance) has cut corners to save money. By doing so they have officially lost business with me and countless other former customers. Along comes Nike to the rescue.I first saw Nike Mens Air Monarch IV in a local store and was very impressed. This sneaker is very thick and strong which is necessary if you play sports or walk long distances. The Nike shoe is made like the old New Balance about 10 years ago. The top, bottom and inside is very thick and strong as it should be.I've used this Nike brand 6 times so far for working out (about 45 minutes to an hour each time). So far they look and feel great. I didn't hear any squeaking as mentioned by other reviewers. The first use did feel snug or a bit tight. After that it just felt comfortable. That, to me, is a sign of a good well fitting sneaker. Another great thing is that they were almost $10 cheaper than in the local store. I would definitely buy these again in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MYU0GV1MS33W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004K4GNF8#wasThisHelpful","R3MYU0GV1MS33W","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall these are sturdy comfortable sneakers. They are well padded and comfortable for walking. However, they are not as thick and strong as Nike Mens Air Monarch IV. Nevertheless K-Swiss are very good sneakers that are strong enough to last quite a while. In my opinion, though, these are not quite strong enough for tennis or other sports.

"There are several problems with this item which I will list below:1.) It does not relieve knee pain at all. It feels just like watered down Sarna lotion (which is used for itching).2.) You get a tube which is smaller than 2 ounces. I compared it to a 2 ounce tube of petroleum jelly and this appears smaller (even considering shape, thickness, height,...etc.)3.) I opened the tube and held it upright. Then I squeezed all the way in before any liquid oozed from the top. In other words the tube appears to be about two thirds empty. You are actually getting about a half an ounce or less. You can feel mostly empty space as you squeeze.4.) The worst part is that the ingredients are not disclosed on the label. What if you're allergic to it? How would you know if it's harmful? Yes I know the ingredients are listed on Amazon but NOT anywhere on the product itself. Some ingredients can be contraindicated for certain people. Consumers, in my opinion, are entitled to have full disclosure of all ingredients of any product that is applied to their body.5.) Even if it did work this item is way over priced. I've seen larger tubes of pain relief cream in a dollar store that provide more pain relief than this one.6.) You're instructed to massage yourself for 2 minutes and use it after a warm shower. The truth is that self massage and a warm shower by itself can relieve muscle pain. Everyone who does this will find at least some relief.7.) The placebo effect is very strong indeed.8.) Many of the reviewers (certainly not all) have only 1-3 total reviews. This implies that they may be done by the seller and/or his employees.Why so many good reviews? Read the above carefully and decide for yourself. To me this is a scam and I am returning it for a refund. In spite of my truthful review here I'm sure some of you will not listen and buy this anyway. My advice is to try Biofreeze first. It won't cure you but at least Biofreeze does help relieve muscle pain in a pleasant way. This is a great example of buyer beware!","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R148VE06E232XO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQCAET6#wasThisHelpful","R148VE06E232XO","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice looking glass bathroom scale. My old broken scale, which lasted about 5 years, cost about $10 dollars more than this one. Although the price was reasonable, the scale is not completely accurate. Four of us have weighed ourselves several times in a row (within seconds) and each time the weight changes by a range of 1-3 pounds. I can live with this because I just want to know my weight within a fairly accurate range. If it's off by 2 or 3 pounds that's not a big concern.

"Like volume 1 you get 10 more card tricks. Again each trick is first demonstrated and then concisely explained. Once again the DVD is a little more than 30 minutes. I was slightly disappointed because the tricks are quite similar to volume 1 with some variations. Still the tricks are quite good and original. One complaint is that there are several tricks that require tearing cards in half. Mr Adams should have worked out ways to do the tricks without having to rip the cards. He mentions it but doesn't demonstrate. As a result you have to figure this out on your own. I couldn't help but feel I was reliving volume 1 since the tricks were somewhat similar. If you're into card magic like I am I still recommend this DVD because it's mostly original and does not require complicated sleight of hand.

"First of all, the magnet is not as strong as I expected. You have to get within an inch (or less) of most metal objects for it to work. The second problem is not giving any instructions at all. If I didn't already know some tricks this would be completely useless. The third problem is the size. Unless you're a child the ring will probably not fit. I'm a medium sized adult and can barely get the ring on and off. The last problem is the integrity of the seller. They enclosed a small note practically begging for a 5 star review. Part of the note says ""We have posted positive feedback for you and hope you do the same for us"". Newsflash: Sellers do not post feedback about customers! This is a blatant false statement.

"This is a great product for your skin. It helps with heat rash, diaper rash, eczema, burns, itchy skin and other skin irritations. It's most important ingredient is zinc oxide (11.3%) which is known to form a barrier on the skin and protect it from irritants such as heat or cold weather. It also helps the skin heal faster from various conditions. Balmex is the perfect external application for diaper rash. Usually a diaper rash can be dramatically healed after only 1 application. I've used it several times on a 2nd degree burn on my leg and it's now about 90% healed after 3 days of use. I noticed improvement several hours after each application.Why only 4 stars instead of 5? First, although it arrived in about a week, I received it with a damaged cover. When I received it a small piece of the cover was torn off and missing. Since the broken piece was not in the sealed package it means it was sent that way. If it was damaged in transit the missing piece would have been in the package. That shows negligence on the part of the seller. Also, this was not the best price. However, it was convenient to order through Amazon. Why is this called Balmex Adultcare? I checked the ingredients with regular Balmex and they both contain 11.3% zinc oxide along with other matching or identical ingredients. Calling it Adultcare seems misleading or deceptive because it's just Balmex and can be used on babies, children or adults regardless of age. Except for the minor things I just mentioned I'm very satisfied with the product and highly recommend it for skin problems. Being a large 12 ounce jar, it should last a very long time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROFBJ6FOCXB0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWPOE1E#wasThisHelpful","ROFBJ6FOCXB0T","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great DVD for those interested in card magic. Although it only runs 37 minutes it contains 10 tricks that range from very good to excellent. The tricks are truly self working but also very effective. Each effect is first demonstrated and then fully explained. I've tried several tricks on friends and family members and got great reactions. As an amateur, I've seen a lot of card magic over the years but these are original tricks. Most tricks can be learned in 5-10 minutes. However, I recommend practicing first before showing them. Otherwise, you're likely to spoil a great effect. My favorite trick is called ""Hypnodeck"". It requires a setup but if you know how to false shuffle this trick is truly amazing. You ask the spectator a few questions and without knowing the name of a thought of card you deal from the deck (face down) until you arrive at the exact card thought of by a spectator. There are other excellent magic tricks included but this is my favorite.

"My knee measures 15.5 inches around the middle. I ordered the large and it fits just right. You can easily adjust it with two straps (top & bottom). I use this on my right knee which gives me minor problems from past surgery. On my left knee, which is worse, I use the Shock Doctor Ultra, which is a better support. If you have mild to moderate knee problems, the McDavid support will do a great job of eliminating or minimizing pain. However, if your knee is very bad (like my left knee) I'd recommend the Shock Doctor Ultra which is a more advanced deluxe knee brace. When I play sports (tennis, handball or raquetball) I always use the McDavid on my right knee and the Shock Doctor Ultra on my left knee. So far I've not had any serious knee problems with these supports after more than a dozen uses. One time only I tried the McDavid on my left knee while playing handball. Although it protected it I did have some pain the next day which required icing and rest for 2 days. With the Shock Doctor Ultra, which has more support, I never had a problem other than minor soreness. If you have old knee injuries that prevent you from exercising, the McDavid will reduce your pain by at least 80%. The Shock Doctor Ultra, which is a more deluxe brace, reduces my pain by more than 90%. However, the Shock Doctor Ultra is about $10-$15 more than the McDavid. Depending on the seriousness of your knee problems the extra cost may be well worth it. On the other hand, The McDavid support may be all you need.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EL7FJYCUOJ09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003554HTW#wasThisHelpful","R1EL7FJYCUOJ09","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use these on my digital therapy machine and they work great. These also work on the older TCM iMassager as well. They may or may not work on other tens units so I suggest you find out before making a purchase.The stick is more than adequate. When you first use them it feels as if the batteries have just been fully charged because the machine becomes more powerful. After about 10 uses or so, at about 1/2 hour per session, the pads will not stick as well. This is normal as it wears out. For most treatments, if you feel it's not a strong stick, just wrap with an ace bandage. When held in place the stick is perfect. If you prefer you can also use some duct tape to hold the pads in place. Even without it I don't have a problem with the stick for about 10-12 uses.Overall a great deal compared to the greedy sellers who try to sell you one third the amount of pads at triple the price. I suspect that many of the negative reviews are from competitors or from people who don't know how to use their machine. I highly recommend these if your unit is compatible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ENTA4NMP5FW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091Q5A54#wasThisHelpful","R1ENTA4NMP5FW8","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has the exact opposite effect that it's supposed to have. It does, however, lower your blood pressure and get you to fall asleep. For what it's intended to do it just doesn't do anything. Perhaps if you take it every day for weeks it may do something. For me, it did nothing except make me too tired to do anything.

"My review below is based on my bad experience with this watch. Although it didn't work for me, it may be okay for you. Nevertheless, I'm warning everyone to think twice before buying this watch.When I received this watch, I wasted over an hour trying to unsuccessfully set the time. The manual is so tiny that it requires reading glasses to read. Pages are so small that you can go blind trying to read it. Even worse are the many multiple steps required to just set the time. Casio needs to include a quick start sheet written in normal size print so people can actually see it. Setting the time should take no more than 5 minutes maximum! The lesson learned here is to always buy a watch in person where you can try it out in the store. I've used many watches of this type and usually figure it out in a few minutes (sometimes without the need for the manual). There are too many unnecessary features that this watch has which may only be useful if you can read it. Furthermore, you need clear simple step by step instructions. Unfortunately Casio does not provide readable or clear instructions. As a result, it makes the watch useless (for me at least).The main problem is that Casio got caught up trying to include too many multiple features (most of which are unnecessary). For example, how many people want to know what time it is in Japan or Germany? A good useable watch should not be so difficult to use.Fortunately I was able to send it back to Amazon for a refund. I did that the day after I received it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD55MHOQ9RLE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DZDYMU#wasThisHelpful","RD55MHOQ9RLE4","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I received this I was in shock. It's the cheapest looking piece of ultra thin tin I ever saw. Also it's much smaller than the photo would have you believe. My hand is slightly bigger. To me it looks like a cheap item you would find in an inexpensive discount store. However, what's worse is that it was not even useable. Here's why:I tried many times to open the battery compartment but couldn't. After reading the skimpy 4 page instructions and trying repeatedly I gave up. It appears that the battery compartment is cemented shut. It would not open on either end no matter how much I tried. Even if it did open the device appears much too fragile to last. It looks and feels like it can fall apart just by blowing on it. I'd compare it to aluminum foil or a cheap piece of jewelry.I'm now waiting for Amazon to authorize a return. This item is absolutely the worst purchase I ever made here (fortunately that's not the norm). Definitely not recommended.If anyone knows of a real acupuncture device that works please post here. I'd gladly pay double or triple the price for something that's made with the consumer in mind rather than a device with cheap or skimpy material.After seeing this pen which is made from shoddy material I think 1 star is very generous! I hope no one else gets scammed by this.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PZ82YV9N6BED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DKGSXA#wasThisHelpful","R2PZ82YV9N6BED","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are a less expensive alternative to the Zensah sleeves that I bought 2 years ago for over $40. These Red Lion sleeves are almost the same but about 60% cheaper (in price but not quality!).I have 15"" calves and ordered the medium/large. Nevertheless they are still quite tight and hard to put on. Once on, however, they are generally comfortable and can be worn for hours without problems except for creases and marks in the skin when removed. However, this goes away in about an hour or so after you take them off.The good news is that, for me at least, they protect my legs and allow me to exercise without serious pain. I have an old injury in my left calf which causes discomfort & pain if I do too much exercise. Recently my right leg developed painful shin splints. Now that I've used these for a few weeks I'm back to exercising regularly and I no longer have serious shin pain after exercise.If you have pain in your calves or shins, these will reduce the pain by about 70-80% and allow you to recover much faster. I definitely recommend them because they do the job and are sold as a pair at a fair price. Some companies are so greedy that they sell only one leg sleeve at twice the price. In my opinion Zensah leg compression, although slightly better quality, are sold at an outrageous ripoff price. I took a chance getting these and I'm glad I did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HG281Z8MCS6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00822C768#wasThisHelpful","R1HG281Z8MCS6Q","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ultimate Self Working Card Tricks is an amazing collection of 11 great self working card tricks. Just because they are self working doesn't mean they are easy to perform. I had to spend at least 30 minutes to an hour for each of the 6 tricks that I've performed so far. However, the magical effects will get great reactions.I love card magic and I perform it for friends and family whenever the opportunity arises. Although I'm an amateur I've seen many card tricks throughout the years. These tricks are quite original but sort of similar to ones I've done before. Nevertheless these are amazing tricks which can easily take months to master all 11 routines. I've had this for about a month and still need to practice and learn 5 more tricks.The high price might turn many people off and that is justified. I feel this is more expensive than it should be which will limit sales. I bought this because card magic is my favorite form of magic and because I can afford it. Also I wanted to find some new miracles to perform. This DVD does deliver and I'm glad I bought it.A cheaper way to learn card magic, which is what I usually have done, is to go to a library and borrow books. However, I've never come across such good tricks like you'll find here in this DVD. The question is ""Is this worth the price?"" The answer depends on you. If you love great magic tricks with cards, like I do, then Ultimate Self Working Card Tricks is worth every penny. It has 11 terrific tricks which are absolutely amazing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YOCH3TVDND7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008Z21DZQ#wasThisHelpful","R2YOCH3TVDND7Z","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this directly from Swanson about 2 months ago as a supplement for high blood pressure. Occasionally my pressure goes up somewhat even though I take a small dose of prescription medication (5 mg amlodipine). When my numbers have gone over 130/85 I take half a capsule (it's easy to open and close). So far I've used this about 5 times and each time it lowers the top and bottom numbers by at least 10 points or more. Earlier today, for example, my pressure reading (using a home monitor) was 135/88. This caused me to have a slight headache. I again took half a capsule of Amealpeptide with a small glass of water. About 20 minutes later my headache was gone. After another 20 minutes or so I again took my blood pressure and was amazed. It went down to 110/68. Every time I use this (about once a week) it produces similar results in less than an hour. Although it comes with only 30 capsules the way I use it it's like getting 60. At this time I won't replace this for my prescription. However, as an occasional supplement to help lower blood pressure this is excellent. I will definitely be ordering this again in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL17OWHH476H7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TEOMBE#wasThisHelpful","RL17OWHH476H7","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WARNING: Do not waste your money on this like I did. It's not even worth $1. This is not a book. It is a brief pamphlet briefly describing about 10 very basic bits of card magic. That's right - incomplete bits of magic. The so-called tricks are not even explained in detail. Do you think 1 or 2 paragraphs is enough to explain a card trick? In most cases the answer is definitely NO!I mistakenly thought this was a new book at Amazon. I was completely wrong. This pamphlet is not for anyone. It is not even suitable for a beginner because it is so very basic. It deserves 0 stars because it should not be sold here at all.If you want to learn card tricks I suggest Scarne On Card Tricks which is an excellent REAL book. Also recommended is Karl Fulves books. His first, called ""Self-Working Card Tricks"" is a great start for beginners. The first page introduction to this crap says (I'm not making this up) ""It is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any health problem...."".

"This is a soothing and cooling gel that effectively relieves pain in your muscles or joints. I've used it successfully to relieve most of my pain in my knees and lower back. To use it properly, spread a thin layer on the painful area but do not rub it in. Also do not cover it. Allow the injured area to be exposed to the air. Within 3-4 minutes you will feel a cooling and soothing effect on your injury. It feels like a thin layer of ice which is what seems to relieve pain. Also, the cooling effect seems to last about 1-2 hours. The nice thing is that it doesn't sting or burn and can be used every 2-3 hours without any noticeable side effect except relief. This is a large tube and can last for months. Also the price was fair. I highly recommend trying this.

"This is a great 8-outlet surge suppressor at a great price. I went to several stores selling similar items for much more than the price here. Also most only had 6 outlets while this one has 8.Since I got this a few weeks ago I can now run my portable heater safely without it shutting off (by itself) every 10 minutes. This surge suppressor has 2400 joules which makes it safe for heaters, lights, TVs, treadmills and most other electronic equipment. Another plus is that this comes with Child-safe outlet covers so small children can't put their fingers into the outlets. The covers are very easy to remove when needed. The chord is 6 feet which is long enough for me. I'm glad I found this here at such a good price.

"I'm allergic to aspirin and researched Serraflazyme about a year ago as an alternative. This supplement helped ease my knee and joint pains within a day. It claims to have multiple uses including pain relief from sprains, joint pain relief, improved blood circulation, enlarged prostate relief and many other health benefits. I can't speak for all those claims but it definitely works for joint pain. I was very skeptical but was surprised that this worked as well as motrin without major side effects. Another pleasant surprise is that it seems to lower blood pressure by about 10-15 points within an hour or so. If you're like me and have had side effects from pain medication this is a great alternative.When I bought this last year it came with 100 tablets. When I had pain I used it 3 times a day for 3-4 days and it relieved my pain and reduced leg swelling due to a sports related injury. My wife also used it for low back pain and she said it works like aspirin but without stomach cramps. I still have about 20 tablets left because we only use it occasionally when needed. Definitely recommended and worth trying for mild to moderate pain. If you have pain from an injury you can take it up to 4 times a day. I took it up to 3 times a day without a problem except that it made me a little tired. It actually helps you sleep. After a few days perhaps your pain will decrease to the point where you won't need it any more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O7G770DWYHYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00014DU16#wasThisHelpful","R2O7G770DWYHYQ","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has been surprising effective for lowering my occasional high blood pressure. I take a low dose of prescription amlodipine (5 mg) which usually controls my blood pressure. However, sometimes when I eat a salty meal or have had a stressful day, my pressure rises a little too high and causes headaches. I use a good blood pressure monitor and check my pressure regularly at home.I've used these apple cider vinegar capsules about 6-7 times in the last 3 weeks about twice a week so far and it consistently lowered my blood pressure with just 1 capsule. When my pressure goes high it's usually around 138/88 to about 142/90. Every time I notice this (once or twice a week) I take an apple cider vinegar capsule with a glass of water and each time my pressure gets reduced within 1-2 hours. The numbers would generally go low to about 108/68. As a bonus my headache (from elevated pressure) completely vanishes in less than an hour. I've used liquid apple cider vinegar with honey before with moderate success of 5-15 points. These capsules work even better and I don't have to tolerate the horrible taste of the vinegar. Another great thing here is that you get 180 capsules which should last for a few months. Also, unlike liquid vinegar, these are easy to take with you when not at home.I'm wondering if this can substitute for prescription medicine. I'm afraid to try because when I forget to take my medicine (before bed) I wake up in the middle of the night with a headache which reminds me that I forgot.Although this may have many health benefits people who take insulin must be cautious. Taking apple cider vinegar along with insulin might cause potassium levels in the body to be too low. For those who are having lots of side effects from prescription medicine perhaps this may help you reduce or eliminate it. However, you should first consult with your doctor which I'm also planning to do. I will definitely order this again in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6RVF6RFIIUF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001TNCK0#wasThisHelpful","R6RVF6RFIIUF1","AWGXF4XREHKBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWGXF4XREHKBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My wife and I liked AmazonBasics 400 Thread Count Sheet Set, Queen, White.Amazon Basics is a simple brand. These sheets are simple and economical but not low quality.They do not have a cheap feel to them. I always wash sheets before using them.Who knows what they were treated with before being imported.These sheets are soft and did not wrinkle when washed. They look good and the fit and feel are very good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27QE3ZNIMB0DP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q7OD3PC#wasThisHelpful","R27QE3ZNIMB0DP","A19XBW5WUDH1Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19XBW5WUDH1Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My 3 and 4 year old girls love Disney Junior Super Stretchy Game.I know twister was taken but they could have come up with a better name for this game.My girls laugh and giggle while playing this twister like game. It is sized for little bodiesand 2 small ones can play easily. This is a fun game for the children to play andfun for adults to watch. It seems a good value at it's price of about $16.My family enjoys it and recommends it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35GX5XTY3DCM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQPOTPM#wasThisHelpful","R35GX5XTY3DCM0","A19XBW5WUDH1Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19XBW5WUDH1Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to try Bio Spot's Active Care Flea and Tick Spot on with Applicator for Medium Dogs.I was interested in trying the new applicator. I have used Bio Spot's flea and tick control formulas before.I have never had a problem with pests.

"I raised my 2 older dogs on dog foods their first 2 years of life.I decided to try this food on my puppy. My puppy did eat it. he doesn't seem overly excited by it.The ingredients seem to be average quality. It does contain grains.I was hoping for a resealable bag. This is a large bag and will last for awhile.Since this bag is not resealable it might attract pests.I transferred the food to a airtight container that I purchased for my dogs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UMTDF0BRG1ZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006OLAJA0#wasThisHelpful","R2UMTDF0BRG1ZK","A19XBW5WUDH1Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19XBW5WUDH1Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I only have one cat but he seems to like the IRIS USA CL-083 Cat Tree, 5-Tier.This cat tree took about 20 minutes to put together. I had some help from my wife.This cat tree isn't very tall and the hiding places aren't very large. If you have a larger cat,they might not be able to fit in some of the hiding places.Our cat likes to sit on the perches and scratch on the post. He likes it and that isthe most important thing. I think it looks nice and seems like a good value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RASBLU3S5X3AR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY25OK2#wasThisHelpful","RASBLU3S5X3AR","A19XBW5WUDH1Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19XBW5WUDH1Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughters really like the Baby Genius Talking DJ Interactive Hand Puppet with Electronic Sounds by Manhattan Toy.They love to play with it and my wife and I love to amuse them with it.It does talk. It is able to say 6 different phrases. I'm not sure why they would make a battery operated toy with batteriesthat cannot be replaced. Why? I would have given it 5 stars if the batteries can be replaced.It is an entertaining toy but prepare for it to go silent one day and just be an ordinary puppet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CWPREW30D7A3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WPW03QC#wasThisHelpful","R3CWPREW30D7A3","A19XBW5WUDH1Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19XBW5WUDH1Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like Garden of Life Dr. Formulated Probiotics. I like the formula.I have used garden of life's products in the past. When it comesto probiotics, you have to trust the company, otherwise you might be wasting your time.The maker has loaded this product with many strains of bacteria.I had no digestive issues with this formula. I don't take probiotics year round but do take themafter using antipiotic and for general health maintenance 2-3 times a year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OM74BYHAX5QP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y8MP5VA#wasThisHelpful","R3OM74BYHAX5QP","A19XBW5WUDH1Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19XBW5WUDH1Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My young daughters loved playing with Build & Imagine Malia's Beach House Building Kit.This doll house lets your child use their imagination to build their house, their way.So many toys like this allow you to build a building one way.My daughters didn't care for the flat ""dolls"" included with this set.They preferred to use their other 3d dolls.One good thing about this set is it works with other build and imagine sets.I like that this toy set is teaching my daughters skills that are often seen in boy toys but seldom seen in girl toys.I highly recommend this toy set for the parent whose child loves to build things and has a vivid imagination.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PI1PZ9KU9IZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8DGZBA#wasThisHelpful","R2PI1PZ9KU9IZY","A19XBW5WUDH1Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19XBW5WUDH1Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
