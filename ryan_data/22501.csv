"I took this little game into my high school biology class to try out on the kids. I thought, ""If these kids like it, it's A-OK."" When I brought it out, they went, ""Oh, that's a kid's game."" But I made them try it anyway. After a few minutes of play, they all wanted to get in on the action. They loved it!Bottom line: If you're looking for a game to keep your kids interest for a few minutes, this should do the trick. I'm not sure how young children would do. It's pretty intense with high school students. With younger ones, it would have to be slower to give them time to find the matches.5 STARS!UPDATE: My high school kids love this so much, every time we have a break, they want to play this game!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WCO13YB4QU0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0V11AS#wasThisHelpful","R1WCO13YB4QU0V","A2Q1046M09398P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q1046M09398P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ultraproof iPad Air case is a good solution for those who want to use their iPad Air around a pool, at the beach, on a boat, in bad weather, or anywhere water could be a problem. It is also a good solution for anyone who wants to protect their case from drops and scratches.  The case is well built with a professional look. At $49.95 and with a lifetime warranty, this is a good choice for your iPad Air protection.Now, here is where I had problems. First, my iPad Air has a glass screen protector. I was unable to use the Ultraproof case with the glass screen protector. Of course, you really wouldn't have to have a glass screen protector with this case, so that is a moot point.Unfortunately, the other problem I had didn't have anything to do with the screen protector. While the Ultraproof case was on my iPad, I had a lot of difficulty using the buttons (on/off and home buttons). I had to push several times and use a lot of pressure to get them to work. This was very frustrating. I don't know if it was my particular case or this is a problem with them all. But, this was a problem.If I hadn't had this problem, I would have given this case five stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C6D4431HLPSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEIP4G4#wasThisHelpful","R1C6D4431HLPSX","A2Q1046M09398P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q1046M09398P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, part of the problem with me reviewing this light bulb is that I resent having to pay $25 for light bulb. I know that's not politically correct, but really?That said, the fact is that I better get used to it. That is all the choice we will have in the near future. So, I decided to review this one to see what $25 plus or minus does for me. The light is brighter than some of the environmentally friendly bulbs I've tried before - that's a good thing. I'm happy with the brightness. The dimmer switch works, but like most dimmer bulbs, I can't tell the difference with the top two settings and don't use them. I do like the lower setting for some things.The size is a problem - it will only fit in certain size lamp shades. However, if it fits your lamp, I like the shape better than those spirally things I've been buying.It's heavy - maybe that means if I drop it, it won't break. Needless to say, I didn't try that.As far as being a good value? Who knows? I would have to update this review in five years if the literature is to be believed. I can't promise I will remember to do that or even have it in five years!","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R202MMOLWZ06R8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKUDHA2#wasThisHelpful","R202MMOLWZ06R8","A2Q1046M09398P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q1046M09398P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This charger is an excellent charger. It works exactly like it's supposed to. Charges fast. Keeps your iPhone upright so you can read the time or for whatever other reason you might want your phone vertical while charging. I have no problems with the charger itself. That's why I give it four stars. But, personally, I don't like to take the case off my phone to charge it. That's why I didn't give it five stars.I have a very simple case - it's not a big bulky one. But, with the case on, my phone won't seat itself far enough into the charging pin for the charging to work. Just won't happen. :(So, I'll go back to using the old stand-by plug-in cord from Apple. This seems to be the problem with most stand-up charging systems. I'm not even sure if it's even possible to make one that could work with cases.

"Be sure to read the title - this is a book of practice questions ONLY. There is no instruction, just a brief ""What to Watch Out For."" It is to be used with Grammar for Dummies book as extra practice.Personally, I think they should have included these questions with the book as a free download. For each grammar topic, you will get about 10-15 extra questions to practice, for a total of 1,001 questions. The questions take up the first 1/2 of the book (144 pages). The answers are in the back half of the book (about another 144 pages).The publisher also offers the SAME 1,001 questions online. It is supposed to be adaptive. As you learn, the questions change. So, I signed up using the code provided in the book. However, I was not able to access the course in any of my browsers. I tried Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. I am running a Mac, so maybe it's not Mac compatible. At this point, I'm too disappointed to continue. Not the best product. As I said before, this should have been included with the Grammar for Dummies book even if I could access the online questions.I did not find this product worth the list price of $22.99.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26Z0KKBY22EUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118745019#wasThisHelpful","R26Z0KKBY22EUI","A2Q1046M09398P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q1046M09398P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"IF you like romantic stories with angels in them, you might like this book. For me, it was just not my cup of tea. I read Mrs. Miracle and loved that one. I don't remember why, but I remember liking it a lot. This one, however, was a disappointment. It appeared to be written more for teens, than adults.The angel in the title, Mr. Miracle, only had a minor role and was cast as a bumbling idiot angel. He was learning to be an earth angel (disguised as a school teacher) and was supposed to be helping a girl get her life back on track, but all he managed to do was get in trouble with the school principle and discover that he had feelings. I found both him and his female angel counterpart boring. The angels added nothing to the story, in my opinion.The main characters, Addie and Erich, hated each other at the beginning of the book. Mr. Miracle was supposed to use this relationship to change Addie, so he ""arranged"" to have her take care of Erich after Erich broke both wrists. Now, here is where I really had to suspend disbelief. My son broke both his arms one time and he could do NOTHING for himself for weeks. When I say, nothing, I mean nothing. His dad had to help him with his bathroom chores, if you know what I mean. In this book, Erich is supposed to be in the same condition. That is why Addie comes to take care of him. He had a nurse come in and bathe him once a day, but there is no way he could hold ""it"" until once a day! So, who helped him the rest of the time? This plot did not work for me.But as I said, if you are big fan of angel stories and young romance, you might like this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JVEKU4T00XYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391151#wasThisHelpful","R1JVEKU4T00XYX","A2Q1046M09398P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q1046M09398P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's what it is: The Belkin Table Stand is a sturdy stand for your iPad or other tablet device (up to 7-11""). The uses for it can vary from doing live presentations, recording a presentation on your tablet to be shown at a later time, or using it to keep your iPad in a particular position for viewing or video conferencing. The tablet can be moved up and down on the stand, as well as tilted in various directions. The stand includes an LED light that can help you see when doing a presentation in a darkened room. The light can also be moved or even removed from the stand. The stand is somewhat heavy, 12.8 pounds; so, although it is portable, it is not easily relocated. However, because it is not light in weight, it is fairly sturdy and should hold most tablets without permanent installation (which is an option).Here's what you can do with it: You can use the stand to hold your tablet and view it at various angles, keeping your hands free for something else. It will keep your tablet steady as you take a photo or video of whatever is on the platform. However, your tablet must have a camera and the apps to do this. The unique feature about this stand is that it is designed to hold a tablet above the platform (similar to the old time overhead projectors). Most stands I have seen do not have this feature.With the purchase of the $4.99 Belkin Stage app (currently available only for IOS) and some type of projector, HDTV, or monitor, you can use your iPad as a whiteboard, including having the ability to do markups on the screen, add text, change the color of text, add shapes (squares, circles, triangles), and import photos and pdf to be projected on the screen. The app is pretty nifty; but, here's the thing: you don't need this particular stand to use it! You could use your iPad on any stand to do the same thing.Bottom Line for me: The stand is a good one and usable in a variety of situations; however, for what it does, I think it's overpriced. I've seen another brand (Justand - not currently available on Amazon that I could find) for $99 that does the same thing and is less cumbersome. For that I knock the Belkin Table Stage Stand down 2 stars. If they will bring the price down, I would give it 4 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NX00DNBTQ6PB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CF7M7RA#wasThisHelpful","R1NX00DNBTQ6PB","A2Q1046M09398P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q1046M09398P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm only giving this particular case 3 stars because it's over priced. The case is fine. It fits nice. The ports are perfect. It has a nice grip to it so it doesn't slide out of your hand. It's slim. It protects about as much as most other cases. The problem is that you can buy a case just as good for a lot less money. This case is listed on Amazon for about $24. There are other cases available that will work just as well that are less. And, if you do a bit of searching on Amazon, you'll even find the same case for a lot less. Otherwise, I like the Brand and this case.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R1KE65Y0O5ID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KB5IH54#wasThisHelpful","R2R1KE65Y0O5ID","A2Q1046M09398P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q1046M09398P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To design your Avery Self-laminating labels, you can use the free online software provided by Avery. This is easy to find on the Avery site. Here are the steps: Input your label number located on the top right. Then, you have to give them your name and email, which I didn’t like, to access the software. There are several templates you can use to design your label, and you can add graphics, shapes, text, QR and barcodes, numbering, and much more. You can be very creative with this software if you are looking for a unique look.Once you complete the label design, you can save your label. It saves as a .avery which means you have to go back to the website to print from it. However, when you choose ""print"", it creates a PDF, which you can save to your desktop and/or print.The labels are water resistant and wipe-able with a damp cloth. They are UV and tear resistant which makes it good for labeling items that will get sunlight. Tear resistant is a fact - i tried to tear one. It’s like trying to tear a piece of soft plastic.The labeling requires a two step process: First, print the white label; then apply the laminate. I had some trouble peeling the white label from the backing. Some labels peeled better than others. I had no trouble peeling off the laminate from the backing, but getting the laminate on the label without wrinkling took some practice.For $11.25 list price, you get 10 labels and 10 laminates. That’s $1.13 per label. Not bad if you only want a few labels. I wouldn’t want to make a lot of them.Bottom Line: I found these a bit complicated to use; however, if I needed a few labels that were unique and needed to be laminated, this would be a good choice. I did not, however, like having to give them my contact info in order to use the software. This bummed me out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WGY9ULIDROOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFMMVBU#wasThisHelpful","R1WGY9ULIDROOW","A2Q1046M09398P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q1046M09398P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a fun, sexy story! Drew has a talent for bondage, and something about Eva particularly appeals to him - the more he can picture her in his ropes, the more he hopes she'll let him in to more than just the bedroom. While Eva had a humiliating past experience that has colored her interactions with men ever since, Drew's patience, sweetness and obvious affection for her go a long way to letting her take the leap back into that part of her that's she's hidden away for so long. The kinky scenes were not too over the top, just right for this reader in fact, and I really enjoyed the whole story and the romance that blossoms between the couple. 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TGZ1Z5PDOWMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015LZCP24#wasThisHelpful","R3TGZ1Z5PDOWMR","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love friends to lovers trope stories, and the title of this one was a pretty good giveaway that it would be this type of story. I really enjoyed it - lots of sexy bits, but even though it was novella length, Carey and Elise spend some time realizing that even though they've been friends for two years, they really don't know everything about each other, and their pasts.

"Anyone familiar with K.J.Charles body of work knows that they can expect a story with interesting characters, a tight plot and a page turner - whether it's because of the drama or the sex or the relationships. In this case, it's all three as Harry discovers that his grandfather is willing to claim him as a relative despite his father's abandonment of the family ideals, so long as Harry marries and produces an heir to continue the line. To that end his cousin Richard has persuaded his personal friend and dandy Julius to outfit and school Harry in the ways of society. As members of the Society of Gentlemen, Julius and Richard are part of a small group of comrades who happen to be more interested in the male persuasion than the female. When Harry realizes this, and the fact that Julius is more interested in him than expected, it becomes more and more difficult to keep their hands off each other, in the name of fashion or otherwise. But Harry's seditious background is in danger of being discovered as the people on the street revolt against the upper class and he's caught in the middle. Can he find peace in his new role and a love worthy of the sacrifices it will require?I think what interested me the most about this story was that it's a given that the men involved are homosexual, and that they must keep that a secret from society in general or risk prosecution and loss of society status. So the drama is never about whether they will be revealed as such. The society of Gentlemen is discreet, with well paid servants and strict rules about their public behavior and so you never get the feeling that their sexual orientation is going to be an issue in the plot of the story (other than to direct the romance of course). Instead the drama is all about Harry's background, his being raised by radical parents who had to flee the country, and in doing so leaving Harry as a 12 year old boy with a warrant on his head should he venture back to England from his home in France. But Harry does in fact return after his parents' deaths, and reunite with their friend Silas (to whom Harry owes his life), and who runs a print shop that happens to deal with inflammatory and secretive pamphlets that would easily get him hanged if discovered. When his cousin Richard finds him there to bring him back into the family fold, it's with the clear understanding that his past, where he's been, and how he grew up must be kept hidden from society. While Harry can immerse himself in this new life of wealth and status, he can't change the deep held feeling inside him for the people in the position he used to be in - the public servants, the ordinary workers, the oppressed. He's hard pressed to hold his tongue when in the presence of the very Lords who are a part of the problem. Caught between a rock and a hard place, discovering that his tutor has the same lustful feelings towards him as he has towards him, and with attempted threats on his life, it's no wonder that this story kept me up late flipping pages faster and faster! I loved the slow burn romance between Julius and Harry as they discover the men behind the facades, and the will to be together no matter the cost. With the fascinating politics, fashion and society manners of the time expertly revealed, it was a joy to read. 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C4LYRAT7B2LE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QP3ROUA#wasThisHelpful","R2C4LYRAT7B2LE","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chelsea's plans to get her current relationship out of the doldrums includes getting her on again/off again boyfriend (who is also her boss)  to let loose a little and as such she provides him with a Santa suit for the office Christmas party at the luxury hotel where they work, in hopes of kicking up their fun a bit.  But when she drags the Santa clad man into a closet for little pre-party action she inadvertently makes out with a man who turns out to be  the new company owner. Ready to confess her mistake, it turns out her boyfriend's been cheating on her all this time with a woman in HR.  With a quick sense of self preservation, Chelsea resigns and highlights it out of town and onto a new job at a luxurious island resort, hoping to leave the past, with the ex  (and the sex with a stranger) firmly where it belongs. Only, Rafe can't forget their interlude and when the new hotel she's working at comes up on his list of possible acquisitions, he's not above following her to correct his mistake - of letting her go in the first place.  Rafe's charm is impossible to resist,  and Chelsea lets down her defenses,  agreeing to a week long fling while Rafe is in Hawaii, with full intentions of moving on before he gets any long term ideas. But while a long distance relationship is something neither wants, it's not so easy to say goodbye when their time is up.So.... the opening scene was a bit problematic for me, not in the execution (because hello, smexy!) but more in the ethics of what happened. It's made quite clear that Rafe knows who he is with but assumes she is single and just looking for a fun time. And Chelsea thinks she's with Paul and calls him that by name at the end, and only knows afterwards (once out of the closet, literally) that it isn't her soon to be ex-boyfriend (and Rafe in turn realizes then that Chelsea thought he was someone else the whole time). It's a bit hard to believe that Chelsea wouldn't have noticed he was someone else, even in the costume, though the encounter happens quite quickly. I kind of wish they hadn't gone 'all the way' - I would have preferred that they fool around but not get to the 'endgame' before realizing that they weren't both seeing the encounter the same way.That aside, once Chelsea has moved away from her old job and onto the new one at the island resort, and Rafe has turned out to be the buyer looking at acquiring it, I found their connection believable.  The sexual chemistry between them was smoking hot (well established from their first encounter) , and when they are at the resort it's a fresh start for them.  In this beautiful setting and the background it entails (tropical paradise! luxurious sheets!) it's like a holiday romp with all the good things. Here is where you really get to see Rafe and Chelsea's true characters. Rafe is a hardworking, conscientious man and while he may be a bit of playboy, he's not out to take advantage of Chelsea despite how they met. He respects her skills that have made her an asset to the hotel industry and wishes there was a way that they could work together longer. Chelsea is equally interesting as a woman whose naivete landed her in the position she's in now, and her natural tendency is to protect herself from future relationship hurts. She hadn't been in love with her previous boyfriend, but even so, realizing how he had used her for his own personal gain makes trusting another man not high on her list. Slowly Rafe is able to convince her otherwise, and I liked how their relationship went from a no-strings fling to something deeper in short order. They do get their happy ending (yay!) and we get a sexy , entertaining romance in return.  I think fans of the author, and Brazen book lovers will find this a worthy addition to their shelves, if they can get past the (for me) so-so start. 3.5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KKQ69M1MW5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151U7X3U#wasThisHelpful","R18KKQ69M1MW5S","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this aptly titled check-in with Reese and Tom, following up on their story in Off Campus (which was a stellar standalone novel with a happy ending). They are definitely in the 'real world' now - a world of job pressures that affect their relationship whether they want it to or not. Like any couple, communication is the key to continuing happy times and this is something that Tom still struggles with. But being with Reese for 5 years means that Reese is aware of all the quirks of Tom's personality, including when he's keeping things from him. And just as Tom's work pressures get worse, Reese is becoming a rising star at his own firm, catching the eye of his manager who might be a little more interested in Reese than he's been letting on.I really enjoyed catching up with them, seeing this glimpse into what makes them still tick as a couple and the hard work that goes into maintaining a happy relationship. Included in this is some super sexy times that show the sexual chemistry between them is still there, and as strong as ever. And when they sort out some of their difficulties, and celebrate some of their successes with Cash and Steph, Danny and Rafael (stars of their own enjoyable stories in the Bend or Break series) we get another great view into the solid friendships they share. There are some laughs in this one, there are some emotional moments and there is the sweetest ending. 5 stars for this entertaining, hard to put down once you start, sexy, romantic story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R90S4RNLUPNQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014T223FE#wasThisHelpful","R90S4RNLUPNQQ","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The last of the four Steele brothers meets his match in this sinfully sexy tale of love recaptured. I love a good second chance romance, and while I thought the other three books in this BDSM series were hot, this one wins the hottest book title as Remington (yes, named after the 80s show which happens to have been one of my teenage favourites) gets his one night at Fanta -C with Cara, the woman who left him several years earlier when the communication between them failed. Since then Cara has come into her own, acknowledging her desire to be a submissive in the bedroom and never forgetting the man she left behind. And now Remington has the chance to spend the night with the woman who stole his heart. I really loved the two of them together and seeing how Cara has got a good sense of herself now. She's also willing to fight for a relationship with Remington. As mentioned, the scenes are super hot (Remington is a pretty powerful Dom, like two of his brothers) and it was a great ending to this sexy series.

"This is the fourth in the Winslow Brother's series and is Christopher's story. All of the books in this series (and the preceding English Brother's series) can be read as standalones, but we do get to see Chris's three older brothers in this one as well as their partners, which was a lovely check-in to see how their happy ever afters were faring. (I'm happy to report all are doing well!). Being the youngest, Chris has his work cut out for him to stand out, but he's doing so in style, running for political office as a Senator. He's a man of deep convictions and a desire to serve his country and has worked hard on his campaign. Enter Julianne. Trouble in high heels. But not the way you'd expect. Because Julianne is motivated to bring down a man she believes is corrupt and would be a disaster if he were elected, by drugging him and taking compromising pictures. It's not easy for her to do this, but she believes her cause is just. Only later does she discover to her horror that it's been a setup of the worst possible kind, that they've both been taken advantage of, and that the only way to set things right is for her to own up to her failings and find a way to turn around the disaster she's made of his campaign. Committing herself to doing anything required, she volunteers to explain away the photos as a girlfriend stunt gone wrong and it works, as the public eats it up, offers their apologies and suddenly Chris and Jules are a darling couple of the media. It's all an act though, one Chris can't wait to end. Only as he starts to see the woman behind the actions that brought her into his life, he realizes that things aren't so cut and dried, and maybe, just maybe, with some forgiveness and faith, he might have found someone he can trust after all.This is a really character driven story, and I was fascinated by the portrayal of Julianne. She's a young Indigenous American, already marginalized by society just by her birth and therefore having to struggle for her place in the world even more so than some. She's got a loyal and loving mother (much to her advantage) but no relationship with her father, and a background of growing up on a reservation with all that entails. I really appreciated the details that went into making her character as authentic as possible. She's in the 'big city' now, working as a waitress and a plus sized model, and used to being harassed on the job or on the street. As such she's got a pretty tough skin. But she's still young and somewhat naive and the man who convinces her to perpetrate the devastating events that threaten Chris's campaign takes advantage of this. Remarkably, Julianne is absolutely willing to take responsibility for her mistake and own up to it, showing bravery and courage in the face of what could have been an even more devastating loss - her own freedom if Chris has chosen to press charges. But she's also smart enough to come up with a possible solution too, one that Chris reluctantly agrees to on the advice of his team. But that lack of trust between them, and his lack of faith in Jules being able to make it up to him means a slow start to their romance, as one would expect. Slowly but surely though, her true self shines through in her actions. She's really a caring and friendly and passionate woman, one who made a grievous mistake she is trying hard to fix.Chris's character was equally interesting. He has worked tirelessly on his campaign for Senator, and as a wealthy and privileged young man, he's got the financial means to put on a good race. But more than that, he's got the convictions and determination to be a man of the people. He's got strong plans for those parts of society that need the most help, including the Indigenous Native American tribes of the area. Meeting Julianne is both a curse and a blessing, as the unintended result of her treachery makes them a popular couple in the media and actually gives a boon to his campaign. In fact, Julianne's true heart shows throw in their campaign stops, and he's hard pressed to believe that she could have done what she did to him in the first place. It frustrates him to no end that he feels a sexual attraction to her, as she is a beautiful woman but a deceptive one too. Still his physical attraction to her can't be ignored, and he believes the best solution would be for them to give into the attraction and enjoy their weeks together until the election and the 'break-up' after which they'll go their separate ways. He's able to separate his physical feelings from his emotional ones, as he still doesn't trust her. But Julianne is unable to do this, as she realizes that she's falling for Chris and the good-hearted man that he is. She doesn't expect his forgiveness, but it doesn't stop her from working towards obtaining it. I really loved the two of them together, the obvious difficulties in building trust between them and the slow and steady workings of their hearts binding them together. The other aspects of this story that I really enjoyed were the behind the scenes looks at Chris's political campaign, and the obvious research that went into Julianne's character's background and the current state of Native American affairs in the U.S. Personally, this has been my favourite of the Winslow Brother's series. An interesting, educational and heartwarming read with themes of forgiveness, redemption, and, as always, love. 4.5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP424U2HOY0GM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147D771A#wasThisHelpful","RP424U2HOY0GM","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This sexy novella, part of the Aces Hockey series, is the story of Jenna and Andrew. When Andrew's family life fell apart as an older teen he was taken in by Jenna's family and Jenna kept her crush on him well hidden. Once in college they shared a steamy night together, but they both decided it was best if it didn't happen again, with both of them unsure of what her family would think about them having a relationship. But three years later, their feelings for each other, while being put on the backburner, haven't ever really gone away and when Jenna shows up with a new boyfriend at her family Christmas (in hopes of trying yet again to get Andrew out of her system), Andrew is thrown to discover his feelings for her are just as strong as ever. Can they find a way to make this Christmas the one with the best gift ever?I really enjoyed this story, told in first person from both Jenna and Andrew's points of view. It's clear from the start that Jenna's boyfriend isn't the one for her (it's a fairly new relationship) and nothing happens between her and Andrew until after he's out of the picture (so no cheating to worry about). We get a flashback scene to their steamy night in college together and I was happy to see that it was a mutual decision on their parts at that time to keep it between themselves and go their separate ways (as opposed to one or the other being made to feel bad about what happened). They were both mature individuals who made the decision together, even if secretly they knew they would have liked to continue the relationship. Instead they kept their distance from each other until finally being together again in the family home for the holidays. I liked Jenna's family who ensure a warm and caring environment and the camaraderie between all of them made for some humorous and lighthearted moments.As Andrew is a player for the Chicago Aces we do get a little hockey (though not much as the majority of the story takes place over the holidays) and a scene with him and his teammates that gives a good hint as to another story upcoming in the series. When Andrew and Jenna decide to pursue a relationship no matter what her family thinks, we get some steamy scenes between them, and a deep and intimate connection. I also appreciated that the angst level in the story was low, giving us a fun, overall lighthearted romance. 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9N1S71EPFW1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZNE45JA#wasThisHelpful","R9N1S71EPFW1C","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review for four of the stories in this set. They are a mixture of complete stories, and serial installments with cliffhanger endings, but every one features a super steamy romance!LUST’S RHYTHM by Lexxie CouperChloe is an accomplished cellist, but she's grown up in a rock star family, with both her father and brother being well known for their music and bad boy rocker images. They've warned her away from Jed, who's got a reputation just like theirs, but that hasn't stopped Chloe from her own secret fantasies of him since their eyes first met three years ago. Finally, (Finally!) they are in the same room together and get the chance to see whether their fantasies might live up to the reality. I really enjoyed this one! Super super sexy (I mean, whoa sexy!) and so much heat pouring off these two that I'm surprised my e-reader didn't catch fire. While it might be called an insta-love story, the reality is that they've been crushing on each other for so long that everything between them feels natural and right. This was a great novella with a happy ever after ending and definitely will make readers want to read the rest of this rock star series.THREE NIGHTS WITH A ROCK STAR by Amber Lin and Shari SladeThis first book in the Bandmates series ( a full length novel) takes us into a world of excess, where alcohol and sex abound, inhibitions are lost and two strangers become more to each other than either ever expected. This is the story of Lock (real name Keaton), front man for the band Half-Life and Hailey, a Sunday School teacher who confronts Lock on behalf of her pregnant sister Chloe in the belief that someone in his entourage is responsible for her sister's condition. Lock will allow Hailey to investigate on the condition that she sign a contract to stay with him for three days, indulging his every sexual fantasy after which time they will part ways.I like the portrayal of Lock's character as an anti-hero. He's a recovering alcoholic who sees sex strictly as a commodity to be bargained and traded. He's rough, he's impatient, he's abrupt - and he makes Hailey's blood sing. Yet something about Hailey sparks a tenderness in him that she sees and accepts despite his words to the contrary. Hailey's character comes across as that of a good girl finally given the chance to act out her deepest fantasies. She relishes this sudden freedom to let go of her inhibitions. We see Lock's character becoming more caring as Hailey's influence over him deepens. The story takes place over only three days, yet their shared experiences lead to a trust developing that Lock never anticipated. Both characters were portrayed in a believable manner for their life experience, and the sexual chemistry between them was off the charts! This a fast paced, sexy, riveting book with a happy ever after ending that will leave you wanting to know more about this band. I'll definitely be on the lookout for the next Bandmates story.PAINKILLER by Cari Quinn and Taryn ElliottThis story is an introduction to Johnny, a singer with Rebel Rage who is working on some solo songs and meets Evie, an MMA fighter on the underground circuit who is coming back from an injury. Johnny is playing at a bar that Evie are her friends (two of whom are also singers) are at and she is struck by the raw passion behind his solo work (but not overly impressed with what the rest of the crowd is interesting in hearing, the run of the mill work for which he is more well known). The story is told from Evie's point of view (with an epilogue from Johnny) and I really liked her character. She's tough, she's opinionated, she's bold and she's working hard on her comeback. She's passionate about her fighting, just as Johnny is passionate about his music. While at first they seem at odds, when Evie gets a chance to see him after the show, the passion they feel for their own interests spills over into a super sexy one one night together. But Evie's not going to let their steamy encounter wreck her plans and she's off bright and early in the morning, back to her regular life. The story is left unresolved, with the knowledge that neither of them has forgotten about the other. Can't wait to read more of their story!DIRTY by Ainsley BoothThis is a whet your appetite kind of story, a short teaser into the life of Tabitha, a rock star since the age of fifteen (now 25). She's used to everything in excess - alcohol, music and sex and never spends the night with just one person. When Wilson shows up, investigating a man involved in a human trafficking ring whom Tabitha may have been involved with at one point, she seeks to shock him with her outrageous behaviour. But he can see that it's a front for what she really feels, and he's determined to get through it and find out what makes her tick. They share a very steamy scene together, one night that surprises her in its intensity and in the fact that she let him stay the night. But in the morning, surprises abound and we're left with a cliffhanger ending, and knowing that there's bound to be more to Wilson and Tabitha's fractious beginning. Looking forward to the next installment in this series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17FJS3JWN75OY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017DPZTSC#wasThisHelpful","R17FJS3JWN75OY","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The second book in the Sin City SEALs series is a sexy, romantic tale about a woman afraid to take chances and a man who promises to catch her if she'll just let herself fall for him. Natalie is the sister of Lucia and best friend to Cade, the heroine and hero of book 1 of the series. She's a tough girl, a no nonsense bartender. She and her sister were in the foster parent system after the untimely death of their parents and she's learned to fight for herself, not giving an inch when it comes to her heart. Enter Jack, one of Cade's SEAL teammates and a handsome devil to boot. As the youngest of a slew of brothers he's learned how to look after himself too but isn't above taking a bet to make his older brother look foolish. The problem is the bet itself - to get Natalie to give him the time of day (or more accurately the time of his life in bed) is one she overhears and she's up for the challenge, to prove to her handsome distraction that she's not going to fall for his tricks. Together in Vegas for her sister and Cade's wedding, Natalie might fight her attraction to Jack but giving in would be so much sweeter. Will the winner come home with the prize or will all bets be off in the game of love?I was delighted to return to this series, as I had thoroughly enjoyed Lucia and Cade's story and was interested in seeing Natalie meet her match. What I enjoyed about this story was that they take turns being in control in their bedroom antics (because of course they end up there eventually, even though they share some steamy scenes prior to the main event). Jack is really quite a sweetheart and treats Natalie with kid gloves part of the time, not wanting to scare her off by admitting to her that he wants more than just a night in the sack. Even though the bet is his pretense to get her to really see him and acknowledge that she's attracted to him, the real thing he's after is her, and a chance to prove to her that he's not going to give up or run out on her as has happened with her loved ones in the past. He sees her fragility, but he also sees her strengths. Natalie is understandably hesitant about getting involved with anyone, especially a SEAL who could be called away on a mission at any time and not return. But Jack is pretty convincing that he'll do his best to always come home to her, if she'll let that happen. There was lots of fun banter between them, and their love scenes have a ring of truth to them, that their emotions are more deeply involved than Natalie wants to admit. I loved seeing them get their happy ending. Looking forward to more of Jack and Cade's comrades finding their happy endings too! 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H2ZFEZ3EHBE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CS5ND4#wasThisHelpful","R1H2ZFEZ3EHBE1","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This third story in the Kerr Chronicles series gives us a new couple, Jake and Natalie. Natalie is agoraphobic, apartment bound after her life changed when her identity as a female video game creator was revealed, enraging some men to the point where she was harassed and eventually the victim of a vicious attack. She’s been able to turn to writing fiction as a way to support herself (and is very successful at it, thought she writes anonymously under a pseudonym), but even stepping outside her apartment creates panic, a situation she is working to overcome when an anonymous note sets back her recovery. Determined to help her, security consultant Jake , hired by Natalie’s friend Oliver to find the perpetrator of the most recent harassment, understands the fear and pain she is experiencing. As a victim of an IED attack while serving in the military, his prosthetic hand and foot are constant reminders of what happened to him and his comrades. But something about Natalie calls to him, and vice versa. Learning to trust a new person is key to Natalie’s recovery and Jake takes care to show her, by his actions and words before they even meet in person that he will keep her safe. Can this unconventional couple find healing and love in each other?What an interesting storyline! While the military war hero is a familiar romance book character these days, an agoraphobic writer is definitely not. Jake comes across as an alpha male with a tender and caring side, evidenced by his treatment of Natalie and his concern for his younger sister who lives with him. As well, while on the outside he is definitely confident and in control, his prosthetics and people’s reactions to them show that he is human, with as much self doubt and pride as anyone else. When he eventually does meet Natalie in person, he worries about her reaction to them. But Natalie sees only his strength of character and will (and that he’s a really hot guy!). She sees that he’s overcome his disadvantages and that he understands her better than anyone she’s met before. Natalie comes across as a very empathetic character. The description of her life as an anxiety stricken woman is heartbreaking and yet her resilience and bravery is underscored time and again as she works hard to take each day and make it better than the one before. Throughout the story Jake is very supportive of her, but at the same time, he doesn’t cure her problem. Yes, he makes her feel safer, and this gives her the courage to keep attempting to move forward, but things don’t get magically better just because he is in the picture and I appreciated the reality of that.It seems hard to believe that a romance can develop between two people who aren’t even in the same room with each other until midway through the story, but it just goes to show that physical attraction can definitely start at an emotional level. As their text and phone flirting turns more serious, the scenes get pretty hot! Eventually Natalie is brave enough to let Jake in (literally), and they share some pretty steamy scenes. While the first half of the story is fairly low key, the action and intensity heat up in the second half as Natalie’s harassment continues and it becomes clear that someone is out to get her. All of a sudden you go from this steady interesting story to a whoa! What is happening! action packed tale that ends on a bang. I was a bit taken aback by how the story ramped up so quickly, but it definitely made for a dramatic ending! 4 stars for an entertaining and unique story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKXWOGCW8KOH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503947556#wasThisHelpful","RKXWOGCW8KOH6","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This collection of SEAL romances actually contains 8 stories, all full of naughty goodness! The Blush Shoppe sex toy company is a thread that runs through the stories, and should give you a hint at what kind of steamy scenes you can expect, so consider yourself suitably warned! The following is a review for 5 of the stories.Toying with the SEAL by Selena BlakeThis was my first time reading a story by Selena Blake and I loved the idea of a coffee shop owner, Jillian who takes a liking to Teo, one of her steady customers (a feeling that is returned) and ends up engaging in a sexy affair with him. Though they both say they're just in it for the moment, the truth is that the more time they spend together, the deeper they fall for each other. The love scenes are super steamy, and I would have gladly read a full length story with this couple. Definitely worth the read.Falling Dirty by Zoe YorkZoe York's SEALs stories always add some new element to keep them fresh and exciting, and this one definitely lives up to its title! Hunter and Serena are already an established couple, but Hunter finds out that Serena's been looking at some pretty interesting sex toys on her computer and decides to play out some of her fantasies. While he's quite willing to indulge her in bed, he's also just a really nice guy, dependable and loyal and that really shows in his commitment to her and her happiness. There is some menage action in this one too, as a friend of Hunter's gets enlisted to add to their fun. Super sexy!The Navy SEAL's Holiday Fling by Zara KeaneIn this story, Liam dated Jill briefly in the summer but had to pull out of their new relationship with no warning when his undercover work was in danger of being revealed. When he finds out Jill might be in danger due to her association with the Blush Shoppe company, he swoops in to save her, and rekindles the flame. I liked the way this story flowed, the bits of suspense mixed in with the rebuilding and strengthening of the bonds they had started to build. There are some sexy scenes too (not as intense as some of the other stories) and a sweet ending with the promise of a happy future together.Tainted Angel by Sadie HallerThis sexy short story is a snippet of the relationship building between Jane, the lead singer of Tainted Pearl and her bodyguard Brody, a former SEAL who now is keeping her safe from a stalker. They're already in a sexual relationship, and Brody wants to deepen those bonds by whisking Jane off for a little Christmas holiday, complete with some new toys for the bedroom. The scenes are super hot as they both get the getaway they are looking for.Taming the Seal by Yvonne MichaelsThis story was the most intense of the ones I read when compared with the other stories in the set. Monica gets involved with Grant, the bodyguard of a Las Vegas mafia man. She gets mistaken for being the wrong woman, and ends up kidnapped, though luckily Grant's experience as a SEAL comes in handy for the rescue. There are some sexy scenes, a bit more violence than I expected, and an eventual happy for now ending.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21FVADAVL61QK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161YV62Y#wasThisHelpful","R21FVADAVL61QK","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first of a 2 part story - no HEA or HFN at the end of this part, but definitely worth the read!Kate's on a one week trip to Paris, an artist who is trying to figure out whether going to school to continue developing her skills or getting a 'real' job as her parents would say is the way to go. She plans to see the sights and tour all the famous museums, hoping that her time away from home will give her the answers she's looking for. When she meets Rylan in a coffee shop, a charming, sexy man who makes it clear that he'd like to make her time in Paris even more worthwhile, she's hard pressed to turn him down. As they share intimate moments together, it becomes clear to Kate that there is more to Rylan than he's telling her - and to Rylan that a week with Kate isn't going to be enough. But what will happen when Kate's time in Paris comes to a close?I really liked both of these characters. Kate comes across as a conflicted woman, torn with what to do for her future (hence her trip to Paris). She's also a bit innocent and naive -though not so naive as to fall for Rylan's obvious attempts to get her to sleep with him without being aware of the consequences of her decision. She figures that he's a playboy and that this is his thing, picking up lonely women and treating them to his off the map tour of the city (or at least his bed). But for once in her life, she's going to just enjoy herself, and this attractive and charming man looks like just the ticket for a good time. Rylan puts on the facade of the fly by night, give a girl a good time guy, but in truth there is a lot more depth to him than meets the eye. While it's true he's gotten into the habit of pursuing tourists for the sake of a few days of fun, it's just a means of passing the time. His life is in a shambles, decisions that need to be made to deal with the fallout of events that happened a year before just sitting and waiting for him. He's wealthy and bored and avoiding his past. But something about Kate, her willingness to see through his act and find the real man underneath makes her different than the other women. He delights in showing her the sensual side of Paris, and in showing her how good sex can be. But it doesn't take long before he realizes he wants more from her. To get more though, he'll have to give more - in fact, he'll have to come clean about who he really is if he wants to pursue a relationship. Lies and deceit haunt him and telling Kate the truth could be his end or his salvation.The sex scenes are super hot, but not only that, there is a lot of emotion to them as well. Sex is great, but won't sustain a relationship and even after their first time together Rylan realizes that Kate is different and special. After one week, when Kate is ready to go back home, Rylan isn't ready to give up everything they've already built. Only time will tell if they will be able to survive the truth of Rylan's past, and his new willingness to put his future back on track, hopefully with Kate in his life. 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R196Q7Z638IQ0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455589799#wasThisHelpful","R196Q7Z638IQ0M","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review for four of the stories in this collection of hot working guys and the women (and men) who catch their eye. There are m/m/f and m/f stories to steam up your ereader and were a delight to read!KNOCKOUT – Cari QuinnThis steamy new adult novella may not be long, but it's packed with sex and emotion as Lily, JC and Emerson discover that the feelings they have for each other are more than they ever dared to admit, until now. It's told from all three points of view in first person, and they are each quite interesting characters. Lily is the daughter of the gym owner where she works, a 20 year old woman who is looking for a little adventure. I'll be the first to say that at age twenty, I'm pretty sure a menage partnership would never have even occurred to me but Lily has the gumption to pull it off. Emerson is a young man her father took a liking to at a young age and helped out with his career as a now up and coming MMA fighter. He's always seen Lily as hands off but there's no denying that he has a strong attraction to her.. And JC is a friend of Lily's, working on a construction project at the gym who just happens to have his eye on Lily and Emerson too. He initiates the action between them at a house party where they are the only invited guests, and a hot and heavy encounter between the three of them ensues. But one night isn't going to be enough for them, and they find ways to spend more 'quality' time together. They get a happy for now ending (one that doesn't delve into the logistics of a long term partnership, which is fitting for their ages) but we know their relationship will continue to evolve. A quick and very sexy read!HOT SUMMER NIGHTS – Cathy ClampWhen two people unknown to each other are the joint inheritors at a motel property, it's a chance for them to connect and save the property at the same time as they find a future with each other. This is a short but sexy read, and I liked both characters. Little did they know that Sophie's grandfather and Gabe's mentor had planned on doing this little bit of matchmaking by making sure they'd have little choice but to work together. They have a steamy love scene and the happy ending is appropriate for the story.MARKED FOR LOVE - Anna J. StewartThere was a lot of story in this short novella, and I only wish it had been longer! Regan took over the care of her siblings when her mother died young and her father turned to alcohol. Not only that, but she's helped keep their business afloat too. Her neighbour Brodie who has just opened a tattoo shop across the street might have caught her eye, but she just doesn't feel she has time for any relationship. Brodie is persistent though, and manages to change her mind. It's a sweet story, no overly explicit scenes but a tender romance. I really liked all the family dynamics in this one, and while we get the ""I Love You' declaration, I didn't think it was needed to believe they could have a happy ending together. I will definitely look for more by this author.UNASHAMED — Leah BraemelHayley has Max and Noah working hard on the house she bought, doing a renovation job for her. She's not above getting her hands dirty though and pitching in, though both Max and Noah have other dirty thoughts involving her - as she does them. I really liked all the characters in this story, and it had lots of sexy goodness as this menage trio works out the kinks of taking a one night stand and making it into a committed threesome relationship. I appreciated that the effect of their relationship on their families was not glossed over but was integral to the story. As well, while both Max and Noah have feelings for Hayley (and vice versa), the relationship between Max and Noah themselves morphs from friendship into acknowledging their true feelings for each other. This story has a lot of heart to go with the steamy scenes and was a great read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R78ID14F3SEQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013J85PQS#wasThisHelpful","R78ID14F3SEQD","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third story in the sexy romantic suspense Bad Boys Undercover series, an exciting, nail biting story that kept me on edge from beginning to end. The  Alliance, an undercover group made up of former MI6 and CIA operatives is under threat, this time from an old nemesis, Benton, a man they thought they'd killed but who turns up still very much alive. He's on a personal vendetta, to destroy each of the operatives one by one by threatening someone dear to them. But while Josiah and his crew are hunting him down, so is someone else, a woman whose mother died at the hands of this evil man. Sutton's investigation into Benton turns up some of his files, and her subsequent delving into what she finds leads the Alliance right to her. It's a game of cat and mouse, trust and deceit as Sutton and Josiah find that the sexual chemistry between them won't be denied. In a world of strange bedfellows, theirs might just be the sexiest pairing, but one that could get them killed.Ms. Dimon is masterful at creating fictitious worlds that rock both the suspense and the sexy edge looked for by readers in the romantic suspense genre. Her characters are  strong, dependable,loyal,  yet conflicted, with all too human flaws.  Josiah definitely fits that description. As a leader on the team, he's ruthless and never afraid to do what it takes to get the job done. When he goes after Sutton, it's with the intent of finding out exactly what she's up to - he doesn't trust her, and she doesn't do anything to clear herself in his eyes, keeping her own counsel and not willing to reveal why she's after the same man he is. Soon enough though, Josiah's actions towards her show that he isn't a threat (even though he isn't sure of the same) and bit by bit they start to reveal more personal details to each other. I loved Sutton's strength, her unrelenting willingness to pursue her mother's killer on her own, and her ability to face her fears (of heights, for example) if it gets her closer to the truth. When Josiah and Sutton end up giving in to their attraction, their scenes are smoking hot! But beyond the sex, in the aftermath they become adept at comforting each other too, and it's this combination that draws them closer together.While Sutton and Josiah are getting emotionally attached, Benton's thirst for revenge is ongoing. We get to see the story from three points of view - Sutton, Josiah and Benton, which gives the story a great well rounded view and adds to the suspense level in knowing Benton's thoughts and plans. There is some violence in the story, as expected, and lots of twists and turns (and definitely events I didn't see coming). This story is my favourite so far in the series, and I'm looking forward to where it's headed next! 4.5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NWNOSWJ331LF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062330098#wasThisHelpful","R1NWNOSWJ331LF","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in the Desert Dogs series, a name that comes from a group of childhood friends who formed a club of sorts, and still have each other's backs even as they've had to deal with the ups and downs of relationships and life in general. There is a continuity to the plot from the first book, in which a casino developer moved into their town and brought some shady dealings, including murder into their midst. You don't have to read the first story to enjoy this one, the setup is laid out well, but it definitely would be of benefit if you want to know more about Vince and Kim, whose story is the first in the series.This story focuses on Raina, the bar owner and all around feisty heroine type and Duncan, the suave and sophisticated legal counsel for the Casino company - a man who finds that by aiding the Desert Dogs in their murder investigation in the previous story is now a suspect as a result and his life unravels before his eyes. He's already got mental health issues, and they are definitely exacerbated by the new events. In an effort to clear himself, he decides that solving some of the still remaining mysteries should fall to him. But in being a suspect and considered a shady character by many of the townsfolk, his life is also threatened and Raina takes him in, a thank you of sorts for his help and the fact that his own career is threatened by him aiding their club.I really enjoyed the relationship that builds between Raina and Duncan. She's such a strong character, and yet she's able to be what Duncan needs, without diminishing herself. Her history with Miah, her childhood friend and former lover isn't glossed over, and it's clear that while they have strong feelings for each other, it's not enough to make for a future for them. (Incidentally, a novella was released after this story, Drive it Deep, that looks more closely into Miah and Raina's prior relationship). Duncan was fascinating as he gets slowly taken apart and rebuilt as a new person, something that's happened to him before and yet now, finally, he feels at home in his own skin. I loved reading about that transformation. There is a tense underlying feel to the story, the knowledge that there is a murdered man somewhere out there, and combined with the harassment of Duncan, makes for a compelling read. The sex scenes between Raina and Duncan are super hot (as expected of Ms. McKenna) but tender too. I felt like this was more Duncan's story than anything else, and I really liked how the whole thing was put together. The ending leaves us with some mysteries still to be solved and I'm looking forward to the next story in the series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32A7SQEY51ZAN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=045147127X#wasThisHelpful","R32A7SQEY51ZAN","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This entertaining romance mixes a little suspense with lot of sexy heat and is the story of Max and Rose. When Rose's estranged father hires Max as a personal bodyguard for Rose after her jewelry shop is broken into, she's not at all pleased, wishing she'd never told her father about the incident on one of his many calls to reconnect their relationship. But when her home gets broken into as well, she's willing to admit that having Max around isn't so bad as she feared. In fact, she's quite willing to take things to a more personal level. Max's best efforts to keep things business only fall by the wayside when Rose makes it clear that she's willing to engage in a no-strings attached affair while things get sorted out. But danger stalks Rose even with her faithful bodyguard around, and when the pieces fall into place, she's going to have to decide where her heart really lies.I really enjoyed this story! It had just the right balance for me of steamy sex scenes and a believable couple intertwined with a compelling suspense plot. I love that Rose is a very strong, opinionated character who doesn't back down from a fight nor run at the first sign of danger. She's definitely a handful for Max, but to his credit he understands her feelings about his bodyguard status and takes them into account even as he doesn't shirk from his duty to protect her at all costs. Rose's relationship with her father is a difficult one, and is the basis for a lot of what has happened in her life, the good and the bad. He's a key character in the story, as his desire for reuniting with Rose and his hiring of Max to protect her clash with her desire to stay independent of him. Though Max and Rose start out having an ill-advised (but so tempting!) fling, it quickly develops into something deeper for them both, even though they've professed to wanting no relationship. I liked that they both had to be willing to make some changes in order for their affair to go any further. The ending wrapped everything together nicely. 4.5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H161NGRHP0RZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WAPFYQI#wasThisHelpful","R3H161NGRHP0RZ","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the BDSM world, it's all about who's got the control, and when you have two people trying to be on top it's going to make for an intense and dramatic story. This is especially true if one of those people is realizing that their role as a Dominant might be masking their true desire. Such is the case with Samantha and Gibson. Though Gibson trained Sam as a Domme, he's never felt more alive than when he played with her as a submissive during her training. He's always shied away from this side of himself and tried to cover it up but she's seen through his mask and is determined to push him out of his comfort zone - and into her arms for good.Gibson's conflict within himself is the key to the story, his desires warring with the expectations on him. From an early age he was defined as weak by his father, and the thought of being submissive at the club he belongs to chills him to the bone, even as it lights him up sexually. I really liked his character, and his struggle, while intense, felt very real. Sam was an equally engaging woman, having experienced a past traumatic attack that has defined her need now to always be in control of a situation. She's never going to lie down for anyone again, and this sets her and Gibson up to fail, as Gibson is determined to never show his submissive side to anyone. When they are thrown together in a situation where Gibson's protective side comes out, Sam will only allow him to take on that role with her if he'll submit in the bedroom. What happens is a sexually explosive affair that could wreck them or heal them. It was a real nail biter for me, the super steamy scenes both in and out of the club, warring with the conflict. Some of the scenes between them were beyond my comfort zone, but necessary and integral to the story as a whole. 4 stars for this intriguing and dramatic story about trust and desire.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R119CGORT0SHNA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISEOM2C#wasThisHelpful","R119CGORT0SHNA","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lacey and Austin have a pretty unpleasant history. He was the arresting officer in a drug case that Lacey inadvertently was involved in due to her relationship with the man in charge. Imprisoned for three years, she's finally free to try to pick up the pieces of her once thriving life. Working at her family's tree farm with her brother is a chance to rebuild, but for one reason or another Austin seems to always be around. Despite their best efforts to stay uninvolved, there is a strong attraction between them and they can't resist giving in. But can they develop the trust to put their troubled past behind them?Kudos to Lacey for embracing the real spirit of forgiveness because I'm not sure that I would have been able to consider developing a relationship with a man who was responsible for the worst three years of my life. But Lacey is determined to move on, and Austin is realizing that things might not have been what they seemed, to his (most likely) everlasting guilt. The friendship they develop starts out very slowly, but eventually they find a space where they can just be themselves at the moment, and not what they were to each other before. I really liked both characters, Lacey's strong will and determination balancing well with Austin's dedication and wish to make amends. They share some steamy scenes together, and the spirit of the Christmas season definitely shines through. 4 stars for an entertaining, sometimes bittersweet, but eventual happy ending story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUQBGOKUN5GLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0175N50IG#wasThisHelpful","RUQBGOKUN5GLX","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is definitely one of the more complex romances I've read, in terms of the relationship dynamics between the hero and heroine. In a nutshell, Jenna is best friends with Mia, who has been divorced from her previous husband and is married again and 8 months pregnant. When Jenna has a one night stand with a handsome stranger, she never imagines that not only is he the mediator hired by her hospital to negotiate a labour dispute, he's also Mia's ex-husband, the one she's heard all about. The man she knows doesn't fit the description she's always heard. In fact, he seems quite the opposite. Not only that, but her Aunt Gertie has a secret career as an erotica writer, knowledge of which Jenna believes could impact her job. It's only a matter of time before all the strings start to tangle up and Jenna has to make some choices about how much she's willing to risk for love.I really enjoyed this. It's a sensual love story, the scenes between Adam and Jenna being not overly explicit but still detailed enough to take this a bit beyond the sweet category. And oh my, the complications! As each little detail of past relationships is revealed, it almost leaves your head spinning, and it's no wonder that Jenna starts to feel to torn about what the right action is, versus what she is starting to feel for Adam. There was a fair amount of bittersweet in the story, the reality of failed marriages, step-children relationships, hurt feelings and guilt all coming into play. Yet there are many light hearted and humorous moments too. It makes for a very realistic romance, the characters being flawed but always trying to do their best in difficult situations. They might not have always made the right choices, but they are willing to own up to their mistakes. From beginning to end I found it highly entertaining and really hard to put down. There was tension from one chapter to the next as revelations are made, but still an overall sweet and lovely story with a really heartwarming ending. 4.5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KOC23FEMDYIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SBZFHYA#wasThisHelpful","R1KOC23FEMDYIA","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a friends to lovers romance, between two neighbours - Holly and Roth. They've both decided that marriage and commitment are not for them, but a dating arrangement they make quickly becomes a friends with benefits deal as they find that their attraction to each other no longer needs to be hidden. But what will it take to make them change their minds and realize they could have a future together?This was an okay read for me, but I found that there seemed to be a lot more emphasis on Holly and Roth's relationship with their respective families than on themselves. While I found that interesting at first, it got a bit wearing after a while. Holly made some decisions at the start that didn't make a lot of sense to me, but that didn't last long and by mid-way I definitely was enjoying her character. Roth I liked from the very beginning, and his chosen career as a jewelry designer was really interesting. They had a good connection and their love scenes showed that chemistry between them. I was glad that they got their happy ending. 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y46GASMUNWGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WAHJ38#wasThisHelpful","R2Y46GASMUNWGH","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know that feeling you get when you've got some warm comfy socks on, you're snuggled up in a blanket on the couch, with a mug of hot chocolate and a good book? (Maybe even your faithful canine companion curled up with you on the end of the couch?) That's how you'll feel after reading this book. In fact, I recommend reading this story while doing all of the above, just to give you a double shot of the warm fuzzies.This is the second story in the Boys of Fall, a delightful small town romance series featuring players from the championship team coming home to help out their town fourteen years later, after the shutting down of the local mill left the local football program in jeopardy.  The first story (and they are all easily read as standalones) featured Chase and Kelly, the coach's daughter. This story though, is about the wayward town son Alex, a troubled teen who straightened himself out with the help of his high school football coach. He went on to become a world renowned photojournalist, and he's making his second trip home to Stewart Mills, this time to more fully document the town's turnaround, including a photo essay of the up and coming team players. Not knowing how long he'll be in town, he's set up to board at Gretchen's farm, the one she runs with her grandmother Ida. Though Gretchen was a few years behind him in school, they know each other, and she feels fairly comfortable renting a room to him to test out the whole boarding thing as a way of making some extra money to keep the farm afloat. What she doesn't count in is how well Alex starts to fit in, becoming a fixture in their home -and with not much encouragement gaining a place in her heart as well.  But his stay is temporary, his calling to be out where the action is only put aside briefly to finish what he feels is the story left to tell about his home town. When his next assignment comes calling, will Alex and Gretchen both be left with only memories?It's really nice to read a story that doesn't have any manufactured angst, just the real emotions of believable characters who've maybe had a tougher upbringing than some, but have dealt with it, moved on, and are fully functioning normal adults. I loved Gretchen's character as a strong, loyal, committed woman. She was brought up by her grandparents after being left with them by her wayward and unreliable parents, and has dedicated herself to the farm, her way of thanking her grandparents for taking her in. But it's not just that, she really loves what she does. It's hard work, but it's rewarding and she doesn't complain about the early hours, or the constant repairs or any other of the little day to day responsibilities - they are just part of her. Her grandfather has since passed away but not without leaving her a legacy to continue, and she's constantly thinking up ways to earn more income to keep the farm viable. Taking in a border is just another means to an end. But Alex is someone who fits in so well that she finds it hard to keep those tenant/landlord boundaries with him. Alex is friendly, helpful, kind, and equally hardworking. He's also extremely talented as a photojournalist, able to capture the emotion of a moment. It's a gift not to be taken lightly, and it's one that Gretchen knows is too important to keep him in a small town like Stewart Mills.  She tries, rather unsuccessfully, to guard her heart from him - because Alex is able to bring out the feminine side that Gretchen keeps so well hidden, the side that might like it if a man could 'open a pickle jar' for her (I'll leave you to decide if that's a euphimism for something else wink wink). Her stature and demeanor have always made her a bit intimidating to men, but Alex makes her feel desired and special.  The chemistry between them sparks from the start and leads to eventual steamy love scenes that turn them both inside out - because what should be a casual sexual fling becomes so much more. Gretchen is good at hiding her emotions though, and knowing that Alex is bound to leave means she keeps her heart locked down, even though Alex has already cracked through the shell.With two people who have set ideas for their future, it's only going to be with compromise that a happy ending will be reached - but not without a few tears (darn you Ms. Stacey!). I really loved how the story came together and how the emotions and conflict were settled. The secondary characters, friends of both Alex and Gretchen made for some fun scenes, with male and female bonding that speaks to strong friendships.  Ida, Gretchen's grandmother is a hoot, and made their home feel warm and loving. And one can't forget Cocoa, a beautiful dog and loyal companion who added just the right touch of extra warmth to the story. Delightful from start to finish. 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XAFKLI4D0TBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI028JK#wasThisHelpful","R1XAFKLI4D0TBK","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this latest (and last!) story in the Club Sin series. While you could read it as a standalone, the many characters of previous stories play significant roles here, and are a welcome addition to the story that for the most part is a look into Dmitri and Presley's current relationship and where it is headed. Threats to the club's privacy are the focus of the more suspenseful side of the plot and felt very realistic for the story, as it stands to reason that sex clubs around the globe would have the same kind of concerns. The dynamics of Dmitri and Presley's D/s relationship show that they have both changed over time, becoming more emotionally attached and while marriage seems the most natural conclusion, the trust between them needs to be solidified before that can happen. I loved seeing the two of them together, and the strength of Presley's character as she fights for what she wants and needs in their relationship. Some new characters were introduced too, ones that will appear in a spinoff series (yay!).

"This is the first of 3 concurrent novellas, all about three young women who met at boarding school and have reunited for a little R&R together, including attending the Outback Bachelor and Spinster ball in hopes of meeting some men to sweep them off their feet (or at least out for a sexy evening).This story features Ellie, a cowgirl who grew up on a ranch in Australia and Rick, her father's right hand man. She's had a crush on him since they met when she was 14 and he was 19. Now 14 years later, she's all grown up and hopeful that if she transforms herself into a sexy siren, Rick might finally see her as the woman she is. I really liked Ellie in this story and her desire to have someone see her more feminine side, something that is often hidden in the day to day life of working on a cattle ranch. Rick came across as a loyal and dedicated farm hand, and a man still struggling with the grief of his father's passing several years earlier and the loss of their family sheep farm. He's torn between trying to revive his family's legacy and his attraction to Ellie. The two of them together share a sexy love scene but it's going to take more than that for them to trust each other. Rick comes across sometimes as a bit dense when it comes to women, in particular in revealing his true feelings to Ellie. But it all comes out right in the end, and they get their happy ending.

"Zoe and Spock (real name Zach, but as that is Zoe's twin brother's name, she continues to use his comic-con identity from their initial meeting) were secondary characters in One Night , the first story in this series, and quickly became favorites. I was so pleased to see them getting their own story which is easily read as a standalone and takes place several months after the end of One Night.A lot has happened for Zoe recently, and not all of it has been good. Most importantly, she lost her brother Wyatt to an adrenaline fueled stunt gone wrong, one she was aware he had planned and never talked him out of performing. As a result, she carries an overwhelming sense of guilt for his death. Her friend Spock had been on tour with his band, but at the news of her brother's death left the tour to come and be with her as she copes with her new reality. She's moved in with a new roommate, a tattoo artist who is happy to take Zoe in hand and not averse to giving her some ink to help her remember her brother. She's also got a new job as an artist for a children's program, a position she's taken in hopes that it will give her back her artistic mojo that has been missing since her brother died. Spock's presence in Zoe's life is a steadying one, as she deals with death and grief in ways that start to border on unhealthy. And as they start to connect on a more intimate level, revelations about Spock's past and Zoe's own issues threaten to derail their relationship. It will be up to Zoe to take action to make it possible to have a happy future with Spock.This was a really emotional new adult story, told from Zoe's viewpoint as she navigates this new stage of her life - losing her brother and the guilt associated with that, losing her roommate Jess (to a relationship and not death, but still a loss) and the reality of being in a family that has addiction problems. Both her parents have struggled with addiction, and Zoe herself had a bad bout with alcohol before cutting herself off cold turkey, to prevent what could be a future of alcoholism. Every time she has a major life change she also tends to change something about herself - her hair or her body or her persona to some degree, as a coping mechanism. I really liked Zoe's character, conflicted as she is, and her willingness to continue to put one foot in front of the other and try to move forward. Her inability to see her own problems starts to blind her though, and it is her friends Jess and Adam, her new roommate, and especially Spock who gently make her aware that she's not going to be able to fix everything on her own. Spock is wonderful, a kind, decent, and caring man. It's obvious that he wants more than just friendship from Zoe and is equally unable to resist taking their relationship to the next level. They share some steamy scenes as they become more emotionally involved with each other. It was sometimes difficult to read as Zoe started to break down, but I really liked how the story came together, the healing that had to happen giving way to a happy ending for this couple that are perfect for each other.  4.5 stars for this sometimes heartwrenching but satisfying story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LDIIH8PNH93P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGZOGMY#wasThisHelpful","R1LDIIH8PNH93P","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This exciting romance, a blend of science fiction and paranormal fantasy is the story of Amanda and Rhodry. When Amanda's starship discovers that the earthlike planet Harp contains a colony of earth descendants, she's the first in line to want to explore the new world, her ship bound status something she's never quite gotten used to despite being born there. At every opportunity she's explored the new worlds they've discovered and this one looks especially intriguing, even more so because the lush green forests seem to be speaking to her on a personal level. She's the only one on her ship who appears to have the ability to telepathically understand the Green as it's called and to commune with their nature. The earth descendants they find are an intriguing blend of Irish and Spanish heritage and some carry a secret that she discovers - genetically altered men who can shift into the form of giant cats, a protection developed by earlier generations to ward off the dangerous animals on the planet. Rhodry, a mountain clan leader and shifter who is in the main city at the request of his king, holds the opinion of many on their world, that the last thing their planet needs is some interfering humans who might take their peaceful existence and destroy it. When Amanda makes it clear that she's here to stay and learn more about the planet, including joining the special Guild that protects the Green, like all the other men he is skeptical of her intentions and her abilities. But Amanda is determined to prove them all wrong. When her mission gets sabotaged, it's Rhodry who heads to her aid - but his own political enemies aren't far behind and it will be a ruthless fight for survival for them both, amidst trying to deny the strong attraction they feel for each other. Can they survive long enough to contemplate a future together?I really enjoyed this story! I found the blend of sci-fi and paranormal to be a really interesting mix of genres. The majority of the action takes place planet side, but Amanda's character is greatly influenced by her shipboard upbringing, her drive to understand and explore new planets part of her desire to enjoy solitude and life outside of a ship. She has an absentee father who was said to have a green thumb, and this goes a long way to explain her unexpected ability to 'hear' the trees, and sense the life in the forests on Harp. Amanda comes across as a feisty, strong and independant woman. She's always had to fight for what she wants and on Harp, this is no exception, her desire to join the Guild that protects the forests something that becomes almost an obsession for her. Rhodry is an equally engaging character, a strong, tough, mountain man who is mired in political intrigue as a result of the inheritance of his clan position from his grandfather. He's loyal to his king, but not particularly pleased with being asked to serve him in the city, as it leaves his clan without their leader and vulnerable to internal attacks by those who would love to see him out of the picture. The two of them together made for an interesting pair, but I loved seeing them work through their attraction, and the respect and admiration that Rhodry develops for Amanda is heartfelt and honest. The romance between them is a slow burn, and things don't heat up between them until later in the story, but it is set up with enough sexual tension that it keeps you turning the pages waiting for them to finally succumb to their attraction. And when they do, the scenes are steamy and emotional. Amanda's fight to be accepted into the Guild and the tasks required therein lead to some tense and dramatic scenes, with lots of action and suspense. I found the whole story to be a real page turner.There were several interesting secondary characters introduced in this story, and I'm really hoping that this is the start of a series, as at the end of the book I just wasn't ready to let them go! The world building was wonderful, well detailed and easy to picture. If you're a regular reader of sci-fi or paranormal romances, and like some sexy scenes and intrigue on the side, this is definitely a book for you. 4.5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY4DJ1UOUQ9UY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WBFNVM#wasThisHelpful","RY4DJ1UOUQ9UY","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This sexy novella length romance complete with a happy for now ending packs a punch with all sorts of emotional feels as Zack and Holly meet on the beach in the small town where he's arrived for his sister's funeral. Holly knows about grief, having suffered the loss of her parents at a young age, and consoling Zack is no hardship, as they connect on an intimate level.

There is a mystery surrounding Zack's sister's death though, and some suspense added to the story as the plot thickens (so to speak). I really enjoyed this one, the romance between Zack and Holly on the fast track due to the circumstances, but with a very satisfactory ending. It's a quick read, but engrossing and a definite page turner. 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A4B5278Y0GQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WAHKKK#wasThisHelpful","R3A4B5278Y0GQO","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being Captain of the Fighter Force on the Valiant Knox starship is a position Leigh obtained through hard work and perseverance - and someone is trying to bring it down. The war with the CSS has taken an even deadlier turn, with moles on board the ship working to cause its destruction. When the new batch of recruits is set upon in transport, Leigh saves the life of the bright and beautiful young woman Mia. As a recruit under his command she's off limits - but there is no denying the scorching heat between them. When Mia is attacked on board, she uses her hacking skills to delve deeper into the mystery, and ends up joining Leigh in his pursuit of the spies within. Engaging in an illicit affair will endanger them in more ways than one - can they catch the ones bent on destroying the ship before they get caught themselves?I loved this story! The worldbuilding was excellently done, giving a full picture of the factions involved in the war between the United Earth Forces and the ultra radical CSS, a religious cult bent on taking earth and its colonies back to a pre-technology time. The huge starship Valiant Knox is well detailed and easy to picture. (It's entirely possible that I had mental pictures of the Starship Enterprise decks while reading the story). The romance is a forbidden one, the commander of the starship being attracted to the new recruit. Leigh and Mia work very hard at denying this attraction, knowing that being found in any kind of compromising position will endanger not only his well regarded military career but Mia's up and coming one as well. But of course in the end they can't keep their hands off each other, especially when working together to find out who is sabotaging things on the ship puts them in close and private quarters in the dead of night. The love scenes between them were pretty steamy, but I appreciated that they each felt equally tortured by their feelings and the knowledge that even though it felt right to be together, no-one else would see it that way. There is lots of action and intrigue right from the start, and along with the romance, it made for a real page turner. Knowing that there was a spy (or two or more) among their trusted friends makes the story taut with suspense, not to mention wondering when someone would find out about the relationship developing between Mia and Leigh (because we just know that someone will discover the truth!). As the story reached it's peak and conclusion, I liked the way everything fell together, the consequences that occurred for all involved and the satisfactory ending for Mia and Leigh. I'll definitely be looking for more from this author. 4.5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EFLQEH1MI836/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MP6JZ2#wasThisHelpful","R2EFLQEH1MI836","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a story about heartbreak and loss, love and redemption. It's a friends to lover story too, about Molly who's loved her brother's friend Jason for years, watching as he teetered on the brink of destruction after her mother died, which precipitated his decision to enter the military and how he returned a battered and bruised man. She's seen him go through women and alcohol and now, now he finally is seeing her in a new light. He wants to pursue a relationship with her, and will do anything to make her see that he is changing, and will continue to do so for her. But is it enough to earn back her trust after years of breaking it apart?I really enjoyed this story. The conflict between Jason and Molly was believable, and it's easy to see why Molly doesn't trust Jason. Starting with dating and marrying (then divorcing) her friend, breaking her heart for the first time and not the last, their relationship has been a string of closeness and confidences followed by bitterness and betrayal. They've always been friends though, through thick and thin until Molly cuts Jason off, leaving him with a month to come to the realization that not having her in his life is worse than anything else that could happen. During this time, he's come to realize that he wants more with her, a future, but he knows it's going to be a tough and uphill battle to convince her that they could be good together. And when Molly lets him back into her life she's clear that she wants only one thing from him - sex. She won't risk her heart again, but she knows that he'll treat her body well. Jason tries to resist letting things between them become physical, but he can't because truth be told, he's always wanted her in his bed. Their love scenes are steamy, and put them on the path to forgiveness. I liked the two of them together, and I was glad to see Molly was firm in her convictions that Jason would have to prove to her that he had changed if he wanted a real chance with her. Jason is definitely an empathetic character, one who has made some pretty poor choices and is paying for them now. But you could tell that he was serious about changing, not just for Molly but for himself too.There's another secondary storyline as well, the relationship between Jason's older brother Marcus and his former military teammate Will. Being in the military means that the 'don't ask don't tell' policy is ingrained in them, so much so that Will doesn't want to let it be known to his friends that he's dating Marcus. And this wears on Marcus, to the point where he has to make some decisions about his future too. Their story isn't finished and I'm looking forward to hearing more about this couple in the future.Overall, I found this to be a great addition to the series, and an enjoyable read, sometimes intense, sometimes sexy, and always entertaining. 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MHVQY6RNWJX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOVZY6G#wasThisHelpful","R2MHVQY6RNWJX1","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tropical resort? Sunlit days and moonlit nights? Handsome sexy hero who gives great ...massages? Check, check and check!This fun and sexy story gives Laney, a trauma surgeon seriously in need of some R&R just what she's looking for. After finding her fiance in a compromising position that resulted in the end of her engagement, a lost job, and no plans for the immediate future, she's going to enjoy what was supposed to be her honeymoon at an exclusive resort that caters to a variety of sexual fantasies along with the traditional fare. Her masseuse seems a bit too rugged and rough to have been working there for long - he's got that military air and the scars to prove that things haven't always been so easy for him. In point of fact though, Gray is at the resort undercover, hoping to catch a notorious drug dealer, the latest intel having him making a stop at the resort. A no strings attached fling is just what the doctor ordered (straight off the 'extra' menu) - until their connection gets to be a bit deeper than either expected. Now Gray's got to choose between keeping his cover or letting Laney in all the way.This one hit all the right notes for me, with its tropical setting, interesting characters and strong connection between them right from the start. I liked Laney as this down to earth gal, one who's no stranger to lies or danger from her position as an ER doc. She knows Gray's not quite on the up and up but it doesn't stop her from having a little fun with him on the side. They have great chemistry together and the sex scenes are fun and steamy. It's not long before Laney is drawn into the web of secrecy surrounding Gray's mission (her medical skills definitely come in handy). Gray's the one who it turns out has commitment issues, but he's soon got to pull his head out of the sand or he'll lose Laney for good. The whole plot comes together nicely and made for a fun and entertaining story. 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R390D4BB8CGYFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373798679#wasThisHelpful","R390D4BB8CGYFO","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This fun and sexy story, part of the 49th Floor series (all standalone) is the story of Marcus and Rose. Marcus is in a bind - he needs to show his domineering father that's he's not going to take over the family business (or marry a nice Jewish girl) as his own company is doing very well (thank you very much). What better way than to bring a totally non-conservative non-Jewish woman to his family's charity ball, just to stick it to his father once and for all? And when Rose conveniently owes Marcus a big favour, he's not above resorting to blackmail to get her to go along with his plans. But Rose's sparkling personality and fun demeanor endear themselves to Marcus more than he ever expected. His plan is backfiring, because all of a sudden it's his heart that's getting played. When the truth is revealed, will Marcus realize that Rose is the real prize all along?First of all, kudos to the Cover Gods for picking a perfect Marcus for the cover. That man, his expression, is Marcus to a T. He's a no nonsense businessman, determined to prove to his father that he has the business acumen and the intelligence to make something of himself and he's worked hard to create the successful advertising firm that he now has. I loved his character as this staid, serious, somewhat disgruntled man. The meet cute with Rose (which I won't spoil here) was hilarious and I laughed out loud at the unique premise. She's a disaster for him, all bright colours, witty comebacks, big smiles and enthusiasm. She's a vegetarian and East Indian, a woman who fosters abandoned dogs and works for an environmental agency - the complete opposite of his high society wealthy family. In other words, she's the perfect woman to show his father that he can take his plans for him and shove them where the sun doesn't shine. Rose agrees to Marcus's plan reluctantly (though she hasn't much choice) and even though it's obvious that Marcus's father is not a fan of hers, she handles herself with poise and dignity and makes a positive impression on the rest of his family - so positive in fact that Marcus inadvertently finds himself telling them that they're engaged to be married - much to Rose's surprise. A fake girlfriend was all he had intended - now he's got a fake fiance! This causes a bit of a problem for Rose too - she's been trying to find the right guy for her (as she's decided it's time for marriage and a family if she can find 'the one') and Thursdays are her online dating matchup nights (lately a new guy every week, as they just haven't been working out). Being engaged to Marcus is definitely going to put a crimp in those plans.But with a fake fiance comes a sudden perk - the chance to explore the attraction that's simmering between them. After all, a few public displays of affection aren't out of place since they are having a whirlwind courtship. But when those PDA's turn into private moments, the steamy heat between them sizzles and though they may be opposite in character, in bed they are a perfect match. I loved these scenes too, filled with humour and sexy goodness. But of course, when the truth comes out, Marcus screws everything up (well, someone has to), and his determination to keep his emotions out of the game is the opposite of Rose, who has gone all in with her heart, even knowing Marcus's views on love and marriage. I loved seeing his vulnerability as he comes to terms with how he really feels. It was great to see Dax and Jack (heroes from the previous two 49th floor stories, equally as entertaining as this one) give Marcus some timely advice (and berate him for his bonehead moves) - I love the bromance in these types of stories, the camaraderie between male friends (who speak the unvarnished truth) always makes for a good laugh. This story had me highly entertained from the get go and rooting for Marcus and Rose to get their happy ever after which of course they do . 5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27WOK63QS4S0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151UPU2G#wasThisHelpful","R27WOK63QS4S0S","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this brand new series from author Erica Monroe, love blossoms in unexpected places as spymaster James uncovers the secrets of his brother's governess Vivian. Suspicious of her behaviour in his family's home, it doesn't take long for her to share with James that she's on a mission to track down her brother's killer, a mission that it turns out is in vain when she discovers that  she's been coerced into spying on her employer for the perpetrator himself. With her life in danger, James' solution is simple - a marriage of convenience in which she'll get his protection and he'll have an excuse to attend London soirees on the arm of his wife, thus giving him a chance to tune his spymaster ears into the latest news while avoiding society matrons wanting them to wed their daughters. But with a killer after them, will the newlyweds find wedded bliss only to see it disappear?This is a new style of historical romance story for this author, who has previously published the Rookery Rogues series (not yet finished) which showcased heroes and heroines from the poorer sides of London. That series is one of my favourites in the historical romance genre so I was eager to see what she could do with the spy theme, definitely a popular subgenre.  I found that this story was less intense than the other series but still an entertaining read. James and Vivian were both likable characters who've experienced the death of a family member under horrible circumstances. James' entire family is in the spy business, working for England to undermine Napoleon's rule and his sister Louisa met an untimely death on one of her forays. James' guilt over sending her out into the field has never left him, despite knowing that she was aware of the risks in her ventures, as any good spy is.  As a result, when he first discovers that Vivian is being duplicitous  and the reasons for it, his instinct is to come to her aid and the best way to do that, and solve his own marital problem is to offer her marriage. There is no doubt that they are attracted to each other (though they had both taken pains not to reveal this due to their positions) so they will be compatible that way. Their romance is a slow burn, and it's not until the second half of the story, once they are married that the scenes between them get steamy.  Vivian comes across as an empathetic character, a woman who deeply feels the loss of her brother and is desperate to find his killer. When she's offered the chance to spy on James family in order to learn more about what happened to him, she feels caught between a rock and a hard place, but ultimately chooses her brother over any other loyalty. But when she is unable to discover the information that the man who first approached her wants, the threats turn ugly and turning to James is the only answer for her. Luckily, she finds in him the man who is the answer to her prayers - someone who will not only help her find her brother's killer, but also teach her how to defend herself, as now that she's marrying into a spy family, she is going to need to have those skills. And on top of that, she'll have a strong, supportive man in her life, one who quickly becomes dear to her. The second half of the story has most of the action and intensity, and builds up to the final conflict, but never fear, James and Vivian get their happy ending. This story moves along smoothly at a good pace, and contained interesting characters, also introducing James's sisters who will have stories of their own in the series. I'm looking forward to the next one! 3.5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SZ682A6JR9LV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0113CZUTE#wasThisHelpful","R3SZ682A6JR9LV","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a really great story about two gay men who were college roommates but never pursued a relationship with each other at the time. 5 years later, Clark has returned from his overseas education and is hoping to reconnect with Bryce, who would have been willing to be with Clark if Clark hadn't rejected him, not wanting at the time to start something that would end up as a long distance relationship. Bryce felt that rejection keenly and their friendship going forward had been and still is strained.Everything about this story was enjoyable - the cosplay of the main characters as super heroes at a comic convention, the fraught tension between them as they acknowledge the mistakes of their past and the slow and steady re-introduction to their feelings for each other. The sex scenes are steamy and emotional, and I loved their reconnection as friends too. They are both openly gay, and have had relationships with others during their absence from each other, but they both acknowledge finally that they love each other. It was a really sweet and touching love story, a quick read but one with a lot of emotion and heart.

"This second story in the sexy BDSM Club series The Player's Club (all standalone) features Paige and Sawyer. Two years ago they were dating and enjoying what seemed to be a promising relationship -until the night of Paige's birthday when Sawyer ended up in Paige's sister Ashley's bed and broke her heart. Five days later he left on his military engagement and has only recently returned. When her friend Raina gives her a one night pass to the club, Paige is determined to use it wisely and find someone to give her the pleasure she's been missing since the break up. Only, Sawyer is a regular at the club, and when he sees Paige, he's determined to get her to give him a second chance. But one night of hot sex isn't enough to restore Paige's trust and Sawyer's going to have to work hard to convince her that what happened in the past won't ever happen again. Can something that's been broken be restored?I really enjoyed this story! After reading the first one in the series, I put this immediately on my to-read list, as I liked the premise, the Player's Club being about to my tastes in terms of the sexuality of the club (nothing too fetishy, more into the bondage and D/s parts of BDSM). Though the initial part of the story takes place in the club as Paige and Sawyer reconnect, the majority of the story is outside of it, as Sawyer tries to get to the bottom of what really happened the night of Paige's birthday and to show Paige that he's not the cheating man that she thinks he is. I really liked Sawyer's character. He's an alpha male, a Dom for sure, but he has a really sweet and tender side (aren't they the best kind of alpha males!) and he goes to a lot of effort to make Paige feel wanted and cherished for who she is.  Paige is a lovely, bright and talented woman who makes beautiful corsets for a living. But she has self esteem issues, stemming from her past relationships with men that never worked out right, and her fractious relationship with her sister Ashley, a vindictive and bitter woman. Ashley is the source of conflict in the story, the woman who never lets a moment go by where she doesn't demean Paige in some way. It was wonderful to see Paige finally standing up for herself, not letting Ashley deter her from what she wants, and finding ways to get around Ashley's attempts to sabotage bother her personal and her business life. Truthfully, there were times in the story where I just wanted to throttle Ashley (I'm sure this is the author's intent!) but in the end, Paige and Sawyer are able to get their happy ever after.Of course the story, being set with a BDSM theme has lots of sexy and hot scenes throughout, and the chemistry between Paige and Sawyer is easy to see. But the characters make the story too, and the dynamic between the two of them was fun to read. This is another great addition to the series. 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8ICJOFPMBCLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940165156#wasThisHelpful","R8ICJOFPMBCLA","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TwistedThe roller coaster ride of sex, drugs and rock and roll continues with this latest entry in the Lost in Oblivion series. Though it could be read as a standalone, it does rely significantly on past events from the prequel novel Seduced (though these are explained to new readers). This story features Jazz and Gray. From the time that Jazz entered Gray's home as a teenage foster child, he's loved and protected her. And when those feelings became more intense for him, he acceded to her wishes and kept things platonic. But now that they are all grown up, partners in the band Oblivion and ready to admit their feelings for each other, things seem to be spiraling out of control. After all this time, will their love for each other just not be enough?I found this story to be equally as riveting as the ones that have come before it. I really enjoyed how the story was told from the point of view of both main characters. As well, giving us glimpses back in time of Jazz and Gray's history and what has led to their current circumstances adds a rich emotional feel to the tale. Jazz is a somewhat contradictory character - vulnerable and innocent in some things but desperate to have Gray see her as a woman and not a girl anymore. She's a spitfire in word and deed now and when she decides to go after Gray she does it with her whole heart. Gray on the other hand is a stoic and increasingly tragic figure in the first part of the story as he struggles with his drug addiction. The more he turns towards this dark path the more he feels unfit for Jazz. When the turning point in the story is reached there is still the feeling of a long road to redemption, but one the reader feels Gray deserves. Naturally the sex scenes are smoking hot as one has come to expect from these authors, and the intensity of them is ratcheted up by the real feelings Gray and Jazz have for each other. Throughout the course of the story we are also given more hints and peaks into the other character's heads as they all strive for their happy endings. It continues to be a wild ride! 5 stars!UntwistedThis was a great addition to the Oblivion series, and a wonderful check-in with all the characters, and in particular with Jazz and Gray from Twisted. This isn't intended as a standalone, so on the assumption that readers have read the earlier books in the series, it was nice to see Jazz and Gray continuing their sexy and exciting relationship. The sex scenes are steamy (as expected)and featuring both points of view, we get a totally smitten Gray who adores his pregnant soon-to-be wife and Jazz being Jazz - sweet, strong, and reconnecting with her baby sister. There are a couple of hints for the upcoming stories and I can't wait for the series to continue.

"This sexy menage story takes place in a small Texan town, the kind where everyone knows everyone else's business, and the home town football team is the Friday night attraction. Several of the team's older players have returned to honor their Coach, a man who recently had a heart attack, scaring many of his beloved players. Colt is one of those, but he's got other things in town that hold his interest, namely his ex-wife's best friend Paige. When his ex remarries ( yep, she marries his brother, it's a long story - but you can catch up by reading Going Long), he is truly happy for them as his own marriage to her was a mistake, though it doesn't stop him from over-imbibing the night of the wedding with all the sympathetic looks coming his way. Ending up in the back of Paige's truck, a call to his best friend Drake has the three of them staying over at Paige's place, and surprisingly, in a hot and sexy 3-way one night stand. Only, after the first night, Drake and Colt and Paige aren't so eager to put things in the past and a secret relationship ensues, one where sex rules, but feelings are there just under the surface. While Drake is content with his bisexuality and happy to have the chance to be with Colt even if it's only going to be with Paige in the middle, Colt finds that his attraction to his best friend is a problem, one he never expected. It's a conundrum to be sure, but one that will either result in a happy future for the three of them or three broken hearts.There were lots of emotions tied up in this story and each of the three main characters involved had their own reasons for wanting to be part of this unique relationship. For Paige, it's an eye-opening experience - to be worshiped by two men, men whom she's joked around with, flirted with, but never really saw that they held a deep attraction for her until they took things over the line. They are not shy to tell her what they think of her, and she basks in their adulation, something that she's never had before. It would be hard to turn that down, and even though she has some guilt over being involved with her best friend's ex-husband, she's right to remember (and be reminded by other friends) that that ship has sailed, her friend is happily remarried and shouldn't begrudge her this chance at her own happiness. Of course this doesn't mean there isn't any conflict with her friend, but it doesn't take over the story.For Drake, who is the more level headed, even tempered of the bunch, it's a chance to show his best friend Colt that the feelings he has for him are more than friendly. They've shared women in the past and on one particular occasion, things between the two men got a little more handsy than Colt expected - something that caused Colt to back off and keep his distance. And Drake let him, not wanting to ruin their friendship. Only now with Paige, the three of them are forming something that can't be easily explained away and Drake has a second chance to show Colt that his feelings for him are open to becoming more than just friends. I really liked Drake's character, his understanding and patience with Colt and his sweetness with Paige.And so it is Colt that is the most conflicted on two main fronts. Firstly, he's attracted to Paige but being his ex-wife's best friend means she should be off limits. Right? Well, so he tries to convince himself, and has succeeded until now. Yet he knows that his ex chose his brother, and is happy with him, which means she should keep her nose out of his love life. Secondly of course, and more interestingly in the context of the threesome is his long denied attraction to his friend Drake. He knows Drake is bisexual, he's known it all along and it's never bothered him. Yet now, he can see that Drake wants more from him than he's willing to give. Or maybe not. He's quite the confused individual as he comes to terms with aspects of his own sexuality that he never considered before. Guilt is the strong one here, and it's going to take the love of Paige and Drake to help him overcome it and not ruin the best thing that's happened to him in a long time.Of course we can't have a menage story without some hot sex, and it's present here in spades. Both Drake and Colt can be rather demanding in the bedroom (much to Paige's delight) yet it's never demeaning and they take care with her. They treat her as the beautiful, loving woman that she is, and the sex scenes are steamy yet tender too. When Drake and Colt begin to play with their own attraction, it turns Paige on as much as having their attention on her.There are lots of secondary characters, as this story is part of a series that will feature several different relationships in the town of Quinn, Texas., some of which have already been released and some which are yet to come. Each story in the series is written as a standalone and can easily be read independent of the others, but it's quite fun to revisit characters from the other stories if you've read them already. This one is a fun and sexy read with the underlying conflicts giving the story some emotional twists and turns. 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIXNEK4T87A9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011CJ92F6#wasThisHelpful","RIXNEK4T87A9Q","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this sexy menage story, Joel and Oakley have had their eye on Sadie for a long time and she knows it. But she's been reluctant to choose between them so it's been a platonic friendship, up until the night of a friend's wedding when desire takes over and the three of them enjoy some sizzling time together. But a one night stand isn't enough for any of them. Sticking to a fling might seem good at the start but when deeper feelings come into play, they're all going to have to decide whether a future together is in the playbook for them.In this small town of Quinn, there sure are a lot of shenanigans going on! This one plays a bit more on the theme of 'what will the neighbors think!', in particular for Joel. He comes from a religious background and worries about what his new and decidedly unwanted feelings for Oakley, his best friend, mean both to him, and how they'll affect his relationship with his mother, a staid and upright church going community member. Oakley is the laid back type, quite used to being disapproved of, quite happy being bisexual and given this opportunity to show his friend how he really feels about him means he isn't going to back down from the truth. I really liked him, he was a funny, friendly man and gave the story the elements of humour it needed to counter the seriousness of Joel. Sadie on the other hand doesn't worry so much about what others will think of her unorthodox relationship if it comes out. Instead, her misgivings relate to the abandonment she experienced as a child, and her trust issues as a result. Loving Joel and Oakley means she could get hurt, and it's a calculated risk, one she needs to be convinced is the right one. Lucky for her, both Joel and Oakley set about pulling down her walls, one steamy scene at a time. With Oakley the steady hand, and Joel and Sadie twisting in indecision, the plot moves smoothly to an eventual happy ending for the trio. 4 stars for an enjoyable and thoughtful story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EI5SE2SBGRFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010YH423Y#wasThisHelpful","R1EI5SE2SBGRFL","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Carter found the woman of his dreams - but when his best friend was interested in her too, he backed off and let them have a relationship, figuring that with his past, his friend Garrett would be a better bet as a husband for Lacey. Remaining good friends with both of them, things started to heat up as the attraction between Carter and Lacey never waned and the three of them shared a passionate night together at Garrett and Lacey's invitation, one that left Carter reeling and uncertain of what to do next when Garrett approached him to consider making things more permanent. Then Garrett died tragically in an accident. Six months went by in which Carter and Lacey had no contact, grieving Garrett's loss alone. When Lacey decided it was time to move forward, she was ready to do it with Carter, and comes to his home town to find him and show him that she's ready for a future with him, and only him. Will Carter be able to put the past behind them and commit to the woman he fell in love with at first sight?When is a menage not a menage? Well, when one of the threesome dies tragically and leaves two behind, as is the case in this story. Except that Garrett's presence is still being felt in the decisions that are made, his love for Lacey and for Carter impacting them even now as they try to go on without him and navigate a future that was never supposed to be like this, but is. While Carter was trying to grapple with how a permanent menage relationship would work between them, especially when Garrett's feelings for him were romantic and sexual in nature while Carter's were only platonic, Garrett upped and died on him, leaving him with only 'what if' scenarios and a grieving woman who Carter loves as much as Garrett did. And he doesn't feel any better prepared now to marry Lacey and provide for her then he did back then, his father's failed relationships impacting his own present ones. He worries so much about obsessing over a woman that he doesn't believe he can have a mature relationship with Lacey that won't lead to obsession, even though in reality he doesn't show signs of the compulsive nature that has driven his father. I really liked Carter and I felt a lot of empathy for him as he navigates grief and his feelings of guilt over not returning Garrett's overtures and wasting the time they could have had together before he died. Lacey has had an equally difficult time of it, not the least of which being Carter cutting her off after Garrett died and the confusion and heartache that came with that. But she's determined to show him that he's good enough for her, and that she wants him back in her life again. The two of them together definitely had smoking hot chemistry and their love scenes are steamy and emotional. In fact the whole story is a mix of emotions - combining the heartache of loss, with the confusion and guilt of wanting something you shouldn't and the joy and happiness of finding love. I really enjoyed the story overall and felt it had a very realistic tone. Definitely worth the read. 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYAB7MYX4ULKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0118FIX3Q#wasThisHelpful","RYAB7MYX4ULKL","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lovely and heartwarming second chance romance is the story of Reese and Trent. With a whirlwind courtship and marriage between them, the young couple moved from the small town of Rockwell Island to the big city of New York. But workaholic Trent's drive for success and Reese's inability to adapt to city life resulted in her making a heartbreaking decision after only six months together, to leave Trent and head back home to familiar territory. Though Trent tried to convince Reese to come back, the truth was that his workaholic attitude hadn't changed and Reese knew this and stayed strong in her conviction that their marriage would not work. Now ten years have passed, and Trent is back home, taking over his grandfather's resort, and realizing what a fool he's been to have let Reese slip through his fingers without a fight. Given a second chance to make things right, can he convince Reese that she can place her trust in him again?The setting of this story, the beautiful island and its lush scenery are well described and it's easy to fall in love with this place of gentle breezes and friendly faces. The characters are typical of a small town romance - close knit families (with the occasional crotchety grandparent, at least in Trent's case), supportive friends, and of course handsome men and beautiful women. Reese is a lovely, quiet woman, a successful painter and her character was very likable. She's never gotten over Trent despite her best efforts, and seeing him again brings back all the desire and love she had for him (and still has) though it is tinged with the hurt and regret over her failed marriage. Trent has changed though, being back on the island helping him to realize what he's missed during his years as a successful lawyer, a success that seems hollow in the face of what he's lost. He's a changed man here, and he's realized that his future lies with Reese, if she'll consider taking him back. While Reese is easily persuaded to share herself with Trent physically, emotionally she struggles to keep herself from falling all over again, worried that when his project here is finished, he'll leave her and head back to the city. It takes a concerted effort on Trent's part to show Reese that she's now his number one priority. Their love scenes are plentiful, sensual and emotional as their bodies tell what their hearts really feel. There is minimal angst in the story, and the conflict is all internal on Reese's part as she's the one who has to decide whether to give Trent a second chance. I appreciated that she was able to take some of the blame for her failed marriage, realizing that it was not all one sided and that she made decisions in New York that didn't support their partnership too. After reading several angst laden stories recently, this one is just a simple, flowing, sweet (with a good dollop of sexy) romance. 3.5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJWEI3NFO6DP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015TD9LTS#wasThisHelpful","RJWEI3NFO6DP5","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This sexy and fun romance (a re-release of a story first published in 2009) is the story of Allison and Seth. When they meet in an online gaming forum, it's all fun and games - until they discover inadvertently that they are both professors at the same school and are playing the game for research purposes (though truthfully they are having a pretty fun time doing it). Given the chance to meet up in real life, can they take the relationship they've built online and turn it into the real deal?I loved this story! This is the first novel I've read where both characters are into online gaming in a really hard core way, and the descriptions of the gaming and their online interactions felt very realistic. Allison's psychology research involves discerning truth telling in online chats and she's searching for clues from her anonymous participants in how they 'talk' online since she isn't able to get the normal visual clues that indicate if someone is telling the truth. She's always thought that the man with the screen name ""Notmyrealname"" (ha!) came across as an honest individual. Seth on the other hand is studying economics in relation to game playing. Meeting up in person means they won't be able to use each other in their research as the anonymity will be lost, but they get one better - the chance to meet in person someone they've interacted with online, and discover that they have quite the attraction to each other. Allison is more reserved than Seth, and when their computer chatting turns intimate, she surprises herself by jumping head first into an affair (electronic at the start) with a man she hardly knows. But Seth is patient and sweet and generous and she soon discovers that a real relationship with him is better than any she's ever had before. Allison has trust issues, ones that make it easier for her to be more free in the privacy of her home than in person. But Seth takes care to make Allison feel at ease. He comes across as a genuinely nice, friendly and caring person, and I really liked his character. They share some pretty steamy scenes together both online and off, and I swear, their chat scene where they re-enact what it would have been like if they'd been making out as teenagers was spot on.There are some very interesting secondary characters in the story as well (Seth's brother Drew and Allison's cousin Tess in particular) whose stories I'm looking forward to reading in other books in the series. There is a sweet and satisfying ending to the story, and I really enjoyed everything about it. A unique, sexy romance, and one I had a hard time putting down once I started reading. 4.5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OJCL69RL4U3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153EVO0C#wasThisHelpful","R1OJCL69RL4U3L","A2A1GRZL896QTF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A1GRZL896QTF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love these things and for the price, you can't go wrong!  Now here's the catch: It's all about the knife you have IN these things.  I use the Fat Daddio's 14"" cake slicing knife.  I attached pics to this review so you could see.  In any case, you press the button on top of the little plastic thing and insert one side of your knife in there.  Then you repeat it with the other end of the blade with the other plastic thing.  Use these on a very smooth, level surface (you can see how smooth my counter is in the pictures) and then they will glide very easily.  I like how there are a few slots so you can adjust where you want to slice your cake (to what thickness).  When I use the 14"" Fat Daddio's cake slicing knife and put the plastic things all the way to the ends, I can cut up to a 12"" cake.

"I have been buying and eating Quest bars since I was first introduced to them in November 2013.  Quite frankly, I love them.  However, there are a few flavors that taste NOTHING like the title indicates.  Pumpkin pie one being one of them. (Their S'Mores bar is guilty of this too). Now with that said, I REALLY LIKE this bar.  It doesn't taste like pumpkin, but it's sweet and I like sweet.  I honestly can't put my finger on WHAT it tastes like, but it's good.  I like the crunchies on top and I really like the thick coating.  It reminds me of a candy bar.  As one reviewer mentioned about the changing of a key ingredient, this may be why their flavors are so off now.  In any case, I will continue to buy this new pumpkin flavor because it tastes like dessert to me!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO4Q30756AL8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014WS4S9E#wasThisHelpful","RO4Q30756AL8K","A3PE1N4QQXR33D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PE1N4QQXR33D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I couldn't wait to try this, and then I couldn't wait to review it!  I need to start by saying this:  YOU WILL NOT regret this purchase!  This is the most amazing Vanilla I've ever tried!  So I emailed Rodelle and asked them what the difference was between their Gourmet Vanilla and their Pure Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla.  This is what they replied to me with:  ""Our Pure Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla Extract is made just with Vanilla Beans from Madagascar. These beans give you the very traditional vanilla flavor that we are all used to.  It contains no sugar.  Vanilla beans can only grow in certain places, and another good location is Uganda.  But when you take the Bourbon variety of bean to Uganda it takes on a slightly different flavor. So when we make a Vanilla with those beans and blend in Madagascar beans, we call it the Gourmet Blend.  Traditional Vanillas used to add a little sugar, and we do to this one too so it has a slightly sweeter flavor like old time traditional Vanilla"".  This Vanilla has made all the difference in my chocolate chip cookies!  I researched vanilla beans from Uganda and found this on Beanilla.com:  'Vanilla beans from Uganda have tones of milk-chocolate. The flavor is very bold as these vanilla beans produce a very high amount of vanillin, making them perfect for rich desserts and chocolates'.

"Artemisia Gentileschi's painting ""Judith Slaying Holofernes"" (1620) is on loan from the Uffizi Gallery in Florence to The Art Institute  of Chicago and on exhibit there from October 2013 to January 2014.  Eve Straussman-Pflanzer, a former AIC curator and currently Senior Curator of Collections at the Davis Museum at Wellesley College, arranged the exhibition and wrote this accompanying essay.  The corrective realignment of art history that has occurred under the aegis of a generation or so of feminist-oriented scholarship has made this image one of the most familiar created by a woman artist of the past.  But to see it in the context of this exhibition is to realize anew how uniquely, and literally, ""bloody shocking"" it is.  The story of Holofernes's fatal encounter with the Jewish heroine was a common one in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but the great majority of visual interpretations of the event, as one can see from the excellent illustrations in Dr. Straussman-Pflanzer's essay, are post-facto, so to speak,  presenting Judith ""with the head of"" Holofernes, and they are generally titled something to that effect.  These range from Lucas Cranach the Elder (c. 1545) to Felice Ficharelli (c. 1665) and include other pictures by Artemisia herself and by her father, Orazio, and the well known images of Cristofano Allori (c. 1616) and Sandro Botticelli, whose Judith is not even touching Holofernes's head but seems simply out for a leisurely stroll with her maidservant, cutting twigs on the way back to Bethulia (c. 1470).  Artemisia's painting, though, comes right from Caravaggio's blood-letting scene (c. 1599)  and even outdoes it in the graphically arcing spurts of blood splashing on her arms and breast and pearling out even to simulate a strand of beads just above the cameo bracelet on her proper left arm.  The most unkindest cut of all: the victim's blood becomes decoration to the hand that slays him.  No wonder it was too much for the Medici Duchesses and that in the long run Artemisia could find no permanent patronage in Florence.  All of this is very ably discussed by the author, who mentions, but does not elaborate on, the psychological interpretations of the visceral violence of Artemisia's depiction as a precipitate of her notorious rape.  This is a quite brief consideration of a very important painting, and it is very good in having brought so much material into so small a compass.  Touching as it does on Artemisia's early reception of Carravagesque naturalism and placing her in the context of early modern European painting and the political environment of the Florentine court, it provides a succinct and informative background to the painting.  It is also up-to-date in considering some letters only recently revealed that cast a light on an unusual extra-marital arrangement that may have facilitated her career.  There are seventeen illustrations, seven full-page, all crisp and in excellent color; a selected bibliography; and a checklist of the exhibition, which featured several pieces not reproduced here.  It is quite convenient to have this material gathered together; overall, a useful and very nicely produced little study.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DZ2ANB1RHW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300186797#wasThisHelpful","R1DZ2ANB1RHW5","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This catalogue accompanies the exhibition at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco from November 2013 to February 2014 and then at the National Academy Museum in New York from February to May 2014.  Although represented in most of our major museums, Zorn has not been particularly well known in this country, even though he was as sought-after and successful here as any of his competitors in the Gilded Age, including John Singer Sargent and Giovanni Boldini.  But now, within the space of a year, we have had two major presentations of his work accompanied by two very good catalogues, and we are fortunate that the exhibitions/books complement each other so well.  The first, at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in early 2013 (see the reviews on this site) focussed on the deep-pocketed patronage of Mrs. Gardner and her extensive social circle, which gave an immediate impetus to Zorn's career from the moment he first set foot on American soil in 1893 and proved invaluable to the advancement of his career for the rest of his life.  The relatively narrow concentration of that catalogue allowed it to present a good deal of interesting material of a biographical and social nature, such as contemporary photographs of his models, of other figures involved and of the interiors in which Zorn's paintings were hung and a good (in fact, the first published) selection of Zorn's correspondence with Mrs. Gardner.There is much less of that in this San Francisco (SF) volume, which, on the other hand, is not circumscribed by its attention to the artist's Boston connections and so is more comprehensive in its reach.  It includes, for example, more of the society portraits for which he was so highly sought (and highly compensated) and more of the etchings for which he was less well known but at which he was apparently equally prodigious.  These are discussed in a special essay by James A. Ganz, who is Curator of the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts in the San Francisco museums, and who recently curated their wonderful ""Rembrandt's Century"" exhibition and wrote the accompanying catalogue (see the review).  Dr. Ganz's essay is the only one in the SF volume which concerns itself much with aesthetic and technical matters. The other three essays are more biographical or broadly comparative: Johan Cederlund, Director of the Zorn Collections in Sweden, who curated the exhibition, writes a general life-and-works introduction; and there is an essay on Zorn in America and one on the artist in his Nordic context, both by prominent Swedish scholars--these are all completely authoritative (and very smoothly translated from the Swedish) but not very searching in their artistic analysis. In that respect, the Gardner volume does a better job: the essays are by and large more analytical, and each catalogue item receives signed work-specific commentary from one of the exhibition's curators.The SF volume contains more catalogue entries, and it is also larger in size, so that the reproductions--of which there are eighty-five in full color and in full-page or double-page format--are also larger.  (The Gardner has more, and possibly more pertinently chosen, supportive illustrations.)  As far as clarity and color of the reproductions go, I think it's a toss-up:  the SF portraits seem to pick up more highlights and the silky sheen of fabrics, but the color in the Gardner's landscapes and bathing scenes is truer, and the images seem generally a bit sharper.  The Gardner has a better selected bibliography; the SF a more detailed chronology.  A previous reviewer advised those who can have only one of these catalogues to go for the SF, but for me the Gardner has a slight edge--not by much--and fortunately it's not a contest.  Best of all, of course, would be to have both; it's not as if there were already too much about Anders Zorn in English.  If there is more to come, it will be a very fortuitous upshot of these two back-to-back exhibitions and catalogues, which have allowed him to (re-)emerge from an undeserved obscurity and to be recognized as the major artist he is, effortlessly the peer of his better known and more acclaimed colleagues.  In any case, we should have more Zorn if only because--to repeat the blunt words of one of his fellow pupils at the Stockholm Art Academy--""It is so damned good"" (11).","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31NO14Y3SCKWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0847841510#wasThisHelpful","R31NO14Y3SCKWT","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the catalogue accompanying the exhibition of the same name at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from October 2013 until February 2014 and subsequently at the Museo Correr in Venice from February until June 2014.  It is a very comprehensive and broadly contextualized examination of Léger's iconic painting ""The City"" (1919) and of his work and that of his artistic colleagues and collaborators in the following decade.  Drawing on loans from some fifty collections, it brings together an almost bewildering array of images ranging from easel and mural painting, architectural painting, book design, typography and journal illustration, set and costume design for theater, film and ballet, poster art and sculpture and just about everything else an artist could find to stick his nose into in the aesthetic ferment of Paris in the '20's.  It is lavishly illustrated by almost three hundred plates (including some of objects that were not in the exhibition) and about fifty further illustrations of all kinds of works, photographs and even film stills.  Many of these, especially the better known and larger paintings, are reproduced on full pages while others, mostly physically smaller objects like journal illustrations and studies for the larger works, are presented in smaller formats.  The actual size of the reproductions is not so important here as it is in painting that depends for its appreciation on matters of finish like, say, the brushwork on impasted surfaces; here, where the energies of the images result largely from the contrast and juxtaposition of elements of geometrical abstraction, what is more important are color and clarity.  Color is at the heart of Léger's work--""It was in me, this need for colors,"" he is quoted as explaining in one of the transcribed interviews (112)--and that need is done full justice here in what is certainly one of the most riotously colorful catalogues published recently (the cover illustration is a detail from ""The City""). Many of Léger's artistic projects in the '20's were by nature joint efforts, and there is a very generous sampling of representative works from some his collaborators: paintings of Delaunay, Duchamps, Mondrian, Picasso, Lissitzky, and Oxenfant, architectural renderings of van Doesburg and Corbusier, posters of Picabia and Tristan Tzara, sculptures of Lipchitz and Archipenko.This wide variety of material is put into context by a comprehensive introductory essay by Anna Vallye, who curated the exhibition and edited the catalogue.  In it, she illuminates the theoretical bases of Léger's art in his notions of ""realism"" and the ""law of contrasts"" and the influence on them from his relationships with figures like Apollinaire and Blaise Cendrars, and summarizes his work in painting, theater, film, and architecture and his relationship with some contemporary artistic movements like Dada and De Stijl.  The book is divided into four thematic sections corresponding to Léger's major artistic interests: first is ""La Ville,"" i.e., the creation and reception of the painting and the avant-garde environment of the time--this is apparently the first time that all of the studies for the painting have been brought together.  Then come ""Publicity,"" treating his work in advertisements and printed matter; ""Spectacle,"" dealing with entertainment and performance; and ""Space,"" reflecting his interests in the urban environment (the street) and architecture.  Each section is introduced by an annotated essay by one of the contributing curators and presents historical documents, most of them translated into English for the first time; these are either interviews with Léger or critiques and reflections by other artists about him and his work, or brief commentaries by Léger himself (""On Charlie Chaplin,"" ""Color in Life,"" etc.). There is a very wide panorama of images, many of which are not referenced in the texts but provided simply for the reader's contemplation and comparison.  Léger said of ""The City"" that it was one of his works that bound to itself much of the other art that he produced in its aura, and this volume is testimony to the expansive circumference of the sphere that can be drawn around all that productivity.  It is an impressive body, and the catalogue has done an impressive job of marshaling an almost dizzying diversity into a coherent narrative of the artist's engagement with so many different media.  The volume closes with a checklist of the exhibition with curatorial data and a selected bibliography of works by and about Léger.  There is no index of any sort, which is a disadvantage in a book as widely ranging as this, and the sectional arrangement of the plates causes the reader much inconvenience in trying to locate any given one, but these are not sufficient reasons not to recommend the book quite highly; it is about as comprehensive a treatment of its subject as one could want.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE1YMHZHMNCG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300197667#wasThisHelpful","RE1YMHZHMNCG9","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"People who are particularly interested in examining Van Gogh's artistic techniques are having something of a heyday at the moment.  There is, first, the large and comprehensive exhibition currently at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, ""Van Gogh at Work"" (see the reviews on this website), and, second, the book under review here is the catalogue accompanying the  current exhibition at the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. (from October 2013 until January 2014 and then at the Cleveland Museum of Art from March until May 2014).  The impetus for this exhibition came from the idea of bringing together two canvases with the same subject that Van Gogh worked on in November and December 1889: Cleveland's ""The Large Plane Trees"" and The Phillips's ""The Road Menders"" (the jacket illustration shows details of these two paintings, l. and r.).  These are what Van Gogh and other artists and art historians refer to as ""repetitions,"" i.e., more or less faithful recreations of the same subject--as distinct from other kinds of copies.  The creation of repetitions was quite common in the nineteenth century; they were considered to be as original and autonomous as the initial creations and were held in equally high esteem.  Van Gogh painted at least a couple of  dozen of such series, and this exhibition draws on the collections of over twenty-five lenders to bring some of them together.  It is an excellent way to query and illuminate Van Gogh's techniques and to appreciate the amount of industry, planning and rational thought that went into Vincent's art.  This is, in part, consciously conceived as a corrective to the common view that his procedures were akin to the ""blinding simple-mindedness of a child,"" to use the words of Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith in their recent biography of the painter.  In the first of his introductory essays, ""The Artist Versus the Legend: Repetitions and Madness,"" Theodore H. Robinson, the Curator of Modern Art at the Cleveland Museum and co-editor of the catalogue, uses that Naifeh/Smith quotation as an epigraph, and then demonstrates that Vincent's procedures were anything but blind or simple-minded and have nothing whatever to do with madness. That and Dr. Robinson's second essay, on the origins and development of the repetitions, set the theoretical and historical framework for the analysis of the series that follows.The repetitions themselves are discussed in the catalogue ""entries,"" arranged chronologically from the early ""Weavers"" (December 1883 to August 1884) and ""Le Moulin de la Galette""  (October 1886) to the better known series done during and after Vincent's residence in Arles, e.g., the postman Joseph Roulin and his family, including the ""Berceuse"" paintings of Mme. Roulin, the ""L'Arlesienne"" after the drawing of Gauguin, etc.  There are eleven of these ""entries,"" each discussed by one or more of the contributing curators, including Eliza Rathbone, who is Chief Curator at The Phillips, with technical data contributed by the museums' conservators.  It is quite fascinating to see these versions juxtaposed so closely and to observe the sometimes minute and sometimes quite considerable variations and to follow the curators' arguments as to the sequencing  of the canvases--usually not very easy and sometimes not even possible to establish.  The thirty-one catalogue plates and ninety-two accompanying illustrations (many of which are reproduced full-page, as are all the plates) are integrated with the discussions, so that text and illustration are never very far apart and it is very easy to compare the paintings.  Our understanding of the variations among the repetitions is enhanced not only by the frequent detail illustrations but also by devices like digital overlay of the major outlines of one painting over another to indicate changes in size and shape.  The technical information provided for each group is copious and probably more than enough for all but the most ardent fans of x-ray florescence, x-radiography and similar analyses, but it is that kind of technical examination that helps conservators to authenticate or de-authenticate questionable attributions, establish sequence, document technique, and do the many other things that contribute to our overall understanding of the paintings.  They are not for everybody, but ""the devil is in the details,"" and it is good that they are there; it is all brand-new information and will be especially welcome to art historians and scholars.  The final essay of the catalogue is by Marcia Steele and Elizabeth Steele, the chief conservators at the Phillips and Cleveland, resp., and deals with the various methods of making repetitions, such as tracing, squaring, using the perspective frame, etc.  The volume concludes with a checklist of the exhibition with full curatorial data, and an index.  There is no general bibliography, but the meticulous annotations in the essays provide specific bibliographical references.  In sum, this is a very welcome addition to the literature on Van Gogh, for it throws a much broader light on an aspect of his art that the ""Van Gogh at Work"" exhibition and catalogue was able to address only in passing and over only a couple of pages. It is the first exhibition and publication to focus specifically on Van Gogh's repetitions, and it has made clear that their creation was not accidental or haphazard, but an essential aspect of Van Gogh's aesthetic thought and an integral part of his artistic practice--an insight we owe to this very informative exhibition and its fine, very well produced and excellently illustrated catalogue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SYMMWURHFU5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300190824#wasThisHelpful","R3SYMMWURHFU5T","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the catalogue that accompanies the exhibition of Charles Marville's photographs at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D. C., from September 2013 until January 2014, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York from January 2014 until May, and then at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa from June until September.  It is a collaborative effort of those museums and commemorates the 200th anniversary of Marville's birth in 1813.  Although there were a couple of  shows of his works in Paris and New York around 1980, this exhibition has been put together from over twenty public and private collections and is the most comprehensive presentation of his works ever assembled.  Among the photographers we associate with nineteenth-century France--Le Gray, Le Secq, Atget, et. al.--Marville has been for some time the least well known, owing in part simply to a lack of information about him.  For example, it was only the intensive archival research undertaken for this project that revealed that ""Marville"" was in fact the assumed name of Charles-Francois Bossu.  This and other pertinent biographical information is woven into the general introduction by Sarah Kennel, an associate curator of photographs at the National Gallery, the principal organizer of the exposition, and the editor of the catalogue. This is a richly illustrated essay of about forty pages that traces Marville's life and work from his early artistic training and occupation as a commercial artist to his increasingly recognized work as an unofficial and quasi-official photographer who styled himself variously as ""Photographer of the Imperial Museum of The Louvre,"" ""Photographer of the National Museums,"" etc., and who was in fact commissioned to undertake public photographic assignments for the municipality as well as private projects for publishing houses, architects, and other institutions that were more and more discovering the usefulness of photographic documentation.  Having come to photography fairly early (1850), and working right up to his death in 1879, Marville's career was one of the longest among his colleagues, and the list of objects at which he pointed his camera is also long: churches, monuments, workmen's quarters and ateliers, monuments, and, principally, the landscapes and cityscapes for which he was best known, for he became both the official and unofficial documenter of the vast urban renewal projects decreed by Napoleon III, which in less than twenty years changed forever the face of the city.  Many of the photographs are of streets and squares slated for demolition and of the demolition work itself as well as of the newly constructed boulevards which replaced them, including items of modern ""street furniture"" like Morris columns, public urinals and the rows of specially designed lamp-posts intended to make Paris the ""city of light""; Marville made close to five hundred images of Paris in transformation.The exhibition presents 104 of Marville's photographs, representing all aspects of his work and stretching from his first known image (a shot of his lover and her sister from 1850) to one of his very last taken twenty-eight years later.  Each of these is excellently reproduced on a full page in the catalogue, and these reproductions are supported by about fifty companion illustrations in the four curatorial essays that follow the general introduction.There are also several two-page spreads of enlarged details. The essays discuss his work before the municipal commissions, his photographic project on the Bois de Boulogne (which resulted in a whole album), the ""old"" Paris (i.e., before the renewal works), and his contributions to the various ""Universal Expositions"" in London, Paris, Vienna, etc. These are all very well written and informative and take in both the social and political circumstances of his work and also its artistic context.  We learn for instance that Marville was both a practical innovator (he constructed the first portable negative holder and co-registered a patent for a twin-lens stereoscopic camera) and also an original artistic thinker (the first to create a real photographic series and to photograph the same scene in different seasons, the first to seriously photograph clouds, etc.).  The volume concludes with an extensive chronology of the artist, a selected bibliography including a list of books containing Marville's illustrations and a list of those with his photographs, a checklist of the exhibition with curatorial data, and a comprehensive index.  This is a book which should appeal to anyone interested in photography as cultural document or as art, in the visual representation of urban spaces, or in the nineteenth century, or simply in things French.  It is superbly produced and beautifully designed and printed; the pages are large, the print is generously sized and the lines generously spaced; it's a pleasure to read and to behold, and I can't recommend it more highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9DA6NN8O6K4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=022609278X#wasThisHelpful","R9DA6NN8O6K4O","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the catalogue that accompanies the exhibition of Balthus paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art from September 2013 to January 2014.  The exhibition itself was called ""Balthus: Cats and Girls--Paintings and Provocations.""  Sabine Rewald, the Gelman Curator for Modern Art at the museum and the foremost authority on Balthus, curated the exhibition and is the sole author of the catalogue.  She explains that the subtitle was added as an afterthought ""in acknowledgment that [Balthus's] paintings of adolescents might offend some viewers"" (vii). In light of the remarks posted here on October 26 (""Disgusted""), that seems not to have been a superfluous concern.  However, Ian Buruma has objected to the subtitle on the grounds that ""there is no evidence that Balthus painted adolescent girls, let alone cats, as provocations"" (""The New York Review of Books,"" November 7, 2013, p. 84).  That is not strictly true, as the aged painter acknowledged in retrospect.  Perhaps we shall simply have to leave it with Justice Stewart's conclusion that we know provocation when we see it and agree that everyone has a right to be offended by provocation--but no one has a right to ban it in order to protect his own sensibilities.In any case, this is the second Balthus exhibition catalogue that Dr. Rewald has written for the MMA (and in fact her third book on the artist).  The first exhibition, in 1984, was broader in scope and included more of Balthus's landscapes, cityscapes and still lifes.  In this show, she has focussed more on his early career--roughly from the mid-thirties to the fifties--and these are the years in which Balthus's obsession with his girl-and-cat paintings is especially prominent, when it becomes apparent that the subject of a girl poised between childhood and puberty is to become what the author calls his artistic ""leitmotif"" (8).  As to the two poles of these paintings, the girl and the cat, there is the obvious French and English common denominator in the vulgar associations surrounding ""chatte,"" ""pussy,"" etc., and Dr. Rewald calls appropriate attention to the historical connection between felines and feminine sexuality.  Her very well illustrated forty-five page essay preceding the catalogue traces this theme chronologically through Balthus's oeuvre, from the precocious eleven-year-old's sketched chronicle of a found, adopted, and then lost stray cat to the last of his several adolescent models.  Some of these pictures are frankly and exuberantly erotic, but there seems to be nothing prurient about even those few that pose prepubescent girls in full frontal exposure, where they radiate a ""wholesome sensuality"" (140).  But for the most part, the girls are just lounging around with blouses and skirts askew, either unselfconsciously exposing a bit of panty-clad crotch here or a bared nipple there or, conversely, quite self-consciously engaging the viewer.The catalogue extends to almost 100 pages and presents forty-one full-page reproductions (including several that were not in the exhibition), a few blown-up details, and a generous number of supportive illustrations (the jacket text says there are 171, some of which are black-and-white photographs); the paper is of a semi-lustrous kind that seems to capture colors quite faithfully.  Each entry is commented on by Dr. Rewald, and inevitably there is some repetition of what she has already written in the introductory essay.  I found her comments sometimes less challenging than I would have liked, in being more generous in description than in analysis--i.e., viewers do not really need to be told that the subject is wearing a red sweater and blue dress and is sitting on a green sofa illuminated by light from the left.  This we can see for ourselves; what we may miss is meatier and more penetrating discussion, comments on things like composition and structure, the contrast between body and background, or between the flexibility of the nubile anatomy and the rigidity of the furniture supporting it, matters of facture and technique, etc.  On the other hand, this catalogue is quite special in that it is written in the first person, and only Sabine Rewald could have done that.  When she writes something like ""I first fell under the spell of Balthus . . ."" (17), it is neither obtrusive nor self-aggrandizing; it simply reflects the years-long personal engagement she has had with the artist, his family, his friends, and his models, many of whom she has sought out and interviewed, and it makes her narrative of Balthus's career a document of irreplaceable first-hand authenticity. The volume concludes with a detailed chronology of Balthus's life, a selected bibliography and list of one-man exhibitions, and a comprehensive index. His life was very long, and his art very wide, and it is to Sabine Rewald's great credit that she has succeeded in concentrating the essence of his oeuvre into a manageable compass.  There will be more Balthus exhibitions and books, but no doubt none more authoritative than this.  I think Dr. Rewald could well have been more demanding of her readers, but even so this is a wonderful catalogue and an indispensable addition to the literature on this amazingly eccentric and truly unique painter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM4449VZX222L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300197012#wasThisHelpful","RM4449VZX222L","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the catalogue of the exhibition of the same name at the Frans Hals Museum in Haarlem from May to July 2013.  The exhibition, mounted to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the museum, was curated by Anna Tummers, the museum's Curator of Old Masters, who also edited the volume.  To include Titian so prominently in the title is a bit of an exaggeration; in fact, there is only one Titian exhibited (along with one Tintoretto), so Hals is not really put ""eye to eye"" with him.  But the inclusion of both those Italians is quite warranted by the background role they played in the art theory discussions of the time.  Hals's teacher, Karel van Mander, had traveled extensively in Italy before settling in Haarlem, personally knew almost all the most important artists and theoreticians, including Vasari, and was thoroughly acquainted with the Venetians' style. Van Mander had been apprenticed to the Flemish painter Pieter Vlerick, who had worked for Tintoretto, who in turn had briefly been a pupil of Titian's.  As a theoretician, Van Mander was the first to formulate the distinction between the ""neat"" and ""rough"" styles of painting, using Titian's late work as his primary example of the latter (and taking his cue from Vasari).  As a teacher he encouraged his students to begin with the ""neat"" manner as the easier of the two to master, but quite clearly ceded pride of place to the ""rough"" style that became the hallmark of his most famous pupil.  So it is indeed good to keep Titian's ""grandfatherly"" relationship to Hals in sight when looking at Hals's paintings, as well as those of Rembrandt, Rubens, van Dyck,  Jordaens and others who sometimes strove for a ""rough"" effect in their finished paintings.  With these contemporary painters, Hals's juxtaposition ""eye to eye"" is not at all an exaggeration, for the book does an excellent job of relating their works to one another.The four meticulously annotated scholarly essays that precede the catalogue underline the fact that the painters were well aware of what their colleagues were doing and were always looking over each other's shoulders, so to speak.  As an example: it turns out that Rembrandt's celebrated device to enliven the action in his ""Syndics of the Cloth Makers' Guild"" (1661), viz., having one of the men apparently caught in the act of rising from the table, is taken from Hals's ""Regents of the St. Elizabeth's Hospital"" of twenty years before.  And Rembrandt was not even the first to crib the gesture from Hals; Johannes Verspronck had already adopted it in his parallel painting from the same year as Hals's, ""The Regentesses of the St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Haarlem"" (1641).  And Hals himself had modeled the two figures at the extreme right of his table on those in Thomas de Keyser's  ""Four Burgomasters of Amsterdam Awaiting Marie de Medici"" from 1638. This is just one of the very many instances of direct influence and straightforward quotation that the writers discuss; they are not limited only to matters of technique, either--we find the same interaction also in themes (the sole musician in the manner of Caravaggio, the ""Pekelharing"" or tipsy entertainer, the great banquets of the militia companies, etc.), in composition, in coloration, and in virtually every aspect that they have in common.  Understanding the closeness of all this interchange is greatly facilitated by the excellent selection of paintings exhibited (lent by over twenty-five institutions and private collectors) and by the many judiciously chosen companion illustrations. Obviously, such mutual reverberations did not go unnoticed at the time, and there is frequent reference to the judgments and comparisons of the painters' contemporaries, be they painters themselves, collectors and potential buyers, or simply casual observers.In the catalogue section, all forty-seven exhibited paintings (reproduced in very good color and mostly full-page or half-page, including some blown-up details) are accompanied by a signed commentary by one of the essay writers or another contributor.  These are obviously at the forefront of Frans Hals scholarship, and I found them very informative on all manner of things touching the works, from the relationship of genre painting and portraiture to the ranks of the militia officers and the customs of the companies.  The volume concludes with a useful selected bibliography and a checklist of the exhibited works with pertinent curatorial data, but it unfortunately has no index.  If I could, I would dock it half a star for the lack of an index and especially for the chaotic arrangement of the plates, which are scattered throughout the essay section in a way that makes it very annoying and frustrating for the reader to locate any particular one.  Apart from that, however, this is a very interesting and useful examination of the mutual influences among these artists, an excellently produced catalogue that I recommend very highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP354SE3TQ9BW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9462080534#wasThisHelpful","RP354SE3TQ9BW","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the volume published to accompany the exhibition of the same name at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam from May 2013 until January 2014. It is edited and largely written by Marije Vellekoop, who is Head of Collection, Research and Exhibitions at the Museum and since 2008 the leader of an extensive multidisciplinary research project on Van Gogh's studio practice. It has contributions by several other curators and conservators, and  it is a superb book.  Over the course of many years' appreciation of his art I have accumulated some fifty or sixty books about him, ranging from small monographs on particular works to some blockbuster coffee-table editions and retrospectives and exhibition catalogues large and small in between, and this is one of the very best of them.  (That number does not yet include the major result of Dr. Vellekoop's project, the simultaneously published volume ""Van Gogh's Studio Practice,"" which is a larger, more comprehensive and apparently much more scientifically detailed account, to which this ""At Work"" volume is a more approachable companion.)Van Gogh came late to painting (already twenty-seven), and he knew he had to make up for lost time.  That probably explains the monomaniacal intensity with which he threw himself into acquiring the roots and fundamentals of his new study and which struck some people as fanatic, abrasive and irritating.  It is the great merit of this book to concentrate on demonstrating how Vincent went about learning what it was he needed to know and to avoid the kind of biographical attention that his singular personality tends to invite.  Thus the whole Christmas Eve blow-up with Gauguin, frequently so luridly described, is here soberly dismissed as a ""row"" that ""threw [him] into a mental crisis and he wounded himself in the ear"" (191).  Instead, the emphasis is on how eager Van Gogh was to learn from the more experienced artist and how he studied the double portraits that Gauguin and Emile Bernard had sent to him for clues about the new painting.  That is the focus throughout: interactions with other people are recorded only in so far as they affected his work, i.e., the artists with whom he painted and whose studios he visited, etc.; the only woman mentioned is Sien Hoornick, who appears only in her function as an unpaid model for him, and a nude one at that.The book is divided into two parts.  The first, a bit more than two-thirds of the whole, follows Vincent chronologically and geographically in fairly short segments that enable us to easily trace his path and his development.  The first section, ""Cuesmes, mid-August to mid-October 1880,"" records his decision to become an artist and his first steps in sketches, copies of prints and photographs, and his following the course of study in drawing manuals.  The second, ""Brussels, mid-October 1880,"" discusses his first studio course and experience of life drawing and his initial interaction with other art students.  Then come ""Etten, late April to late December 1881,"" with its charcoal drawings of the ""Brabant types"" and a brief excursion to The Hague, ""The Hague, late December 1881 to mid-September 1883,"" with his study of watercolor with Anton Mauve, the nude drawing with Sien, his exploration of the perspective frame, etc., and so on until the end.  All of these sections are extremely well illustrated with reproductions of Van Gogh's own work and that of other artists with whom he was working and studying, like Mauve himself and his fellow student Anton Van Rappard.  There are descriptions and illustrations of aids like the perspective frame and the wooden drawing frame, of tools like pens and brushes, materials like paper and canvas, and of  drawing materials in black and white and watercolors.  There are discussions of color theory and  his study of color charts, his fascination with Delacroix and experiments with color combinations, of oils and pigments and where he bought them, of kinds of supports and how he learned to treat them, etc., etc., just about every aspect of what he had to learn and do to make a painting. Much of the documentation is from his letters to Theo, and many of the letter sketches are also reproduced, especially when Vincent is describing a new technique or implement.The second part of the book, about the last seventy-five pages, is topical, rather than chronological or geographical, and consists of short essays on specific subjects by contributing curators and conservators.  These are very focussed pieces, also extensively illustrated, on matters such as ""Painting thickly and thinly"" (his experimentation in the summer of 1886 with pronounced brushwork, complementary colors, and thick impasto in the dozens of flower still lifes he painted in the style of Adolphe Monticelli; followed a few months later by experiments in painting thinly, almost as if drawing, in the manner adopted by his friend Toulouse-Lautrec).  Other topics are the painterly relations of ""Van Gogh, Bernard and Gauguin,"" ""Reused canvases,"" ""Van Gogh's new colors,"" ""Van Gogh's cobalt blue analysed,"" etc.  Indeed, color is one of the major priorities throughout this study, and much attention is paid to the artist's preoccupation with it.  One particularly engaging strategy is the analysis of Van Gogh's self-portraits in the act of painting, where the author focusses on and discusses the paints on the painted palette, which by necessity are the same paints as were on the palette of the painter painting the portrait. By numbering the paints on the palette and treating them in turn, one can achieve a very coherent discussion of the paints in the portrait. The last section in the book is ""Looking through the researchers' eyes,"" a brief discussion and explanation of the  analytical tools available to the conservator and which were used in the evaluation of the paintings in the exhibition, things like X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography, and other advanced technologies.  The volume concludes with some brief bibliographical references, an index of names and works, and a separate index of Van Gogh's works. This is a very serious treatment of those works as work, the hard work he had to do to get where he wanted to go.  As I am not an artist, I can not judge the usefulness of the study to a working painter, although I can imagine that at the very least the many pages of blown-up pictures of the tubes and brushes and palettes and pencils that he used would be of interest to one.  In any case, despite the variety and the excellence of the reproductions, this is not a book for someone who simply wants a nice representative selection of Van Gogh's oeuvre with some curatorial commentary.  I myself found it greatly informative, as well as beautifully produced in all respects and, as I wrote, one of the very best of the huge Van Gogh literature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P4E8A38QEZRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300191863#wasThisHelpful","R2P4E8A38QEZRN","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This volume is published in conjunction with the exhibition of the same name at The Jewish Museum in New York from September 2013 to February 2014.  It is not an exhibition catalogue in the usual sense of a numbered series of reproductions of the exhibited items; it consists, rather, of two essays centered around and commenting on the fifty-odd paintings and drawings in the show and a small  selection of Chagall's poems in English translation. (In fact, the only serious argument I have with this book is that the originals of the poems--in Russian, Yiddish, and French--are not also given.  Poetry is, as is well known, the first thing to be lost in translation, and surely a great number of the people who would want to see this exhibition and have the publication would be able to read the originals.) The focus is on the years between 1930 and 1948--although these are bracketed by the inclusion of both earlier and later works of a similar kind--and it should put to rest the notion that only the early Chagall is worthy of serious attention. For these are serious works indeed, and in fact rather shocking in their insistence on the figure of Christ as their central image.  Who would have thought that the godfather of fiddler-on-the-roof imagery, for which this transplanted Russian Jew became most widely known, would have created during these years at least twenty-five images of the Crucifixion?  How this came about, why Chagall went in that direction and what the figure of the crucified Christ ultimately meant to the artist is the subject of the fascinating seventy-page essay by Susan Tumarkin Goodman, the Senior Curator at The Jewish Museum, an established Chagall scholar whose many publications on the artist include the excellent ""Chagall and the Artists of the Russian Jewish Theater,"" the catalogue of an exhibition she curated at the museum in 2008 (see the reviews on this website).  Dr. Goodman calls her essay about Chagall in the '30's and '40's ""The Fractured Years,"" a title concisely evocative of the ""Love, War, and Exile"" theme of the exhibition: years in which Chagall was forced to flee the  Paris he had come to love, first to temporary refuge in the south of France, and then to the United States, where the increasingly credibly documented reports of the Holocaust caused him excruciating existential anxiety in his exile, and where at the same time he had to suffer the death of his beloved soul-mate, Bella, his muse and wife of over thirty years.The second essay in the book is by the noted art historian Kenneth E. Silver, who has written extensively on French art in the early twentieth century and on French-Russian Jewish artists such as Chaim Soutine.  His essay is titled ""Fluid Chaos Felt by the Soul,"" a formulation used by the French Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain, a friend of Chagall's, to describe the artist's work.  Prof. Silver notes that the artistic theme of the ""Jewish Jesus"" had been evolving since at least the late eighteenth century, and he situates Chagall's Christ iconography well within this tradition: the connection between the Christian savior and Jewish martyrdom is at the bottom of the ""flood of turbulent imagery [that] was the aesthetic rule of Chagall's oeuvre"" (114).There are about fifty full-page reproductions of the works, as well as numerous companion illustrations and photographs.  The color of the reproductions is excellent, which is crucial with Chagall: as Picasso said, ""when Matisse dies, Chagall will be the only person left who understands what color really is.""  Everyone who has seen a general survey of Chagall's works is familiar with one or two of his Christ paintings. But it is quite a different thing to see so many of them gathered from over thirty-five institutional and private lenders world-wide and to realize how important the image of the crucified Christ was to him in the insane years of  World War II and the Holocaust.  Having seen these paintings and read these essays, it is not likely one will ever think of Chagall in the same way again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E5K5MVJ79UAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300187343#wasThisHelpful","R2E5K5MVJ79UAV","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the catalogue of the exhibition organized by The Museum of Modern Art in New York and mounted there from September 2013 to January 2014.  It will subsequently travel to Houston's Menil Collection (February to June 2014) and The Art Institute of Chicago (June to October 2014), both of which institutions collaborated with the MoMA in producing the exhibition and catalogue.  All those museums have extensive holdings of Magritte's works (the Menil alone is surpassed only by the collection in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts in Brussels, which includes the Magritte Museum itself), and their contributions make up the majority of the works exhibited, augmented by significant loans from Brussels and from some fifty further collections and private lenders worldwide.  Many of the expected and iconic paintings are here, alongside many far less well known images, collages, objects, commercial catalogue and periodical pages, and photographs of and by the artist and his circle of ""accomplices,"" as they called themselves.  This is, in other words, a major and comprehensive exhibition; it is likely to remain the definitive show of Magritte's Surrealism for some time to come.The catalogue, edited by Anne Umland, MoMA's senior curator of painting and sculpture, does full justice to the exhibition.  There are 132 plates of exhibited works, mostly printed full-page or, in the case of photographs and periodical illustrations, two to a page, and there are several two-page detail enlargements of the paintings.  The essays are also accompanied by numerous companion illustrations. Four scholarly essays follow on a general introduction by the show's curators; these trace Magritte's path during this period of his life, from his initial involvement with Surrealism in Brussels (1926-27), his decision to live in Paris in order to be closer to the center of the movement and the failure to become satisfactorily established there (1927-30), his return to Brussels (1930-36), and his brief work in London, creating panels for the decoration of Edward James's town house (1936).  This is a concentrated period of time; it takes Magritte from his twenty-eighth year to his fortieth, the years most fruitful for the development of his Surrealist style and which set the foundation for the remaining thirty years of his life.  Throughout, the writers are keen to relate their discussions to Magritte's project of illuminating the ""mystery of the ordinary"" through his various ""alienating"" or ""defamiliarizing"" devices like the ""misnamed"" objects in the early word paintings, the morphing of figures into one another, the effects of optical illusion and trompe l'oeil, etc. The essays and their notes have frequent quotations from the artist's writings to elucidate the semiological motivations behind the paintings, the quest to reinvest meaning into things that have lost their meaning through everyday familiarity and routine inattention.  Magritte's interaction with his friends and fellow artists (most of them writers) is also highlighted enough to give the sense of Surrealism being a cooperative and collaborative effort, a real group movement.  I found these essays to be very informative and helpful, even though they average only about fifteen pages each--which of course means that the majority of the volume is given over to reproducing the art.  There is also a detailed and annotated chronology of  Magritte's life during these years, which provides information and material beyond that given in the essays.  The volume concludes with a checklist of the exhibition giving full curatorial information including the Sylvester/Whitfield catalogue raisonne numbers, a selected bibliography and an index of photographs and figures.  This is about as comprehensive and informative a book on the artist's founding Surrealist years as we are likely to see for some time, very solid and professionally produced and highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C302XZDBHBWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0870708651#wasThisHelpful","R3C302XZDBHBWE","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the catalogue accompanying the exhibition of the same name at the McMullen Museum of Art at Boston College from September to December 2013.  Exhibition and catalogue are both joint ventures of the McMullen and the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels.  Writing in ""The Boston Globe"" (""Catching up with Courbet,"" September 22, 2013), Sebastian Smee rightly called attention to the Museum's admirable ambition in putting together such a show, which mounts no fewer than seventeen Courbets (and one from his ""workshop"") and almost twice as many works by artists on whom he had a palpable influence.  The show divides, somewhat unevenly, into two parts.  The first, which we can call ""Courbet and the Belgians,"" consists largely of about twenty paintings loaned from Brussels; these are both original Courbets and works by several painters whom he encountered on his trips to Belgium and who were clearly affected by his painting, including Alfred Stevens and Louis Dubois, the latter represented by six canvases.  The second and larger part, ""Courbet and the Americans,"" brings together about thirty pictures from private collections and American museums (mostly in New England) and documents how Courbet's presence projected itself across the Atlantic, carried back to this country by artists who had come under his sway while studying in Paris (mostly with Thomas Couture).  Here figures such as John LaFarge and William Morris Hunt are prominent and are exhibited along with Theodore Robinson and Winslow Homer.  It must be said that the net was cast fairly wide in making these selections; it is not always apparent how some of the paintings betray much influence of Courbet, beyond their basic realist techniques.  In this respect, it is unfortunate that the plates are not given any specific commentary. Many of them are referenced by the scholarly essays preceding the catalogue, but, for the most part, readers are left to make their own connections in the absence of curatorial guidance.  The paintings are all reproduced full-page; the colors, although adequate, are somewhat muted and a bit somber-looking.Six scholarly essays precede the plates; all are meticulously annotated and accompanied by copious black-and-white illustrations.  Jeffery Howe, Professor of Fine Arts at Boston College and the volume's editor, provides both an introductory ""map"" of Courbet's influence in Belgium and the U.S. and an essay on the painter's landscapes, which increasingly occupied his artistic attention and in the end made up two-thirds of his oeuvre.  Dominique Marechal, curator of nineteenth-century paintings at the Royal Museums in Brussels, writes on Courbet's travels in Belgium and the Netherlands and his reception of the art of those countries, including the masters of the Golden Age and, more surprisingly, some contemporary figures like Alfred Stevens and his brothers.  The longest essay is that of Claude Cernuschi, also an art historian at Boston College, who discusses Courbet's many self-portraits from the point of view of social psychology: since Courbet insisted that he was a Realist and prided himself on being one, how is it that his self-portraits are so consistently unrealistic?  Dr. Cernuschi  uses the concepts of image-management and self-symbolization to explicate the artist's notoriously difficult personality.  This is a very well informed analysis and the most perceptive discussion of Courbet's psychological make-up--as well as the most persuasive explication of ""The Quarry"" (1856-57)--that I have come across.  Obviously, there is no dearth of books on Courbet or Realism; as recently as 2008 there was the double-whammy of the Metropolitan Museum's huge Courbet exhibition and its catalogue along with Segolene Le Men's immense and comprehensive monograph (see my reviews on this website), but Courbet is a fertile and endlessly fascinating figure, and this ""map"" of his realist reverberations in the two countries considered is just one of the many aspects from which his work can be profitably considered.  A nicely done volume and, despite the rather disappointing reproductions, a welcome addition to the literature and a ""must"" for Courbet enthusiasts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UJ36VVVB43TK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1892850214#wasThisHelpful","R1UJ36VVVB43TK","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the catalogue that accompanies the exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum from April to July 2013, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston from October 2013 to January 2014, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston from March to May 2014.  Both exhibition and catalogue are collaborative efforts of the Boston and Brooklyn museums and are curated and edited by Erica Hirschler and Teresa Carbone, their most senior curators of American art.  Perhaps the most surprising thing about this exhibition is that it took so long to get it together, because it's an obvious idea: the museums have owned the two most significant collections of Sargent's watercolors for over a hundred years.  The artist was notoriously reluctant to sell his watercolor paintings, not because he did not think them worthy or because he considered them only as products of his leisure, ""unofficial"" painting time--indeed, after the turn of the century they came increasingly to occupy the major part of his artistic attention--but because he thought of them as groups of serially related works. ""United they stand, and divided they fall,"" he wrote to a friend (40); the only thing that would tempt him to sell would be if ""a Museum should offer to buy the whole lot [. . .] for they only amount to anything when they are a lot together"" (39). That is precisely what happened: Sargent was persuaded to send his watercolors to only two major exhibitions in the United States, both times at the M. Knoedler gallery in New York: in 1909 the Brooklyn Museum bought eighty-three of the eighty-six pieces exhibited--just a day or two ahead of Boston--and in 1912 Boston, once burned, secured the basis of their collection by buying up the whole lot of forty-five watercolors before the show even opened.  Finally, a hundred years later, the two collections are exhibited together for the first time: 102 paintings from the museums, the majority of them from Boston (the MFA since expanded its collection to include over 500 works by Sargent, whereas shortly after the artist's death the Brooklyn Museum deaccessioned  forty-one pieces of its original purchase), augmented by a few loans from private collections.  They are all beautifully reproduced full-page (or over two pages in the case of the larger horizontal formats) and are accompanied by numerous photographs, companion illustrations, and over thirty detail studies; the jacket text says there are 175 color illustrations in all.  The reproductions are in sharp focus, and the colors seem natural and authentic, but as I have not yet seen the exhibition, I can not comment on the quality or accuracy of the colors.The paintings have been organized thematically, rather than chronologically or geographically, although there is naturally some overlap: the paintings in ""The Quarry"" section, for instance, were all done in the marble works of Carrara in the fall of 1911; they constitute the most coherent group of watercolors in his oeuvre.  But most of the other dozen or so sections have only a given subject as their unifying principle:  ""In Villa Gardens"" features paintings made from about 1903 until 1910, and in locales from Aranjuez to Florence and Lucca; ""Sunlight on Stone"" has work from 1906 to 1911 and takes us from Florence to Corfu and then to Venice, etc.  The paintings are not individually commented, but each of the sections is prefaced by a few pages of well annotated and very informative discussion by one of the contributing curators, and a couple of major introductory essays deal with the role of the watercolors in Sargent's development and the circumstances of the museums' acquisition of them.  There is also an excellent section by the museums' conservators on the artist's techniques and materials, which should be of particular interest to practicing artists.  The volume concludes with a select chronology from 1900 to 1917, a select bibliography, an exhibition checklist with curatorial data, and a comprehensive index.  There is no lack of books on Sargent, but this one provides insight into an area of his art that has not been extensively treated. It is a very welcome addition to the literature and also a beautifully produced volume.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R285GFE0QGUUFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0878467912#wasThisHelpful","R285GFE0QGUUFB","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When exactly Cennino Cennini put together his famous handbook is not clear.  It must have been quite early in the fifteenth century, for although his stated intention is to provide advice ""for the use and good and profit of anyone who wants to enter this profession"" (1), he has only very little to say about oil painting and seems unaware of the latest developments of that exciting new medium in the early decades of the century. (It was enough, though, to disprove the contention of Giorgio Vasari and others that oil painting had been invented by Jan van Eyck.)  In any case, it is absolutely a book intended for the professional, for the active practitioner, the working artist, and one can note that most of the reviewers on this site have praised it for the practical advice it provides.  It has also been reported that it was an important source-book and wellspring of useful technical information for Eric Hebborn, the notorious English art forger and author of his own handbook (""The Art Forger's Handbook,"" 1997), who is reputed to have employed Cennini's technique of using egg-white to simulate the appearance of aged varnish.I am not an artist and have never painted anything but some old furniture, a couple of book-cases and a dog house--and I must confess to never even having forged a Renaissance masterpiece--so to me this book is of no practical use, but it is greatly entertaining as well as historically informative.  Just to realize the huge amount of preparatory labor a fourteenth- or fifteenth-century artist had to accomplish in order to get ready to work adds a humbling perspective to the art we so easily admire on the walls of our museums.  And there are some wonderful insights into the times, too, such as the use of chicken bones: the older the better, ""just as you find them under the dining-table"" (5) and, while giving ""the exact proportions of a man,"" dispensing with those of a woman, ""for she does not have any set proportion"" (48).  There is practical advice here for almost anything a contemporary artist might have been called upon to do, from drawing for embroiderers to waterproofing a wall with boiled oil, but behind it all is Cennino's sense of his profession as having the dignity of a calling and requiring a measured life-style, ""just as if you were studying theology, or philosophy,"" and he admonishes the fledgling artist to eat and drink moderately and, in order to ensure an unwavering and unfluttering hand, to avoid ""indulging too much in the company of woman"" (16).  Obviously, times have changed, and that makes up a great deal of the charm of this book for one like myself, who is not about to enter the profession but who nevertheless also found in it much ""use and good and profit.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MNOK7RUOR9OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=048620054X#wasThisHelpful","R3MNOK7RUOR9OO","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the catalogue for the exhibition of the same name at the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence from March to May 2013 and at the Louvre in Paris from September 2013 to January 2014.  It is an enormous tome of around 550 large pages, beautifully produced and lavishly and excellently illustrated, and as far as I can see, it is the most comprehensive and up-to-date book on its subject currently available.  The legacy of Italian painting roughly from Duccio to Barocci is so huge, so ubiquitous and so overwhelming in its beauty and brilliance, that we can easily forget that the artists who began what we now call the Renaissance were not painters at all, but generally sculptors and, before that, goldsmiths.  The exhibition thus rightly places the plastic arts at the center of the ""springtime"" of the new sensibility, but also rightly indicates its relationship to the entire sphere of artistic activity, and in the first of the book's scholarly essays, ""On Primacy,"" the editors write of the developments in sculpture that ""imparted a new language and spirit to the other arts"" (25).  With one or two exceptions, the remaining essays all deal with aspects of Quattrocentro statuary in its manifold varieties, from ""Pisa and Antiquity"" to Brunelleschi's dome, from the great equestrian statues of Donatello and Andrea del Verocchio to Luca della Robbia's glazed terracotta, etc.  Some of the essays address specific works of art, while others discuss more general themes like the role of antiquarians and relevant theological debates.  Most of them are quite short (6-8 pp.) and are well illustrated and meticulously annotated, so there is even less than six or eight pages of text, and they all make frequent references to the reproductions in the catalogue section. There are twenty-eight of these essays, and they have the usual advantages and disadvantages of anthologies: a great diversity of topic and perspective, but also some repetition and uneven quality in the writing. The majority of the contributions are by Italian scholars; the translations are at times odd to an English ear and occasionally even inaccurate, but I did not find any instances where the intended meaning was obscured.  They are all informative, authoritative, and obviously at the cutting edge of Renaissance scholarship.  Unfortunately, there is no list identifying who the contributors are; some are well known, but others not, and it would have been useful to know what academic or curatorial positions they occupy.The second half of the book is the catalogue itself. It is divided into ten themes, which follow the roughly chronological arrangement of the exhibition itinerary, starting from ""The Legacy of the Fathers"" and including such topics as ""Christian and Civic 'Romanitas,'"" ""'Spiritelli' Sacred and Profane,"" ""The Revival of 'Condottiere,'"" and ""'Sculptured Painting.'"" Each thematic section is preceded by a short introduction and an indication of which of the scholarly essays are pertinent to it, so that if readers wish to start with the essays, they know which catalog sections are referenced; and if they wish to start with the works, they know which of the essays are relevant. There are about 150 reproductions here (by my rough count), most of them full-page and in full color, and a number of companion smaller illustrations, with the sculptures in the round photographed from more than one angle when appropriate. The reproductions are excellent in clarity and color; some of the colors, especially those of the painted terracottas of Donatello, Nanni de Bartolo and Luca della Robbia, are striking.  It is an extensive collection, including many of the ""usual suspects"" and some much less commonly encountered pieces (the exhibition drew on some seventy-five sources worldwide), all of which are illuminated by commentary from the editors and contributors and provided with specialized bibligraphies. The last two reproductions are, appropriately, Desiderio da Settignano's marble bust of Marietta Strozzi (c. 1464) and Giuliano da Sangallo's wood carved model  of the Palazzo Strozzi (1489).  The volume concludes with an extensive general bibliography, but,  unfortunately, no index, which severely limits the book's usefulness as a reference.  Nevertheless, this is a major contribution to the study of early Renaissance sculpture, especially in its larger cultural context and its relation to other arts, and it is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27KA2R9HXCR7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8874611862#wasThisHelpful","R27KA2R9HXCR7C","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a small booklet of about sixty pages (but handsomely and well produced, with sewn binding) that was issued to accompany an exhibition at the Coe Kerr Gallery in New York in November and December 1987.  It had been known for some time that Prendergast worked in pastel; he had exhibited four in Philadelphia in 1918, and there were a few scattered about in various museums and private collections.  The assumption was that these were merely random and occasional pieces, the products of a desultory occupation in the studio of an artist known for his experimentation.  What was unknown--and this is the fact that justifies the somewhat exaggerated title--is that the artist actually produced a distinct body of work in this medium during the decade surrounding World War I, and that some of the later pastels are the least realistic, most abstract pieces of his whole oeuvre and thus in fact the culmination of his Modernist style.  It is a peculiarity of Prendergast that he did his boldest and most avant-garde experiments in media for which he was far less well known than for his signature watercolors: in this case pastels, or, as Elizabeth Kennedy recently asserted, ""when working with his monotypes"" (p. 104 in the exhibition catalogue ""Prendergast in Italy""; see my review on this website).  In any case, this systematic occupation with pastels was unsuspected until, some seventy years after their creation, the artist's very much younger sister-in-law brought them to the attention of Warren Adelson, at that time Director of the Coe Kerr Gallery, who arranged the exhibition and wrote the catalogue.Mr. Adelson comments that the aesthetic impression of the pastels is fundamentally different from that of either the watercolors or the oils of the same period, that they seem to ""synthesize the fluidity and clarity of watercolor with the density and impasto of oil, thereby gaining a new and quite different effect"" (5).  I am quite willing to take this at face value, for it makes sense that these works should have a special brilliance: Prendergast's usual technique in these pieces was to apply pastel over a base of watercolor, producing an unusual  chromatic result, a ""texture that is startling, [. . .] both translucent and impastoed [. . .] a suffused shadowless radiance, a luminous effect that records not the effect of light on color, but pure color untouched by light"" (13).  This sounds both convincing and intriguing, but the pity is that such chromatic and textural nuances simply cannot be replicated on paper, even though in every other way the reproductions are excellent.  The paintings are beautiful; the compositional rhythms and perspectives and the wonderful colors familiar from the watercolors are there, but unfortunately the very special qualities that the author so eloquently adduces and that make these works stand out in the artist's oeuvre are not obvious in reproduction, and I (for one) cannot always discern the difference between them and similar works done in pure watercolor.  Fortunately, that does not detract from an appreciation of the paintings themselves nor from understanding the kind of temporal compression they represent: Prendergast's career went from the representational and anecdotal increasingly toward the abstract and nonrealistic, and this trajectory can be followed in these works also, even though they represent only a scant decade of his work.  The dating of these pastels is difficult and uncertain,  but the first of the twenty-two paintings exhibited, ""Boat Landing, Nahant, Massachusetts"" (the cover illustration), is dated 1910 on the reverse and is still largely figurative and pictorial.  The last of them, ""Distance Hills, Maine"" and ""On the Rocks, North Shore,"" both from ca. 1918, are a world away from the beaches of Boston and the parks of New York; here, the figures are practically one with their background, almost absorbed by the shore they are pictured on and seemingly woven of the same material: interior, almost dream-like apparitions that Mr. Adelson aptly calls ""arabesques of the imagination"" (17).  Clearly, one will need to see these paintings in the flesh to appreciate them fully, but in the meantime we can be thankful for these beautiful reproductions, the several black-and-white illustrations that accompany them, and a concise and expert introduction to this little known aspect of the artist's work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HLXFZR3BTH8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0876635346#wasThisHelpful","R2HLXFZR3BTH8X","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the volume that accompanied the exhibition of the same name at the Williams College Museum of  Art in Williamstown, Massachusetts, from July to September 2009; at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice from October 2009 to January 2010; and at  The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, Texas, from February to May 2010.  It is not a catalogue in the strict sense, as there is no actual ""catalogue"" of the exhibited works.  Instead, the works are reproduced among the many companion images accompanying the essays.  The book is lavishly illustrated with, by my rough count, over two hundred reproductions--mostly of Prendergast works and many printed full-page--in excellent  color, which is especially important for this artist, who quickly became known as one of the outstanding colorists among the early Moderns.  Prendergast spent most of his time in Italy, during both of his two sojourns (1898-99 and 1911-12), in Venice, which means there is a lot of blue in his works (dress, flowers, etc., and especially sky and water), and some of the reproductions, such as of ""Grande Marina, Capri"" (ca. 1898-99; CR 758 recto) and ""Steps of Santa Maria d'Aracoeli, Rome"" (ca. 1898-99; CR 749), are surprisingly good in their ability to capture some very nuanced tones. The companion illustrations include maps, a number of period photographs of people and locales, and well chosen comparison paintings from Veronese and Carpaccio to Sargent and Klimt.The art works are accompanied by several interpretive and historical essays.  Nancy Mowyll Mathews, who as Eugenie Prendergast Senior Curator at the Williams College Museum was the major curator of the show and the volume's major editor, has written an excellent discussion of the artist's Italian work, pointing out what was new to him and how he incorporated his new experiences and impressions into the Modernist grounding he had already acquired in his years in Paris and further developed in Boston.  She is very good in indicating the thematic and technical innovations that made his work so attractive to the American avant-garde and ensured a positive reception to his Italian work upon his return.  This is a much longer and more detailed consideration of the work than the one she contributed more recently to the catalogue of the ""Prendergast By the Sea"" exhibition at Bowdoin College (see my review).  Next to watercolor, which was Prendergast's preferred medium (there are only three oils in his entire Italian oeuvre), he created many monotypes on his first Italian trip, and these are the subject of an excellent essay by Elizabeth Kennedy, the Terra Foundation's Curator of the Collection, who assisted with both exhibition and catalogue.  She underscores this medium as the one in which Prendergast was most experimental, creating spatial ambiguity and manipulating color in such a way as to earn him her designation as ""America's first Modernist artist"" (125).  A few other essays are less specifically analytical of the work and are intended more to provide background information on the Venetian ambiance that Prendergast encountered: the belletristic activity of writers from all over the world drawn to the city; his absorption and use of the paintings of the great masters he studied in the museums (especially Carpaccio); the conflict of tradition and modernity in the early days of what eventually became the Venice Biennale (a gouache Picasso sent from Paris in 1905 proved a bit too much for the conservative crowd and was taken down and returned to the artist after three days); time as an element of great importance on the second visit, etc.  Although somewhat tangential to the artist, these essays create a good sense of the atmosphere in which he was working and the influences to which he was exposed.  The volume concludes with a fourteen-page checklist of the entire Italian oeuvre (updating the catalogue raisonne), a chronology of the artist's life, and a good index.  Prendergast's Italian paintings were central to his entire body of work, and this very competent and comprehensive presentation of them is an essential addition to the literature about him.  It is also a very handsomely produced volume and highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X6OW6UXSDRQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005X4EGGW#wasThisHelpful","R1X6OW6UXSDRQ4","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This volume is the catalogue of the exhibition of the same name at the Bowdoin College Museum of Art in Brunswick, Maine, from June to October 2013.  It is edited by Joachim Homann, the Museum's director.  The show is co-curated by him and Nancy Mowll Mathews, the former Eugenie Prendergast Curator at the Williams College Museum of Art, who curated the 2009-2010 exhibition ""Prendergast in Italy"" in Williamstown, Venice, and Houston, and edited its catalogue (see my review on this website).  Whereas that presentation focussed on the results of Prendergast's two trips to Italy in 1898-1899 and 1911-1912, this exhibition is the closest thing the artist has had to a retrospective in over twenty years and gathers together works from some thirty collections.  ""By the Sea"" might seem to disqualify it as a broad overview of his artistic career, but in fact wherever Prendergast lived and/or painted--be it New England, New York,  France, or Italy--he was never far from the ocean, and the depiction of people disporting themselves at the water's edge was his lifelong occupation, amounting to over a thousand images (two-thirds of his entire oeuvre).  This catalogue presents works spanning his whole artistic life, from 1891 to 1923, in all the various media in which he worked (primarily watercolor, oil, and monotype).  There are seventy-four plates of the exhibited works, printed either full-page or, for the horizontal format he often preferred, over two pages, and these are accompanied by over thirty companion illustrations.  Given the unusual  breadth of his palette, it is sometimes hard to judge the color quality of the reproductions, but I believe they are generally quite true to the original, and they are in any case sharply printed.  The reproductions are arranged chronologically, so it is easy to follow Prendergast's evolution, in both theme and technique, from the elegantly dressed Boston boardwalk strollers of the 1890's to the very undressed and surprisingly erotic bathers of the later paintings, when impatience with the prudishness of the Boston public prompted his and his brother's move to New York in 1914, after forty-six years in the Massachusetts capital.This is the trajectory traced by the five essays in the catalogue, by Drs. Homann and Mathews and other scholars who have written before on Prendergast and aspects of early American modernism.  Some of the topics covered are his importation into the American art scene of themes and techniques that he discovered on his European trips; his stylistic ancestors among the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists (chiefly Renoir and Cézanne); his participation with other Americans in group exhibitions of early modernist painters (Glackens, Sloan, Bellows), etc.  These essays tend to provide more general information than specific aesthetic analysis; they mostly locate him in the making of American art and highlight his role as a bridge between European and native developments. The discussions are augmented by scholarly apparatus in the form of a chronology of the artist's life, a bibliography, and a checklist of the exhibition with relevant curatorial data.  The informative text and abundant illustrations combine to make this catalogue a thorough and competent overview of Prendergast's oeuvre, short of the catalogue raisonné the most comprehensive one we have at the moment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIXPSDSFA2VAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3791352903#wasThisHelpful","RIXPSDSFA2VAX","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the eighty-page catalogue produced to accompany the exhibition at the National Gallery in London from June to September 2013.  The NG owns two Vermeer paintings of a young woman playing a muselar virginal (one standing, the other seated), and when they received ""The Guitar Player"" (ca. 1672) on loan from English Heritage, it was decided to mount a show on the subject of music as a theme in Golden Age painting.  Two additional Vermeers and some representative musical instruments and songbooks were borrowed and put together with paintings already in the NG's permanent collection, and the result is this small but informative presentation.  ""Vermeer and Music"" may be a bit exaggerated as a title (the exhibition is much broader than that), but there are indeed five Vermeer canvases in the show, and to see five Vermeers together under any circumstances is not an experience to disparage. Marjorie Wieseman, the Gallery's Curator of Dutch and Flemish Paintings, who curated the 2011 exhibition ""Vermeer's Women: Secrets and Silence"" and edited its catalog (see my review) has written both the introductory essay and the catalogue notes for this show also.  Her thirty-page introduction briefly discusses the historical background to music appreciation in the new United Provinces, the locales of public and private performance, and the kinds of music and songbooks available.  The essay is well illustrated  with companion pictures of paintings, instruments, and music books.  The exhibition featured twenty-five paintings, seven instruments, and five songbooks.  Not all the books or instruments are illustrated in the catalogue, but all of the paintings are, in reproductions in small format but large enough to be easily legible, and in good color and detail. The Dutch in the seventeenth century were not known for their musical culture, and so it is quite surprising to see the extent to which musical themes permeated the visual culture in which they were preeminent. The range goes from riotous hoedown fiddling to tender duets in the service of courtship--and everything in between; it is estimated that some twelve percent of the paintings created in that century have musical themes of one sort or another, and fully one-third (i.e., twelve of thirty-six) of Vermeer's extant paintings depict musicians or musical instruments.  Dr. Wieseman's individual notes comment on the instruments in the paintings, and the volume concludes with an illustrated glossary of instruments and some suggestions for further reading.  This is in no way intended to be a definitive or comprehensive survey of the subject, but it is a very nice overview of the National Gallery's extensive collection of Golden Age genre paintings and a thoroughly competent and handsomely produced introduction to one of the most important sub-genres.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VV8JL7C68B8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1857095677#wasThisHelpful","R2VV8JL7C68B8Y","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the catalogue of the exhibit of the same name organized by the Mildred Lane Kemper Museum of Art at Washington University in St. Louis and shown there from January to April 2013 and at the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., from June to September 2013.  There are forty-one exhibition paintings, each reproduced full-page and with excellent color and clarity, as well as some forty-odd additional supportive illustrations and a few pages of photographs of Braque and his studio.  The paintings are not given any specific commentary, but they are discussed in a general way in the several accompanying essays.  Karin K. Butler, who curated the show in St. Louis and edited the catalogue, provides a general overview of this period of Braque's career and elucidates the aesthetic bases of his political quiescence in these tumultuous years--especially in view of Picasso's highly visible political profile--which was a very sensitive point in the critical reception of his work during that time.  Her conclusion is that his still-life paintings ""are about the war precisely by being not about the war"" (29).  Renee Maurer, Assistant Curator at the Phillips, contributes an essay on Duncan Phillips's predilection for Braques, while everyone else was collecting Picasso and Matisse, and there are further essays on the role of the German publicist and cultural critic Carl Einstein in the early appreciation and popularization of Braque's work and on the characteristic ""tactility"" of his way of seeing.  There is also an extensive report on the technical analysis of  twenty-one of his paintings.  That kind of documentation is apparently becoming obligatory in exhibition catalogs, but here it makes a great deal more sense than it does in many others: Braque paid almost obsessive attention to the texture of his surfaces, which he considered at least as important as color and form, and, as the technical examinations clearly show, he was a masterful and imaginative manipulator of his materials, mixing all kinds of things into his pigments and then applying them in ingenious ways to the supports.It is a peculiarity of Braque's reception that the paintings of his middle years--precisely the Cubist still lifes presented here--have received less attention either than his early work, with its tighter association with Picasso, or the post-war paintings. As the foreword points out, this is his first major museum exhibition in twenty-five years, and it seems to be the first exhibition and catalogue to have concentrated on this period altogether.  For that reason, it is a particular merit of this volume to reprint, in excellent translations, both Carl Einstein's introduction to the catalog that accompanied the first retrospective exhibition of Braque's work (in Basel in 1933), and Jean Paulhan's 1945-1952 essay ""Braque le patron.""  Paulhan, editor of the Nouvelle Revue Franaise from 1925 to 1940, was one of the most influential critics of the time, and this is the most substantial of his pieces on Braque.  The volume concludes with a chronology juxtaposing the artist's life with the major historical events of the time, a checklist of the exhibition with pertinent curatorial data, and a comprehensive index.  A very substantial and handsomely produced volume, an absolute must for anyone interested in Braque or the issues of Cubism, and highly recommended in general.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GLJRY6PI01WA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3791352709#wasThisHelpful","R1GLJRY6PI01WA","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This volume was published to accompany the exhibition of the same name organized by the Cleveland Museum of Art and mounted at the Museum from December 2012 to April 2013; it will be shown at the Museu Picasso in Barcelona from October 2013 to January 2014.  The sole author, William H. Robinson, Curator of European Paintings at the Cleveland Museum, has written extensively on Spanish and Catalan modernism and is thoroughly acquainted with the political, social, and cultural environment that gave birth to the works of that couple of generations of artists from Antoni Gaudi to Joan Miro and Salvador Dali.  Here he has brought his formidable learning and analytic skills to an elucidation of one of Modernism's most enigmatic paintings, ""La Vie"" (1903), the culmination of Picasso's Blue Period.  The result is one of the most comprehensive and informative studies of an individual painting that I have ever encountered--and it is also compulsively readable.  Rather than explicating the finished canvas as a whole, the author seeks to establish the painting's ""meaning"" by reconstructing the process of its creation and tracing the crucial alterations that Picasso made to its iconography in pursuit of his changing conception of the work.  In doing so, he discusses themes, subjects, and other artists who were important in Picasso's formulation: the genre of ""the artist's studio""; the desperate women of the St.-Lazare prison that the painter started visiting in the summer of 1901; the artist as both bohemian and martyr; the suicide of the artist's close friend Carles Casagemas and the notion of the ""femme fatale"" and the role of ""Germaine"" Gargallo in all that; Nietzsche, Rodin and, especially, Gauguin, etc., etc.--the range of reference is so broad that the book actually approaches an intellectual biography of the young Picasso centered on his creation of this one work. One engaging aspect of the narrative is that Dr. Robinson never insists on ""influence"" as such--just as a pool of water cannot be said to ""influence"" a sponge placed in it, yet the sponge (in this case, Picasso and his painting) is profoundly altered by absorption from its milieu--and our understanding of this much more elusive process is superbly facilitated by the material he presents for our own absorption.  All this discussion is duly informed by the results of the technical examinations now made possible by the array of instruments at the conservator's service: infrared reflectology, stereomicroscopy, etc.The volume is lavishly and beautifully illustrated with over 175 excellently chosen reproductions.  In keeping with the small format, these are also for the most part small, but they have excellent color and clarity.  There are also a dozen or so detail blow-ups of ""La Vie."" The book is very conscientiously annotated and concludes with a short but useful selected bibliography. The conclusion of the discussion is that what the painting ""means"" is the accretion of meanings that it acquired in the course of its creation; it is a merging and mingling of its many diverse themes: an allegory of sacred and profane love, of the cycle of life and death, a commentary on the assorted vulnerabilities of the proletarian class, and on many other things.  What emerges clearly from the study is that virtually everything Picasso altered in the course of the painting was aimed at expanding the original theme of the artist's studio into an increasingly multilayered and mysterious image, until the painting, rather like ""la vie"" itself, finally raises more questions than it answers. About the same time Picasso was painting this canvas, Gustav Mahler made his famous comment to Jan Sibelius that the symphony ""must be like the world, must embrace everything.""  Neither symphonies nor paintings are infinitely capacious, but apparently they can be inexhaustibly suggestive.  To his friend Jaume Sabartes Picasso once said that ""a finished work is a dead work, killed"" (140), but an unfinished work is still alive.  So perhaps it is also with interpretations: the great merit of this volume is that it hones our understanding and provides us with meanings but leaves us with the realization that the painting's meaning is still unfinished, still alive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JJS1QXNWBXM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1907804218#wasThisHelpful","R1JJS1QXNWBXM3","A3MVH6J3T9YY8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MVH6J3T9YY8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of those continued series that really needs to be read in order to understand what all is happening.  This story picks up from Shawna’s Choice and now Shawna and Vilnek are on the run from Falsen and had to leave Trellian under false murder charges. Falsen has gone off the deep end and there is no reasoning with him. The plot kept the pages turning and more mystery and suspense unfolds. The story is full of characters from the first book and new ones are added. Many of the Miners and their Companions are now married too.

"This story is a contemporary romance of two people, in two separate states, who never had met before but had become friends over the internet, phone calls and Skype.  Austin Tyler is a man who has a terrible track record with three ex-wives and an ex-fiancé, great with horses and is a smokejumper.

"This is a wonderful series that has dominate men, submissive women, mystery, suspense, kidnapping, crime with a drug cartel with a long overdue beautiful erotic romance. Captain Anthony Rossi could never indulge in a long term relationship while he was away so often on missions as a Green Beret. Since changing his lifestyle, he is ready for a more permanent relationship and Megan is his dream woman. Megan is 31-years-old and never been in a serious relationship, she has been in love with Cap for fifteen years and no one could hold up to his standards in her eyes. When these two finally get together they are explosive.  This story will take the reader on a wild roller coaster ride of emotions and action filled pages that involve mystery and suspense. This is a very steamy romance with explicit sex scenes, spankings and punishments, as well as erotic play.  Always safe, sane and consensual.  This is part of a series but I have read books out of order and they will read well as a stand-alone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C9K6MQCIZ01X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CAD2LBG#wasThisHelpful","R3C9K6MQCIZ01X","A16AL32R7ZZVXB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16AL32R7ZZVXB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am so excited about this box set of Mail Order Brides and Christmas.  I had read two of the stories for two authors, which I am leaving a review for now. I actually won the box set in a giveaway and was so excited. I can't wait to read the other 4 stories and will add to my review later.  I love mail order bride books and these stories offer inspiration.1. Jacob's Christmas Dream (Christian Historical Romantic Novella) (Christmas Mail Order Angels) by Darlene FranklinWAITING UPON THE LORDWhat a sweet and inspirational story of faith, trust and listening for God's answer and obey His calling. This is the beginning of a wonderful series, Christmas Mail Order Angels.  The Christian men of Angel Vale, WY decided they need to find them Christian mail order brides and send off to Merville, Maine to the Ladies Aid Society. Becky Patterson, daughter of Seaside Community Church's Pastor, sees this as an answer to prayers and enlist the single and widowed ladies to join in and answer letters. The arrangements are made and the ladies travel by train and then wagon to Wyoming to meet and marry their prospective grooms, some immediately and others after a short courtship. Jake Underwood, merchant and fill in pastor for Angel Vale is excited for his future bride.  Sometimes, what God is calling us to do, is the one thing we are struggling with and don't want in our life. Acceptance of God's will in our life gives peace and happiness.2. Christmas Gold (Christmas Mail Order Angels) by Cynthia HickeyAN ANGEL SENT BY GODAnother sweet and inspirational story of faith, trust, and an answer to prayers. These Christmas Mail Order Angels books are a series, but I believe will read in any order. Phoebe Ross was alone, losing her beloved employer and faced with a choice to leave or marry the son she detests. She joins the mail order brides going to Angel Vale, WY with an agreement to marry Alex Vaughn, jeweler and gold miner. Sometimes the interaction between these two is a comedy of errors and you just want to knock both of them up beside their heads. This is a charming story with delightful characters, humorous antics, witty dialog and heartwarming moments. Alex and Phoebe are a sweet couple, especially when they learn to be honest and open with each other.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UYKAE044PD5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015RN2J8U#wasThisHelpful","R2UYKAE044PD5P","A16AL32R7ZZVXB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16AL32R7ZZVXB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fun and at times comical story.  Dillion Westover is a widower with two children, Michael and Christy, and an author.  He is engaged to Amanda Dickenson who takes care of his children while he writes.  Amanda is spoiled, selfish and lazy, and a whiner.  Dusty Dickenson, a nurse, gets a letter pleading for help from her twin sister Amanda begging her to come to Arizona, which she does. She tells her all about the ghost town there, knowing that Dusty would love it, and she needs to see her sister and find out what the problem is.  But Amanda being who she is, abandons her and the children, leaving her to deal with Dillion and his anger. The plot kept me captivated as Dusty tries to play along that she is Amanda and trying to uncover what is going on in her relationship. The dialog is entertaining, the children’s affection to Dusty heartwarming and enduring.  When will Dillion realize there has been a switch? How long will he pretend not to be wiser to the twins? Where did Amanda go and what will Dusty do? Sometimes, what seems like a trick is being played on someone, they may have a nice treat in the end.  There are several spankings but no sex in this story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ9AQ6MF5V78V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01786SDCU#wasThisHelpful","RQ9AQ6MF5V78V","A16AL32R7ZZVXB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16AL32R7ZZVXB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this Christmas story of the Colburn family mainly seen through the eyes of Dr. Lydia Colburn Bradshaw.  This book is a spin-off from the Uncharted series and can be read well as a standalone. The plot kept me captivated and is full of emotions, many trying to capture and recreate past family memories.  The dialog is open, honest and heartwarming.  I especially enjoyed the journal from Lydia’s late mother that told more on the family.  Lydia is heartbroken that the family traditions are changing and her siblings are starting their own traditions and she feels they are going to ruin Christmas. It hit home as I thought of my own childhood memories, then marrying and moving away and starting new ones for my family, and now dealing with adult children and grandchildren.

"Disclosure: I won a paperback copy of this beautifully illustrated 1, 2, 3 Count With Me book at a Goodreads giveaway.  The illustrations are colorful and appealing.  The story counts forward from 1 to 10 and then again backwards from 10 to 1. The rhyming is fun and even a matching song at the end of the book.When trying to teach children counting, I think that it would have been so much better had the animals not been repeated in groups of 2 or 3 for numbers.  Example: 1 Sheep and on the page across from it 2 sheep, it would be easy for a child to start counting and come up with 3 sheep because they are basically all together on the two adjoining pages, then 4 Lizard and 5 lizards, so in total on the 2 pages you see 9 lizards, and on countdown, 2 kangaroos and 1 kangaroo appear as 3 kangaroos.  Children easily see the 2 pages combined as one large canvas.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LSRNRX7WZK25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0139V12CG#wasThisHelpful","R3LSRNRX7WZK25","A16AL32R7ZZVXB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16AL32R7ZZVXB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Sweet Biblical Amish Romance stories are such a joy to read with the similarities to characters in the Bible with the same names.

"This is an extremely emotional story of a woman who wants to be loved and accepted and goes about it in a destructive way before she meets Cal  Chesterfield.  Her parents have really done a number on her with their rejection and the only love she really has known was from Granny.  Astraea is definitely a rebel, Goth look, lackadaisical attitude, no self-respect, but it is all a barrier to try and not be hurt again.

"I absolutely loved this time travel romance, with its charming cast of characters, witty and entertaining dialog and sweet romance.  I was laughing out loud so many times while reading this story of the various antics described, especially at the Kringle’s Ball. Ms Hartman has a wonderful way of spinning a tale, adding cats, birds and various animals, entertaining us with delightful characters and a clean sweet romance.  The plot kept me captivated and the pages turning.  I love a story with an HEA ending. Disclosure: I received an e-copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.  All thoughts, opinions, and ratings are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EZPEP2URYNLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0175EFALW#wasThisHelpful","R2EZPEP2URYNLB","A16AL32R7ZZVXB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16AL32R7ZZVXB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It works well as a conditioner.  Actually better than most mainstream conditioners at keeping my frizzy hair tamed.I do not personally care for the scent.  I think it's the rosemary, which I've just never been a fan of.  It smells like glue to me.  I also tried the Luscious Island conditioner from Sprout, and I liked that much better.

"Very nice, quality product.  Thick cardboard, well made.  Child can match pairs based on letter/number or color (the two halves have different backgrounds for the most part, but there's a tiny bit of spillover of color from the animal object/half to the letter half).  I liked that both the full alphabet (A-Z) and basic numbers (1-10) are covered.  My 29-month old finds them entertaining already, and it's pretty early days for him in terms of letter matching.  He has very good good letter recognition already, but doesn't yet understand how to identify the animal with the matching letter.  The puzzle and color matching aspects though keep him engaged enough to keep going, which will help us to keep working on the letter matching.The only downside (a minor one, really) for me: the box is unnecessarily large, in my opinion -- the cards, when paired up, only fill it up about a third of the box, so this uses up more storage space in my home than I'd like.  But I guess the large box was designed with enough room to allow toddlers to put all of the pieces away themselves without getting frustrated.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R257H1JPLH3H8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400630576#wasThisHelpful","R257H1JPLH3H8T","AVZBK78Q39LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVZBK78Q39LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice product - hours of entertainment for our 2-year-old - just perfect for restaurants, doctor's offices, etc.  Great concept and works great for the most part.  My kid loves it.Three ways that M&D could improve this product:1) The opaque white film is not as opaque on this product as it is on the Water WOW spiral books.  So there isn't quite the same mystery - my kid can identify each animal/object before he even puts pen to paper.  But, he still seems plenty motivated, so I guess it still works.2) The opaque white film is also not that durable.  It scratches off easily, when my kid holds the pen at an angle a ridge on it leaves scratch marks.3) The plastic ring is a great add, but there needs to be a better way to store the pen.  The plastic blisterpack in which the pen comes packaged has a hole in it so you can add it onto the ring, but it is awkward and bulky.  Also there's no top for the pen, which means you can't leave any water in the pen whatsoever before storing it, or it will leak out and permanently damage the cards.I do recommend this product though, as well as the Water WOW books, for younger toddlers, say ages 2-3.  I'm guessing older kids with greater physical dexterity would have more fun actually using their imaginations more and coloring on their own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVG2WGF3PDBO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4H17OI#wasThisHelpful","RVG2WGF3PDBO5","AVZBK78Q39LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVZBK78Q39LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was super excited when I saw this bib as we are huge fans of the Modern Twist placemats (have used ours for every meal for our child for the past two years).  We have been long-time users of the Baby Bjorn plastic bibs with the lip, and I thought this might be a nice, more flexible alternative that would be more comfortable for our child.  Well, I'm sure it is more comfortable, because the material is totally flexible, but the downside is that the lip does not stay open and as a result does not catch ANY food.  This bib is fine for just protecting your baby's chest, but it certainly does not catch anything.  It's back to the Baby Bjorn bibs for us.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39QEUM0KCLL0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HTYFTWY#wasThisHelpful","R39QEUM0KCLL0C","AVZBK78Q39LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVZBK78Q39LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This loose green sencha tea is excellent.  I am a green tea snob - usually only like gyokuro.  I enjoy this almost as much (has the same grassy taste), and it is much cheaper.  The price is quite reasonable actually via Subscribe & Save.One note: the brewing instructions on the package are definitely overkill.  They suggest 1 tbsp tea per 8 oz water, and to brew for 2-3min.  That is definitely way too much tea, and for too long.  I brew 1 tsp of tea per 10-12oz of water for 2min, and the result is just perfect.

"These are OK - they do the job.  They run a little small.  I have a small 26mo old and the toddler size (2-4 years) clasp his head too tightly.  In theory I thought the reversibility would be nice so I wouldn't have to worry about my son putting them on upside down.  In reality this has turned out not to be that important, as he had no problem grasping the concept of something being upside down, and the downside of them being reversible is that they are not cute either way.  They make my son look buggy eyed.We much prefer the Babiators, which I purchased after receiving these and not being thrilled with them.  My son strongly prefers them (they don't squeeze his head as tightly, I presume), and they look way cuter on him!The Julbos might work well for you if your kid has a narrow head and the looping mechanism is an important feature for you.  Otherwise, check out Babiators as an alternative.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KAWH1LGAESTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001O0DN8G#wasThisHelpful","R3KAWH1LGAESTC","AVZBK78Q39LXT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVZBK78Q39LXT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS:- Good variety of shapes (range of shapes, animals, vehicles)- Eash to wash (with fingerpainting paints, just wash out easily with cold water, w/o any soap)CONS:- Much larger than expected (up to 4-5"" in length).  Use up a lot of paint (even when painting it on as one reviewer suggested), and difficult for my 26mo old to manipulate (cannot press down the whole shape at once, leading to uneven prints).  Also produce figures that are just too large for normal (8.5x11"") or fingerpaint size (12x16"") paper.  Maybe a good choice for very large format paper.- Do not work great with fingerpainting paint, at least not the Crayola brand washable fingerpaints.  The impressions they leave behind are bubbly and diffuse.  Not sure if it would be any different with non-fingerprinting paints and/or non-washable paints.In retrospect I had not purchased these.

"Something smells at the Chili Queens's house of ill repute, and it's not in the kitchen. The Chili Queen is a tale about a tough as nails madam with a tender heart who takes in an abandoned bride, who repays her by turning her well-ordered life upside down. At times hilarious, at times tender, even sad,  the Chili Queen is a colorful adventure of the old west filled with ladies of the night, bank robbers, and con artists. Sandra Dallas's wonderful prose recreates the honky-tonk atmosphere of frontier towns. Her West is dry and dirty, a hopeless place where one can only expect a hard-scrabble existence. Everybody has a past that has brought them to their present, and some of the stories are hallowing. Rape, incest, murder, bigotry, and war are part of life, and influences the paths that people end up taking. However, this is not a tale of victims, but triumph. Each character uses what life has dumped on them, carving out a niche, trying to find a spot to thrive.  Nobody appears as they seem, and despite living on the wrong side of the law,  even the most corrupted inhabitants have a conscience.  This was an interesting book, and while I guessed some of the intentions of the characters, I missed others. I was entertained and well as surprised by the outcome.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GOYCY0L5OAQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312320264#wasThisHelpful","R2GOYCY0L5OAQ7","ACABSLRSDYYE5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACABSLRSDYYE5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Luckiest Girl Alive is dark and snarky, just like the main character, New York career woman, Ani Fanelli. Raised by an indifferent father and social climbing mother, Ani is enrolled in a prestigious private school where she jockeys for acceptance from the cool kids. Her brains take a back seat to her ambition and Ani is both abused and shunned. The book has a slow simmer to the supposed climax, jumping from the hard lights of the past to the brittle present. Everything about Ani screams success, from her envious spot as a writer for a magazine, to her picture perfect fiancé and the wedding of the decade. Ani holds onto her superior position, digging her claws into the slippery glass ceiling, and resting her suede, toeless booties on the hordes of women desperate to depose her. She covets her hard won prizes with vicious domination, and the reader is lulled into believing it's the result of her experiences at the hands of her cruel classmates. Then the book takes an unexpected left turn, where the words move out of focus and the reader must reevaluate the entire first half of the book. Ani's sharply defined angles blur, her motives as well as character reshape forcing the reader to rethink the personality, as well as the morality of the character. Just as you can't judge a book by it's cover, so can a reader not judge Ani. She comes barreling back into focus, her irritating competitiveness washing way, revealing the misunderstood victim buried under the dense armor. I loved this book. I loved that it surprised me, enough so I had to finish it in one sitting, reading until 3 A.M. How do you define a page turner- Luckiest Girl Alive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X5R44TLFQWBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476789630#wasThisHelpful","R1X5R44TLFQWBD","ACABSLRSDYYE5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACABSLRSDYYE5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a 10 year old Beagle who is a ""walking garbage can"". I like to say that he will eat anything that ""is or ever was food"" if you know what I mean. No matter what I do, he will eat anything. As a result, he gets terrible diarrhea and occassional vomiting. Since it doesn't go away on its own, I end up having to take him to the Emergency vet frequently, to be given fluids and anti-diarrheic meds (like Metronidazole which he has taken many times). This has happened multiple times while away on vacation, requiring for me to end my vacation early which was not ideal for both my dog and myself.While at the vet one visit, my Vet suggested that we try this product - Forti Flora for dogs. I purchased one box from my vet to try it out. One box is a 30-day supply. The box comes with 30 individual packets inside. Each day, you simply rip open the top of one of these little packets and sprinkle the stuff on your dog's food before eating it. It's light brown in color and has a few white speckles in it. My dog is NOT picky (of course) and he gobbles it up on his food like it wasn't even there.The most notable thing is this...this stuff actually WORKS. My dog continues to eat ""garbage"" on a daily basis, but as long as I am giving this to him each day, he can get through it. He has not had diarrhea since the first day that I started giving this to him! Since that was 5 months ago, that is a HUGE success in my book! He has no side effects at all from this. And, I know that it's working because I ran out of it and he had to go for 2 days before the next shipment arrived. During those two days, he was definitely feeling it - upset stomach and loose stool. As soon as he took this again, he was fine!Yes, this may be expensive for use on a daily basis for some people. But, for me, it's worth it. I now have confidence that I can take my dog on vacation and actually enjoy it and not have to go home early because of his intestinal issues.Fantastic product that I have already reordered many times and plan to continue to this every day going forward. You can buy these in individual boxes instead of this 3-pack if desired.  I vary depending on which has the better price at the time of reorder.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRN1APVVNETHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2T0XSW#wasThisHelpful","RRN1APVVNETHZ","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a 43 year old female who has a variet of health issues, including extreme muscle tightness at all times.  This issue is most severe in my forearms and my upper back and shoulder area.  I have participated in months of physical therapy and acupuncture which has allowed for me to function on a daily basis.  Although I have tried many, many muscle relaxers (Stay Calm Magnesium powder, Magnesium pills, Formula 303, SalonPas, Thermacare, etc etc etc), the only thing that has ever helped to loosen my muscles at all is acupuncture. For various reasons, I have not been able to attend acupuncture for more than a month, and wow, I am hurting because of this!  So, figured that I would try this out.This is a homeopathic solution, which is great for me, since I take a lot of medications for my various health issues and this type of product is less likely to interact with my other medications (please be sure to research this to be sure, however!).The product comes in a rollerball tube, where you unscrew the top to find a rollerball (just like roller deodorant works).  The product is clear.  You use the rollerball tube to roll the product onto your skin in the desired area and then rub it in with your hands.  It's not thick, but it's not thin - somewhere in between.  I would say almost like the consistency of suntan lotion but in a more liquid form.In regards to the smell, it is so faint, you can barely even tell that it has any smell at all. But, I have noticed that it might smell a bit like menthol, but it's so faint, I would wonder if everyone can even smell any scent at all both during and after you apply the product.It has a somewhat sticky consistency, and it remains on your skin like that for a few hours.  I didn't mind, as I was still able to get dressed with no issues (wearing casual clothing) about 5 minutes after applying it.So, how does it work?  I don't know why it works, but it works.  Seriously.  I don't have muscle cramping issues, so I can't comment on whether it works well or quickly with that issue.  But, for my extreme muscle tightness, it really helps.  And, other than acupuncture, nothing else has ever helped with this problem.  It took about 10 minutes for me to notice something, and it got better ever 30 minutes for the next two hours.In terms of how long do the results last, for me, for the muscle tightness issue, it lasted me for two days until I decided to reapply in order to try to relax my muscles even more.  After using this for about a week, I would say that the results from the initial applications (two) at still holding - unbelievable!  How is this possible?  How it is possible for a topical solution to have the same result on me as an acupuncture session?  I just don't know, but it does.  This product worked so well that I immediately ordered 6 more tubes of it.In terms of the size of the bottle, yes, it's not large.  It's the size of a rollerball deodorant.  I have used this three times in total (and used a lot of product in those three applications) and the bottle isn't even half empty.  Of course, it will vary depending on the size of the area of your skin that you are covering.  But, for me, I don't care if it is ""expensive"", if it works this well and saves me a trip to the Doctor's office for my acupuncture treatments (which cost me twice as much for one session), sold!I definitely recommend that you try this out, it's worth the risk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UA6TOCLLYY3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002OEBSUQ#wasThisHelpful","R2UA6TOCLLYY3O","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a 43 year old female with fine medium brown hair colored blonde and cut in a bob to my shoulders.  My hair is very dry, and does not hold color well.  I have used the Lanza and Matrix hair products and really love them.  But, I wanted to try something new so I ordered this product.Based on the reviews, I really expected to love this product.  A few nice things about it are that for my fine hair, it doesn't weigh it down like some moisturzing shampoo/conditioners do which is great.  Also, the smell is pleasant - unisex smell that reminds me an ""ocean breeze"" scent if that makes any sense.The things that I didn't like were that the shampoo dried my hair out, even though it was very easy to lather and seemed very gentle to my hair.  The conditioner is very creamy, and did balance out the drying effect of the shampoo a bit.  But, when I dried my hair, it was a bit dry.  For a moisturizing set, I had expected for it not to be dry, of course.Also, this will not apply to most people, but I found the bottles difficult to use.  They are very thick plastic, and since I have arthritis in my hands, I had a hard time squeezing them to get the product to come out.  Again, not really a factor for most people, but wanted to mention it.I think that based on the positive experience from the majority of other people, you may want to try it.  But, for me, I will stay with Lanza as this is more moisturizing for my hair type.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L2O9ZGWIM1CX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FYV0HM#wasThisHelpful","R1L2O9ZGWIM1CX","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a 43 year old female who has asthma, and as a result, I never wear fragrance as it irritates my asthma.  In the past, when I have tried to wear a fragrance, I either put so little on that I can't smell anything or too much that I am gaggling.  I gave up on trying to find a fragrance that worked for me years ago.But, in searching for another product here on Amazon, this product came up in my recommendations.  After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try.This product is a small glass bottle which contains the perfumed oil.  This is a thicker oil that you rub onto your skin in the desired locations with the rollerball dispenser at the top of the product (under the cap).  I really liked this design, as it allowed for me to control the amount of product very well.Also,  since it was an oil, the scent was much more long lasting that anything else that I have tried - lasting all day which was great.  Since it's small, it's very portable - I could take it with me in my purse if desired - but since the scent lasted all day, I didn't even need to do that.In regards to the smell, although I always have favored any kind of vanilla scent (which is why I wanted to try this product even without smelling it first), I found that it was just too musky for me.  The scent reminded me of my grandmother.  Just a little too musky for my taste.I did purchase the Lavinalla 4 piece mini set at the same time, which contains this exact set as part of that set in addition to three other scents with a vanilla base.  I have found that the Vanilla Lavender, Vanilla Coconut and Vanilla Grapefruit scents are better suited for what I was looking for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39BNJW9C3NBIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005Q8RLOY#wasThisHelpful","R39BNJW9C3NBIX","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the Jawbone activity bracelet from UP about 5 months ago.  As a result of cleaning binge that I recently went on at home, I misplaced (aka lost) the charging bracelet that comes with the bracelet with the initial purchase.  Thus, I had to order a replacement.Since I was so disappointed with not being able to use my bracelet due to the lost charger and battery that ran out, I ordered this product which is actually a 2-pack of the same item - 2 separate chargers.This product is identical to the charger that you receive when you buy the initial product which is great and important, since many times, the charger does not work as well or at all, for a replacement charger.

"I am a 42 year old female who is really warm all of the time.  This prevents me from getting much sleep, as I am really hot.  Depsite using cooling sheets and wearing moisture-wicking pajamas, in a room cooled by Central Air conditioning, I am still too hot to sleep.  I have tried other projects like a Bamboo mattress pad, Tempurature balancing mattress pad, the new Dual Temp Mattress pad from Sleep Number...nothing worked.For my last attempt to cool myself at night, I ordered the Chilipad.  It is fantastic!  A few important points...Setup:  It took me about 4 minutes to set this up.  You simply unroll the mattress pad and lay it on your bed, connect the hose to the control unit on the floor and plug it in, and fill it with water.  That's it. Super easy.Setting the Tempurature:  As you may know from reading other reviews, you set the tempurature (either on the device itself that sits on the floor next to your bed) or using the remote control.  The design is really good as the hoses are small and they come out of the top of the mattress pad (meaning, the part that is near your headboard or your feet, if you reverse it).  This is much better than the Sleep Number Dual Temp, where the hoses were HUGE and came out of the side only.I have only used this for cooling, of course.  When I plugged it in, the temp was 87 degrees.  It took about 1 1/2 hours to reach 53 degrees (in an air conditioned room).  When laying down to sleep, I decided that it was super cool and adjusted the temp frm 46 (the lowest) to 53.  As I slept, it was actually too cold for me (which is beyond amazing!) so I ended up increasing the temp until I hit 70 degrees which seemed to be perfect.  It held that tempurate all night - I was never too hot for the first time in years!Noise level:  Regarding the sound from the Control device, I cannot sleep with noise so this was my concern when purchasing this product.  But, it is very quiet.  When it is initially reaching the target temp, it is blowing at a higher rate.  But, once it reaches that temp, the fan speed slows down to whisper.  Even though I am sensitive to noise, it really was not an issue.  I am going to experiment with putting the control devices under the foot of my bed to reduce the noise even more, but really, it was not loud at all.  The Sleep Number Dual Temp mattress pad (which blows air instead of using water, like the Chilipad) was much louder.Timer:  Although I have not used these features (as I do not need them), you can set the timer so that it turns off after X number of hours (for example, it turns off in 4 hours). And, you can also set it so that you go to sleep with one tempurature and you wake up with another (for example, you go to sleep at 68 degrees and wake up with 72 degrees).Comfort:  In terms of comfort, this mattress pad is about 1 inch thick and it's very comfortable.  I read a review that said that the person could feel the tubes?  No way.  I can't feel anything.  I also can't hear the water moving through the tubes at all.  Super comfy.I haven't had the need to wash it yet, but apparently, the pad can be washed in your regular washing machine which is great.Update:  It took me three nights until I got it the way that I liked it - to figure out my ideal tempurature (it is 68 degrees, by the way) and also to position the control unit where the noise was less.  I would suggest that you try this for the first time when you don't have to wake up early the next day, as I didn't sleep too well for those first two nights while I was messing around with the temp and the position of the control unit, of course.Also, another benefit that I didn't expect - the sound of the fan on the unit acts like a ""white noise"" machine.  I have found that I am sleeping better now because I am not distracted by other sounds outside since the fan noise (even though it's very quiet) cancels the other noises out.  My dog slept through a thunderstorm because of this white noise - which he nevers does - great!In summary, fantastic product and well worth the price.

"I am a 42 year old female who is very warm all of the time, due to my nature and the medications that I am taking for my health.  As a result, I don't sleep - at all - due to being hot all of the time.  I have tried so many different products in order to try to keep myself cool at night (including various cooling sheets, tempurature-controlling mattress pads, the new Sleep Number Dual Temp Mattress pad, etc), including the purchase of this mattress pad.A few things to mention...the quality of this product is very good.  It comes folded up and you simply unfold it and put it on your bed just like any regular mattress pad.  It is a bit heavy - without looking this up in the product details, I would say that it's close to 10 pounds when folded up.  But, I was able to carry it without any issues.Part of the mattress pad unzips to come apart so that you can wash it, if you like.  The rest of it is made of this cooling gel that is across the majority of the surface where you would lay while in your bed.  Note:  The cooling gel does not cover the entire surface!  It does not come up to the part where your pillow would lay, for obvious reasons (you don't need it up there since your head is laying on a pillow).The gel itself is only about 1/2 inch thick.  The design is very good, as it is evenly distributed across and doesn't pool or gather unevenly into the cells. The coolness is created due to the gel and chemicals, I suppose - not quite sure how or why it works, but it works well.When you first lay down on it, it's very cold.  It gradually starts to warm up.  I found that I had a good 4 hours of cooling until it got too warm.  This is the best that I have seen in these products, as most won't last one or two hours before getting too warm to use. But, once it's warm, you have to move to another area for the rest of the night in order for it to cool down again.  Again, this is normal for this type of product.In terms of comfort, this was not too uncomfortable for me.  But, since I typically sleep on a soft mattress, this definitely made it feel like a firmer mattress just due to the design.My reasons for not giving it 5 stars...the product has a smell to it, similar to a new Memory Foam mattress.  This typically goes away after a week or two, but you need to be aware of this.  Also, although it cooled great for those 4 hours, it got very warm after that time, requiring me to move to the other side of the bed or actually take off the mattress pad.  For those who only need the cooling effect to fall asleep, this may not be an issue.  But, since I am hot all of the time, this was a problem for me.  Probably not realistic for me to expect this type of product to stay cool for 8 hours so, really not the fault of the product, just with my own expectations.Overall, I feel that this is a high-quality product and would not hesitate to recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G30Z5EHLJNVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BY3N022#wasThisHelpful","R1G30Z5EHLJNVK","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this item to use as a laptop desk when I am working at home but in a different location than my office (for example, while sitting on the couch).  I have problems with pain in my arms due to overusage, so it's really important that I have my laptop at the proper height.When you receive this product, it is actually compacted into a small square that almost looks like a laptop (it's about the same size).  You slide the back off and inside are the four legs that are able to be pulled out.  You simply slide out one or both of the extension pieces that are built into the legs and turn it to lock into place.  Great concept.  Then, you slide the leg into the opening under the desk and turn it to lock into place.  Again, great concept.The back cover that you slide off to reveal the storage compartment for the legs turns into an extension to the top of the desk for your mouse.  Really, great idea.The only issue is the quality of the product. It's lightweight (probably weighs one pound), which is key as most people would want to travel with it.  But, unfortunately, in this case, it also means that it's not very good quality.  I used this desk a total of 5 times and on the fifth time, one of the legs broke - the connection which is made of plastic broke and thus, it won't extend properly now.  I had to return it, as I could no longer use it at the desired height.One other point...for my intended usage, as a desk that you would sit at, you can't put your legs under it.  It is just way too narrow to actually sit under it as a desk.  Probably not an issue for anyone else but wanted to mention it.Although I am disappointed due to the poor quality of leg design, I really like it and will order a replacement if I can't find an alternate.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CYPLULS191DM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001EMA80#wasThisHelpful","R3CYPLULS191DM","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a very old wooden picket fence on one side of my yard.  This fence belongs to my neighbor.  It is so old and rotting that the wasps love it - at any given time, there are 15-20 wasps flying around and sitting on the fence.  Although they do not bother me or my dog, I have no doubt that if one of them flew too close to my dog, he would try to eat it and that would be not good, to say the least.I don't want to hurt the wasps (they are not making a nest), but I wanted for them to go someplace else.  I never use toxic chemicals in my yard at all and wanted to find something natural instead.  I found this product and decided to give it a try.You are ordering two individual spray bottles of the product with this order.  It smells like orange oil and is a clear liquid with the consistency of water.  I sprayed this generously on half of the fence as a test to see if it worked.  Although the wasps moved out of the way while I was spraying, they immediately came right back to the area as if nothing happened.  And, I watched them over the course of the next two days to see if there was any difference - nothing.So, basically, I just spent almost $35 on two bottles which I will end up dumping down the drain.  Based on my experience, don't waste your money.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TBU5MOMWJ7YS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0070D0T88#wasThisHelpful","R3TBU5MOMWJ7YS","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a 42 year old female who dresses casually whenever possible. In the Summer, this includes my standard wardrobe of shorts, a tshirt and Nike sneakers.  Due to some of the medications that I am taking, I am really, really hot all of the time.  Thus, I was looking for any opportunity to keep myself cooler.  I found these shorts at my local Boscov's department store and decided to try them.I absolutely love these shorts!  They are made of cotton, but it has almost a silken feel to it.  They lay perfectly on your body -not too form fitting and don't cling to any areas that you don't want to highlight (like my stomach which hasn't been flat since I was 12 years old). They are super soft and very lighweight (the inside of the side pockets is actually mesh which allows for superior venting and coolness).  These shorts do wrinkle if not properly folded and stored but I never iron them as the wrinkles come out within minutes of wearing them.The other great thing about these shorts is that it has sun block protection built into the fabric.  They call it ""Omni"" and it is supposed to prevent the sunrays from getting through to your skin.  For me, this is not really a concern as I have a medium skin tone and tan (and rarely burn).  But, it that effect keeps me a bit cooler, than it's great.  I also noticed that it doesn't stick to my skin if it's really hot outside and I am sweating - you can't even see it on the shorts.  They are not waterproof, but dry almost instantly (I wore these on an amusement park water ride where I was drenched and they were barely wet and dried within 5 minutes!).Due to the factors that I mentioned above, I am definitely cooler when I am wearing these shorts no matter what the heat/humidity is outside.I love these shorts so much, I ordered a dozen more of them from Back Country website (cheaper than Amazon or Boscov's) in various colors.  It's part of my daily wardrobe now - love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G19VLKRX49ET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M8RSGK#wasThisHelpful","R2G19VLKRX49ET","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I currently have a Weight Watchers scale, which I have used for many years.  It's not perfect, but I am used to it and it's ok for me.  I spend time in two different locations, thus, I wanted to purchase a scale to have in both places (so that I didn't have to carry it around with me).  I wanted to be as consistent as possible, so I ordered another WW brand scale (since the model that I have is no longer available).This scale is VERY HEAVY.  It is made of glass - the section that you step on is completely glass.  The LCD display is very large, but hard to read at times since there is no backlight on it (t's black numbers against a dark grey background).The biggest complaint is that the scale actually doesn't work.  First, you are supposed to tap the scale in order to turn it on (just like my other WW scale).  But, no matter how hard you tap this, it doesn't turn on.  I physically have to lift the scale off of the groud to get it to turn on!Next, the weight is not accurate.  It changes as you are standing on it!  If you step on the scale, get a measurement, step off, and do this again, you will never get the same weight value.  This is unbelievable.  I was wearing the same clothes, in the same location, standing in the same place on the scale, doing this within seconds of each test, and got different results every single time.  My current WW scale is also not great with this - I have to weigh myself 3 times in a row and try to take the average of those weights to figure out my actual weight.  But, with my current scale, usually, two of the three are the same.  With this scale, every single time, every weight is different (even off by one or two pounds!).  Obviously, this is not acceptable.I returned this product the day after I received it.  Will not order another WW scale again.  Ordered a scale from EatSmart - hopefully, this will work like it should.  Would not recommend this product based on my experience.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14MU95CQ94G8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OVGMOM#wasThisHelpful","R14MU95CQ94G8A","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a 42 year old female who has brown hair that is colored blonde with different color highlights, cut in a bob to my shoulders. My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it. My hair grows very quickly (between 3/4 and 1 1/4 inches a month, depending on the season). Thus, I need to get my hair colored every 5 weeks in order to manage the roots.My hair also starts to ""fade out"" as I am getting closer to the next color session - my highlights seem to get a bit dim, for lack of a better term. I read about this product and decided to try it - bought it at my local drug store (Rite Aid).I typically use Matrix Biolage Strengthening shampoo and conditioner every day as part of my regular routine.I purchased both the Highlight activating shampoo and conditioner and used them together. This comes in two different types - one for lighter blond highlights and the other for darker blonde highlights. Even though my darkest color would be considered dark blonde, since my lighest highlights are very light blonde, I opted for the product designed for lighter highlights thinking that for me, it's ok if my darker highlights became lighter, but not the other way around.Both the shampoo and the conditioner are light yellow in color, with a bit of pearly white mixed in. The smell is nice - just smells clean and not too strong. No scent remained on my hair after it was dry.I used the same amount of shampoo and conditioner that I normally do. Lather was normal - as expected. My issue is this...this shampoo completely stripped my hair. My hair was so dry and brittle after using this, I was afraid to even comb through it. The conditioner was not overly heavy - I think that it did a good job of preventing tangles but could not compensate for how drying the shampoo was to my hair.My hair was definitely brighter - I could even tell when it was wet after one use! But, even after returning to my regular shampoo, it took a few days for the texture of my hair to return to normal. This product, according to the label, has Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in it, which is apparently really damaging to your hair. This may explain it? Not sure...The effects of the brightening did last over the following week and didn't fade again which is ideal since I shouldn't have to use this every day for weeks in order to get/keep the effect.In summary, I will use this only once a week during the week or two prior to getting my hair colored to help get through that difficult period, but would never consider using this on a more frequent basis due to the excessive stripping that occured.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XBHUTX2P9LPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0067YUKJ4#wasThisHelpful","R1XBHUTX2P9LPX","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had a CaseMate iphone case identical to this (minus the kickstand) which I used for years with my iphone 4.  I recently upgraded to iphone 5, and thus, due to the size difference of these phone models, needed to purchase a new case.  I learned the hard way with my first iphone 3GS that I need a sturdy case at all times since I dropped that phone and cracked the glass.  Not fun.I really like this case for multiple reasons...first, it's very light weight and slim.  I had previously purchased the Otter brand cases and others but disliked them as they were so bulky and heavy.  This case adds very light weight and width to the profile of your phone which is ideal.Next, it has rubber sides which makes it easier to hold and prevents it from sliding.  This is great since I use my phone as a GPS navigator sometimes in the car, and this case allows for me to sit it on my dashboard horizontally for easier viewing but prevents from it from sliding back and forth while driving (the other cases that I had in the past did not do this, and my dash was scratched up as a result!).The opening at the bottom of the case is very wide which allows for easy access to the charging port and earbug plug-in.  Also, the power button sticks out of the top but is covered, but is easily pushed on/off.The things that I would say about this device that could be improved (thus, my rating of only 4 stars) is the size of the hole in the cover for the vibrate button.  It's not very accessible and you may need to use a tool to turn this on or off (my fingers are very small and I struggle with this).  Also, the kickstand on the back - although it is very helpful when I viewing video or typing long emails on my phone (with the assistance of a Bluetooth keyboard that I purchased for this purpose as I use this phone for work) - it is pretty thin and I fear that it will break after just a few uses.  As a result, I have avoided using this for that reason (which is not ideal, of course).In summary, love the quality of the cases from CaseMate - these are the only ones that I will buy going forward.  But, this one could be done a bit better.  I would still purchase this style again, though, if needed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XXGLSTEUA02F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008U6PZO2#wasThisHelpful","R1XXGLSTEUA02F","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Black and Decker blender, model BLC12650H (color white).  I am not sure how it happened, but I got a large crack in the glass blender jar that came with the blender (think that this occurred through my misuse/poor storage).

It is an inch or two shorter in height than the original blender jar but that is not really an issue for me.  Please note that you are only ordering the glass portion of the blender jar here - the plastic top does not come with this product.

"I have a 10 year old Beagle who is a ""walking garbage can"". I like to say that he will eat anything that ""is or ever was food"" if you know what I mean. No matter what I do, he will eat anything. As a result, he gets terrible diarrhea and occassional vomiting. Since it doesn't go away on its own, I end up having to take him to the Emergency vet frequently, to be given fluids and anti-diarrheic meds (like Metronidazole which he has taken many times). This has happened multiple times while away on vacation, requiring for me to end my vacation early which was not ideal for both my dog and myself.While at the vet one visit, my Vet suggested that we try this product - Forti Flora for dogs. I purchased one box from my vet to try it out. One box is a 30-day supply. The box comes with 30 individual packets inside. Each day, you simply rip open the top of one of these little packets and sprinkle the stuff on your dog's food before eating it. It's light brown in color and has a few white speckles in it. My dog is NOT picky (of course) and he gobbles it up on his food like it wasn't even there.The most notable thing is this...this stuff actually WORKS. My dog continues to eat ""garbage"" on a daily basis, but as long as I am giving this to him each day, he can get through it. He has not had diarrhea since the first day that I started giving this to him! Since that was 5 months ago, that is a HUGE success in my book! He has no side effects at all from this. And, I know that it's working because I ran out of it and he had to go for 2 days before the next shipment arrived. During those two days, he was definitely feeling it - upset stomach and loose stool. As soon as he took this again, he was fine!Yes, this may be expensive for use on a daily basis for some people. But, for me, it's worth it. I now have confidence that I can take my dog on vacation and actually enjoy it and not have to go home early because of his intestinal issues.Fantastic product that I have already reordered many times and plan to continue to this every day going forward.

"I had low voltage landsape lights (4 Watt bulb) that were made from Malibu - I purchased them at Home Depot about 10 years ago.  These lights were made of plastic, and were set up outside in my mulch beds to provide accent lighting.  After years of fighting with the lights staying in their post (and not falling over), I decided to purchase new lights.I liked the style of my old lights, but wanted something in metal with tops that connected securely to the ground post and that were bright and durable.  I found nothing, but really liked these lights as they met all of my criteria - bright, metal, same style, and well made.  But, they are supposed to PATHWAY lights (instead of accent lights for your mulch bed, for example).  The difference is that pathway lights are brighter (which is great, what I wanted) but are a lot taller than accent lights (these come with two connecting posts that make the light about 10 inches high (off the ground).  They use the standard low voltage lighting but the plastic is very transparent and thus, allow for a brighter light.I purchased these lights initially in Home Depot to test them out and then ordered them here as Home Depot did not stock the quantity that I needed (and I find ordering from Amazon very easy and reliable).  Thus, I ordered the majority of the quantity from here.I installed these in my mulch beds earlier this Summer and they are holding up well.  These lights are not solar - you need to purchase the low voltage lighting wire and power station separately.  If you are not sure what to purchase, I would suggest that you ask someone at your local Home Depot or other similar store first.Overally, very pleased with my purchase - good quality lights.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ICRBYWBHD6AB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZRPM7W#wasThisHelpful","R3ICRBYWBHD6AB","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I work in a corporate office, and also work remotely (from home) a few days a week.  As a result, I need a very good speaker phone to use for my conference calls that I take from home.  I bought the starter set for this phone from my local Target store - it included the base station (which is your answering machine and charger for one of the phones) and three additional individual phones.  I purchased this product which is an additional phone to go with the starter set.  Note:  This does not work on its own - it allows you to extend the existing grouping to another individually operated phone but it needs the overall starter set to work.This phone is great for many reasons...first, it has light up numbers.  I find this very helpful if I am working at night, even if the desk lamp is on.Also, the battery life on each individual phone is excellent - on my last cordless speaker phone, I was lucky if I got 3 hours out of it.  This can last for twice that time - up to 6 hours of non-stop usage.  The phone display includes a battery icon so you know how much battery life is left.  When/if I run out of the battery on one of these phones, I just replace it with one of the other phones located in another rooms of my house and replace the other to its charging station to recharge.Most importantly, the audio quality is excellent.  I often use the phone in speaker phone mode (just press a button on the individual cordless handset to turn it into a speaker phone!) and the audio quality is great - crystal clear audio quality.The phone also does your standard stuff like show you call waiting list, allow for you to adjust the volume on the individual handset, the ringer tone, Mute button, etc.  All of these features work as you would expect.Also, if you haven't ordered a new cordless phone recently, it is important to note that the phones these days do not require you to connect to a phone line.  To be specific...only the base station needs to be connected to a phone line.  All of the other individual cordeless phones (like the one that you would be purchasing  here) connect to the base station wirlessly to talk on the phone.  How awesome is that?  Now, you can put the phone anywhere you like, as long as there is an electrical outlet there (since each of the individual phones require for their charging station to be plugged in).As noted, I retired the two other phones that I had in my house and ordered this product to expand the individual phones in my house - love this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z2QPQ62NXV4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OA6VQ4#wasThisHelpful","R2Z2QPQ62NXV4Y","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a 9 year old Beagle who never had an issue with noise or thunderstorms.  But, two years ago, during the summetime, we had terrible weather with very heavy thunderstorms every night for a week.  They were so loud, that I was even scared!  He started to pace back and forth across the room, whimpering and shaking in fear.  I tried to sit with him on the couch or the floor, holding him with my arms around him and putting a blanket on him - it didn't work.  I even let him sleep in my bed with me (instead of in his bed on the floor next to mine) to try to comfort him, with no success.  He would cry and pace around my bedroom all night - keeping me awake and basically comatose for work the next day.After two days of this, I asked a few friends if they knew anything that would help and they suggested this product (I had never heard of it before then).  Since he takes medications for various medical conditions, I did not want to give him any kind of meds in fear of a conflict with his current mediciations, so this was a good option.  I was skeptical at first, but after multiple sleepness night due to his pacing and crying, and his ongoing discomfort, I would have tried anything.  I found it on Amazon and ordered it for immediate delivery.The product is made from a heavy-duty fabric - it's cotton with a bit of stretch in it.  It has super wide velcro straps, which you use to wrap around the dog like a coat.  The first strap goes around the neck/chest area and the second one around the middle in order to have a tight but comfortable fit.  Since the material is stretchy, it can be tight but still comfortable.The idea is that the tight wrap makes the dog feel secure.  The instructions tell you that you are supposed to put it on when they are calm (before they get scared), to prevent or minimize the fear when the thunderstorm starts.  But, in my case, I put it on him after an hour of him crying and shaking during a thunderstorm (again, keeping me awake all hours of the night).  Within 15 minutes of putting this on him, he stopped crying and shaking and laid down and fell asleep!  I absolutely cannot believe it.  I don't know how it works, I don't know why it works, but I am telling you, it works great.  I take this with me every time that we travel just in case.  I have told everyone that I know with a dog about this and it's fantastic!One important note:  My Beagle is about 35 pounds (with a very muscular chest) and he fits just perfectly in the Large size.  My cousin has a 100 lb Lab and even the XXL doesn't fit him which sucks.  So, if you have a mid size dog or smaller, this is the product for you.  Try it, you will not regret it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQL3Y39SIK12G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028QK6EY#wasThisHelpful","RQL3Y39SIK12G","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I work in a Corporate office and my desk in located in an area that is quite loud.  Thus, I was looking for a headset that would help reduce the noise level and would allow for me to listen to music on my computer.  I occassionally create audio recordings as part of my job using my computer, so I wanted to purchase a headset with voice recording functionality, as well.This headset is wireless - meaning, you don't plug it into your laptop like you used to - you plug the small black receiver into one of the USB ports on your compueter and that's it.  Since many of the new laptops no longer have plugs for microphone and headset anymore, this is ideal.In order for this to work, it has a battery inside of one of the ear pieces.  This product also comes with a charger which you plug into an electrical outlet and then connect to the port on one of the ear pieces.  The end of the port which connects to the ear piece is transparent, and changes color when it is charging (orange means charging in place, green means that charging is complete).  It takes about 2 hours to fully charge the device.  But, it lasts for a very long time - my best guess is that it lasts about 50 hours before you need to charge it again (when used for listening to audio only, without the microphone).The microphone is a heavy thick plastic that can rotate up and out of your way when you are not using it, and want to just use the headphones.  The clarity of the audio from the microphone is very good.Regarding the sound quality, it's very good.  Very clear and noticably better than your average headset.  This is not advertised as noise cancelling, but it does a decent job at that, too, minimizing background noise when you have them on your head (whether you are listening to music or not).The ear pieces are made of with thick foam, which covered in a soft, rubbery type of plastic coating.  They are comfortable, but I find that after wearing them for more than 30 minutes, my ears start to hurt and get red.  I have to readjust the fitting of the ear pieces which is not ideal.Overall, a good product which I use on a weekly basis.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A8QP4BNO27FG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015EY5RE#wasThisHelpful","R3A8QP4BNO27FG","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this product prior to a trip from the US to Germany, as you need an adapter for any electrical devices in order to use them in Germany since their outlets are different from ours.  This product includes 2 of these adapters.As shown, they are pretty simple - they take a regular three-prong plug and convert it into a three-prong plug which fits into German electrical outlets.  Note:  Although this is intended to convert a three-prong plug, you can also use this with a two prong plug which is great.Overall, the plastic is a good quality - seems to be a well built product.

"I am 42 years old, with very fine brown hair (just above my shoulders cut in a layered bob) that I have colored blonde. My hair has a natural wave to it. As a result, it's never as shiny as I would like for it to be. I use L'anza hair products which I really love, and try to get it shiny with the InStyler which does a good job. But, it never looks as good as when I leave the salon which is what I am always trying to achieve.I saw the infomercial with Allysa Milano and figured, why not? I read all of the reviews here before purchasing but figured that it was worth a shot - I purchased the Sweet Almond Mint scent first (which is supposed to be for all hair types). When this was very heavy and made my hair feel greasy and too soft (beleve it or not, that is possible), I decided to try to Cucumber since it was designed for people with Fine hair.I agree with many of the reviewer comments - the smell is very strong when you are applying it but it's faint when your hair is dry. It looks and feels like you are washing your hair with conditioner. I used less than the recommended number of pumps for my hair length due to how fine my hair is (I typically use less styling product, as well, due to my fine hair) - total of 15 pumps which sufficiently covered my hair with no issues. I massaged it in for 2 minutes, used a wide tooth comb to evenly distribute and left it on for 5 additional minutes. I rinsed it off well and then used 1 pump as a leave-in conditioner.My hair is super soft and shinier than usual, and it feels clean but a bit greasy. But, in my case, it's almost TOO SOFT. I will need to use a ton of additional styling products in order to have any kind of control over my hair. I can say that if my hair style was loose and wavy, it would be perfect. But, my layered bob with bangs does not do as well with this product. I would never be able to make my hair straight after using this as it's just too soft.As I did with the Sweet Almond Mint bottle, I gave this to a coworker with longer, thick hair and she loved it.  I think that this product is just not designed for people with fine hair.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OWZE4AO4QL4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003W5YCVI#wasThisHelpful","R3OWZE4AO4QL4K","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this product because I was looking for a squirt gun that I could put into my dog walking bag and use in case a runaway dog came as my dog and I during a walk (believe it or not, this happens quite often in my neighborhood).  This product comes with 12 of these very tiny squirt guns - they are onoy about 3 inches wide.  They hold very little water, and after about 3 or 4 squirts, they are empty.  They squirt the water only about 6 inches and it's not a strong stream.  I should have returned them, but I just decided to donate them instead.In summary, if you are looking for a throw away gift for kids at a birthday party, for example, this is perfect.

"I live in the suburbs of Philadephia, in a heavily wooded area.  Even though we live in a highly-populated area, due to the extensive trees and shrubs, we have a lot of wildlife that is not shy about walking through or even living in our backyards. This would not be an issue, however, I have a Beagle who will chase anything that comes in our yard.  Of course, once, we chased and cornered a skunk and that was a disaster.So, in order to avoid any unwanted animal encounters in my backyard, I wanted a very bright flashlight that I could use to check the yard before letting my dog out at night.  Over the years, I have purchased dozens of flashlights (most recently, the Mag light - in 3 different sizes...) and all of them were lousy.  Big, heavy, not bright enough.  I found this flashlight at my local hardware store.  I chose to buy it because in the store on the shelf, it had packaging that let you test it out right there.  When I turned it on, even in the well-light store, I could barely see - it was so bright!  If it was that bright in a store in the daylight, I figured that it had to be bright at night.This flashlight is like your own personal sunlight!  It is so small - it's only about 4 inches long and 1 inch wide.  It takes AA batteries which go inside the handle.  it is made of a high-quality metal and heavy duty plastic cover for the light.  You press the button at the bottom of the handle to turn it on and off.  When you turn this thing on, it's like it's daylight!  Wherever you shine it, it's literally like you are looking at daylight.This is the best flashlight that I have ever used.  I have already bought more of these to give to my family, and to keep in my car in case of an emergency.  It's so small and light, I should also buy one to keep in my purse.  It is expensive, but based on the quality of this light, you will use it for years to come - it's worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPED85NNFT3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JWB34G#wasThisHelpful","R2YPED85NNFT3O","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"live in the suburbs of a large city in Northeast US. We have a lot of mature landscaping in our area, which makes it very appealing for wildlife of all sorts. About two months ago, two skunks moved into our neighborhood. I am an animal lover, but after a few close run-ins by my neighbor and I with the skunks (I almost stepped on one going out my front door!), I decided to find a way to encourage them to stay away from my home area. I have a dog, and based on their proximity and frequency (we were seeing them on a daily basis), it was inevitable that I and my dog would end up with skunk spray which is not good. I did not want to hurt them, just did not want for them to feel so comfortable in the immediate area.I did some research on the internet, and found out about this product. I would never use chemicals to hurt them or any animal, and this seemed like a good solution. I read the reviews, which seemed to indicate that it worked as long as you read the instructions. Needless to say, it works! I have not seen the skunks since the first day that I put it out. Previously, we were seeing them daily!It's been about 4 weeks since I started using it. It comes in a plastic can that looks almost like a parmesan cheese container. It opens just like that, too. You are supposed to shake it out lightly around your property. Since I didn't think that the skunks were living in my yard (I could smell them in the next block when I walked my dog each morning, so I think that they live there), I used it around my property line. You are supposed to use it twice a week for two weeks and then twice a week after that. It worked great with the skunks. And, my dog (who is a Beagle and has a very sensitive nose) didn't seem to mind it at all, although I used it on the property line where he does not hang out often.One point...it really stinks, so I would recommend that you keep it in an outdoor location. Also, it says that it's supposed to work on bunnies (which I didn't care about being in my yard) but I have seen two bunnies since putting it out so I don't know that it would work as well on them. But, as I said, it's been 4 weeks and no sign of the skunks.

"In order to prevent wildlife from getting into my garbage and recycling cans outside, I replaced my old plastic cans with these metal cans from Behrens (made in the USA, which is great).  I bought them at my local Home Depot store.  They are very light weight and durable - I keep them outside at all times to store garbage and recycling.The one thing that I don't like about them is that they do not have wheels.  Even though they are lightweight, as a female, it is difficult for me to lift the cans when they are full of garbage to take them out to curbiside for garbage pickup.  Home Depot didn't carry the cart, so I ordered that here from Amazon.First, the cart comes deassembled - you need to follow the directions in order to put it together.  I hate doing this, but it's logical that it would be shipped like this due to the size of it.  It took me about 15 minutes to put it together.  It's not heavy duty - the metal is made of a thinner aluminum.The two cans fit inside the cart and sit on two of the thin aluminum metal rods at the bottom, which suspend it about 2 inches above the ground.  The two cans fit, but often slide forward and hit the wheels which makes the cart get stuck and not roll properly.Also, in order for it to roll, you have to lift the end of the cart with the handle off of the ground.  When the cans are filled and heavy, this is difficult to do as you have to keep it elevated in order for it to roll.  I think that this would have been a lot better if they had made wheels on both sides of the cart and put a locking device to keep it in place if needed.I still use this on a daily basis as I haven't tried to find a better replacement.  But, if I had to do it over again, I would find something else.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGZ7RR7BXJOGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001N7SSV2#wasThisHelpful","RGZ7RR7BXJOGH","A3B83GRTAX6QOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B83GRTAX6QOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"George Perez isn’t exactly a name comics fans link with the Fantastic Four. When he served as the main artist for that series in the late 70s/early 80s, he was still learning his craft. The second volume of the “Fantastic Four Visionaries” series focusing on Perez features some charming comics from his run, mostly written by Lou Wein. These are fun comics and the art is excellent. But, without any context, the plots can fail to hold readers’ attention. There are some excellent reproductions of pin-ups by Perez. Honestly, as good a job as Perez does here, Marvel made a mistake by focusing on an artist as opposed to a writer. This book should appeal more to Perez fans than Fantastic Four ones--and even here the artist had not yet his prime.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17EMCKIU6CSD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785120602#wasThisHelpful","R17EMCKIU6CSD6","A7WH560VVUXB2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WH560VVUXB2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alan Davis tries to offer a conclusion for a classic Marvel team in “Fantastic Four: The End,” which is odd since Stan Lee attempted to do the same thing earlier. Davis is a solid writer and artist and he wraps things up for the team. There are some fine moments to be sure and some knowing asides and tributes to other comics and sci-fi stories. Davis gets most of the themes that make the Fantastic Four great: family relations, pushing the boundaries of the imagination, having the heroes explore look ahead to the future. But there’s one plot element undermining the book. Davis keeps the team members apart for too much of this book, leaving to less banter and humor than what could have been offered. Going through this book, it appears Davis is preaching towards the converted instead of trying to appeal to new fans. Fantastic Four fans will enjoy this book--it really is geared towards them--but some comic fans will simply shrug it off.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1US7VWCF31QWK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785119450#wasThisHelpful","R1US7VWCF31QWK","A7WH560VVUXB2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WH560VVUXB2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Francois Furstenberg offers an interesting take on the Atlantic world and early American history in “When the United States Spoke French.” Tracing the lives of five men who fled the French Revolution (the only major name here is the great diplomat Talleyrand) and settled in Philadelphia, Furstenberg offers glimpses in social history, the shaping of the frontier, art and economics. Furstenberg relies heavily on primary sources, including letters, but he also ties in secondary sources and presents some memorable insights and offers some interesting side tracks through history. This is a unique look at early America and offers an interesting look at a very different and overlooked side of the Age of Federalism. The writing is somewhat inconsistent as Furstenberg often shifts from a dryer, academic style to much more vivid and engaging writing. This usually works but there are some admittedly dull pages. Despite this, the book carves its own niche in a increasingly crowded bookshelf, no small achievement. Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CJ4GIH8Y6ZRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204411#wasThisHelpful","R1CJ4GIH8Y6ZRY","A7WH560VVUXB2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WH560VVUXB2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The core of the “Fantastic Four” focuses on family and pushing the boundaries of the imagination. Both are on center stage in this collection of comics as Mark Waid continues his solid run as writer with Mike Wieringo doing a solid job as he leads the art team. Waid takes longtime nemesis Dr. Doom in a different direction here, playing up his sorcerous abilities and how Mr. Fantastic, a logician who embraces science, has to respond to it. Included in the mix is how Doom threatens the Richards family and how the various Fantastic Four members respond to it. The result is a solid, exciting story with memorable moments, some humor, interesting plot twists and excellent character development. The story also includes a remarkable epilogue which ties up various elements. This ranks as one of the best Fantastic Four collections out there.

"Rush’s “Presto” was that band’s last album in the 1980s and my first exposure to the band when I was 15. A nice blend of strong guitar by Alex Lifeson, drums and lyrics by Neil Peart and bass, keyboards and vocals by Geddy Lee, “Presto” is a bit of an overlooked album in Rush’s collection, probably because many of the songs simply did not achieve the airplay and fame of some of their other efforts. “Show Don’t Tell,” the first track on the album, is probably the most well known of the songs here. Despite being somewhat wary of authority in the lyrics, it’s a catchy song. There are some other ear worms on the album like “Hand Over Fist,” “Scars” and “Superconductor.” Some of the songs hold up very well including the title track, “Chain Lightning” and “Available Light.” Others-- “War Paint” and “The Pass”--are more forgettable but certainly not bad. After a quarter of a century, this album remains fresh and extremely listenable. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RJPV50MWZASE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002NRQTS#wasThisHelpful","R3RJPV50MWZASE","A7WH560VVUXB2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WH560VVUXB2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch turned their attention to the “Fantastic Four” after their run on the “Ultimates”with decidedly mixed results. Hitch’s art is subtle and always interesting, even engaging. Millar is--usually--a fine comics writer but there are major problems with the start of his run on the FF. Millar certainly has some good ideas, ranging from a created world and what the powerful want to do with it (though a scene with George W. Bush and Condi Rice connected to it simply doesn’t hold up). But the execution stalls. An insanely powerful robot shows up, beats up all the Marvel heroes off screen and (spoiler) only loses thanks to an underwhelming plot device. The characterization seems a bit off on some of the heroes--the Human Torch is played up as too idiotic, the Thing rushes into a serious relationship in the blink of an eye without his usual doubts and fears--though Millar does a fine job with Sue and Reed Richards. There are two key elements to the Fantastic Four: they are a family and they push the boundaries of the imagination. Millar does a fine job with the second but not the first. As such, this book is average, even slightly forgettable and disappointing based on Millar’s previous hits.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XRJAZF1HYY7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FSRFQDG#wasThisHelpful","R1XRJAZF1HYY7C","A7WH560VVUXB2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7WH560VVUXB2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In ""The Land That Never Was: Sir Gregor MacGregor And The Most Audacious Fraud In History,"" David Sinclair looks at one of the great con jobs of all time. Gregor MacGregor won same fame as a minor military figure and adventurer in the New World after Napoleon's fall. From there, MacGregor conned hundreds of English and Scottish settlers to invest their life savings to buy land on the Mosquito Coast, claiming he led a utopian like nation. Sinclair shows how MacGregor pulled off his con and, with a few minor problems, essentially got away with it.  Sinclair is a sharp writer about money and offers a solid biographical account of MacGregor. Still, there are points when Sinclair relies on large chunks of primary source material. That works to some extent, especially when the focus is on MacGregor's victims. There are lessons to be learned from the strange career of Gregor MacGregor and Sinclair offers a readable and valuable account of it.

"More than 30 years, when I was attending second and third grade in the suburbs of Philadelphia, I would rush home to watch “Star Blazers,” an epic space opera featuring a brave crew of adventurers traveling across the universe to save Earth. Having recently watched the entire first season, I find it holds up very well--and certainly much better than your humble reviewer has over the last three decades.Despite animation which is unimpressive by today’s standards, the first season of “Star Blazers” presents an engaging story which will draw viewers’ interest. The exciting plot and sweeping story will still appeal to younger viewers. So will the characters. One of the major themes of the series is the maturation of young Derek Wildstar who goes from a brash loudmouth to a responsible commander. Even the supporting cast make an impression. So do the villains, including the rash Lysus and the enigmatic but engaging Desslok.There are many themes here to be sure: courage, sacrifice, commitment, love. Younger viewers may be troubled by the battle scenes (though there is no gore) and not all of our heroes come back alive. There’s certainly more to the story and it’s pretty clear that Dessolk is a stand-in for Hitler with Lysus as Rommel and other German commanders. Still, most viewers between the ages of 8-12, perhaps a few older ones, will appreciate this epic series. Some of the scenes and the music have been imprinted in my brain for more than 30 years; it’s that memorable.

"Neil Jordan hit another home run with the “Borgias” and the second season proves as strong as the first.This excellent historic drama focuses on the Spanish family that held the papacy and the Papal States in its grasp at the end of the 15th/start of the 16th centuries. While the music, sets and costumes are all excellent, this series is held together by a wonderful group of actors including the masterful Jeremy Irons as Pope Alexander VI, Franois Arnaud as Cesare Borgia and Holliday Grainger as Lucrezia Borgia. Two of the stars from the first season-- Lott Verbeek as Giulia Farnese and Colm Feore as Cardinal Della Rovere--get less screen time and that is a problem as both of them are excellent. The writing is fast-paced and generally comes together along with fine drama, tense moments and an epic feel. The special features continue to underwhelm but the second season has more than the first. Still, this is a great show.

"“Captain America: The Bloodstone Hunt” is a fun collection of comics but extremely unoriginal. Mark Gruenwald is a strong writer for Captain America and the art team led by Kieron Dwyer does a fine job. But while these comics have some fine moments--including the debut of Crossbones--this story is familiar, perhaps overly familiar: a pursuit against Nazis for a lost ancient artifact, snake filled pit in Egypt, made South American tribe chasing our hero, trips through Asia, squabbling romantic leads.....yeah it’s pretty much Captain America in the first three Indiana Jones movies. Despite some fun moments, it simply doesn’t work. Not every hero can be inserted in every story. Captain America simply doesn’t wear Indiana Jones’ shoes well just as Indiana Jones doesn’t fit into sci-fi stories (as viewers of “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” can attest).

"Love it, we sleep on a pillow top mattress that just needed that little bit of extra plush to soften the mattress contours. I can see that this might not be adequate on a lower-end mattress as the plush offers a distinct softness but limited support when lying down. The sides are long enough to fit the mattress without over stretching. The cloth material is a polyester that does not retain heat like some plush mattress pads (Pinzon Basics Overfilled Ultra Soft Microplush Queen Mattress Pad, though this one does offer more support).Overall, I am a happy sleeper.

"I've been a PaintShop user from way back when it was a JASC product. It has always been the less expensive alternative to Photoshop with much of the functionality. I have had mixed feelings about the Corel versions as they tend to be slower loading with a fairly large system footprint and in the more recent versions almost as cumbersome and confusing as Photoshop.This current offering continues to suffer from those flaws (but only enough to cost them one star in the rating) though still offering the features that I have always valued in Paintshop. The tool is easy enough to use, once you pass the initial learning curve, and priced to make it accessible to the non-corporate user. Installation was easy and uneventful, startup on my dual-core system was slow as expected, but ran smoothly once up.One feature that continues to improve over the years is the shape fitting selection (something that used to be the shape or outline wizard and is now being called Magic Move), still not perfect and does require a little help with touch-up, but leaps and bounds over what used to be required to cut and move a non-standard shape within a picture. I still love the layering (originally discovered it in Photoshop, and loved when introduced to PaintShop).Overall, a solid set of improvements on the previous version, maybe enough to warrant springing for the upgrade if you still run version 7, any version earlier than that is a definite candidate for upgrade.

"Very reminiscent of Heroscape (yes, the tiles are compatible).The components: decent quality plastic miniatures (only the planes walkers are painted) the monsters are divided among the familiar MtG colors - blue, green, red, white and black, the map is cardboard large sections with smaller plastic tiles. The cards are not to the quality of the MtG playing cards but will suffice.Game play: so much like Heroscape with a flavoring of Magic the Gathering. Essentially, this is a dice battle game, any number of which exist on the market, I won't deride the randomness, MtG had it in the card draw, but I prefer the fixed damage of the card game versus the dice rolling. The game plays well and can be either fast paced or strategic depending upon the players' moods. I cannot say that the game plays well in 3 or 5 player games or a 4 player free for all. The game plays best with 1 vs 1 or team play.Overall, this is an entertaining game that will probably disappoint hardcore MtG players and Heroscape fans alike. That said, the vast majority of other players will find the game entertaining and a reasonable variation on the exisiting dice combat games already on the market.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D30CMA7KAEQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SDJGCRA#wasThisHelpful","R1D30CMA7KAEQA","AG90OGHDGOOVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG90OGHDGOOVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The game is fun to play, not excessively burdened with complex rules - essentially you play a card, move your piece and draw a card (truly it is a bit more complex than that but not a lot). The board and pieces are of good quality including wooden meoples, cardboard tokens and decent quality cards. The game will last well through repeated playing.The game plays quickly, my group of gamers is a set of adults, and while we don't always pay complete attention, the game progressed quickly after the initial trial that included repeated reference to the rules. Randomness plays a large part in the game, but there is an element in the card play that requires planning and strategy in opportunity management for card draws.Overall, the game is more suitable for younger audiences, but we may still play this game when we are in the mood for more of a beer and pretzels type casual game.

"I have two cats, in their tween years, edging toward old age, and I thought this might be good for them. I vary dry food constantly and the cats don't seem to be too picky. One is a long hair and does tend to get more hairballs, especially at the start of the hot season when she sheds more. I have noticed, anecdotally, that there seem to be fewer for me to clean up lately, but can't really conclude that it is the food over other factors. I like that the food is healthy and protein based. Price wise it compares to most other minimal ingredient foods, a little higher than some like Iams and lower than some I've seen in the pet store. Overall, the cats eat it and that's good enough for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LDDVRNJIJDCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZI3VR2#wasThisHelpful","R2LDDVRNJIJDCJ","AG90OGHDGOOVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG90OGHDGOOVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used the compressor from from a prior job (hardwood bloors in the master bedroom. Being designed for use with hardwood flooring I found this to be a better tool overall. The nylon shoe did its job and I saw no damage to the finish of the flooring. As with any new power tool it took a little getting used to, but once the trial and error period was done, it worked as expected.

"This is our fourth wine aerator so I figured I would extend my head to head comparison of wine aerators. Thinking of the things I want in an aerator - ease of use, clean-up, aeration and design/flash - so, those are the categories I will use for comparison. The four aerators in question are the Tanors Wine Decanter Aerator, the Metrokane 6127 Rabbit Super Aerator, Clear, the Soiree bottle-top Wine Decanter & Aerator and the Vinturi Essential Wine Aerator. Two free holding aerator and two in the bottle types.Ease of UseFor ease of use, I favor the two in the bottle models: the Rabbit and the Soiree, both fit into the bottle top snugly and pour directly to the glass, no coordination required other than hitting the glass with the wine, minimal mess though both tend to hold onto that last drop so it can drip down the bottle or onto the counter, so keep a drip cloth handy. Note that with the Soiree has a pliable rubber collar for fitting into the bottle, the Rabbit has a tapered hard plastic like collar that needs to be wedged firmly in the wine bottle to avoid mishaps. Both the Tanor and Vinturi are hand held models and workable with a regular 750ml bottle as you pour and hold the aerator at the same time, I'd hesitate with magnum or larger bottles. The Tanor and Vinturi have their own holders for placement when not in use that catches the drips once use is done, but I still find myself keeping a drip cloth handy to prevent messing up the counter top.Clean-upAgain, I tend to favor the in bottle single piece aerators for ease of clean-up. Hot soapy water for all three, the Soiree is glass and rubber, the Rabbit is acrylic and plastic, the Vinturi is again acrylic and plastic (you will need to clean both the aerator and the base, and the strainer insert if used), the Tanor is acrylic as well and requires minor dis-assembly to pull out the aeration part for thorough cleaning (note: I only do this every 5 bottles or so, finding rinsing adequate on the average)  . I have not needed to scrub any of the devices, just swish around some hot soapy water and rinse thoroughly. Then dry. The Soiree comes with a base for storage that can also double as a drying base (I dry the Soiree upside down on the base then turn it over for storage). The Tanor and Vinturi each have a base, though I tend to dry them upside down on a towel, as the base generally needs drying as well. The Rabbit is minimalist, having just the device, which I tend to dry in a shot glass (I store it that was as well, though it can be stored on its side in a drawer just as easily).AerationFor the purists, this is what it is all about, and why we buy these little devices in the first place. I'm not trying to make a $6 bottle taste like a $10 bottle or make two buck chuck taste like a fine Bordeaux (I know, my wine snob is showing); I'm using the device so that I can open the bottle and enjoy it without needing to allow it to breath for 30-60 minutes, bypassing the wait for the sulfite oxidation and the first rush of ethanol evaporation. This allows me to focus on the character of the wine and enjoy the richness of the aromas. Functionally, the Rabbit and Vinturi use the same technology, they each have an air hole and use the flow of the wine to provide a suction that draws air into the stream of wine; some may argue that the Vinutri provides a somewhat bigger cavity to allow for better mixing of the air and wine than the Rabbit. The Soiree is somewhat simpler in that it is a glass bulb and allows the pouring of the wine as it passes through the bulb to create a turbulence exposing a greater surface area of wine to air. The Tanor model incorporates and aeration fixture composed of a wide convex head for spreading the wine and then a screen or sieve below to further separate the wine for exposure to air. Ultimately, even head to head with the same wine, I'm not convinced that any of the devices works better or worse than the others. They all seem to do the job they are designed for.Design/FlashThis is where you get to be subjective, as despite the functionality, you may want something to wow your friends as you explain to them just why aeration enhances the wine. The Rabbit makes a nice little hissing sound and displays the wine as it pours, though of the three is the most minimal. The Vinturi, gurgles as the wine is poured through and while somewhat cumbersome is not likely to be ignored by onlookers. The Tanor is like the Vinturi, but without the gurgle, just wine sloshing and draining to the glass, still, being hand held and clear acrylic it is likely to be part of the show. The Soiree, in my opinion, wins hands down for flash and design as the glass bulb, with a ruby colored wine sloshing through it is very eye catching and sparkly.Ultimately, I see selection of an aerator as a subjective item. If you can't tell the difference between two buck chuck and a Bordeaux blend out of the Rutherford sub-region of Napa, you are wasting your time and money on one. If, however, you are in it for more than just the alcohol and you want to appreciate the full character of a good wine, an aerator can help bypass the breathing period of freshly opened bottles. That said, functionality being equal, my preference tends to the Soiree for ease of use and clean-up as well as the eye candy aspect. Enjoy.P-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN053JQ4URGP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ORZHJZI#wasThisHelpful","RN053JQ4URGP5","AG90OGHDGOOVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG90OGHDGOOVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Functional, inexpensive and not unattractive these scissors will do the trick for most simple cutting jobs.I have to agree with the sentiment that when buying scissors you get what you pay for. Here is my assessmentPros:- Eco friendly in that they use some recycled material for the plastic handles- Economically priced- ambidextrous- cuts standard paper effectivelyCons:- handles are not very comfortable for long term cutting jobs- cutting anything thicker than 2-3 sheets of paper is not smooth and hard on the hands- don't expect precision cuts, these are neither sharp enough nor smooth enoughOverall, I have a pair of left-handed Fiskars that offer more comfort and better cutting ability. The perfect niche for these Westcott scissors is the office where cutting is occasional, doesn't tend to require great precision and can benefit from economical pricing. You are getting, perhaps, a little more than you pay for here, but not a lot more.

"Having come into possession of two different products for auto headlight restoration, I thought I would try a head to head comparison, The two products are the 3M Headlight Restoration System (PN 39008) and the Meguiar's Perfect Clarity Headlight Restoration Two Step Kit (hereafter know as Meguiar's).The headlights on my car had started to show the telltale opaqueness characteristic of sun damage and oxidation.

The Meguiar's product requires less steps in that you start with a rubbing compound and then after achieving the frosted appearance spray with a clear protective coating.Effectiveness- the 3M product left a clear un-yellowed headlight cover- the Meguiar's product left a clear un-yellowed headlight coversurprise, essentially they were in my opinion equally effective at restoring the headlightsEase of use / Effort- the 3M product took roughly 60-90 minutes to strip and buff a single headlight, note that this was done using a cordless drill (you may need an appropriate chuck as the kit attachment is smooth and round where my drill required a hex shank) making several passes and wiping down to assess progress before advancing to the next disk [ note that the instructions caution you to mask around the headlights to prevent damage to the paint, I would suggest multiple layers in the areas where the paint is most likely to get damaged, varying by car - I suggest this because I cut right through a single layer of tape in one area and scratched the paint ]- the Meguiar's product took roughly 15-20 minutes, this was through intense side to side rubbing of the headlight with the applicator pad, adding more buffing compound as the surface became dry and wiping down to assess progress before the final spray on step [ note that you need to mask here as well, but now to protect against overspray from the protecting coat, also, be careful in your spray technique as it is possible to end up with drips due to too much spray application ]Overall, as you can see from the attached before and after the both systems worked well, the difference being mostly in the length of time required to achieve the effect.

"Not just another dry history book, you don't hear that often, even the best authors struggle at times to make history entertaining. Mr. Dickey does a very good job of keeping the narrative moving around the focal point of the text, Robert Bunch, British consul to Charleston, South Carolina. While the focal point of the text, Bunch is not the be all and end all of the story. The author ensures that the reader is fed a steady stream of events current to the times, providing an excellent backdrop for framing his biographical efforts on Bunch.I found the work to be an easy and entertaining read, and a novel insight into a period and locale in American history that I was not previously familiar with.

"We are in the process of replacing our upstairs carpet with engineered hardwood flooring - a project that pretty much requires a nail-gun to fasten the planks (read about toenailing the flooring). The kit comes complete with 1 1/4"" brads, which are unfortunately too short for the job (I had to pick up some 1 1/2"" brads), but it is gratifying to find that the nail gun can handle up to 2"" brads. We have started with the master bedroom and I was able to set the compressor at one end of the room and use the included 25 foot hose to access the entire floor, not needing to move the compressor the entire time. It took a little bit of practice to get the technique down (I took one flooring strip outside and set it on some scrap wood and used about a dozen brads to adjust my technique).You have to love the attached tank for holding compressed air; I've used tankless compressors in the past and the constant noise get to you after a while. I wouldn't call it quiet, but since the compressor only runs when the tank pressure gets low the noise is not constant. The nail gun is satisfyingly sturdy and thankfully not hand specific (i.e. just as easy to use left handed as right).Overall, a very nice nail gun / compressor kit, reasonably priced. You won't be building any houses with it, but for normal household projects like mine this fills the need.

"A better than decent electric shaver, but let me be honest, I am happy to use a two bladed disposable razor and basic shave cream (think Barbasol), and feel that I get a good, close, comfortable shave. I have yet to find an electric razor that offers the closeness or quickness of that standard - the razor being reviewed included.I have used the gamut of electric razors over the years, cheap and good quality, and given the above caveat, this Remington stands up with the best of the lot I have tried. The closeness of the shave is adequate, though it requires repeated passes from different directions to ensure full coverage. Cleanup is easy, pop the head off and brush off the residue, pop the head back on, done. It is nice that the razor is wet/dry and usable in the shower (though in our drought state here in California, I don't think I could justify the length of time it would take me to shave under running water). The charging cradle is somewhat of an oddity, I'm not sure whether it is meant to simplify carrying for travel of stowage, but it just seems ill-designed. A couple of other nice features - the hair trimmer on the back side of the unit, and the remaining minutes of charge display.Overall, one of the better electric razors I have used, but it still doesn't beat a blade for closeness.

"Upfront, align your expectations, this is a budget system, not some uber-gamer system. It is assembled from basic components to provide a functional product at a low cost. Keeping that in mind let's take a look at the specifics:- Weight: surprisingly light, given the 15.6"" screen, I at first thought they might have left the battery out of the system- Size: 15.6"" screen again, but in wide screen format, ~10""x15"" case, seems a little on the bulky side if you plan on carrying it around to classes, should fit into most normal sized knapsacks though- Display: 1366*768 pixels in wide screen, not 1080p but acceptable and delivers a good image- Processor: 2.16 GHz Celeron N2840 (dual core), remember basic system, you won't be doing heavy duty graphics rendering or speedy compiles on this system, but to stream some videos or music, play some basic games, or word process, the chip is capable, just don't expect anything miraculous (it can run games like World of Tanks, in minimum resolution reasonably well)- Network: I was a bit disappointed that the system would only connect at 2.4GHz, but remember, basic system, this will limit your streaming or online gaming, though it seems to work fine here in my house with top of the line multi-channel routers- Memory: 4 Gb, basic for Windows- Storage: 500 Gb @ 5400 rpm, basic again, expect to use either cloud storage add a passport drive- Connections: the usual network and VGA ports, 1 USB-2 and 1 USB-3 port (expect to need a USB portal or splitter, I use one port for the mouse - sure the case comes with a finger pad but you can't get real work done with one of those, and if you want to plug in a set of USB speakers you are done) I was surprised to see an HDMI port for connecting to a larger screen or TV (nice)- Software: preloaded with Windows 8 (yes, the abomination, the horror, and no touch screen, <soapbox> seriously, IMO, Windows 8 is a barrier to getting anything useful done, especially without a touch screen </soapbox>), and the plethora of trials and advertised crap (I spent my first couple of hours with the system going through the configuration of Windows that requires you to setup or provide an email account, and removing all of the preloaded trials, then installing Open Source protection software and the Chrome browser among other favored software)So those are the basics and my impression. Overall, the system is usable, though it seems 'cheap' to me, especially the keyboard (it just sounds and feels flimsy. Also, given the limited amount of 'guts' inside the box, you would have though ASUS could have used a thinner case.

"Fun, easy to learn games in a box. The board and dice are good quality items that should last through numerous plays. The closest thing I can come up with to compare the main game play to is scrabble, but without the letters and based upon creating sets of three dice ( a set is based upon the parameters of color, shape and number on each die - all dice must be either the same or different in each parameter ). The rules for actual play were a bit confusing, but once we got to actual play, it all seemed to fall into place (trust me I know rules, being a graduate of the old Avalon Hill university of rules reading for games like Squad Leader, Tobruk and 1914, just to name a few).The rules contain variants for two other play modes - Crossword and Scramble (which offer solitaire play mode as well as group play).

"Lower your expectations if you buy this product. No one will ever mistake this log set as real or even a quality imitation for a fire. The set is constructed of resin (think plastic), includes a power adapter and is operated by an On/Off switch for the light and another controlling the 'crackle' noise. The set is light weight, textured and colored to look vaguely like a fireplace log set. I assume that it is intended to be used in an actual fireplace setting, given the single viewing angle (back side is where all the switches are).Assembly requires a Phillips head screwdriver and is pretty simple - just attach the legs (don't over tighten as this may strip the threading or break the main assembly. Plug it in and turn it on and you have a red glowing log shaped piece of plastic. The glow cycles low and high to simulate (albeit badly) a burning fire. The 'crackle' is little more than a joke perpetrated by what sounds like a ratchet gear (think - 'click, click, click, klunk', repeat) at three speeds.While the packaging seemed adequate, the unit was still broken and cracked in multiple locations, requiring super glue to reattach one piece and left something rattling around inside the unit. There was one spot that appeared to be a sloppy resin repair performed at the factory and another where the unit was cracked around a screw that had been over tightened at the factory.Ultimately, if this weren't a review unit I would have returned it. I can only think that Duraflame has not done their brand name any favors by claiming this as their own.

"Okay, let me do a head to head for a couple of the more moderately priced Bluetooth speakers - RND Ripple Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with two front speakers subwoofer and microphone (Gun Metal Grey) and NYNE Multimedia Inc Cruiser Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Grey/Green). First off these are not the high end products like Bose, Sony or even Beats that can cost in excess of $200. These are more moderately priced items costing $30-$60. Your expectations should be appropriate for the price range.Sound: first and foremost among what you probably want from a speaker. Both speakers offer good sound for the small size. The Ripple is a touch fuller on the bass, but both offer good sound across the volume range (better at higher volumes, a little tinny at lower volumes)Portability: these are after all designed to accompany you mobile device. The NYNE is a bit bulkier, but is mountable on your bicycle (brackets and such included). Both units weigh in about the same when held, one in each hand, at less than a pound.Charge: both are rechargeable, both come with a USB cable (you can use the plug adapter from you phone to connect the cable and charge), the Ripple is rated at 8-10 hours, I get about 6-8; the Cruiser does not seem to have an official rating on the Amazon product details and I have not run the battery enough to wear it down in the 4 hours of play time I've been using it.Misc: the Cruiser is equipped with an internal microphone and can be used to answer calls, both are equipped with Aux input plugs so that you can play from non-Bluetooth sources, though that sort of defeats the purpose of buying a wireless speaker.Pairing: both paired easily with my iPhone, nothing special here.Overall, the Cruiser is nice as a casual bike mounted speaker for when you want to be 'mobile.' The Ripple is the less expensive of the two and a good solution for those times when you don't have your stereo with you and want to listen without a set of head phones. Neither measures up to our Bose, but then we expected that, these best use by giving them to the kids.

First off these are not the high end products like Bose, Sony or even Beats that can cost in excess of $200. These are more moderately priced items costing $30-$60. Your expectations should be appropriate for the price range.Sound: first and foremost among what you probably want from a speaker. Both speakers offer good sound for the small size. The Ripple is a touch fuller on the bass, but both offer good sound across the volume range (better at higher volumes, a little tinny at lower volumes)Portability: these are after all designed to accompany you mobile device. The NYNE is a bit bulkier, but is mountable on your bicycle (brackets and such included). Both units weigh in about the same when held, one in each hand, at less than a pound.Charge: both are rechargeable, both come with a USB cable (you can use the plug adapter from you phone to connect the cable and charge), the Ripple is rated at 8-10 hours, I get about 6-8; the Cruiser does not seem to have an official rating on the Amazon product details and I have not run the battery enough to wear it down in the 4 hours of play time I've been using it.Misc: the Cruiser is equipped with an internal microphone and can be used to answer calls, both are equipped with Aux input plugs so that you can play from non-Bluetooth sources, though that sort of defeats the purpose of buying a wireless speaker.Pairing: both paired easily with my iPhone, nothing special here.Overall, the Cruiser is nice as a casual bike mounted speaker for when you want to be 'mobile.' The Ripple is the less expensive of the two and a good solution for those times when you don't have your stereo with you and want to listen without a set of head phones. Neither measures up to our Bose, but then we expected that, these best use by giving them to the kids.

"Sharing these around the office, I have been informed that the Matcha flavor is the current rage with the 20-30s crowd. Personally, I've run across Pocky before and found the chocolate version tasty, though not compelling in the way I might feel about a toll house cookie, but I can chalk that up to a cultural preference from my childhood.What I do like about the Pocky is that I can grab two or three and have a quick little snack without feeling the guilt of eating too much. The Match flavor reminds me of a white chocolate / yogurt covered pretzel consistency with a little flavor (I'll assume the green tea, though it does not taste like any green tea I've ever had). These are not nearly as sweet as the chocolate Pocky, having what I would consider as a subtle sweetness.Overall, I'm inclined to say that they are tasty and while I may not buy them for myself, I can see eating them without complaint.

"Once again, as with Katabasis I felt lost during the first few chapters as I picked up many of the characters and back stories without the benefit of having read the first three books. Comparison to Katabasis does not favor this book and while I will not pan this book, I'd drop the rating a half star because it lacks some of the depth that I had so enjoyed in the prior book. This text seems to verge even farther into religious mysticism than the last book, and stretches the believability of an otherwise good piece of historical fiction.All of that aside, the author does a good job of story telling and provides a fairly entertaining tale.

"Not having read any of the previous books, makes the early stages of the book a little confusing, but not hopelessly so. I was easily engaged in the storyline within the first 100 pages, and had little trouble keeping up with the disparate groups. The authors make ample use of scene/group changing to maintain literary tension, but aside from the initial confusion over characters that I was not familiar with this was not cumbersome and actually helped keep me reading.The characters, even as a first reading in the series, are well developed. I found the use of religious mysticism well placed and not so heavy as to verge over into fantasy. All in all, I found the book very readable and entertaining.

"I'm relaying comments from my wife, who has been using the product.Following the directions as printed, application is pretty simple, my wife uses about two pumps for hair a little past shoulder length, working it into the hair and letting it set for 5 minutes and rinsing. The result is, subjectively, softer hair that after drying does appear to have more volume and retain the volume throughout the day. Seven days may be a bit of a stretch for duration of effect, especially, given that she washes her hair daily (your mileage may vary depending on washing). As an aside she noted somewhat more retained control on days when we get a slight mist in the mornings than before.Overall, my wife is happy with the results and not unhappy with the cost for the product.P-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QY12OC0OGAA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1NBKSW#wasThisHelpful","R2QY12OC0OGAA7","AG90OGHDGOOVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG90OGHDGOOVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The dog loved it at first, then got tired of it near the end of the bag. Admittedly, I only use a 1/4 - 1/2 cup twice a day (small dog) and it may have started to get a little stale by the end of the bag, which may explain the limited interest in the last few days of use.

"Beer and pretzels or maybe wine and crackers, that's about the way I would characterize this game. The luck/random factor is too heavily involved to make it a true strategy game.The game is extremely free form, as an example it does not start with a goal and there is no way to win until someone plays a Goal card. Likewise that rules are simple to start - Draw a card, Play a card. The rules are all out on the table, nothing to remember, just be adaptable. The game is best played with a 'fun' group (more being better), too much seriousness would just make the game really frustrating.The one complaint (ignoring the luck factor, because, every now and then it is fun to just play something without having to strategize) and why I dropped a star is the cheapness of the card stock, truly thin. I have not played enough games (half a dozen so far) to see any degradation of the cards, however, the cards are thin to the point of making them difficult to shuffle well and I fully expect that the useful life of the cards may be under 100 games (I have standard playing card decks that have survived 5+ years of solitaire play, these wouldn't make it a single year).To recap, fun game, no really strategy or skill to winning, cheap card stock.P-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGE8E91QCHJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OETKWCE#wasThisHelpful","RGE8E91QCHJW","AG90OGHDGOOVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG90OGHDGOOVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had played Munchkin in the past, so many of the cards were familiar, though they have been re-purposed to work with this game's format, and they add a whimsical element to to panic side of the game.The game pits the players against a tightening ring of monsters similar to Castle Panic, that requires a certain level of cooperation to stop from reaching and breaching the castle walls. A failure to cooperate can force the entire group to lose the game. Enter Munchkin with it's stab the other guy in the back and tongue in cheek Dungeons and Dragons mentality; the result is a game that would have made John Nash proud. Players have to balance the desire for the brass ring and the risk of everyone losing.The game is well made with sturdy pieces, quality cards and a suitably opaque bag to hold the monster counters. Overall, the product is durable. The random element is powerful, but not necessarily overpowering to the point of eliminating the need for strategy and prioritization.This is a suitable beer and pretzels game for adults or a nice family game that just might spark some learning as children face the quandary noted above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UQAKWD7S7UPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD176IE#wasThisHelpful","R2UQAKWD7S7UPP","AG90OGHDGOOVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG90OGHDGOOVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Picks up right where the first book left off. While there is some concession in the way of back history, I would not recommend picking this volume up without having read the first book. Much of what I said regarding the first book, Children of Fire, still holds true.""The author is good at his craft, with good character development, good conflict and tension building as well as a well thought out plot line. Overall, I enjoyed the read.""The author has continued with the story, I was gratified to see that the story has spread the focus to flesh out all four of the main characters as well as their associated supporting characters. The story still took a little effort and time to get fully moving, but I was easily engaged by the 100th page.

"Works great for what it is designed for, a reading light for your basic Kindle, but beyond that it is, also, an acceptable reading light for books, the clip is wide enough to clip (with softer plastic grips inside) to either the hard cover or soft cover plus pages to give a firm attachment.I'm not altogether sure why people are complaining about battery expense. The device uses CR 2032 coin batteries x2 (for example: Energizer CR2032 3 Volt Lithium Coin Battery 10 Pack (2 packs of 5)) ultimately at about $0.50 per battery. My use (admittedly, I only read most nights and only for an hour or so) allows for 1-2 months of battery life.Overall, the device is practical and works for my needs as an occasional reading light, the one complaint I have is that it is actually a little too bright, a softer light would be preferable for me.P-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R7ZRMWDTJL2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N30V288#wasThisHelpful","R2R7ZRMWDTJL2N","AG90OGHDGOOVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG90OGHDGOOVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sweet and simple, this little tool is a savior for those of us that don't finish a bottle in one night and want to preserve some of the quality of the wine for the next night. The tool and included caps help to pump out some of the air in the bottle (which would otherwise oxidize the wine) forming a nice vacuum to seal the bottle. The seal is not perfect, but you will get some vacuum and be able to drink the rest of the bottle the next night with reasonable assurance that the wine will not have turned.Operation is fairly simple as you insert the cap into the opened bottle, place the pump over the cap, forming a seal by applying light downward pressure with the hand holding the body of the pump (don't get over zealous with the pressure as you may over balance the bottle and spill or break the bottle if you have tile floors like I do), pump the handle up and down 4-5 times and you should have created a vacuum seal on you wine. The caps are easy to clean with warm water and soap.Overall, the device works well, and performs adequately to preserve an open bottle of wine for at least one more night (your mileage may vary).P-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29970M9ATJ5JF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTWA3HQ#wasThisHelpful","R29970M9ATJ5JF","AG90OGHDGOOVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG90OGHDGOOVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is our third wine aerator so I figured a head to head comparison of the three would be in order. Thinking of the things I want in an aerator - ease of use, clean-up, aeration and design/flash - so, those are the categories I will use for comparison. The three aerators in question are the Metrokane 6127 Rabbit Super Aerator, Clear, the Soiree bottle-top Wine Decanter & Aerator and the Vinturi Essential Wine Aerator. One free holding aerator and two in the bottle types.Ease of UseFor ease of use, I favor the two in the bottle models: the Rabbit and the Soiree, both fit into the bottle top snugly and pour directly to the glass, no coordination required other than hitting the glass with the wine, minimal mess though bottle tend to hold onto that last drop so it can drip down the bottle or onto the counter, so keep a drip cloth handy. Note that with the Soiree has a pliable rubber collar for fitting into the bottle, the Rabbit has a tapered hard plastic like collar that needs to be wedged firmly in the wine bottle to avoid mishaps. The Vinturi is the hand held model and workable with a regular 750ml bottle as you pour and hold the aerator at the same time, I'd hesitate with magnum or larger bottles. The Vinturi has its own holder for placement when not in use that catches the drips once use if done, but I still find myself keeping a drip cloth handy to prevent messing up the counter top.Clean-upAgain, I tend to favor the in bottle single piece aerators for ease of clean-up. Hot soapy water for all three, the Soiree is glass and rubber, the Rabbit is acrylic and plastic, the Vinturi is again acrylic and plastic (you will need to clean both the aerator and the base, and the strainer insert if used) . I have not needed to scrub any of the devices, just swish around some hot soapy water and rinse thoroughly. Then dry. The Soiree comes with a base for storage that can also double as a drying base (I dry the Soiree upside down on the base then turn it over for storage). The Vinturi has a base as well, though I tend to dry it upside down on a towel, as the base generally needs drying as well. The Rabbit is minimalist, having just the device, which I tend to dry in a shot glass (I store it that was as well, though it can be stored on its side in a drawer just as easily).AerationFor the purists, this is what it is all about, and why we buy these little devices in the first place. I'm not trying to make a $6 bottle taste like a $10 bottle or make two buck chuck taste like a fine Bordeaux (I know, my wine snob is showing); I'm using the device so that I can open the bottle and enjoy it without needing to allow it to breath for 30-60 minutes, bypassing the wait for the sulfite oxidation and the first rush of ethanol evaporation. This allows me to focus on the character of the wine and enjoy the richness of the aromas. Functionally, the Rabbit and Vinturi use the same technology, they each have an air hole and use the flow of the wine to provide a suction that draws air into the stream of wine; some may argue that the Vinutri provides a somewhat bigger cavity to allow for better mixing of the air and wine than the Rabbit. The Soiree is somewhat simpler in that it is a glass bulb and allows the pouring of the wine as it passes through the bulb to create a turbulence exposing a greater surface area of wine to air. Ultimately, even head to head with the same wine, I'm not convinced that any of the devices works better or worse than the others. They all seem to do the job they are designed for.Design/FlashThis is where you get to be subjective, as despite the functionality, you may want something to wow your friends as you explain to them just why aeration enhances the wine. The Rabbit makes a nice little hissing sound and displays the wine as it pours, though of the three is the most minimal. The Vinturi, gurgles as the wine is poured through and while somewhat cumbersome is not likely to be ignored by onlookers. The Soiree, in my opinion, wins hands down for flash and design as the glass bulb, with a ruby colored wine sloshing through it is very eye catching and sparkly.Ultimately, I see selection of an aerator as a subjective item. If you can't tell the difference between two buck chuck and a Bordeaux blend out of the Rutherford sub-region of Napa, you are wasting your time and money on one. If, however, you are in it for more than just the alcohol and you want to appreciate the full character of a good wine, an aerator can help bypass the breathing period of freshly opened bottles. That said, functionality being equal, my preference tends to the Soiree for ease of use and clean-up as well as the eye candy aspect.

The Rabbit makes a nice little hissing sound and displays the wine as it pours, though of the three is the most minimal. The Vinturi, gurgles as the wine is poured through and while somewhat cumbersome is not likely to be ignored by onlookers. The Soiree, in my opinion, wins hands down for flash and design as the glass bulb, with a ruby colored wine sloshing through it is very eye catching and sparkly.Ultimately, I see selection of an aerator as a subjective item. If you can't tell the difference between two buck chuck and a Bordeaux blend out of the Rutherford sub-region of Napa, you are wasting your time and money on one. If, however, you are in it for more than just the alcohol and you want to appreciate the full character of a good wine, an aerator can help bypass the breathing period of freshly opened bottles. That said, functionality being equal, my preference tends to the Soiree for ease of use and clean-up as well as the eye candy aspect.

"I'm coming at this series fresh, not having read the first book. What I see are elements of Victorian romance and horror mixed in with the expected steam punk genre.There is quite a bit of story/plot/character building that goes on in the first half of the book, and while the author has added a healthy dose of tension to keep the reader interested, it tends to be romantic tension (personally, I made concessions to it as story building, however, I found it a drag to have to slog my way through it to get to the latter half of the book).Overall, a nice good versus evil story with plenty of steam punk elements. While there were story elements that I probably would have benefited from in the first book, I was well enough able to gather enough of the story to enjoy this book on its own. There were times when I would say the story was definitely not a page turner and others when I could not put the book down.

"As far as shop vacs are concerned, I would definitely put this into the light duty category. The unit is made of tough molded plastic and somewhat bulky in nature. The wheels make it easy to drag along as you vacuum, though the large size tends to get it hung up on my workbench and other items as I cleanup around the garage.The suction power is comparable to smaller shop vacs I have had in the past, though the large hose tends to reduce the ultimate power over the others I have owned. It still gets the job done, but a floor adapter with a narrower opening would have helped a lot. Speaking of adapters, this model comes with only a utility nozzle, though it touts the ability to store accessories on the castors. That and though it is billed as a WET/dry vac it requires the additional purchase of [WORKSHOP Wet/Dry Vacs WS24200F Wet Foam Filter for Shop Vacuum, 5 to 16-Gallon] to be used as a WET vac.Overall, this is a basic dry shop vac (with one included bag) that has the capability to be a wet vac with additional purchase. As such, it gets the job done, but I have seen better products on the market.

"I guess I expected more from this 'hilarious look at the eating habits of the skinny and famous' - more satire, more poking fun at celebrities, more poking fun at the senseless diets; with so much material out there I just expected more fun. Instead, what I got was some poking of fun, some gushing over celebrities and some feminism.Dieting is such a prevalent part of life here in the US, you would think that there so much more that the author could have done given the empathy that she could bring to bare on the topic. Thankfully, at about 160 pages the book was short and aside from the gushing was relatively painless, though not terribly 'hilarious.'","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EKYO994EBLSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101872438#wasThisHelpful","R2EKYO994EBLSG","AG90OGHDGOOVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG90OGHDGOOVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The main promoted benefit of turmeric as a supplement is as an anti-inflammatory / anti-oxidant. There is not a lot of research to support this, most of the support for its use comes from Asian folk medicine use (which isn't to say that's bad, just not up to blinded control studies as far as scientific method is concerned).Nutrigold has a good reputation for purity and vegetarian capsules. If you decide to take this supplement, I would recommend this supplier.

"Pyrroloquinoline quinone is an interesting substance contained by a number of enzymes, and a number of studies have shown some positive results for cellular health in the areas of reduction of oxidative stress and mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, a few small scale studies have shown some neurological benefits - much of which seems to be related to reduction of toxin sensitivity and reduction of oxidative stress (again).I will go as far as, cautiously, saying that there _may_ be some benefit to taking this supplement, though it is a little pricey at approximately $0.75 per capsule. What I can say from my own trial of 30 days is that the supplement did not cause any stomach upset or marked side effects; I cannot report any notable positive results from the 30 day period. I do not see this supplement as a panacea, and think a good deal more study is warranted.Other antioxidants that may offer oxidative reduction results include: Vitamins A, C and E, Ubiquinol (CoQ-10), resveratrol and flavonoids (found in tea, coffee, soy, fruit, olive oil, chocolate, cinnamon, oregano).

"I'm used to the ear buds that are little more than the bud that fits into the ear, so the larger backing to the ear bud seemed a bit odd at first, not sure if the shape is part of the acoustics or just a nice place to put the company logo.Sound Quality: very nice, while I am no audiophile that can hear the extended ranges above and below normal human hearing, I can say I am pleased with the highs and lows, vocals and instrumentals are clear. The buds don't completely isolate me from outside noise, but are good at keeping out most noise, enough so that I tend to not notice ambiant noise unless it is right on top of me are very loud (I'll hear the fire alarm when it goes off).Functionality: I love the volume button on the right ear bud wire, have not used the mic (I am not that plugged into my phone and don't tend to get calls at work). One of the biggest problems I have with most ear buds is that they tend to slip out of my ears over time, over the weeks I have been using these buds I cannot complain of that problem. The selection of included ear tips allows for better selection of the 'right' pair to fit.Ultimately, I could recommend these to others - my wife is still a Bose fan, and for the added $10 for a pair of iE2s I'll still indulge her, for me these are just as good.P-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26GMD58E4MTJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1KX80E#wasThisHelpful","R26GMD58E4MTJP","AG90OGHDGOOVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG90OGHDGOOVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the translation of the second book of the Secret of Ji series. The quest continues in the effort to determine the reason behind the pursuit of the small band of Heirs of Ji by assasins.The author continues to develop his characters (you really need the first book to understand what is happening, this is not a stand alone book), and plot from where it left off in the first book. As in the first book, I quickly re-invested in the main characters and thread of the story (it has been a while since reading the first book, so I had to remember what was going on).

"The story is loaded with action, starting fast and continuing to keep the reader engaged. The author does a good job at character development with frequent flashbacks to character back story to provide insight, though early on in the story the characters were little more than stereotypes from the genre.While it took me a little effort during the first few chapters to come up to speed on the story's world, I quickly became invested in the characters and found this to be a light adventure story that turned into a quick read rather than a effort to complete.

"The author offers up an event filled narration of a North Vietnamese assault on a US fire base during the Vietnam War. The text begins with a recap of the events of the author's book Blackhorse Riders that led up to the events of this book. Introduces many of the lead characters then launches into a, roughly, sequential narration of the events of the assault and aftermath.The author's style is smooth and very readable and skips from hotspot to hotspot as the attack unfolds. The factual nature of the story is derived from interviews and public records. The author does his best to fill gaps where possible from standard operating procedures or practices from the period, but makes no attempt to hide the areas of the narration that involve uncertainty.Bottom line, a good read from a skilled raccontare.

"I wasn't sure what to expect from the game (not having played any of the earlier versions) and imagined it to be something akin to a collectible figure game like Heroclix mixed with an online adventure game. The reality is close, if you can imagine, to Sonic or Mario Brothers that allows you to swap characters during play.The set comes with three character figurines: 1 standard and 2 SWAP figures. The SWAP figures are two piece (top and bottom) that allow for mixing and matching. The game plays a lot like the Sonic or Mario Brothers genre - run around various locations, beat on monsters / creatures / bad guys, collect coins / gems / etc., solve visual / sequential puzzles.The added bit for teh Skylanders games is that you get to change characters during play; certain areas are restricted to certain classes of characters (categorized by Elements: Magic, Water, Tech, Fire, Earth, Life, Air and Undead), and SWAP force characters can combine two elements. Add to that the ability to gain experience for characters and skills and you have the basics of the game.Overall, the game is a fun spin on a perennial favorite genre. The manufacturer has developed a clever way to get the user to pay for additional content (more characters) and provided a tactile element in the form of the little character figures (gotta get them all).

" 6:47 MinsI've uploaded a video to show an example of the audio quality using it in different modes, so use this to see whether you're happy with the quality it's able to output.  Bare in mind that Amazon has a very low file size restriction, which meant it had to be uploaded in the poorer quality 480p resolution.Also, depending on which device you're using to see this review, the video may not be visible.  I'd recommend viewing on a desktop or laptop..·:*¨*:·.·:*¨*:·.·:*¨*:·.·:*¨*:·.♦ Introduction ♦When it comes to motorcycle gadgets and tech, Sena really have been making great strides when it comes to innovation, firstly by making a device that allows you to overlay your voice to GoPro cameras via Bluetooth; followed by making their very own Bluetooth audio action camera, the Prism. Sena have now stepped the game up even further by making the 10C, an all inclusive action camera and Bluetooth intercom/communication device.Going through the specs of the 10C, it's as if Sena have almost perfectly combined the 20S with the Prism into one package, but look closer or even use it in fact, and you will see it's not exactly the same. Whilst the 10C has gained some extra features like 'Video Tagging' or 'Smart Audio Mix' which are FANTASTIC to have, it has also lost a couple, one that I've clearly noticed is that there's no 'UHD Voice Recording' which unfortunately hinders sound quality when recording your voice. That said, depending on your needs and expectations, the recording quality of the 10C may be absolutely fine.When it comes to weight, the 10C weighs 34g (1.19oz) more than the 20S which weighs 60g (2.11oz), but is only marginly bigger in size, so is still very compact. Also despite the 10C having the extra camera feature, the 10C only has three main buttons and is surprisingly very simple to use. Sena have also given the 10C a ""cool"" & ""unique"" look which seems to grab other motorcyclists curiosity.- Main Features:∙ Action Cam & Bluetooth communication system/intercom in one device.∙ Full HD 1080p Recording at 30FPS (720P at 60FPS is available).∙ 125°FoV with F/2 aperture.∙ 30° Lens rotation to level out footage.∙ Time-Lapse Feature.∙ 1.6km (1 mile) intercom range (with no obstacles in the way).∙ Up to four-way intercom.∙ Voice prompts (the headset will tell you when a mode is activated, so you're always aware of what's happening).∙ Smart audio mix (Overlay intercom conversations, music, FM radio or phonecalls to your footage).∙ Video tagging.∙ Microphone noise control.∙ Music sharing to other intercoms.∙ FM Radio.∙ Universal Intercom.∙ Use whilst charging.∙ Firmware Upgradable.*There is a firmware upgrade that's already available, so before using the 10C, go to Sena's website and search for their 'Device Manager' which is needed to update the 10C.- Box Contents:∙ Main Headset Unit.∙ Helmet Clamp.∙ Adhesive Mounting Plate.∙ Helmet Speakers.∙ Attachable Boom Mic.∙ Boom Mic Holder.∙ Mic Wind Shields.∙ Wired Mic.∙ USB - Micro USB Cable.∙ Car Charger (Cigarette Port).∙ Pads, Covers and Hook & Loop Fasteners for Speakers & Mics.∙ Allen Wrench.∙ Quick Start Guide.- Recommended Extras:∙ MicroSD Memory Card (The 10C only supports up to 32GB).♦ Helmet Attachment Set-Up ♦- Mount:You have two choices to mount the 10C to your helmet; either by using the helmet clamp or the adhesive plate.I used the helmet clamp as not only does it not leave any residue onto my helmet, it makes the whole mounting and un-mounting a quick and easy process.To attach the helmet clamp, ensure the clamp is loosened by using the included Allen wrench to undo the bolts; then slide the clamp onto your helmet (the part going inside your helmet should go between the shell and the cushion).After it's slotted in firmly and you're happy with the position, tighten up the bolts so the clamp is fixed in position.If you're using the adhesive plate, ensure the area it's being placed on is cleaned and dried (alcohol wipes are good to use). It's best to leave the adhesive plate on for at least 24 hours before mounting the 10C on to ensure it has settled properly.- Main Unit, Speakers & Microphone:I found it easier to mount the 10C onto my helmet and getting it in the correct position before setting everything else up. The 10C slides onto the mount, then you can adjust the vertical angle by loosening the wheel then twisting the camera around, and then twist the lens for the horizontal alignment.The speakers slot into the rear-right port of the 10C and the microphone is then plugged into a connector on the speakers cables. Place the speakers somewhere that's comfortable (if your helmet has speaker pockets, even better), then insert the microphone somewhere secure such as between the cheek pads and the helmet shell whilst allowing the boom part to protrude out.♦ Intercom & Smartphone Set-Up ♦- Intercom (Sena Intercoms):1) Whilst powered on, hold the jog button down for 5 seconds to enter intercom pairing.2) Ensure the other Sena headset is also in intercom pairing mode.3) Press the jog button.- Intercom (Non-Sena Intercoms):You will need to navigate through the 10C configuration menu by holding the jog button down for 12 seconds.- Smartphone:1) Whilst powered on, hold the phone button down for 5 seconds to enter phone pairing.2) Ensure your smartphones Bluetooth in activated, then search and click on 'Sena 10C'.♦ 10C Usability & Battery Life ♦- Usability:If you've used a 20S before then you'll have no issues in operating the 10C as the commands are the same, the only addition to learn is the camera button which is very simple to use.I would advise looking at the quick guide included or by using the one available on the app, which is great when you're on the go.The buttons are well positioned and are easy to use, it just takes a little practice to remember the commands.If there's one change I could make, it would be to match the size of the control wheel to the 20S. Although it's still at a size where it's usable, the 20S is much user friendly.- Battery Life:Sena have advertised the 10C in having battery life for the following:∙ Talk time (Intercom) - 17 hours.∙ Radio on time - 8 hours.∙ Recording time - 2 hours.Testing the intercom or radio for such amounts of time is rather extreme, so I decided to test the battery life from full charge on the most battery draining feature, video recording, and these are the results I got:∙ Recording without using any Bluetooth or intercom features in 1080p: 2hrs, 17min & 21sec.∙ Recording whilst connected to my smartphone via Bluetooth and playing music in 1080p: 2hrs, 7min & 32sec.The 10C monitors the battery levels and will disable recording as to leave you with decent talk time left, which is a very good feature to have.All in all the battery life is quite respectful, however I do want to point out that it's not removable. So why is this a problem? Well, whilst not entirely an issue if it was just used as an intercom because of how little often you would need to charge it, as it's being used as an action camera, you will find yourself charging it more often. Rechargeable batteries have a certain amount of charging cycles before it dies, so for action cameras it's quite important to be able to replace them when they're rendered useless.♦ Audio Quality & Wireless Range ♦- Intercom Quality (10C connected to 20S):I couldn't say anything bad about the audio quality whilst having an intercom conversation.The other person was clear and easy to understand and apparently I was too.- Phonecall Quality:Being on the receiving end, the quality is only going to be as good as the other persons phone.The receiver from my audio stated that it was clear that I wasn't directly on a phone, however had no idea I was actually riding my motorcycle. He did point out that the quality he was receiving could have some improvement.- FM Radio Quality:This may vary from person to person depending on the area they're in.Basing it on my experience, the FM radio quality was absolutely superb, a huge improvement in quality from my 20S.No matter which way I turned my head or whatever directly I was riding, the quality was consistent.- Music Quality:I listen to various genres from classical, pop, rock, electronica and dub-step and I found the quality to be more than satisfactory; well balance and clear sounding.You can achieve a high volume level with very little distortion, however I really wouldn't recommend it that high as we need some road awareness with our ears for safety.- Intercom Wireless Range:For a Bluetooth device, the intercom range is actually very good (although not as good as the 20S).On a nice clear stretch, my friend and I were quite some distance away from each other, myself being quite a few cars in front and we had no noticeable drop outs.However, add some corners with a lot of obstacles in the way such as a lot trees and you will notice the range will decrease significantly, so just bare that in mind.♦ Action Camera Quality ♦- Video Quality:Video files are recorded in 44min 36sec segments, so once you've gone past that time on a constant recording it will automatically create a new file. All video files are recorded in the QuickTime Movie (.mov) format.As for video quality, I would say it's at an acceptable quality. Of course it's not going to be anywhere as near as the likes of Sony or GoPro branded action cameras, so if sharpness & clarity were a major factor for your videos, then maybe this isn't the right product for you, just remember that the 10C isn't marketed towards the same area as they are.To break it down, the 10C performs well in daylight. decently in cloudy and just about okay in low-light with street lights around.- Audio Quality (Voice Recording):I have to say that in this department I'm fairly disappointed. Although usable, it's not something I'm used to coming from using the 20S and Prism.Considering the Prism took the audio from the 20S via Bluetooth, the voice recordings came out so clear! But with the 10C having a wired microphone, I honestly expected better.Like I said it's usable, and to be honest a lot of people wanting to use this for motovlogging may think it will do just fine, I can see there being a lot of people finding the quality not acceptable.- Overlays:This is a really neat feature to have; if you're listening to music, FM radio or talking via intercom, these audio's will be overlaid onto your video recordings, and they come out rather clear too. Do note that the audio will be as loud on the recordings as you have it, so if it's too loud for your ears, it will be too loud on the recordings.These of course can be disabled (much easier doing it through the app), as well as there being an option which is turned off by default, to allow you to record your phone conversations!For me, the overlaying ""Smart Audio Mix"" is a much loved feature!♦ Smartphone App ♦To anyone using the 10C, I would highly recommend downloading the 'Sena Utility' app on your smartphone as it's an incredibly useful app to have. Once connected to the app, you can view the following tabs:∙ My Sena: This is the home screen, it tells you which firmware version your 10C has and which version is the latest to be released. You can also quickly select 'Basic Settings', 'Quick Guide' & 'User's Guide' on this page.∙ Basic Settings: This page has a variety of settings to enable/disable, such as sidetone, voice prompts and audio boost etc... It also allows you to choose which video quality you would prefer to record with and which overlays you would like to enable etc...∙ Speed Dial: Save up to three phone numbers for the speed dial feature.∙ FM Radio: Select your region and save up to 10 of your favourite radio stations.∙ Quick Guide: A guide for when on the go. This guide covers with coloured pictures and text how to operate the 10C. Topics range from adjusting volume, checking battery level, pairing with other devices, using the camera and other features. The layout is done very well which makes it easy to read and understand.∙ User's Guide: A more intensive guide that pretty much covers EVERYTHING you need to know, however I personally found the quick guide more useful.♦ Final Opinion ♦The 10C really is a unique product within the motorcycle accessory market and is definitely something that will appeal to a lot of motorcyclists.Considering how much features this device packs inside, I think the asking price is more than reasonable. Since owning this, I've had a couple of friends buy the 10C who have been satisfied by their purchase.If you're someone who is looking for high quality wireless voice recording and a lot of the features the 10C has, then I would highly suggest going for the 20S Bluetooth Communication Device & Prism Action Camera instead.Overall I would recommend the 10C, just make sure it ticks your boxes before you go ahead.✔ Pros:✓ 10C packs a whole load of features into one unit.✓ Great looking device.✓ Simple mounting system.✓ Very good button layout for ease of use.✓ Intercom is very clear.✓ Receiving audio from smartphone is good quality.✓ Video tagging mode is a great additional feature for motorcyclists.✓ Battery life is impressive.✖ Cons:✘ Non-removable battery.✘ No 'UHD Voice Recording'.► Note: I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YDVBOKOUXRW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEH89EK#wasThisHelpful","R1YDVBOKOUXRW1","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"♦ Introduction ♦Sena headsets such as the 20S are more than simple to use, however it does require the user to take one of their hands off the handlebars temporarily, which in some scenarios can be dangerous.The 'SC-HR-01' aims to reduce risk by allowing the user to control their headset in thumbs reach whilst gripping onto their handlebar- Features:∙ Water resistant.∙ 3 Months operation time (From full charge).∙ Clamping system for easy handlebar mounting.∙ Firmware Upgradeable.- Compatible Headsets:∙ 10C.∙ 10U.∙ 20S.∙ Other Sena headsets with Bluetooth 4.1.♦ Box Contents ♦∙ Handlebar remote.∙ 2x Rubber Bands.∙ Micro USB charging Cable.∙ Instruction Manual.- Instruction Manual Issues:The first issue I came across was with the pairing section: Whilst it's very clear on how to put the remote in it's own pairing mode, it's not clear how to put the main three devices which are compatible (10C, 10U & 10C) into their own appropriate pairing mode for this device. Whilst I wouldn't normally expect a devices manual to tell you how to get a different device into its pairing mode, the remote is only compatible with other Sena devices, so adding a little extra leaflet wouldn't to help with this process wouldn't do any harm.Alternatively, Sena need to update their compatible devices manuals (which can be viewed on their App) so that people can look for a pairing reference. For example: Whilst the Sena 20S has a section mentioning how to access its configuration menu, there's nowhere stating that's where you need to go to and navigate through to be able to pair it to the handlebar remote.Second issue I came across was within the command section: Not all commands are correct (well, in use with the 20S anyway). Commands like adjusting the volume and skipping tracks are all correct, but starting an intercom or activating the voice dial for example, are not correctly written down, which is going to be a problem for anyone who just wants to read and memorise the appropriate commands rather than having a play around to figure out which does what.♦ Set-Up ♦- Before Set-Up:Regardless if there's any charge already in the remote, I would recommend giving it a full charge of 2 hours before use.- Pairing Process:1) With the handlebar remote turned on (tap the front button), hold the rear button for approximately 5 seconds.2) Enter the 'Remote Control Pairing' mode within your headset.∙ 20S: Hold the 20S jog dial for 12 seconds until you hear ""Configuration Menu"", then scroll forward using the 20S control wheel until you hear ""Remote Control Pairing"", then press the phone button on the 20S.∙ 10C: Currently haven't had the chance to use the 10C yet, so will write how to when I get the opportunity to use it.∙ 10U: I do not own this device, so cannot comment on how to connect the two together.3) With the two devices being in their appropriate pairing mode, the two should automatically connect.- Mounting Onto Your Motorcycle:1) Stretch open up the clamp and place it over the handlebar grips (left side). The front button should be located above the joystick.2) If you feel like the remote doesn't have enough grip when mounted, apply one or two of the rubber bands onto your grips.3) Adjust the remote so that it's at an ideal angle and that your clutch lever doesn't clash with the remote when it's pulled in fully.The correct way to have the remote is having the joystick at a vertical position (on my bike, it was perfectly aligned with my indicator switch.An alternate way to have it so your clutch lever slots in between the gaps; I technically preferred it this way, however it made it very hard for me to hit my indicator switch, so I reverted back to the default position.It's quite hard to say which way would be most suitable for your motorcycle as different makes/models have different riding positions, button layouts or accessories that may further facilitate or hinder your experience compared to mine.♦ In-Use ♦There's one thing to bare in mind when using this is that it does force your left hand to be placed further out from the grips than you may do normally, I normally keep my hands towards in the inner areas of my grips than the outer area, so it did take me awhile to get used to. For some it may mean adjusting the clutch so it comes in a bit closer.So far I've tried it on two different bikes/set-ups:1) My bike: Honda NC750S w/default levers (Street): Works well.2) My friends: Yamaha R6 w/short levers (Super Sport): Is not suitable at all.The riding position of the R6 definitely didn't exactly help in the lack of comfortability when using this, however the main culprit would be the short levers. As the remote takes space within the inner part of your handlebar grips, it doesn't leave your hands much space to grip on the clutch.Once I had gotten used to my new hand position when using this on my bike, it wasn't too much of a bother. The only thing I have to do when using this is having to stretch my thumb out a little bit further to hit my indicator, however at no point was it blocking me from accessing any of my motorcycle controls.The remote's front button and joystick can easily be pressed with the thumb and the rear button with my index finger (this is with me wearing summer gloves).My main uses for the remote so far has been adjusting volume, skipping and pausing music, accepting phone calls and connecting to another's intercom and so far it has worked perfectly.♦ Final Opinion ♦It is a great accessory to have that really compliments (in my case) the 20S. I would rather have to deal with my moved over hand position than having to remove my hand off my handlebar and press the 20S directly.It's a shame the instruction manual isn't up to scratch, however this is something they could hopefully sort out.As for compatibility, it may not be suitable for all bikes, however I can see street and touring bikes being the most suitable for this particular product.✔ Pros:✓ Easy to press buttons.✓ Very long battery life.✓ Convenient product to have.✖ Cons:✘ Instruction manual needs sorting out.✘ May not be suitable everyone (depends on motorcycle and accessories etc...).► Disclaimer: I was provided with this product in exchange for an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NSDBTS6NW38G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0100F7R5K#wasThisHelpful","R1NSDBTS6NW38G","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a couple of lenses for my Sony A6000 Camera, all of which are great in their own areas, however I didn't have one that covered a decent focal range starting from a nice wide angle view.Sony have a fair amount of zoom lenses on offer, however the 'SELP18105G' was more in my budget than others; plus it ticked all the right boxes: 18-105mm Focal length (27–157.5mm (APS-C)) | Constant F/4 aperture | 'Power Zoom' | Zoom is quiet.The lens itself actually weighs more than my camera (427g, compared to the A6000 which weighs in at 344g), however this hasn't bothered me the slightest.Anyone looking for filters (at least get a UV filter to protect the lens), it fits 72mm filters.The zoom is completely electronic, so it doesn't matter if you're using the power zoom slider or twisting the zoom ring, it won't zoom whilst the camera is turned off. What I really like about the zoom that all the optics stay inside the housing of the lens, unlike my other zoom lens which will stick out the more you increase its zoom. It's also very quiet that I can't hear it when it's zooming in or out (very positive feature to have when filming).So far I've used it more for videography than photography, however the photos I have taken with it have came out sharp and clear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31MJK80T4F3KD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENZRQH8#wasThisHelpful","R31MJK80T4F3KD","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:58 Mins♦ Introduction ♦Danboard otherwise known as Danbo originated from the Manga, 'Yotsuba&!'. Though many may have come across this character through photos taken of the figurine in many adorable situations.  Nevertheless this cable is aimed at Danbo fans which I'm sure won't disappoint.There are three different types of Danbo charging cables, all of which are available with various cable lengths:∙ USB - Micro USB: 10cm | 25cm | 50cm | 100cm | 180cm.∙ USB - Lightning: 10cm | 25cm | 50cm |100cm.∙ USB - M/L Combo*: 10cm | 25cm | 50cm | 100cm.*The lightning connector is attached to the micro USB via plastic cable.  To use the lightning connector, slot it over the micro USB connection.This cable is compatible with anything that has a USB port, however if you're a really big fan of Danbo, and would like something to go well with the cable, the Cheero Power Plus 10400mAh DANBOARD Power Bank would make a great addition if you don't have one already.♦ Quality & Features ♦The cable is braided for extra strength and the connectors on either don't feel of cheap quality.  Overall all, the cable does seem like it's been made to a high quality standard.Danbo's face can be seen on the USB connector.  When it's connected to an active USB port, his eye's light-up red, then as soon as a device is connected on the other end, his eye's turn to yellow.♦ Final Thoughts ♦There's not really much I can say as it's just a charging cable after all, however the Danboard theme is a very nice touch.Price wise it is a little bit more costly than some others on the market, but you are paying for the most adorable cable on the market.► Note: I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F3U51QR33HZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SG8UYBS#wasThisHelpful","R2F3U51QR33HZY","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:38 Mins#UPDATE: I've put together a video which shows video/image quality and a run through of the modes and Bluetooth functions. Note that depending on which device you're viewing this from, you may not be able to view the video.♦ Introduction ♦The action camera market is a fiercely competitive one. Ranging from all kinds of ranges from affordable budget action cams to the more pricey premium action cams, there is always going to be one for everybody. The problem is finding the one that fits for your purpose.I've owned and used various action cams from budget brands to the more premium brands such as GoPro, Sony & Drift; all of which have their own positives, however you will find that they are good in different areas to each other.Sena's Prism action camera is the first to have in-built Bluetooth technology that can communicate with other Bluetooth headsets (either Sena or non-Sena branded). This allows users to record their own dialogue over their video footage without wires. Unlike the Drift which requires a wired mic to overlay audio, the Prism doesn't which means more mounting options are available.- Main Features:∙ 137° Field of view.∙ Full HD 1080p at 30fps.∙ Bluetooth voice recording with Bluetooth headsets.∙ Ultra HD audio recording with combined use of Sena UHD compatible headsets.∙ Included Quick-release Mounting system.∙ Bluetooth 4.0 technology.∙ Charge whilst being in use.∙ 2 Hours battery life.∙ Firmware upgradable.♦ Box Contents & Recommended Extras ♦Unlike most other big brands which fall within the same price range, Sena actually include a decent variety of mounts in the box already. Brands such as GoPro, Sony & Drift only include the basic adhesive mounts with their action cameras, so it was refreshing to see a brand actually include a good variety of mounts to begin with.- Box Contents:∙ PRISM Camera | Lens Cap | Waterproof Housing | Skeleton Back-door.∙ Helmet Mounting Kit (Helmet Clamp Kit, Goggle Strap Mount & Helmet Surface Mounts etc...).∙ Motorcycle Mounting Kit & QRM System (Single & Dual Suction Cups, Handlebar Mounts & Quick-Release Mounting System).∙ Allen Wrench.∙ Safety Wire.∙ Micro USB Cable.∙ Instruction manuals*.* There are two manuals included: First is the 'PRISM Flow Chart' which shows all the settings available and how to find them. The second one is just a quick set-up guide. Unfortunately there isn't a manual showing how to set-up/use the accessories included; whilst most are self explanatory, it still would have been nice.- Recommended Extras:∙ MicroSD Memory Card.- Optional Extras:∙ Spare Battery.∙ Spare Top Surface Mount w/QRM System.∙ USB AC Adapter.∙ Micro HDMI to HDMI cable.- Extra Information:The Prism is EXTREMELY versatile when it comes to mounting. Sure it uses its own proprietary QRM system, however its 1/4"" thread is easily accessible which means it can be attached to other third party mounts too.♦ Prism's Functions & How to Use ♦The rear of the camera has a battery compartment which also conceals the memory card slot as well as the Micro USB & micro HDMI ports. This can be opened by firmly sliding the switch down. The micro USB port (used for file access & charging) is the only part which can be accessed whilst the cover is attached. There is a little rubber flap to protect it from water/dirt however you will need to use the included cable when the battery cover is on as it has extra reach.To the side of the camera is a small LCD screen which when on displays text in a nice clear and bright blue color. The LCD screen displays remaining memory, battery life, camera mode, resolution & frames per second.On top of the camera is an LED indicator, this changes color depending on which mode you have selected:∙ Red: Video mode.∙ Blue: Single shot mode.∙ Green: Burst mode.∙ Pink: Time lapse mode.∙ Off: Settings.∙ Flashing: Recording.Also on top are the 'M' (Mode) & 'S' (Shot) buttons:∙ Hold 'M' & 'S' at the same time to turn the Prism on; tap them to turn the Prism off.∙ 'M': Displays the next option when pressed, or displays settings for the selected mode when held down for a second.∙ 'S': Selects the mode highlighted, so if you're on 'Video', it will start recording when pressed and stop when pressed again.I know it might sound silly me complaining there isn't a microphone port on an action camera that supports Bluetooth connectivity, however covering both ways would have been a welcomed addition as it would provide people with the choice of wired or wireless.♦ Results ♦- Ease of Use:Navigating around the menu system is simple, it's just getting used to where all the settings are which can be time consuming.If you have a smartphone then I would highly recommend paring it with the PRISM, then downloading the 'Sena PRISM' app.Pairing the PRISM to a Bluetooth headset and/or smartphone will require you to do it directly from the PRISM. This can be done by going to 'SET', 'Device SET' then either 'HEADSET Pairing' or 'SMARTPHONE Pairing'.To pair the Prism with a headset, you will need both to be in pairing mode for them to connect. If you own a Sena 20S, disconnect it from the universal clamp, turn it on and shake it to put it into its pairing mode.For smartphones, the PRISM will be visible on your Bluetooth devices list once you've activated the pair mode.The app doesn't allow you to remotely command the PRISM to start recording, however it does gain you superb ease of access to ALL the settings and can be changed quickly.Settings range from resolution to field of view, upside down mode, time-set and mic options such as sidetone and gain. You can also view the PRISM's quick guide and user's guide.If you own a Sena 20S, you can skip through modes and when to record and stop recording using the jog dial. Within my experience, it worked well without any hitches.- Video Quality:Video footage is recorded in the 'MP4' format. 1 minute of 1080p footage took up around 76MB of memory. Files can be found by going into the PRISM folder and through the following folders: 'DCIM' - '100MEDIA'.∙ Daytime Quality: Overall quality is pretty darn good; colors are good and the video is quite clear, however it could be slightly better (a little increase in sharpness and at times better exposure), other than that the video produced is well suited for either personal videos or uploading on YouTube.∙ Low-Light & Night-time Quality: The quality sits between the Drift Ghost HD which can be quite darn awful in low-light (so much noise), and Sony's AS100V which has incredible low-light performance.Whilst video quality at night-time isn't exactly this cameras forte; noise levels are fairly low, it's just can't quite pick up the surroundings. Though footage at night-time with street lighting would be usable as evidence in an event of an accident. Indoor footage is at an acceptable level.The Prism can't touch the low-light levels the AS100V achieves, but compared to some other action cameras, the Prism does pretty well.∙ Image Stabilization: The stabilization is the same as the GoPro & Drift, there is none. It will really depend on how stable the unit is which you're mounting it on. Being mounted on my helmet and having good suspension on my motorcycle meant that the majority of my footage was reasonably smooth.∙ Bluetooth Range: The range may vary on the headset you're using. I used the Sena 20S and managed to get around 20 or so metres away before it decided to cut off; the 20S & Prism automatically reconnected when I was back much closer in range.Leading up to the 20 metre mark (after 10 metres), as I was walking, there were times where the audio became a bit choppy, so I would question the durability going at high speeds with the Prism & headset being further away from each other.I have no doubt that the Prism would stay connected within a 10 metre radius going at speed, so if you were to mount it onto your motorbike rather than your helmet, there will be no issues in connectivity.If you're planning on dual-vlogging (compatible via Sena headsets), make sure the headset that you've paired with the Prism is closest to it. If the PRISM is on your bike, you need to equip the headset that's paired up with it. So as long as your headset is connected to the Prism and is also getting signal from the other headset, audio from both parties will be recorded.∙ Sound Quality: The in-built microphone picks up sound with a lot of clarity, however does also pick up a lot of wind noise at speeds. This can be reduced by using a waterproof housing, but it's still noticeable.The Prism REALLY shines when using in conjunction with a Sena product that supports UHD audio such as the 20S Bluetooth communication device. The results are fantastic! It captures your voice with crystal clear clarity, very pleased indeed.I can't comment on the quality of a normal Bluetooth headset as I don't have one.- Photo Quality:Photos can be taken singularly or via the burst setting (3, 5 or 10 pics), photo resolution ranges from 3MP to 5MP. The Prism has a decent response time from pressing the button to taking the photo. I timed it to be around 80ms. Photos are saved in the 'JPEG' format and can be found in the same folder as the videos.Daytime quality is above average and doesn't suffer from much motion blur. It's perfect for posting on social media such as Facebook, but wouldn't rely on them to make prints.Low-light quality is usable, but can suffer from bad motion blur if moved whilst taking a photo.- Time Lapse:The time lapse feature is extremely cool. You can choose the Prism to take a photo in 1, 3, 5, 10, 30, or 60 second intervals. You also have the choice to save them as individual files or make into a video! Neat eh?- Battery & Temperature:Whilst using the Bluetooth feature, I managed to get a total of one and a half hours worth of footage and the battery hadn't died, but was getting very low. I think it could possibly get near to the two hour mark which is pretty good for something that uses Bluetooth as well.The only time I noticed the Prism getting quite hot on the side was when I was using it inside and was constantly plugging it into my laptop. Otherwise when in use outside, there was no noticeable heat, even when it was enclosed in its waterproof housing. There was no fogging up either.♦ Final Thoughts ♦The main feature of this action cam is to be able to overlay your speech/conversations from a Bluetooth headset onto your video footage whilst filming. This is extremely convenient as it opens up multiple choices for mounting.Unfortunately I can't comment on the quality with a non-Sena headset as I don't own one, but I can say in use with a Sena headset delivers outstanding results.I do still love my Sony AS100V due to its crazy low-light & image stabilization quality, however its poor mounting options for my needs makes it very unfavourable. As a whole package for motorcycling & motovlogging, the Sena Prism wins hands down.✔ Pros:✓ Smart & slimline design.✓ Ability to flip video footage.✓ Versatile when it comes to mounting.✓ Great variety of settings & features.✓ Simple to use and even simpler with app.✓ Can control the Prism via selected headsets.✓ Tonnes of different mounts included in the box.✓ Amazing audio quality via Bluetooth headset (UHD mode).✓ Has sidetone feature, so you can hear yourself whilst talking./ Neutral:- Video quality is decent, but could be a bit sharper.✖ Cons:✘ No external mic port.✘ Doesn't organise photos & videos into their own separate folders.✘ Quite a lot of wind-noise on internal mic (with and without the waterproof housing).► Note: I personally contacted the manufacturer for a review unit, they agreed to send one out in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BVI65G5WISI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SGA3UYO#wasThisHelpful","R3BVI65G5WISI4","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:47 MinsI've uploaded a video to show an example of the audio quality using it in different modes, so use this to see whether you're happy with the quality it's able to output.  Bare in mind that Amazon has a very low file size restriction, which meant it had to be uploaded in the poorer quality 480p resolution.Also, depending on which device you're using to see this review, the video may not be visible.  I'd recommend viewing on a desktop or laptop..·:*¨*:·.·:*¨*:·.·:*¨*:·.·:*¨*:·.♦ Introduction ♦When it comes to motorcycle gadgets and tech, Sena really have been making great strides when it comes to innovation, firstly by making a device that allows you to overlay your voice to GoPro cameras via Bluetooth; followed by making their very own Bluetooth audio action camera, the Prism. Sena have now stepped the game up even further by making the 10C, an all inclusive action camera and Bluetooth intercom/communication device.Going through the specs of the 10C, it's as if Sena have almost perfectly combined the 20S with the Prism into one package, but look closer or even use it in fact, and you will see it's not exactly the same. Whilst the 10C has gained some extra features like 'Video Tagging' or 'Smart Audio Mix' which are FANTASTIC to have, it has also lost a couple, one that I've clearly noticed is that there's no 'UHD Voice Recording' which unfortunately hinders sound quality when recording your voice. That said, depending on your needs and expectations, the recording quality of the 10C may be absolutely fine.When it comes to weight, the 10C weighs 34g (1.19oz) more than the 20S which weighs 60g (2.11oz), but is only marginly bigger in size, so is still very compact. Also despite the 10C having the extra camera feature, the 10C only has three main buttons and is surprisingly very simple to use. Sena have also given the 10C a ""cool"" & ""unique"" look which seems to grab other motorcyclists curiosity.- Main Features:∙ Action Cam & Bluetooth communication system/intercom in one device.∙ Full HD 1080p Recording at 30FPS (720P at 60FPS is available).∙ 125°FoV with F/2 aperture.∙ 30° Lens rotation to level out footage.∙ Time-Lapse Feature.∙ 1.6km (1 mile) intercom range (with no obstacles in the way).∙ Up to four-way intercom.∙ Voice prompts (the headset will tell you when a mode is activated, so you're always aware of what's happening).∙ Smart audio mix (Overlay intercom conversations, music, FM radio or phonecalls to your footage).∙ Video tagging.∙ Microphone noise control.∙ Music sharing to other intercoms.∙ FM Radio.∙ Universal Intercom.∙ Use whilst charging.∙ Firmware Upgradable.*There is a firmware upgrade that's already available, so before using the 10C, go to Sena's website and search for their 'Device Manager' which is needed to update the 10C.- Box Contents:∙ Main Headset Unit.∙ Helmet Clamp.∙ Adhesive Mounting Plate.∙ Helmet Speakers.∙ Attachable Boom Mic.∙ Boom Mic Holder.∙ Mic Wind Shields.∙ Wired Mic.∙ USB - Micro USB Cable.∙ Car Charger (Cigarette Port).∙ Pads, Covers and Hook & Loop Fasteners for Speakers & Mics.∙ Allen Wrench.∙ Quick Start Guide.- Recommended Extras:∙ MicroSD Memory Card (The 10C only supports up to 32GB).♦ Helmet Attachment Set-Up ♦- Mount:You have two choices to mount the 10C to your helmet; either by using the helmet clamp or the adhesive plate.I used the helmet clamp as not only does it not leave any residue onto my helmet, it makes the whole mounting and un-mounting a quick and easy process.To attach the helmet clamp, ensure the clamp is loosened by using the included Allen wrench to undo the bolts; then slide the clamp onto your helmet (the part going inside your helmet should go between the shell and the cushion).After it's slotted in firmly and you're happy with the position, tighten up the bolts so the clamp is fixed in position.If you're using the adhesive plate, ensure the area it's being placed on is cleaned and dried (alcohol wipes are good to use). It's best to leave the adhesive plate on for at least 24 hours before mounting the 10C on to ensure it has settled properly.- Main Unit, Speakers & Microphone:I found it easier to mount the 10C onto my helmet and getting it in the correct position before setting everything else up. The 10C slides onto the mount, then you can adjust the vertical angle by loosening the wheel then twisting the camera around, and then twist the lens for the horizontal alignment.The speakers slot into the rear-right port of the 10C and the microphone is then plugged into a connector on the speakers cables. Place the speakers somewhere that's comfortable (if your helmet has speaker pockets, even better), then insert the microphone somewhere secure such as between the cheek pads and the helmet shell whilst allowing the boom part to protrude out.♦ Intercom & Smartphone Set-Up ♦- Intercom (Sena Intercoms):1) Whilst powered on, hold the jog button down for 5 seconds to enter intercom pairing.2) Ensure the other Sena headset is also in intercom pairing mode.3) Press the jog button.- Intercom (Non-Sena Intercoms):You will need to navigate through the 10C configuration menu by holding the jog button down for 12 seconds.- Smartphone:1) Whilst powered on, hold the phone button down for 5 seconds to enter phone pairing.2) Ensure your smartphones Bluetooth in activated, then search and click on 'Sena 10C'.♦ 10C Usability & Battery Life ♦- Usability:If you've used a 20S before then you'll have no issues in operating the 10C as the commands are the same, the only addition to learn is the camera button which is very simple to use.I would advise looking at the quick guide included or by using the one available on the app, which is great when you're on the go.The buttons are well positioned and are easy to use, it just takes a little practice to remember the commands.If there's one change I could make, it would be to match the size of the control wheel to the 20S. Although it's still at a size where it's usable, the 20S is much user friendly.- Battery Life:Sena have advertised the 10C in having battery life for the following:∙ Talk time (Intercom) - 17 hours.∙ Radio on time - 8 hours.∙ Recording time - 2 hours.Testing the intercom or radio for such amounts of time is rather extreme, so I decided to test the battery life from full charge on the most battery draining feature, video recording, and these are the results I got:∙ Recording without using any Bluetooth or intercom features in 1080p: 2hrs, 17min & 21sec.∙ Recording whilst connected to my smartphone via Bluetooth and playing music in 1080p: 2hrs, 7min & 32sec.The 10C monitors the battery levels and will disable recording as to leave you with decent talk time left, which is a very good feature to have.All in all the battery life is quite respectful, however I do want to point out that it's not removable. So why is this a problem? Well, whilst not entirely an issue if it was just used as an intercom because of how little often you would need to charge it, as it's being used as an action camera, you will find yourself charging it more often. Rechargeable batteries have a certain amount of charging cycles before it dies, so for action cameras it's quite important to be able to replace them when they're rendered useless.♦ Audio Quality & Wireless Range ♦- Intercom Quality (10C connected to 20S):I couldn't say anything bad about the audio quality whilst having an intercom conversation.The other person was clear and easy to understand and apparently I was too.- Phonecall Quality:Being on the receiving end, the quality is only going to be as good as the other persons phone.The receiver from my audio stated that it was clear that I wasn't directly on a phone, however had no idea I was actually riding my motorcycle. He did point out that the quality he was receiving could have some improvement.- FM Radio Quality:This may vary from person to person depending on the area they're in.Basing it on my experience, the FM radio quality was absolutely superb, a huge improvement in quality from my 20S.No matter which way I turned my head or whatever directly I was riding, the quality was consistent.- Music Quality:I listen to various genres from classical, pop, rock, electronica and dub-step and I found the quality to be more than satisfactory; well balance and clear sounding.You can achieve a high volume level with very little distortion, however I really wouldn't recommend it that high as we need some road awareness with our ears for safety.- Intercom Wireless Range:For a Bluetooth device, the intercom range is actually very good (although not as good as the 20S).On a nice clear stretch, my friend and I were quite some distance away from each other, myself being quite a few cars in front and we had no noticeable drop outs.However, add some corners with a lot of obstacles in the way such as a lot trees and you will notice the range will decrease significantly, so just bare that in mind.♦ Action Camera Quality ♦- Video Quality:Video files are recorded in 44min 36sec segments, so once you've gone past that time on a constant recording it will automatically create a new file. All video files are recorded in the QuickTime Movie (.mov) format.As for video quality, I would say it's at an acceptable quality. Of course it's not going to be anywhere as near as the likes of Sony or GoPro branded action cameras, so if sharpness & clarity were a major factor for your videos, then maybe this isn't the right product for you, just remember that the 10C isn't marketed towards the same area as they are.To break it down, the 10C performs well in daylight. decently in cloudy and just about okay in low-light with street lights around.- Audio Quality (Voice Recording):I have to say that in this department I'm fairly disappointed. Although usable, it's not something I'm used to coming from using the 20S and Prism.Considering the Prism took the audio from the 20S via Bluetooth, the voice recordings came out so clear! But with the 10C having a wired microphone, I honestly expected better.Like I said it's usable, and to be honest a lot of people wanting to use this for motovlogging may think it will do just fine, I can see there being a lot of people finding the quality not acceptable.- Overlays:This is a really neat feature to have; if you're listening to music, FM radio or talking via intercom, these audio's will be overlaid onto your video recordings, and they come out rather clear too. Do note that the audio will be as loud on the recordings as you have it, so if it's too loud for your ears, it will be too loud on the recordings.These of course can be disabled (much easier doing it through the app), as well as there being an option which is turned off by default, to allow you to record your phone conversations!For me, the overlaying ""Smart Audio Mix"" is a much loved feature!♦ Smartphone App ♦To anyone using the 10C, I would highly recommend downloading the 'Sena Utility' app on your smartphone as it's an incredibly useful app to have. Once connected to the app, you can view the following tabs:∙ My Sena: This is the home screen, it tells you which firmware version your 10C has and which version is the latest to be released. You can also quickly select 'Basic Settings', 'Quick Guide' & 'User's Guide' on this page.∙ Basic Settings: This page has a variety of settings to enable/disable, such as sidetone, voice prompts and audio boost etc... It also allows you to choose which video quality you would prefer to record with and which overlays you would like to enable etc...∙ Speed Dial: Save up to three phone numbers for the speed dial feature.∙ FM Radio: Select your region and save up to 10 of your favourite radio stations.∙ Quick Guide: A guide for when on the go. This guide covers with coloured pictures and text how to operate the 10C. Topics range from adjusting volume, checking battery level, pairing with other devices, using the camera and other features. The layout is done very well which makes it easy to read and understand.∙ User's Guide: A more intensive guide that pretty much covers EVERYTHING you need to know, however I personally found the quick guide more useful.♦ Final Opinion ♦The 10C really is a unique product within the motorcycle accessory market and is definitely something that will appeal to a lot of motorcyclists.Considering how much features this device packs inside, I think the asking price is more than reasonable. Since owning this, I've had a couple of friends buy the 10C who have been satisfied by their purchase.If you're someone who is looking for high quality wireless voice recording and a lot of the features the 10C has, then I would highly suggest going for the 20S Bluetooth Communication Device & Prism Action Camera instead.Overall I would recommend the 10C, just make sure it ticks your boxes before you go ahead.✔ Pros:✓ 10C packs a whole load of features into one unit.✓ Great looking device.✓ Simple mounting system.✓ Very good button layout for ease of use.✓ Intercom is very clear.✓ Receiving audio from smartphone is good quality.✓ Video tagging mode is a great additional feature for motorcyclists.✓ Battery life is impressive.✖ Cons:✘ Non-removable battery.✘ No 'UHD Voice Recording'.► Note: I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14FJ8ANG65KTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SGASQBQ#wasThisHelpful","R14FJ8ANG65KTT","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:58 Mins♦ Introduction ♦Danboard otherwise known as Danbo originated from the Manga, 'Yotsuba&!'. Though many may have come across this character through photos taken of the figurine in many adorable situations.  Nevertheless this cable is aimed at Danbo fans which I'm sure won't disappoint.There are three different types of Danbo charging cables, all of which are available with various cable lengths:∙ USB - Micro USB: 10cm | 25cm | 50cm | 100cm | 180cm.∙ USB - Lightning: 10cm | 25cm | 50cm |100cm.∙ USB - M/L Combo*: 10cm | 25cm | 50cm | 100cm.*The lightning connector is attached to the micro USB via plastic cable.  To use the lightning connector, slot it over the micro USB connection.This cable is compatible with anything that has a USB port, however if you're a really big fan of Danbo, and would like something to go well with the cable, the Cheero Power Plus 10400mAh DANBOARD Power Bank would make a great addition if you don't have one already.♦ Quality & Features ♦The cable is braided for extra strength and the connectors on either don't feel of cheap quality.  Overall all, the cable does seem like it's been made to a high quality standard.Danbo's face can be seen on the USB connector.  When it's connected to an active USB port, his eye's light-up red, then as soon as a device is connected on the other end, his eye's turn to yellow.♦ Final Thoughts ♦There's not really much I can say as it's just a charging cable after all, however the Danboard theme is a very nice touch.Price wise it is a little bit more costly than some others on the market, but you are paying for the most adorable cable on the market.► Note: I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SI5BWZ34VF7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJGPQP4#wasThisHelpful","R2SI5BWZ34VF7W","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"♦ Introduction ♦The MDR-10RC's are Sony's entry level Hi-Res audio compatible headphones. These on-ear headphones have 40mm dynamic driver units & an impressive 5Hz-40KHz frequency response.I really like the style of these, if you're looking for some smart looking headphones, then these fit the bill. There are also three different colored themes to choose from: Black | White | Red. I have the black version, which I really like.- Main Features:∙ High-Resolution Audio compatible.∙ 40mm dynamic driver units.∙ 5-40,000Hz Frequency Response.∙ Foldable.♦ Box Contents ♦∙ MDR-10RC Headphones.∙ 1.2m length 3.5mm Audio cord (Gold plated: Straight & L-shaped connector).∙ 1.2m length 3.5mm Audio cord w/ in-line remote & mic (Gold plated: Straight & L-shaped connector).∙ Carry case.∙ Instruction manual.♦ Comfort & Sound ♦I normally have issues quite quickly with on-ear headphones due to me wearing glasses, which is why I usually go for the over-ear types. These headphones stretch smoothly, the ear-cushions are amazingly soft and there is very little pinch on the ears which means I can wear them for longer than I would normally. I'd say I can manage around 40 minutes before needing to rest my ears.Although there is very little pinch, they do stay on my head even when I move, however if you're a head-banging type, they will probably fly off.Audio quality I found to be utterly superb... I own a couple headphones, but these are the best by far. Very clear audio, well balanced and and can deliver just the right amount of bass when needed.There is a bit leakage when playing at louder volumes, but it's not really noticeable when they are being worn.As already stated it's compatible with Hi-Res audio, so if you have something like the NWZ-A15 Hi-Res Walkman with some 24-Bit songs at the ready then you'll notice these shining even more. As a test I used these headphones on my friends iPhone 6 playing 16-Bit version of some tunes, then used them on my A15 with the 24-Bit equivalent and there was even more clarity on the vocals and instrumentals. Just to make sure there was a difference, I asked two of my more musically minded friends to test them; they both agreed there was a positive difference.♦ Final Thoughts ♦The MDR-10RC are a great pair of headphones.If on-ear styled headphones really aren't you thing, you might want to look into the over-eared version: MDR-1A, these are more expensive and supposedly better quality too. Whilst I can't comment on them personally, they seem to be getting positive reviews from other people.Anyway, would I recommend the MDR-10RC headphones?

"It's been two years since her last album Speak Now which had a new sound whilst keeping the feeling your listening to the artist you loved since her first release, I was a little worried whether or not she would be able to up her performance in this new album, and I can assure you she has.This album has an awesome mix of different styled tunes, for example if you listen to 'State of Grace', 'Treacherous', 'I Knew You Were Trouble.', 'All Too Well' & 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together', just to name a few, you will realise that sound completely different. There are quite a lot of bands & artists who have albums which most of the songs sound very similar to others, and Taylor manages to give you a different feel for each song you listen too.One thing that has pleased me is that a few of my friends had reluctantly admitted to me that have enjoyed one or two of her new songs, not that it bothered me too much of the quite frequent digs I get for appreciating her music(I know they're in denial ;)), however it's a nice change to hear something positive about an artist you enjoy listening too.Overall, it's a pretty solid album which I would highly recommend to those who are into pop/country type genre, and especially to those Swift fans out there, however I'm sure you already own it if you are. ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V9V19DRMB6V4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XNZMOU#wasThisHelpful","R1V9V19DRMB6V4","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sony's XA900iP wireless speaker dock is one of four in the X-series that is currently available on the market, at the moment it's the highest model available out of the series with a huge price tag, just the mere thought will manage to make any persons eyes water. I think the main question for many people would be ""is it really worth the money?"", well ladies and gentlemen, I can genuinely say this has not only(to date) been the best dock I have proudly had the chance to play with, but possibly one of the best 2.1 speakers I have ever heard.... oh and it looks great too!- - -Most docks on the market connect to devices via one or two ways, either with a combination of an iPod dock accompanied by an AUX port; Bluetooth & AUX, or just the one alone. A good example would be the Philips Fidelio SBD7500 Fidelio Portable Docking Speaker which lets you connect your iPod/iPhone directly to a docking port or any device that has an AUX port available.However the XA900iP has many different ports making it one of the most compatible docks available; it features the following:1) Main Dock: Apple devices only. It accepts all generations of iPod, iPhone & iPads (up to date of review) & even charges them!2) AirPlay: Another Apple feature which allows you to stream your music wirelessly to the dock.3) Bluetooth: Many devices have this feature of which should be Android based, so if you have an Android phone or tablet, you can play music & audio wirelessly, though please note that Bluetooth devices work on average up to 32 feet (10 meters) away.4) Digital In: By using an optical/digital cable(not supplied), you can transmit your audio from main home devices such as your Television, PlayStation 3 and Blu-ray player!5) Analog In: Otherwise known as an AUX port, by using an auxiliary cable(not supplied), you can connect devices such as a Walkman or CD player to play music.6) Video Out: For use with iPad when connected directly on the dock to view videos on a display such as a TV. (Cable not supplied)Due to these multiple compatibilities, this dock is great for social gatherings and parties where peoples devices vary.For those using the dock via Bluetooth or iPod Dock feature, you can use the included remote control to skip tracks and adjust volume wirelessly. (People using the dock via iPod, I would recommend downloading the app so you can browse through your tracks without having to unlock the phone).- - -The other main feature a dock needs is good sound quality, for those who really appreciate music, listening to bad audio quality can be an unpleasant experience. When it comes to top-notch sound quality, this unit delivers, in fact it actually delivered more than what I had expected.This product advertises it has `dual-passive radiators' and `magnetic fluid speaker units' which provide powerful bass, higher sound pressure and less sound distortion. I honestly couldn't tell you what they were exactly, but what I can be sure about is that the speakers really do produce crystal clear sound and rich/perfectly balanced bass even at high volumes.I've tried listening to pop, rock, metal, country and more and couldn't fault anything, you could literally hear every beat of the track.So far all I've had from people are positive responses when they've heard what this speaker can deliver, two musician friends who are EXTREMELY picky when it comes to sound have done nothing but compliment the sound quality, even one said it is on par with a high-end Bose speaker he had listened too.As for the looks, it's elegant, very stylish and one that would suit being in many different styled rooms.- - -Overall I believe it's a great investment for people who are obsessed with sound and for those who really like getting the most out of their music, yes the price tag is big but will be worth it for any audiophile out there!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22HZ92G8MG036/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009E6J8UE#wasThisHelpful","R22HZ92G8MG036","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:16 MinsI managed to try this case out with an RX100 before the release at a Sony product event.I loved the feel of quality and it looked amazing, another thing I liked was a screw that goes through the bottom of the case into the cameras tripod receptacle, this ensured the camera was completely solid and would not fall out of the case, the screw also has a tripod receptacle at the bottom so you could still mount it on top of a tripod.The top part of the case is held together by some poppers which is easily taken off if you wish to remove it, though you can keep it on and just flip it over so it's out of the way.As for the strap, once again amazing quality.The only reason why it had received four stars rather than five was purely based on the current price, Sony have it available at an eye-watering price and whilst I will be purchasing this case for my RX100 due to the fact it provides a perfect fit and is of great quality, I will be grinding my teeth whilst doing so.Though as mentioned before, it is very high quality, so if you want one that is perfect for the RX100, then you will need to fork out that extra cash to get your hands on this premium case.[EDIT - July 2013]I have now tried this with the RX100M2  and can safely say it fits in perfectly, though when it comes to moving the screen it just catches the sides of the case, to get around this it's best to extend the screen out before inserting the camera into the case, though only do this when the camera is in use.[EDIT - AUGUST 2013]People who own the RX100M2 may want to purchase the LCJ-RXC camera case, it is available at a higher cost, however is designed for this newer model.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLYIP6VX1ODYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006K551TO#wasThisHelpful","RLYIP6VX1ODYY","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From watching the trailer, I got a slight understanding of the film; guy has no friends when he starts his first year in high school and struggles to make them also, he then finally meets some nice people who befriend him, which to one he falls in love with.Whilst the base of the story is just as I had predicted, the film as a whole was so much more.Charlie who is the main character is extremely socially awkward, and you get hints close to the beginning that something in his past had caused him to be this way, eventually you start finding out Charlie has a very deep story in the past which is gradually explained through as the film goes on by flash-backs, you will eventually find out why he is the person he is today, this combined with the journey through his first year with his new friends who also have different personal issues makes this film an emotional roller-coaster.I don't want to ruin the story for those who haven't seen it, so I'm not going to go into further detail.On a final note, I do want to point out that the cast for this film was perfect, they were all brilliant at their roles and made the film very believable.  I also want to say Emma Watson did an especially good job at portraying her character 'Sam'.  As she's widely recognised for playing Hermione from the Harry Potter films, it must have been hard for her to shake off that image that has been imprinted into peoples minds throughout these years, which she has done so brilliantly in this film, this shows how good she is of an actress.I would highly recommend this film for those who enjoy drama/romantic based films and I certainly will be buying this film when it comes out on DVD/Blu-ray.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDWK4Q5EXBYHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AMAKJU#wasThisHelpful","RDWK4Q5EXBYHC","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After misplacing my favourite and impossible to find earphones that came with my Walkman, I decided to purchase these due to the similarity in shape and of course the very reasonable price.These earphones come with three different sized ear-buds(one pair already attached), I had to swap these around because the ones already on were way too small for my ears, but once the size was changed, I found these to be extremely comfortable.As for the sound, I honestly didn't expect too much from these due to the price, but to my surprise they were a lot better than I had initially thought; the audio is very crisp and it can deliver a decent amount of bass also.I've listened to a good variety of different genres of music from artists such as Skrillex, Owl City, Taylor Swift, Passion Pit, 30 Seconds to Mars & Metallica and have no complaints about the audio quality.That said they're certainly not the best earphones I have ever listened too, but I feel you get more quality than what you pay for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UGUCCQ8AON4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RF9XM0#wasThisHelpful","R3UGUCCQ8AON4R","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those who don't have a graphics card that has multiple ports or HDMI connections, then this is an absolutely fantastic unit for those who want to view their desktop/laptop on their TV, extra monitor(with HDMI-IN), or anything that supports HDMI as either an extension, main display or duplicate image.This little unit is very simple to set-up:1) Connect the USB cable from this device into your PC/laptop.2) IF you want audio to come out from the unit your connecting this too, insert the audio cable into the headphone slot of your PC/laptop.3) Connect a HDMI Cable(sold seperately) from the device to your desired unit (I chose my 16"" 720p LED TV).When I connected this device to my desktop which runs on Windows 7, it automatically sorted out the drivers and within a minute it was all set-up, though there is a driver disk included if for some reason you need to do it manually.Once it's all set-up, right-click on your desktop and go to ""screen resolution"", from here you can select the following options on ""Multiple displays"":1) Duplicate: This option will put make the displays display the exact same thing, though do note it will show both screens in the resolution that is supported on both screens.For example; my monitor can display with 1920x1080, but my TV I'm connected to only supports up to 1280x720, therefore both screens will be shown at 1280x720 resolution.2) Extend; depending on what is your main display, when your cursor goes off your current screen, it will end up on the other one.You can change which one is your main display by clicking on either (1) or (2) and click on ""Make this my main display"", which is located under the multiple displays option.You can also decide whether your cursor will go off the screen to the left or right by dragging (2) display to the left or right(default).3) Show desktop only on 1.4) Show desktop only on 2.And that's pretty much too it.I've also managed to connect my Sony 3D viewer thanks to this unit, which meant I could play 'Slender: Eight Pages' on it.... and yes it was terrifyingly awesome.The image quality this device passes on to the connected TV I found to be extremely good, I wouldn't say it's exactly HD quality, but it's close enough and I'm happy with the outcome.When I had used the audio cable with my TV the audio was very good, though when no audio is being played there is a bit of static noise, however this may be my headphone port as it does it with my headphones also.Overall it's a decent product and I've found it very useful indeed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XEBCKKR6FHPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008QXXJ42#wasThisHelpful","R2XEBCKKR6FHPB","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ActionPro's 1080p HD ActionCam definitely offers some serious competition in today's market of high-end sport/action cams.This little unit offers up to 1080p quality at 30fps or 720p at 60fps and a 170 wide-angle lens that really delivers top-quality results.What's in the Box?ActionCam (with 4GB MicroSD card) | LCD Screen | Battery | Remote Control | Waterproof Case | Tray Mount | Helmet Mount |Helmet Front Mount | Flat Mount | Power Adaptor | AV Cable | USB Cable | User Manual.- - - - - - - - - - - - -Features & Settings:- - - - - - - - - - - - -The first most important thing to do when you unpack everything is to charge the ActionCam, you can do this by using the power supply, or connecting it to your PC or laptop via the USB cable, the recommendation is around 3hours to charge.(Note that you will need to connect the ActionCam to your computer via USB to access the video files).Once done, I personally recommend attaching the LCD screen onto the ActionCam and then turn it on to toggle the settings, this way you know when the screen is detached, it's recording with all the appropriate settings you want it to have.Pressing the ""M"" button will get you to the main ""Camcorder"" menu, you have the following to select:*Resolution: 1080p (30fps) | 720p/60 (60fps) | 720p (30fps) | WVGA (60fps).If you're using the cam for quite fast paced sports such as motorcycling, then I would suggest the 720p/60 as the higher frame rate will give you smoother video footage.*Video Length: 5min, 10min, 15min, 30min.This breaks up the video into segments into whatever you have chosen.  Shorter video lengths will give you more video segments which will make it easier edit, and longer lengths will give you less segments which are easier to put together if you don't want to edit clips.*Laser Sync: Off | On.I would suggest keeping this setting off, because it can easily be toggled when the camera is on by holding the record button for a few seconds.You can then go into the ""Camera"" settings by clicking right, here you will have the following options to choose from:*Single Shot.*Triple Shot.*Continuous: 0s | 2s | 3s | 5s | 10s | 20s | 30s | 60s.*Resolution: 3M | 5M | 8M.The cam is actually a 5MP sensor, so I would advice using the 5M setting.The next tab is the ""Set-Up"" menu, here you can set-up the date/time and whether you want it to be displayed on your video & photos, select power saving options and adjust the TV settings (PAL or NTSC).- - - - - - - - - - -Using the camera:- - - - - - - - - - -Once the camera has been charged up and all the settings have been set, it's time to get the camera mounted.It's really up to you where you want to stick the provided pads, for example you could stick it to the fairing of your motorcycle, or on your helmet, there are many possible ways to use the mounts, you just need to make sure it's in an appropriate area so you get the best camera view as well as being somewhere that isn't going to vibrate too much which would cause the cam to shake.The sticky pads are extremely secure, once stuck on properly, it isn't going to come off without a fight, so do make sure your happy with the place it's going to be stuck on.  Personally I chose the side of my helmet and used the extenders to give my cam the best angle.I want to also add that because the cam has a tripod mount at the bottom of it, it widens the usage of what you can use it on.(Tripods, Camera Pistol Grip, Dolly, etc...)To mount the cam when it's encased in the waterproof housing, you will need to use the clip connector rather than the screw, this is very easy to swap over (takes seconds).  Do note this accessories main purpose is for underwater usage and whilst it will significantly reduce wind noise when on a motorcycle etc... it will steam up when using it out of the water if the weather is too hot.Once mounted, turn on the cam by holding the power button for a few seconds, to get the best angle, hold down the record button, this will turn on the laser.  The laser points to the exact centre of where it will record, this makes the laser one of my most favourite features of this cam as it reduces time setting up and more time to record your action.On the cam you have to options; on the left you have the record button which will toggle the recording on/off, and to the right is the snap-shot button, or you can use the remote control to wirelessly select the one you want, except with the remote control you will need to press the stop button to stop recording.Using the cam was a breeze, that was until I wanted to use the waterproof housing... putting the cam into the housing is easy and will completely keep the water away, the problem is whilst there is a button to record and take a picture, there is no button to turn the cam on or off.  To get around this, you will need to turn the power saving options off and make sure the camera is on before you encase it, it's easy enough to do this, but it is an annoying hassle that could have been avoiding by adding an extra button.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Video, Sound & Picture Quality:- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -The video quality I personally found to be absolutely amazing, be it in sunny or overcast conditions, the quality was always clear and the frame-rate extremely smooth making it a top choice for those who want something for a wide variety of sport activities.As for late-evening/night time (with some light source), I wasn't expecting much, though it surprised me, even though the picture had quite a bit amount of noise to it (which is completely understandable), you can still pick out all of your surroundings which makes this cam great for those who want to record their commute from home to work and vice-versa for security purposes.The sound quality is also very decent, using it for slower speed activities it picks up sound well, though if your going at faster speeds such as when your on a motorcycle understandably you may pick up a bit of wind-noise.Unfortunately, this cam doesn't have an external mic jack.Picture quality is reasonable; I've had a mixed bag of results, some good some blury. You're never going to get results equivalent to digital cameras currently available on the market, however you can still get some pretty cool snap-shots.- - - - - - - - - -Final Opinion:- - - - - - - - - -This is a fantastic ActionCam which I think many people would appreciate, okay so the waterproof case issue mentioned above is a little annoying, but you can still get around it.  The most important part is it's easy to use and delivers outstanding video quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UDNEGSIJU26P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008OXOBYQ#wasThisHelpful","R1UDNEGSIJU26P","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:19 MinsIf your looking for a good quality router that provides good speed and great connectivity whilst not having to splash too much cash, then this may be the ideal router for you.What's in the box?: Router with two antennas | power adaptor | network cable | manual.Connecting everything up was at first hassle free; screw the antennas on to the router, then connect your main modem/router to new Uspeed router to each others WAN ports via network cables, and then power them both up.As soon as you've connected the router and it's up and running, you need to make sure you go through the set-up process as soon as possible as it doesn't have it's own default security key.If your doing it directly by wire, then there wont be a problem, but if your using a wireless dongle, I had an issue when connecting, it stated something along the lines of registering the router, and to do this requires a 4 or 8 digital security number which would normally be on the back of the router, this one doesn't have that code imprinted, so to bypass that I had typed in a random 4 numbers which let me go through the options, by the end of it, windows stated I can register later, but lets me stay connected to the router.Once connected, you need to go into a browser and type in '192.168.0.1', this connects you to the routers settings, when promoted for the user name and password, type in 'admin' in both boxes and you will be into the routers main menu. After that, go to 'Wizard' and go through all the steps and make sure you create your own 'WPA' security code, that way no unauthorised persons can connect to you router.Then your done and your all good to go! It may seem a bit of a hassle, but it's actually a lot easier to set-up than it sounds. The complete set-up took no more than 10 minutes altogether.I want to state that people who already own the best types of modem/router (wireless-N), are not going to notice a speed difference, in fact after measuring the speed differences, they were both exactly the same. However if you have poor wireless range, then you may be interested in this router because throughout my experience, it had a lot stronger signal than my main hub. Before set-up, Uspeeds router had less signal than my main hub, however after I have yet to see if fall below 5 bars and I have been using it for almost two weeks now.So what about the 2.4GHz & 5GHz bands? Pretty much every standard wireless dongle connects via the 2.4GHz band, so to use the 5GHz band you will need to have one that can pick it up.2.4GHz & 5GHz don't actually offer a different in transfer speed, however 2.4 GHz has a better connectivity over longer distances and is better at getting through walls, 5GHz has a much shorter range but has less interference in normal households because there are less things using that band, this is why it may seem the 5GHz is faster at times.To finalise the review, apart from two negative points about set-up, it's a very decent product available at much affordable price compared to others on the market.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVG9YQI34CSU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008AE2WV8#wasThisHelpful","RVG9YQI34CSU9","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As soon as I saw information released about this camera, I knew instantly I wanted to get my hands on it; it looked awesome and the specifications mentioned seemed incredibly impressive for a camera it's size, so when I finally got it(which of course made a big hole in my credit card), I was super excited to play around with the features and see what it could actually do and if it would live up to the expectations Sony had created about this camera.First impressions were definitely positive, it looks remarkably suave and holding the camera itself I found it to be really comfortable even though it only has one grip which is located precisely for your thumb.  I personally think they got a good balance between grip and style, because if they had added any more grip it would have ruined that nice sleek design it has, for example if you take a look at the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX20V, you will see it has a huge grip which whilst gives maximum grip it does overwhelm the side of the camera.Included in the box are the following:Camera | AC adapter | Battery pack | Micro USB cable | Wrist strap | Two shoulder strap adapters | Manual.Things you NEED:SDHC Card (You can choose a different brand/memory capacity, though do remember as this is a 20MP camera, files sizes average around 5MB if your using Jpeg in fine detail, or is around 20MB if using the RAW format (RAW image has a '.ARW' file extension)).Optional:Camera Case (LCJ-RXA) | USB SDHC Card Reader | Spare Battery NP-BX1 | HDMI - Micro HDMI Cable | Anti-reflective Screen Protector- - -The main thing I love about this camera is it has modes which are great for people who don't have a lot of knowledge about cameras and just want to point and shoot whilst getting great results, and there are modes for those who know more about cameras and want to go more in-depth with the settings.The modes which I personally think are great for those with limited camera knowledge, I would suggest using the mode dial located on top of the camera to choose one of the following:1) Superior Auto; ""This device beautifully shoots automatically while reducing blurring and noise"".My opinion: I've always had great results with this mode, on most occasions it takes the picture I want it to, though sometimes you may want select a mode in the scene setting to get a little bit extra.- - -2) Intelligent Auto; ""Automatically identifies the scene's characteristics and shoots a photo"".My opinion: Pretty much the same scenario with the superior auto, it takes fantastic shots most of the time, though I haven't really noticed the difference between both of them, this may be because I haven't had the chance to test them in many varied locations.- - -3) Scene Selection; Here you can select different pre-setting modes to get the most out of certain scenarios:- Portrait; ""Emphasizes subject by blurring away background. Reproduces soft skin tone"".- Anti Motion Blur; ""Reduces blur indoors with poor lighting or for telephoto shooting to obtain clear images"".- Sports Action; ""Shoots fast motion at higher shutter speeds"".- Pet; ""Shoots pets and other subjects in movement to reduce blur"".- Gourmet; ""Shoots food to look delicious"".- Macro; ""This mode is best suited for shooting close-ups of small subjects such as flowers and food in clear and sharp focus"".- Landscape; ""Shoots the entire range of scenery in a sharp focus with vivid colours"".- Sunset; ""Vividly expresses and dramatically captures the redness of dusk and dawn"".- Night Scene; ""Shoots night scenes clearly. Recommend using tripod"".- Hand-held Twilight; ""Suitable for shooting a night scene without using a tripod"".- Night Portrait; ""Automatically fires the flash to illuminate foreground subjects and engages slow shutter to capture background night scenes"".- Fireworks; ""Shoots beautiful fireworks without flash"".- High Sensitivity; ""Reduces blur even without using flash"".You can select different scene modes by twisting the mode dial back and forth, twist the control ring(my favourite and the easiest way), or go to photo tab 5 which is located within the menu.My opinion: You have such a good amount of different options to choose from.  Not only does the camera explain the best situation to use such scenes, but also shows a picture to give you a better idea of what scene they should be used in.I've had some great shots with the hand-held twilight setting, whilst I don't get perfect shots all the time, it has produced better results than all my previous cyber-shot cameras combined!I also really like the portrait mode.There is one option not on the list from previous models and that is the ""Picture Effect"" mode, this has been moved into the menu or can be selected via the function button (if selected), I would have preferred it to be in the scene selection, but that may be because I'm used to it being there.- - -4) Sweep shooting; ""Creates a panoramic image while you move the camera left/right or up and down at a fixed speed"".You can adjust the settings by going into the menu on photo tab 1.My opinion: This is one of my favourite features on the camera that produces truly amazing panoramic results.- - -5) Movie; Choose from the following movie modes:- Program Auto; ""Auto movie shooting where aperture and shutter speeds are automatic, and other features can be set as desired"".- Aperture Priority; ""Adjusts aperture to change focus range and background defocus"".- Shutter Priority; ""Manually adjusts speed to control how moving subjects are captured"".- Manual Exposure; ""Adjusts aperture and shutter speed manually"".You do have the ability to duel record (take pictures whilst recording) however it's important to note that it's disabled whilst recording in AVCHD format '60p 28M(PS)', so if you do want to take full advantage of this feature, make sure your on '60i 24M(FX)', '60i 17M(FH)' or are recording through the MP4 format. When taking pictures whilst recording, you will NOT hear the shutter sound, instead you till see a message on the screen stating ""captured"", this is to ensure the shutter noise is not recorded.Also note that you don't have to be in the movie mode to start recording, you can start recording on most modes/settings by clicking the record button as you would do normally.My opinion: When recording in the best quality the output is phenomenal, the video is so smooth and it focuses on things very well.  To be honest if it wasn't for the fact that my camcorder has so much more zoom than this camera, I would use this camera instead and scrap my camcorder!- - -For those who understand a bit more about camera settings, you will be pleased to have several modes available for you to use:1) Program Auto; ""Automatically sets aperture and shutter speed.  Other settings can be set as desired"".2) Aperture Priority; ""Adjusts aperture to change the range in focus and amount of background blur.  Small value blurs front and back, large value makes even background in focus"".3) Shutter Priority; ""Adjusts shutter speed manually for different effects of moving subjects.  Faster speeds to appear stopped momentarily.  Slower speed to capture traces of movement"".4) Manual Exposure; ""Adjusts aperture and shutter speed manually"".5) Memory recall; This setting lets you go in-depth with pretty much every setting, you can save up to three profiles which you can quickly select for later usage.  This will be a favourite for a lot of people so they don't have to manually set everything all over again.My opinion: I wouldn't classify myself as someone who knows a lot about in-depth camera settings, but thanks to the camera guide which you can pop-up by clicking the ""?"" button, it's given me some really good simple yet detailed tips to get me started.  I still think it will be awhile before I understand these settings fully, however I'm certain I will get there at some point, it just takes persistence.- - -The menu system is a lot different from the previous cyber-shot cameras I've owned, previously when you click ""Menu"", you get a quick menu system on the left hand side to where you can fiddle around with the settings quickly or choose to go into the proper settings menu, however with this camera it goes straight into one menu where you can browse everything.  This for me is something I had to get used to as it is different, however they do have pictured tabs which make it easy to navigate.Another feature which is new to me is the function button labelled ""Fn"", this button lets you navigate through 7 different options that can be changed to your liking via the menu system.Quick options you can select are: Exposure Comp | Focus Mode | Autofocus Area | ISO | Drive Mode | Metering Mode | Flash Mode | Flash Comp | White Balance | DRO/Auto HDR | Creative Style | Picture Effect | Soft Skin Effect | Quality | Image Size | Smile/Face Detect | Aspect Ratio | Not Set.On the front of the camera, there is a ridged ring called the ""control ring"", depending on what you select it to do, it can be used to quickly change the aperture or shutter levels, zoom or even navigate through different modes.  Personally, I welcomed this new feature and have found it to be very helpful at times.The flash is also really good, it pops out automatically when needed, however you will have to manually push it down when you're not going to use it as it's on a springy device.- - -*Helpful information:When transferring files, if you're using the USB lead provided, make sure when it's connected you turn the camera on, otherwise it wont recognise the camera is connected.Personally I would recommend getting an USB SDHC Card Reader, it's so much faster to navigate through files and delete the ones not needed, you can then copy and paste the desired photos onto your computer within seconds.Pictures are located in the ""DCIM"" folder.Videos can be found by going through folders; ""PRIVATE"" - ""AVCHD"" - ""BDMV"" - ""STREAM"".One other important bit of information I need to share is for those wanting to use the RAW files this camera produces, you will need to download a special piece of software, just google ""Image Data Converter Ver4.1 Download for DSC-RX100"", and it should be one of the first results, you then get a choice to download it for Windows or Mac.- - -So far I've had nothing but good experiences with this camera, the size is decent, it's comfortable to hold and it performs very well.  It produces photos with amazing depths of field without the need of using a background defocus mode, which can be found on previous models.Another important factor is it's user friendly to both beginner and more experienced photographers.For what this camera lacks in zoom, it makes up in picture quality and although it is available with a premium price tag, your not going to find another camera available of such size and cost that delivers such outstanding results, so for that reason I would highly recommend this camera.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CS2DLUSOCXDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00889ST2G#wasThisHelpful","R1CS2DLUSOCXDY","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:50 MinsFor our holiday to America, my sister didn't want to take her beloved expensive DSLR camera with her just in case it were to get damaged during our travels, so I helped her search for a camera that would deliver great picture results, good zoom, had a good amount of settings (simple and some manual control) and of course didn't cost too much.During our search, this camera popped up many times and ended up ticking all the boxes, that combined with the such high positive ratio on reviews, it ended up being a no-brainer, so we chose it.What comes in the box:The one and only... HX200V Camera! | Lens Cap | Power Adapter | USB - Micro USB Cable | Shoulder Strap | Battery | Manuals etc...Extras you will NEED:SanDisk Extreme 16GB SDHC Class 10 (You can buy a different brand/capacity if you want).Optional Extras:Sony LCS-U20 Carry Case for Handycam and Cameras, this is a brilliant case that keeps the HX200V well protected and has a good amount of pockets also.Upon taking the camera out of it's box, we instantly had a good impression just by holding it, it's super light, comfortable and has very nice grip.Before you start playing with the camera, I would highly recommend charging the battery up fully which takes approximately 100 minutes (1hr 40min).This camera has some nice simple settings for those who just want to point and shoot: 'Superior Auto' & 'Intelligent Auto', and if they happen to fail you, you can choose from many different pre-sets in the ""SCN"" mode(Scene Selection'), or choose the 'iSweep Panorama' to get those great panoramic shots easily.For those who aren't familiar with the more advanced photography settings and you want to get a good picture, stick with those mentioned above and leave the 'P'(Program Auto), 'S'(Shutter Speed Priority Shooting), 'A'(Aperture Priority Shooting), 'M'(Manual Exposure Shooting) and 'MR'(Memory recall mode) settings until you have time to play around and have fun with them.My sister had about a week to play around with this camera just before we went on holiday, she seemed to be able to navigate around the menu quite easily after a few tries.As for the experience with the camera, it's been mostly positive, the zoom is just fantastic, we both love the moveable/tilt LCD screen(probably one of the best features a camera could have).Like any camera, we did get a few out of focus photos, but the majority, be it using the full zoom, or even at low light(recommend using the ISO or hand-held twilight mode in low lighting conditions), have been superb.Overall, this is a great quality camera with superior zoom and photo taking capabilities, it's helped my sister take some fantastic shots whilst on holiday, so she's extremely happy.I have also included a video to show off the zoom and video quality (video uploaded was in the 1080p format, however I'm not sure what the quality outcome will be on Amazon).Anyway, from both me and my sister, we highly recommend this camera!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPI7Z63V8JQ2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089KJT64#wasThisHelpful","RPI7Z63V8JQ2L","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 4:49 MinsSennheiser's PC 320 may not be the most stylish headset available compared to others available on the market, however it does have a really nice solid feel to it.The past headsets I've used for the PC connect via a wired USB cable or a wireless USB dongle, this one however splits off into two; a 3.5mm headphone jack(port normally coloured green) and a 3.5mm microphone jack(port normally coloured pink), both these ports are standard for desktops and laptops, however do double check you have them just in case.The audio output from the headphones I found to be of really good quality and it's really easy to adjust the volume by sliding the circle around on the right-hand side. Though I was very impressed with the sound it can't output much bass, so for those who like that extra kick in bass, you are looking at the wrong product.When I first used the microphone, I initially had a problem with the microphone volume, even when putting the microphone volume to it's maximum it was far too quiet, but after fiddling with the microphone cable the volume went to as it should and since then I've had no problems at all, so it's highly possible it may have been my computer having a funny 5 minutes.The clarity of the microphone really blew me away, the voice output was crystal clear and to date has got to be the best headset microphone I've owned.Comfortability wasn't too bad, it fits well on my head and is easily adjustable, I can wear these for about 3 hours before feeling any kind of discomfort which for me is really good, I do have sensitive ears so small amounts of pressure effects me more than most other people so others may have a different experience to what I've had.Overall it's a really good headset with a fantastic microphone attached, it may lack a bit in bass but don't let this put you off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KZ5QEXJLIYJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006RF9HX8#wasThisHelpful","R1KZ5QEXJLIYJZ","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:48 MinsThis product doesn't seem like it was anything special, it has a plain look to it and is a little bit chunky, I don't think many people would be able to fit it in their pocket comfortably, definitely more of a kitchen side thing.Well looks are certainly deceiving when it comes to this product, I placed it over a bottle and gave it a push down and I must say I was extremely surprised, it popped that cap right off the bottle and held it with a magnet which not only meant it keeps the floor tidy, but no more finding them later when you step on them barefooted!Whoever invented this thing is an absolute genius, I couldn't recommend this product enough!**Note: There is also a metal version available Cellardine Zap Cap Stainless Steel Bottle Opener - Cellardine CD0030.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y4DZ0PWEW6OR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GG4YEQ#wasThisHelpful","R2Y4DZ0PWEW6OR","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"- - BRIEF - -The 'Sony HMZ-T1 Personal 3D Viewer' is surely one of the most futuristic gadgets that is currently available on the market, it most definitely has a Star Trek if not Cyclops from X-Men kinda look to it, maybe something that doesn't quite belong in this current space of time, but nevertheless it is and boy was I excitedThe items included in the whole package are:01) Head Mounted Display (HMD).02) Processor Unit.03) AC Power Cord.04) HDMI Cable (3D Compatible).05) Light Blocker (Left & Right piece).06) Headband Strap Clip.07) Connecting Cord Holder.08) Thin, Medium & Thick Forehead Supporters.09) Forehead Supporter Cover.10) Reference & Start-Up Guide.- - SET-UP - -There are two parts into setting this device up; the first part is connecting your HD device to the viewer, that was the easy part and to be honest doesn't take more than a minute, it's the second part where you have to configure it to your head which at first is the more challenging part.Connecting the devices really is as simple as counting ""1, 2, 3""; make sure all devices (the HD device you want to connect & the processing unit) are powered on via the appropriate AC power cords, plug the HDMI lead from the HD devices HDMI ""Out"" into the processing units HDMI ""In"", then plug the HMD's cable into the HMD port located at the front of the processing unit, it really is that simple.  If you're wondering what the ""Out"" part is for on the processing unit, basically you can connect the ""Out"" to a TV's ""IN"" so when the HMD is on standby, the processing unit will send the audio/video signals to the TV instead (when the pass-through option is enabled).To view pictures on both the HMD & TV, this will require an HDMI splitter, however be cautious if trying to view 3D content at the same time of the TV if the TV is not 3D compatible, so if it isn't, I would recommend sticking to 2D content whilst using the splitter, otherwise just connect it directly to the HMD.The next part is the most important and will determine whether you'll get fantastic viewing results, or trashy blurriness. You need to make sure that not only are the lenses in focused with your eyes, but also the HMD having a snug fit on your head and there is barely any pressure on your nose.  The easiest way I went around this is by firstly making sure the HMD is on, this is because you get a ""Welcome"" message which is great to use to make sure your eyes are focused.  Start by unclipping the straps and make sure the sides are extended to as far as they can go, then use your hands to adjust the HMD whilst switching the focus around to get the writing as focused as you can.  Don't forget there are different sized forehead pads, if you feel like you're not getting the best results, don't hesitate to change them around.  Once you believe you have the optimum level, whilst having one hand to support the HMD, use the other to tighten up the straps and push them in further to get a snug fit, once done, adjust the headphones until you are satisfied.  This may take awhile like it did me, or it might take a few minutes, just have patience and eventually you will get it right.  Once done, go through the options on the viewer, when done you will finally be seeing whatever interface is set by your HD device.For those who are using it with a PS3 and did not have it connected to a 3DTV previously, you may want to go through the ""Display"" settings again and re-configure the HDMI settings, this way you will make sure the PS3 has 3D enabled.When viewing content through the HMD, you can also access the HMD options by pressing the ""MENU"" button, this will give an variety of options ranging from:1) Information; Identifies input signals (Video/Audio) from the current device connected.2) 3D Settings; Change from Auto 3D settings, to ""Over-Under"" & ""Side by Side"" 3D settings.3) Display; Change picture mode from vivid to cinema, adjust the brightness, colour temperature. sharpness and more.4) Sound; Change settings from standard, game, cinema or music & adjust the treble and bass.5) General Settings; Set password, enable HDMI pass-through, control for HDMI, power & language options.If you want to adjust the sound volume, this can be done by pressing either buttons located just above the ""MENU"" button.- - EXPERIENCE - -Using this viewer is literally like watching a film or playing a game in a hugely sized cinema screen, but for your own personal use, it's a weird yet awesome sensation that is one to be personally experienced.The very first piece of content I viewed through this device was Tangled 3D and I can assure you my mind was blown into another dimension just by seeing the title screen, never mind the actual film, it was like seeing 3D for the first time all over again... but better!  The 3D had no ghosting at all, the colours were full and vibrant... it was just perfect, absolutely perfect.  I've seen 3D films at cinemas with the polarized glasses, and I've seen 3D films on 3DTV's using active shutter, even on the Nintendo 3DS and I can safely say this 3D viewer would win hands down in any competition these other 3D experiences could dish out.Tron 3D was to follow, but this time I had watched the whole film as the previous one I was skipping through to check out the 3D effects. Tron 3D was really enjoyable, but it soon came to my attention that needed a break now and then was worthwhile, not in the sense of my eyes getting funny, but rather the pressure on my head I was feeling, after all the device weighs 2lb and after time it adds up, for me in this circumstance I was laying down and had a 10 minute break after 1 hour of watching the film.  This obviously for some people may be an annoyance, but for me it didn't bother me too much, this may be due to the fact I had been enjoying myself so much, if it required a break now and then so be it!  I also tried several games in 3D; Super Stardust HD, Mortal Kombat, Batman: Arkham Asylum & Call of Duty: Black Ops.  Stardust & Arkham Asylum were definitely my favourites, it added a whole new depth to the gameplay as well as making them feel like a whole new game, you feel fully immersed and with the top-notch quality the headphones provide, this really is the ultimate gaming experience.So what about 2D games?  Well, I've played Battlefield 3 multiplayer and am more than satisfied with the results, you can see enemies more clearly, hear the surroundings clearer, the explosions sound amazing, and weirdly although being in a 2D game, you get a slightly more depth to the game than you would by playing on a TV.  The best part was flying a jet in the cockpit, whizzing through the skies, if you're a Battlefield fan, you need this device!  Another thing to add was the experience playing Modern Warfare 3, I honest believed it was a 3D game but it actually isn't, it gave me a really good depth of field which made it seem 3D, this is due to the having screens for both eyes. :)- POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS - -Whilst the experience has been fantastic, there were a view issues I would like to point out:1) Headphones: Audio quality is fantastic, but they aren't noise cancelling so people around can hear what you are viewing depending on certain sound volumes, it would be great to see noise cancelling headphones for future models!2) Prolonged comfortability:  For short-medium terms of use, using this HMD is comfy, but for extended use pressure can amount onto your forehead and can be uncomfortable.  When sitting upright, around the 30 minute mark you may want to have a 10-minute break, or if you're lying down, you could possible extend that to an hour+, to be able to watch a full featured film without any breaks would make this product even better!3) Easier to connect light blockers: For most people, the light blockers whilst connected to the viewer make it really hard to put the HMD on, but if you try to connect them whilst you have the HMD on, it's just as hard, this needs to be improved, but I'm fine without them.As for the next idea's, these are merely just something I would like to see in future models:1) In-built Bluetooth headset; so people who play PS3's can talk to their friends whilst playing.2) Head-tracking (if compatible); There was a PS2 HMD version in Japan which had a head-tracking feature which allows the user to have sweeping views of the surroundings.3) Detachable headphones; this will give people an option to use their surround sound instead.  Having an optical out would be useful in this scenario, however the main device (i.e. PS3 or Blu-ray player), should have one anyway.4) Optional wireless connectivity; At the moment, the wire is completely fixed to the viewer, if in future models they can make this rechargeable and wireless, but with the option to still connect it via wire, this will increase the movability for users.They were just a few idea's that I'd personally think would make this product better.- - OVERALL - -What can I say?  Personally, it's been & still is giving me the best personal 2D/3D film/gaming experience I have ever had, it really defines home entertainment to a whole new level and would like to thank Sony for making such device available on the market!  This obviously comes with a high price tag which I hope to see will drop down in the near future and also the fact it's a one person at a time experience, and when you're showing off the device you will not only have to reconfigure it, but you will also have to redo it again when your using it again yourself.Although the sound & image quality this device delivers to me is perfect, sadly the device isn't, it has a few bits that need improving for future models before it becomes perfect but in my eyes it's still the best personal home entertainment device currently available on the market and that's why this still gets top marks from me and I would recommend it to anyone who can get their hands on one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM0N1CHJNFOXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005SCYZGA#wasThisHelpful","RM0N1CHJNFOXF","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"====BRIEF====The SL99 headphones are an extraordinary piece of audio equipment that any person who are passionate about music will fully appreciate.Just looking at the box tells you these headphones mean business, it's very neatly styled however is a nightmare to get into, I had my hands on the corners of the box whilst franticly shaking it up and down, it worked eventually.When you finally get into the box you are presented with a very smart accessory case which inside have the small & large ear-buds.As for the earphones, well lets just say they are probably the most stylish in-ear headphones I have seen to date, visually they shout ""hey look at me!"", and they have every right to do so.The quality is the cable is really nice, instead of the typical circular wires, they seem to have a slight rectangle shape which is probably why they don't get tangle so easily (I'm not sure if this is the actual reason, but the wires very rarely tangle when I shove them into my bag unlike previous headphones, but when they do they untangle with very little effort).============COMPATIBILITY============I've tried this on many different devices that have an audio jack slot, with mixed results:* iPod, iPhone 3G, iPhone 4; I was able to test this on my sisters and friends iPods and iPhones and can say these headphones are FULLY compatible with these devices, you can use the control panel located under the right earphone:The triangles are for volume adjustment or press the circle button once for play/pause, twice for skip forward, or three times to skip back a track.For iPhone users, when you get a phone call, press the circle button to answer it, that's right, the control panel has a very small hole on the back which picks up audio! I must say the audio quality both ways were very good indeed!* Sony Walkman; For audio purposes only, this does the job, but unfortunately you cannot use the control panel.* Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo This is the phone I have, unfortunately I get a message (Unsupported Device), I don't really mind not being able to use the skip functions or the hands-free option, I just want to listen to my music.... So this was a HUGE disappointment for me.Not being able to use it on my phone was a real let-down especially as it has the 3.5mm audio socket this is why I had to knock off a star. Luckily for me though I have a Walkman, which is DOES work on, so I can use these with that.======================COMFORT & SOUND QUALITY======================I wanted to get more than one opinion so I also asked friend on his opinion for these headphones:Personally I found it took awhile to get used to getting them in my ear, I also at first wasn't fond of the feel in the sense of my last earphones were really nice and snug, whereas these had a more lighter feel which although were actually secure, felt like they were going to drop out at any second. Although now after using it for awhile I don't get that sense of feeling any more.As for the sound, I cannot fault it in any way, I've listened to; Passion Pit, Taylor Swift, Fightstar, 30 seconds to Mars and was blown away, no matter what genre of music I listened too, it always took my breath away, it can even produce some nice bass also.My friend is a drummer and I would say is very picky on music quality, he notices music flaws whereas I don't notice. He had no problem putting them in his ears, he actually found them to be very comfortable on first time use, as for his opinion on the sound quality, he stated the quality was extremely good and was very pleased with their performance.=======OVERALL=======I wouldn't recommend these for people who don't own an iPhone due to the lack of compatibility, as to those who have an MP3 player (excluding the iPod) and don't mind not being able to use the control panel, then I would recommend these.As for those who own an iPod, iPhone or iPad and appreciate the up-most audio quality, then I highly recommend these!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11B4MMI3PZY12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Z57X42#wasThisHelpful","R11B4MMI3PZY12","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Before I start this review about the main game, I would like to mention that when you put the disk in you get two disk options on your PS3's XMB:The main LittleBigPlanet 2 game and another named ""Extras""; on the extras you have three things to choose from:*Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves, which is the Move capable game.*ModNation Racers Demo.*PlayStation Network Tutorial video with Sackboy & Steven Fry.---As for the main game itself, if you have a previous LittleBigPlanet save, you will be asked if you would like to import your profile over, if you agree you will have EVERYTHING that you had unlocked transferred over, this obviously includes all your costumes, materials, stickers, objects & your pod etc...If you've played the first game you will know that there is an intro when starting the game, this one also starts out by giving you basic advice like how to customise your Sackboy, too controlling his emotions while of course giving credit to the makers of the game in a very creative way. Once you have gone past all that, the story starts with an epic and I really do mean EPIC movie sequence which shows off what you can do in this game. (Everything the makers of the game have done has all been done with the same tools you use in create mode).At different parts of the story, the characters actually speak to you with a human voice explaining what's happening, this along with the fantastic camera angles, sound & light effects, really do get you stuck into the story line.Story mode in LBP2 is a lot more challenging than the previous LBP game as there are more traps and obstacles to get through; also don't think that as soon as you have the ""switch stickers"" available you can get the prize bubbles straight away, no no no you still have to earn them. Through my in game experience so far I have had it so when I activate a sticker switch it unlocks a race start with grapple hooks that I have to use to get the items which were previously unreachable, to actually chasing some moving prize bubbles before they disappear! Another example is when a sticker switch unlocks the power gloves, which you then use it to throw objects at things to drop down the extra items. Even some mini-games you now unlock items by getting a certain score, so now you have an even bigger excuse to survive a longer time!Now for those who haven't played LBP before, keep note that you can't just 100% complete a level on the first go, you have to do complete three things before you 100% each level:*Level Complete - Complete the level, you do this the first time you play through the level.*Collect all items - This may seem simple, but when you play the level through the first time you wont have the appropriate stickers to unlock the other items, so you will have to come back to the level later on in the game after you get the right sticker. Also note as this is a 1-4 player game, there are areas within the game that require more than just one person to get additional items.*Ace the level - Complete the level without dying. (This can be done on the first go, but it can get rather tricky).Create mode has now been modified to make creating your own levels a lot more easier by simplifying certain tools, and making some new ones available, all of which have a detailed yet simple tutorial to help you out, all of these are categorised perfectly and can be found in the pop-it menu when in create mode.For the really advance creating, there are plenty of well described tutorials out there on the net.If you want a break from the story mode or creating your own level, why not go online, there are over 3 million levels out there to play, which includes all of the old levels along with the constant adding of new ones. With LBP2 people have managed to make pretty much any genre game they want for example some people have made racing, first person shooters and role playing games!A great addition I love about LBP2 is that if your connected to the internet other than the PS3, you can search and browse for other levels you want to play on ""lbp.me"", after signing onto your PSN ID you can add levels you want to play on your own personal ""queue"" play-list which will be available for you to view and jump in to when you next play LBP2 providing you are connected to the internet.Overall this game gets top marks from me, it has a fantastic story mode which is not only fun and challenging, but also gripping, it has so many levels being made everyday, which makes this game endless with constant creativity by people all around the world. 10*/10*!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SD4ZBADKZ4R5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I0K780#wasThisHelpful","R3SD4ZBADKZ4R5","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is by far one of the best animated films I have seen in a long time, the story is very well written that keeps close to the theme of the old classic tale WHILST changing certain aspects of the story, which in my opinion was actually an improvement.Tangled gives you a lot of that old Disney's feeling, while bringing something new, it has beautiful music tracks and just like the old Disney classics, it has songs you could sing along too.Every character has their own unique personality that you will instantly love, be it Flynn with his hilarious flirtatious behaviour, Rapunzel's cute, caring & clumsiness personality, Pascal the chameleon's sweet yet tough attitude or Maximus; the horse who is completely fearless and has a serious vendetta against Flynn which is extremely entertaining.The voices were perfect, if someone asked me if I could change anyone's voice, who would it be... I just couldn't do it.Overall in my opinion this is a master piece, visually the film is stunning and you get a real connection with all the characters, it's just one big emotional roller-coaster. This film will definitely be enjoyed no matter who you are; child, teen, adult, male or female, if you haven't seen it yet, then I would recommend you do so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23ZYJ6EZH79L8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004G600A4#wasThisHelpful","R23ZYJ6EZH79L8","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow... my mind has literally been blown away, something I haven't felt for a long time since first watching some of my now favourite Hayao Miyazaki's films such as Howl's Moving Castle, My Neighbour Totoro, Spirited Away & Laputa, Castle In The Sky + more.The storyline is fantastic and whilst based on technology that is superior to our own at the moment, it's actually something that could happen in the future if social networks keep growing and people give permission for them to access even more personal details, maybe not in the exact same way, however as we live in a totally internet/computer dependent society, the idea isn't as far-fetched as some may think.One thing that you will certainly love about this film is how much emotion it pumps through you; I was laughing, crying and biting my lips in suspense all the way through the film, not once did I feel that the film was dragging on, there was always something there to keep your attention towards the film right from the beginning to the very end.One thing I must point out is that the film is in BOTH English & Japanese audio for your own choosing, Amazon currently states it's Japanese audio only with English subtitles, so for those that are wary of buying this product because they struggle reading subtitles like I do, I can assure you that this is in English audio.If you loved The Girl Who Leapt Through Time which was also directed by Mamoru Hosoda, then just wait until you get your hands on this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KG20FKLPRM7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DMIIOG#wasThisHelpful","R2KG20FKLPRM7E","A23O6Y6BCFE808","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23O6Y6BCFE808?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So we have a couple of standard poodles (the big ones). My wife got an Andis dog clipper like the groomers use so she could groom the dogs herself. Well, that was the only clippers we had so....yeah. She cleaned the blade off with alcohol and strapped me down to the chair. I feel sorry for the dogs. This ""professional"" Andis clipper blade pretty much yanked the hair out of my head. In between my wailing and moaning she'd say, ""Sorry""...bzzzz...yank!True story...and a sad one (stop laughing).Alright! Well, that was it! I told her we are going to get a HUMAN CLIPPER right now and I don't care the cost! Fortunately, this Wahl clipper kit was very reasonably priced for what you get (and far cry less expensive than our $180 dog hair pullers, I mean, clippers). All the good reviews prompted me to select this one and I'm glad I did. It cuts as smooth as a hot knife through soft butter.It comes with 2 hair clips for victims with longer hair, 2 combs, scissors, 13 blades, a maintenance kit (brush/screwdriver and oil), a blade cover, a hard plastic case, and a plastic apron. First off, the plastic apron is nothing more than a kitchen garbage bag in the shape of an apron...seriously. Toss it out! It builds up so much static electricity that it literally attracts the hair to you ON BOTH SIDES and covers you with the clippings. I got a real apron instead. One of the Salon Sundry Professional Hair Salon Nylon Cape with Snap Closure - 50"" x 60""Secondly, the cleaning brush works great for for the blade but the screwdriver end is a bit flimsy for adjusting the blade power (see the instruction manual). I used a real flat head screwdriver for that. Everything else in the kit seems to be high quality.Some of the unique and, perhaps, more helpful accessories are the Left and Right side taper combs (I don't think my wife's ever even looked at those yet--she's still doing it the hard way), the ear guard (you can cut the hair evenly over your ears without getting ""white walls""), and the eyebrow guard. You know...for the older, bushy eyebrow gals--and guys--not that I'm one of those ;-)There are some great videos on doing clipper cuts on YouTube. There's a good one made by a military guy who shows men how to cut their own hair with the clippers (something most of us military guys have had to do more than once). If you're super cheap, like me--or you don't have someone to cut your hair, doing it yourself with this kit is a super easy. The guide combs do it all for you! Comes with instructions.Wife says it's lightweight and easy to hold (the clippers, I mean). Made in the USA--like me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHN63GCBTPB3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026IBSVE#wasThisHelpful","RHN63GCBTPB3A","A17V6IWPTMUXXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V6IWPTMUXXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In my DuPont TY122S Disposable Elastic Wrist, Bootie & Hood White Tyvek Coverall Suit 1414, Size XLarge, Sold by the Each and 3M Full Facepiece Reusable Respirator 6900 (Multiple Sizes) with 3M 2097 P100 Particulate Filter with Organic Vapor Relief, 1 Pair, I was crawling on my belly and knees the whole way. This miserable chore was the type of dark, claustrophobic task usually reserved for firefighters. Well, this particular athletic event took me to the far end of the attic about 40 feet from the opening stairs. MULTIPLE times during my belly trek, the switch got bumped shutting the lamp off. Sometimes, I would rest the lamp on the bottom board of a ceiling joist and it would fall over into the insulation, other times I would hit it with my gloved hand, still other times I'm not even sure what happened but in every case, the switch was bumped and the lamp shut off--leaving me in total darkness, cramped between 2 x 4's lying in a field of insulation. So, I'm taking some stars away for the switch which is all too easily knocked around during real, world use because I see it as a safety issue. You could be left in complete darkness at a time when you're relying on this light and your personal safety or even your life might depend on it. Of course, my situation wasn't that dire. I'm not afraid of the dark or claustrophobic and I'm not one given to panic, but then again, I wasn't in any real danger. The biggest risk was that I might not get my TV antenna connected...well, that and I could have easily stepped in the wrong spot breaking a water pipe or gas pipe. But other than the trivial risk of incinerating myself or blowing the roof off my house, it was considerably inconvenient to have the switch constantly shutting off in the pitch darkness of the attic. Bottom line, the switch is NOT a smart design so buy and use this lantern with caution.---------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:I just received one of these lamps on 2-1-15. The lamp I received does not look like the one in the photo. It is a Rayovac lamp and has ""Rayovac"" printed on it in white lettering but the design is a bit different. Mine doesn't have the plastic ring around the front lens but instead the lamp housing is one solid piece of metal (steel or aluminum--my guess is aluminum) with a black baked on finish. The lens of  mine appears to be acrylic and is secured in place by 4 screws on the front around the face of the lens. The handle posts that rise from the bottom plate up to the grip house the wiring so there is no exposed wiring. On the front and rear of the grip itself are an opening at each end to accommodate a clip for a shoulder strap. The entire grip/lamp housing is metal (again, I assume it's aluminum). The grip can be opened if needed--possibly to repair wiring, etc.) by two dial-type screws on the right side of the handle. Overall, a great design in my opinion.The only part of the design that I don't like is the power switch. It's not a push button on top of the grip. Rather it's a thin, 3-way switch (like a light switch on the wall) which is rubber coated. It's easily actuated by the right thumb (or left index finger if you're a lefty). It's only about 1"" or so down from the handle so it's not hard to reach. It's just less than ergonomic...but just a bit. If you have smaller hands, you might find the thumb switch to be at the end of your reach, but it's still very easy to use. My big gripe with the switch is that it might be a bit too easy to accidentally switch it off with your thumb.The focus of the beam is good for the design and bulb. At less than about 5 feet, there is a darker spot in the center of the beam with a bright ring of light around it; however, past about 5 feet the center of the beam fills in and provides a very bright beam approx. 4 - 6 inches wide. The light is very bright. Noticeably brighter than these lights used to be ""back in the day"" (circa 1960's and '70's). While there may be some newer LED lamps that offer a brighter beam, I haven't seen many anywhere close to this price range.The battery is large but I knew that when I bought this. The battery is actually lighter than the lamp head. Making this lamp a bit front heavy as far as balance goes. One of the best parts about this lamp (and the main reason I bought it) was that you can set the unit down on a flat surface and angle the lamp head almost anywhere you want vertically.It has a ""Lifetime Warranty"" that excludes the bulb (that makes sense), accidents, and misuse. OK, I can understand the warranty that excludes the bulb and ""misuse"" (whatever that may mean) I suppose but to exclude ACCIDENTS? That pretty much makes the warranty a joke. They should simply say it's warranted against defects in materials and workmanship. By excluding both ""accidents"" and ""misuse"", they've pretty much covered every single thing you'll ever need the warranty for because it will be extremely easy and convenient for the company to fit any complaint into one of those 2 categories. Still, it's a great light for what its intended purpose.It's a good bright, heavy duty, ""working man's"" utility flashlight. Made of metal, corrosion resistant, weatherproof switch, lightweight, adjustable angle lens. If you need a bright, long-lasting, durable, portable light. I highly recommend this one. I thought they quit making these years ago. Instead, they just keep improving the design!Some things are so simple and so useful that they don't become obsolete; they become classics.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H3T15A3PT50D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UEAQO6#wasThisHelpful","R2H3T15A3PT50D","A17V6IWPTMUXXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V6IWPTMUXXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to have the Corona 18"" saw-back machete (which I reviewed) and it was a total turd. I tossed it in the trash can and bought this one instead. This professional machete was only $2 more expensive than the Chinese-made Corona machete that I threw away. If I'd have known then...Many of the earlier reviewers complained of the machete arriving dull. Mine didn't. Mine arrived razor sharp, seriously. As in, I sliced a sheet of paper in half with a single, gentle stroke...right out of the box. The seller for the one I received was Ontario Knife Co. and it came from the Amazon Fulfillment Center. I don't know if other sellers in other parts of the country are shipping ""unfinished"" tools or not--but as I said, mine arrived razor sharp.There have been lots of complaints about the handle being uncomfortable or slipping--or feeling like it will slip--out of the hand during use. I think I understand the problem with the handle: It's not because the handle scales are plastic; it's because they are too small for many of us.I wear Medium surgical gloves and Size 7 military dress gloves. That basically means I have medium/average sized hands for the average American male. The handle on this machete is too small for me. Yes, it's a bit squarish and boxy as some reviewers have pointed out; however, that doesn't mean the grip is large. It just means it's not an ergonomic shape. What I found is the grip doesn't fill my hand at the heel of my palm and my hand wraps around the handle (at the hilt) to the point that my thumb is all the way over the first knuckle of my index finger. It makes sense if you think about what the military needs to consider. These machetes need to be usable for soldiers with smaller hands who won't have a means of making the handle smaller in the field. Soldiers with medium to large hands can always wrap some 550 cord (parachute cord) around the handle while in the field to make it thicker if need be.Some reviewers have also mentioned that the scale rivets come loose after awhile and the handle falls apart. At the point when that happens to mine, I will make some comfortable, ergonomic wooden scales that fit my hand well and attach them with screws.As you can see in the photo, this is a ""Latin style"" machete. The tip is slightly wider than the edge closer to the bolster (like a Parang style) which puts the weight of this machete near the tip. This aids in giving you more power in your strike. Yet, this machete doesn't feel heavy and I can (and you probably can too) easily use this for hours without much fatigue. Overall, this is an amazing design and this particular machete is an amazingly efficient and TOUGH workhorse! Once you figure out how to make the handle more comfortable for you, you won't be disappointed by this machete. Made in the USA from 1095 high carbon steel. If you didn't already know, 1095 is an incredibly strong blend of steel and nearly indestructible even with hard use.Don't waste your money on a more expensive machete which will likely be of lower quality than this anyway...get this one. You won't regret it. This has been issued to the US military since the 1940's and has been used on the battlefields of numerous engagements. This machete is a professional soldier's machete; the real deal.UPDATE EDIT: With all the reviews written about this tool, I know my little review won't push anyone over the edge one way or the other as far as buying this or not, but I wanted to add some additional detail about the handle on this thing in case I can help someone else. Since the handle is a bit squarish, I found that I was getting a sore spot that wanted to become a blister on my thumb. Fortunately, the last few inches at the bolster is not sharpened on this blade. I was able to choke up on the blade a little by allowing my index finger and thumb to hold the blade while the rest of my hand was on the grip. That seemed to help. I also wrapped the handle in sports tape. I rolled up 3 small lumps that I then taped to the handle. One lump was put on the back of the handle where the heel of my hand rests. The other 2 lumps were laid across the handle on the front so that one sits between my pinky and ring finger and the other sits between my index and middle finger (if I were holding the handle and not grabbing the blade as mentioned earlier. I wrapped the handle in sports tape with these 3 bumps under the tape. That seems to have helped a lot with holding the tool; however, like I said the handle is kind of square shaped under your thumb and tends to irritate it so I had to choke up on the blade. The cutting power of this machete is insane! While that ""Lowes Special"" (the Corona machete) was bouncing off twigs and vines, this machete was slicing right through 1"" thick dense wood Azalea branches in 1 stroke (2 strokes if the branches gave way when hit). I'm so glad I bought this! Goofy handle or not, the blade on this thing is all business and no B.S.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REFAM1OLA8Q1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001WBIEY#wasThisHelpful","REFAM1OLA8Q1W","A17V6IWPTMUXXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V6IWPTMUXXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As other reviewers have stated, the axe blade is quite thin. So while it can make deep cuts, IF you cut with the grain of the wood (as one does when splitting) the blade tends to bind in the wood and you have to rock it back and forth to loose the blade from the wood. I did not sharpen my axe before testing it on a water oak stump, it was very sharp when I got it brand new. I've used quite a few axes, splitting mauls, hatchets, and sledge hammers in my time so I know how to swing one of these striking tools. This axe is very easy to swing and I did not find the handle to transmit too much shock to my hands. In fact, I didn't notice any more shock from this steel tool than I have from many of the hickory handled tools I've used. The weight of this tool is forward (in the head) which aids in giving you a good, strong strike. This is a ""forest axe"" blade design. Overall, the tool is light and is a very fast axe!DISCLAIMER: The following information may be disturbing to some shoppers; reader discretion is advised (you've been warned!).----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Given the thin profile of the axe head, the tool's reasonably light weight, and the ability to maintain a solid grip on it do to good length and shape--along with the grip material on the handle, this tool might be suitable for those who raise their own food or process meat. The weight, shape, and grip enable a very accurate blow to be struck with this. So far, I have been able to hit exactly the spot I was aiming to hit with this axe. The thin blade profile enables to tool to make deep, clean cuts with a single blow. On larger animals where you must contend with larger bones and joints, this axe would be perfect for quickly quartering game or making the appropriate separation at a troublesome joint. Being also that it's nearly one entire piece (except for the grip material) it would be much easier to clean this than many other axes and hatches that I've used in the past. For birds or smaller animals (e.g. chickens, rabbits, etc.), it could go without saying that this would quickly and cleanly remove the head bringing a quick, humane end. If you're someone who needs an axe for this purpose than I have no doubt my assessment was not in the least bit offensive to you. I trust we're all trying to act like adults here?---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall, I'm fairly please with this axe and in spite of the thin blade profile that can cause binding in the wood when trying to split, I think this makes an excellent camp axe. As mentioned, this is far too thin to do any serious splitting of logs but for light to medium duty or campsite duty this will certainly split small enough logs to get a good fire going. I had the Estwing E24A hatchet which is also another high quality chopping tool; however, more often than not I've had a hard time repeating accurate strikes with a hatchet. The length and shape of this axe makes accurate strikes much easier. So because of that and the fact that you can strike harder with two hands using this axe, I prefer this tool as a camp axe over a hatchet. The best thing this axe has going for it is the size and weight.UPDATE EDIT: After buying this axe, I thought would have preferred the 16"" better since it doesn't feel as ""top heavy"". Well, I did a lot of work today clearly tree roots and several large azalea bushes from my property and I put this axe to good use. I really like having the option of choking high up on the handle if I wanted a hatchet, half way up if I wanted the 16"" axe, and being able to use the grip and get the leverage of the full 26"" axe when I needed it. I have found this axe provides great versatility, is easy to wield, and is very sharp. Growing up in rural Alaska made me much more skilled with an axe than I ever have been with a machete. I even used this axe to do most of the work clearing a thicket of azalea bushes--a job most would assign to a machete. I'm definitely pleased with this axe and recommend this one over the E24 hatchet or the E44 16"" camp axe. This axe is all 3 in one! This ax's performance for you is mostly limited by your own skill level with an axe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCSPZ7LSZGSJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DT0PEOA#wasThisHelpful","RCSPZ7LSZGSJF","A17V6IWPTMUXXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V6IWPTMUXXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to own an Estwing E24A hatchet. That's a very nice tool! So nice in fact that someone asked to ""borrow"" it and stole it from me. When it came time for me to need another hatchet, the store no longer carried the Estwing but had theses Coleman in stock so grabbed one of these. It was before the days of Amazon and online shopping. Unfortunately, I still have this hatchet. Where's a thief when you need one?When brand new this hatchet is dull. Unless you have an arm like Thor and the endurance of Michael Phelps, you'll need to sharpen it before first use. Oh, and bring your file on the camping trip too because you'll need to re-sharpen this thing constantly! The steel used is not a good choice for an axe head; it's too soft.Also, there is something about the shaft design and/or material that isn't right. I've used this to split small logs and to hack small limbs from trees and logs and no matter the angle I'm working at or how thick the material I'm chopping, the axe seems to bounce off the wood! There's a springiness to this tool that is not good. Not all of the energy of your strike is transmitted to the wood. As if that weren't enough, there is something wrong with the balance of this tool also. I am an experienced axe handler and grew up in rural Alaska where I spent every weekend through my school years chopping, splitting, and processing firewood...and I'm not an inexperienced camper either. In other words, I've used many axes, hatchets, mauls, and sledge hammers over the years. I know my way around chopping and striking tools. That said, I can't seem to hit the exact spot I'm aiming for with this axe twice in a row. It seems to twist in your hand as you strike. Once you hit the wood, the axe head bounces off at different angles. Very odd. Perhaps the problem is the shape or material of the grip. In any case, it behaves in an unpredictable, uncontrollable way which makes this hatchet terribly inefficient.Overall, this is a very poorly designed hatchet made from cheap materials that are inappropriate for a striking tool. The shaft is too springy, the head is much too soft, and the grip and balance are ""off"". If you have the chance, I strongly recommend avoiding this one and getting a quality hatchet from a reputable maker such as Estwing or Husqvarna. In fact, as a general rule of thumb, avoid any Chinese made axes (poor steel) and choose one that's either made in USA or Sweden.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LWLBEKTZI429/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00168XMDM#wasThisHelpful","R3LWLBEKTZI429","A17V6IWPTMUXXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V6IWPTMUXXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this at Lowes for approx. $16 - $18. I needed a machete on short notice to thin out some thick growth on the back of my property. The quickest solution was to buy this one that was in stock at my local store; otherwise, I would have shopped around more.First, lets talk about the saw and get that out of the way. The saw is pretty useless from what I've seen. The teeth are NOT sharpened, they are broad, not angled or offset, and have wide gaps between them. I really haven't found and can't think of any plant matter that this saw would be appropriate for. The only thing this saw is sharp enough to do it injure your hands. I think this saw is more of a gimmick than anything. If you'll need a saw for your work, go buy an actual saw and forget about using the back of this blade.Now, the machete blade--which is what you would buy this for anyway. Well...bluntly? It's not a good machete. The blade is made of a soft steel that doesn't hold an edge worth a your effort. I literally have to sharpen this blade after EACH use...as in...hack a few plants, sharpen the blade, hack another few plants, sharpen the blade, etc. I take good care of my tools and I always sharpen and oil the blades of my chopping tools after a day's work anyway but this machete really couldn't give you 2 solid days of work WITHOUT being sharpened after each day's work. I don't mean a touch up. I mean lock in in a vice, grab a file, and put an edge back on it--EVERYDAY!Another problem I've found with this tool is that the blade is very thin (2 mm) and flexes and bends as you strike with it. So, without getting overly scientific about it...some of the energy of your strike is dissipated as the blade flexes and warps. The result is that you can put in a solid swing and only end up cutting partway through a branch or vine. I've literally had to use 2 or 3 strikes to cut through a vine only 3/4"" diameter! You can do better than that swinging a Swiss army knife (seriously...I've done it)! The last time I used this, I was trying to cut a green (not dry) vine MAYBE 1/2"" thick, I hacked away at that thing about 8 times (I'm not exaggerating) and never did any more than make some nicks in it. I ended up running back to the garage to get some pruning shears to do the job! Have you ever tried to clear a thicket with pruning shears?! You'd spend all day at it, make little progress, exhaust your self, and end up with forearms like Popeye. Yes...There's a reason man invented the machete!As far as I can tell the problems with this machete are: 1) the blade dulls quickly, and 2) the blade flexes too much which weakens the impact of your strike. So for a tool that's supposed to be made to hack through brush and vines, it ends up taking a fair amount of energy and time for very little progress.The weight is acceptable; it's not too heavy. The length is great! The handle is decent enough that I've used this with bare hands without any discomfort. Everything is decent with this machete except for the BLADE...which is the part that really matters!I finally just tossed this thing in the can and let the garbageman take it. I recommend you pass on this one, do some research and shop around, and buy a proper machete (there are several blade designs on the market--this blade design is know as a ""Latin"" style machete). Honestly, for the price of this machete, it's more trouble than it's worth!As I mentioned earlier, it generally goes for about $16 to $18 at Lowes (the Fiskars brand sold at Home Depot is no better; I checked those out too). For another $5 (or less) you can get a REAL machete like the Ontario 6145 Military Machete (Black)---------------------------------Let me give you a couple of helpful tips when shopping for a machete: Take it from someone who has used a machete in the real world and learned the hard way. You DO NOT want a machete with a flexible blade! Some people misleadingly tout that as a desirable trait--it's NOT. A machete is really just a long knife. If you want to fillet a fish, you need a flexible blade; for cutting grasses, vines, and brush you need a sharp, stiff blade with some weight and length to it.To cut thick, hard, inflexible material (i.e. wood) you need a sharp, HEAVY tool. That's why the axe is the preferred tool to use for chopping wood. If you're a teenager or some clown preparing for the fictitious zombie apocalypse, you'll make YouTube videos of yourself chopping down trees with your machete (when you should be using an axe or a saw).To cut thin, flexible material (i.e. grasses, vines, brush, etc.) you need a very sharp, LIGHT, long tool. Ever try to cut grass or vines with an axe? Essentially, you need a long knife. A machete is basically just a long knife. Get one that has enough weight to put some energy behind your swing but light enough to be able to be used one-handed without fatigue--and get one that is stiff and NOT flexible. The better ones on the market seem to have blades that are 3mm - 4mm or approx. 1/8"" thick. Get one that holds a VERY sharp edge. Honestly, it's a trade off with steel. If the blade sharpens easily, it also loses its edge easily (if the metal is soft enough to be easily shaped, then it's soft enough to be easily misshaped...get it?) If a blade is harder to sharpen, it also takes longer to lose it's edge (if the metal resists shaping, it resists misshaping). The 1095 high carbon steel of the Ontario 6145 Military Machete (Black) I recommended is more difficult to sharpen; it will take some time and effort. The benefit is that it will hold it's edge much longer than a softer steel so you will have to resharpen it less frequently. So get a machete with a hard blade, take the time to make it very sharp before you head out--then you'll be able to work without having to stop and resharpen all the time....and, yes, the Ontario 6145 Military Machete (Black) is strong enough to chop down a tree or behead a zombie.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EMJ5OFLTL2N4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MP36GJO#wasThisHelpful","R3EMJ5OFLTL2N4","A17V6IWPTMUXXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V6IWPTMUXXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had a ""real"" ceramic neti pot for several years. I moved and lost a box full of stuff in the process and in it was my ceramic neti. Given my severe seasonal allergies, I was forced to find another neti pot so I ran to Walmart pharmacy and found this cheap one. I recommend this to use only in an ""emergency"". I don't mean an actual emergency like anaphylaxis. I mean the type of drama-queen ""emergency"" were you're too sick to go to work and you're having a bad day and nothing else provides relief. Using this for about a week or two should be fine, but beyond that, you're begging for a fungal infection. The pot is very light, thin, brittle plastic. I haven't tried to put it in the dishwasher and I don't think it would survive. I think it might melt or warp even on the top rack. You can't really sterilize it because it would melt. If you really need a neti pot, get one of the ceramic pots available on Amazon. You can run those through the dishwasher, submerge them in boiling water, whatever.Also, this kit comes with some gimmick premix packets. The instructions say you should not use ""homemade recipies"". The reality is that they want you to drop more money into their coffers. I was using a ceramic neti pot with nothing more than good ol' Mortons table salt for YEARS and had great relief and never one problem. I never had a brain infection or any of that other spooky stuff they talk about. Their proprietary formula is salt and baking soda. The purpose of the salt is to keep the water from ""burning"" your sinuses. If you just used water, it could be a bit uncomfortable. If you use the salt water (you're basically making a saline rinse), you clean your sinuses and suffer no discomfort. Baking soda could, in theory anyway, raise the pH of your sinuses temporarily enough to make it  inhospitable for some species of bacteria (as most infectious bacteria prefer a more acidic environment). Of course, even the ancient Romans used salt to cure infections since, as well all now know, salt kills bacteria. So do you need the baking soda? I doubt it; but it doesn't seem to hurt. The bottom line is that you can get a higher quality ceramic pot and use salt--and baking soda if you want--and make your own neti mix.I think overall, this is a waste of money if you have the time to get a ceramic neti pot before your allergies kick you into a drama-queen emergency.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24LT3HGN5W6OD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ITHH86#wasThisHelpful","R24LT3HGN5W6OD","A17V6IWPTMUXXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V6IWPTMUXXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the SodaStream Diet Cola (blue label). Well...Tastes like a very low-budget house brand of a big box store or that really gawd awful soda that Amway sells.

"This game is just plain FUN! It's fun if you're the kind of person who can enjoy a game with a simple story line and can enjoy a game because of the uniqueness of it. If you find cartoonish graphics charming, you'll like it. If you're a gamer who has to have the HD videok style graphics in your 1st Person shooter or RPG, then this game isn't for you. This is more of a game for people who can enjoy a more simple, ""innocent"" gaming experience like you had with Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, and those types of games. This isn't a graphically realistic game, there is no blood or gore, and no one really dies. When you conduct naval warfare on a ship and use your grapeshot to destroy the personnel on the ship, you really just blow the little sailors overboard. In fact, you can see some of them floating in the water and it's possible to sail over to them, rescue them, and add them to your crew where they immediately start manning your cannons. When you best a soldier or pirate with the sword, they are either knocked out cold by something or they surrender...or you knock them overboard into the sea. Definitely a ""kid friendly"" game, in my opinion.The story is that your father owed a large debt to a powerful noble. Your father's means of repaying the debt sank to the bottom of the ocean. In exchange for repayment, the noble (who, himself is a pirate) took your entire family into slavery. You ended up as a slave on a ship's crew being overworked and mistreated. One day you and a select group of men on the ship decided to mutiny against your tyrannical captain. Of course, the captain isn't killed...you simply maroon him somewhere. After that, YOU are captain of the ship! You start your adventure as a young, 18 year old, pirate captain with a merry band of 40 sailors aboard a small vessel with a few cannons and some food.The object of the game is that before you grow too old to continue the pirate life, you must rescue your entire family, avenge them against the tyrannical pirate who took them into slavery, marry the most beautiful woman that you can (and this is not easy...there are a few ""rather plain"" girls who are available too), vanquish all the other pirates, amass as much gold and land as you possibly can, find all the buried treasures hidden in the Caribbean...all the while you must keep looting to keep your crew happy. Every so often, you'll need to divide the plunder with the men to prevent a mutiny. Every time you divide the plunder, you stay in whatever town you docked in for 6 months to a year...remember, you have to do all these things before you get too old! Sailing from one place to another takes time! Remember, you are on an old pirate ship in the 1600's so you're at the mercy of the wind and travel can take MONTHS! There are items that you can buy or that can be gifted to you by various governor's daughters--if you won their hearts over--that can make the voyages much easier. Several items, for example, boost the morale of your crew so they are more patient with you and less likely to mutiny. There are also maritime specialist that you can capture from other pirates which help you too. For example, a Cook will boost the crews morale; a Carpenter will repair your vessel at sea making it more resistant to enemy cannon fire; a Quartermaster will enforce discipline at sea and prevent the crew from mutiny for awhile; a Gunner will train your seamen on the cannons and increase your ship's rate of fire..and there are others.It is possible to be captured by the navy or by other pirates and end up being sent to prison where--as you'd imagine--YEARS of your life are drained away! With so much to do in so little time, the game can be a bit fast paced. It draws you in and can be a bit addicting too!While graphically, it's not on the level of some of the newer games like Halo or Ghost Recon, it's also not nearly as ""serious"" as those games. This is a charming, cartoonish, FUN game which keeps you thinking and keeps you coming back! It's one of my favorites!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R5V6N4H11YBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AOIES6#wasThisHelpful","R3R5V6N4H11YBX","A17V6IWPTMUXXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V6IWPTMUXXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars is that it really only has 4 little button type magnets in it and it could fit more magnets. there are 2 sections (or pads if you will) that have 2 button type magnets each. There is another pad section that could house another set of magnets. Also, I would think a bar magnet rather than button magnets could provide more area to hold items and/or hold them more securely.All that said, those 4 stars are shining brightly! This bracelet is awesome! I've used this multiple times and I can't you how handy this thing is. I've used it to hold screws while I've been up on a ladder so I don't have to climb up and down to get screws. I've used it to hold various tools (allen wrenches, screw drivers, and stuff like that) and it works great. I even used it to hold 8 stainless steel 1/4"" ball bearings that I was using as slingshot ammo to hunt the squirrels trying to get in my attic.The only real concern with this bracelet is that because of the size and number of magnets in it, it won't hold anything really heavy. It can hold a small screw driver but nothing too long or heavy. Still, I HIGHLY recommend this tool. It's not meant to fix all your problems but it's one more piece to make things a little bit easier and it succeeds. Get it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z5DK7ZM1UBJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WU9LCQ#wasThisHelpful","R1Z5DK7ZM1UBJQ","A17V6IWPTMUXXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V6IWPTMUXXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has a keyless chuck. Sometimes that's good. Not here. If you use this as a screwdriver, any strong torque you put on this will loosen the chuck making your bit at least not turn the screw and at worst--fall out. Also, the long handle opposite the chuck end, has a tendency to come loose. It's simply screwed into the tool so if the tool rotates as you turn the crank, the handle will unscrew. Honestly, this is simply ridiculous! This is a reasonably expensive drill boasting that legendary German engineering...and it's pretty much a joke to use as a screw driver. Granted, it was not marketed as a drill/driver and it doesn't serve well as a screw driver.So use it as a drill only. I just used this drill tonight to drill 9 pilot holes for screws of varying sizes (so I used a couple of different drill bits). As a drill, this tool worked very well. It was easy to align and easy to hold. Using a ""egg beater"" style drill like this takes a bit of practice to get the hang of it. Because you are applying torque to only one side of the drill, it's easy to wiggle the drill as you use it causing your hole not to be straight. Once you have that skill down, this drill works just fine for drilling into anything that is relatively soft. Drilling into metal, concrete/brick, or very hard dense wood may be quite challenging because it can get extremely hard to turn the crank. Even so, this drill works just fine AS A DRILL. Again, don't even bother considering this for a screw driver! To put it plainly, it sucks as a screw driver Also, it should go without saying that this is a manual tool so you need fairly strong hands to use it. If you don't have strong hands or you have an injury to your hand or wrist, it'll be hard to use this.Would I buy this drill again? Not sure; maybe not. For the money, you can find some really great, reputable vintage/antique manual drills on eBay. At the time of this writing, this drill is selling for over $50. That's WAY over priced for what you get! I guess you're paying for that ""German Engineering"".Also, because of the weaknesses that this has when used as a screw driver and the hand/wrist strength needed to use this, it could be frustrating for a kid to use.UPDATE: Well, I'm not quite sure what I was doing wrong before when using this as a screw driver, but last night, I put a Phillips head bit in it and let my wife use it to a re-upholstery project she was doing. The Schroeder zipped those screws out of the bench seat very quickly and the chuck never loosened once! Perhaps I hadn't used it enough to ""wear the new off it"" before I formed my opinion about it as a screw driver. It worked well last night as a screw driver both to remove and to insert screws into a bench. I have also used it for several drilling jobs around the house and it works perfectly as a drill. It's light weight, tight (no wobble or looseness, and steady. I've raised my opinion to 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LAGMGXB2ELJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013YZRPU#wasThisHelpful","R3LAGMGXB2ELJA","A17V6IWPTMUXXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V6IWPTMUXXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, so the song actually says, ""R-O-C-K in the USA"" but the sentiment is the same. This is a hat that John Mellencamp and Bruce Springstein would be proud to wear.When I first got it, I thought the crown was a little too deep. I'm medium build and wore a 7-1/4"" hat in the Army. I put this on and if I wore it military style, the crown was so high it looked like a trucker hat. If I put the crown on my head, the hat came down to the back of my ears.Well, my wife says it looks great on me! That's saying something because more often than not, she would rather tell me to ""fix my hair""--which means slather some goo in my hair and style it somehow. I'm not bald by any stretch; I have plenty of thick, dark brown hair--but I'm a guy and we like to wear hats because we've got other things to do beside primp our hair. Well, since I got this hat, my wife actually reaches for this one out of the closet and says, ""Do you want to wear your hat?""It's patriotic, it's appropriate for an Army veteran like myself, it's modern and stylish, and my wife digs it...so what's not to like.Get it and rock your patriotism!There should be a new mandate: If you're a member of the Tea Party or the Republican Party, you are REQUIRED to wear this hat in public!Of course, if you live in California or are a member of the Demoncat (sorry...Democrat) Party you can continue to wear your Che Guevara hats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R1OKKODTDEB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004NJ53N8#wasThisHelpful","R1R1OKKODTDEB5","A17V6IWPTMUXXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V6IWPTMUXXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got one of these to help me look in tight spaces that I might not be able to put my head up to. Well, the design of this thing puts the actual opening and mirror nearly in the middle of the tube. The length of that tube from the end to the hole is longer than the side of my head from my ear to my eye...So...I can press the side of my head up to something and be able to see it while in that same space, this tool won't even be able to fit into the space! For example, I was trying to set up my entertainment center and I was threading cables through the frame of my TV stand (it's designed for that--to hide the cables). I tried to use this tool and when I put the tool into the cavity of the TV stand, the end of the tube met the back of the TV stand frame while the opening for the periscope tube was still OUTSIDE the TV stand--so all I was looking at was the carpet! With the periscope, I was looking at the outside of the TV stand--NOT the inside--because the periscope is too long (between the end of the it and the mirror opening). I have tried to use this periscope on 2 other occasions for similar types of tasks (e.g. looking behind my refrigerator) and in each case, the end of the periscope is too long and the mirror opening is too far from the end to be able to see in the space.If they shorten the distance between the switch and the LED light, they could move the mirror to the end of the tube and allow it to require no more than about 1 inch of clearance, As it is, you need about 3 inches or so of clearance to get the periscope far enough inside anything to be able to see through it. They need to redesign this with the opening and mirror near one END of the tube. Putting the mirror in the middle of the tube means you can only use it to look into spaces that are deep enough for your head. So what's the point? If my head fits, why use a periscope?EDIT: Perhaps the B.E.S. Wall Scope, Lighted Periscope would be a more effective tool. It's less expensive than this tool too (at the time of this edit). I have not had the opportunity to try the BES scope yet. If anyone does, please review it or add a comment here about its performance.

"Is this set ""awesome!""? Well, no, but it's worth every penny and will get a lot of work done for you. These are steel bits but they aren't the highest quality on the market, of course. There are bits on the market that can cost $30 to $50 each or more! This set isn't that professional quality. It is good enough for most work at a light or medium duty level (such as around the house or ranch). I've read some reviews complaining that you get 15 of the #2 Phillips bits and no torx bits. True, there are no torx bits in this set; however, if one looks closely you'll see that while the SIZE of those 15 bits is #2 Phillips, the taper and depth of each bit differs. So don't read those reviews that think this is a rip off because you'll be getting redundant items in the kit. They are all different bits. Something really nice about this kit is the box itself. The outside if each side has a storage compartment. So if you want to add torx bits to the set, you can go buy a set of torx bits and toss them in one of the side compartments.From time to time, one of these bits may break (they aren't industrial strength) and that may be due to metal fatigue or microscopic cracks in the piece. Generally, though, drilling without breaking bits requires you to put some thought into 3 areas: bit type, speed, and pressure. Woodworking bits are not going to stand up to drilling in metal or concrete/brick, for example, so use the right bit. Sometimes squeezing that trigger and getting your drill up to top speed when you're trying to drill into something hard will break a bit; you may need to slow it down. Sometimes pressing the drill too hard when drilling into something hard will break a bit; lighten up some on it and let the bit do the drilling for you.One of the best parts of this kit is probably the Craftsman guarantee. Craftsman tools are guaranteed for life. I have a friend who is a welder and mechanic and one day while we working on a vehicle, he broke a socket that he was using to loosen a bolt. We drove down to Sears and went to the hardware dept. He told the guy behind the counter, ""My socket broke, I need a new one."" They guy asked ""How did it break?"" My buddy, being the kind of guy he is said, ""What difference does it make? It's a Craftsman and they have a lifetime guarantee."" The manager happened to be standing at the next register and overheard it. He leaned over and told the clerk, ""On Craftsman tools, it's a straight across trade. If it breaks, we replace it. Just give him a new one."" So he got a new socket and we walked out. You can't beat that!Take a look at your local Sears store before buying this set. At the time of this writing, my Sears store has these kits on sale for $15. You may not find it for that price but it's worth checking. Even on Amazon, this is probably the most bang for the buck you'll find for drill/driver bits.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21WQ7LS39PTX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00692T2ZW#wasThisHelpful","R21WQ7LS39PTX5","A17V6IWPTMUXXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V6IWPTMUXXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grew up in Alaska; lived there 31 years. I finally relocated to a more affordable, warmer place (Texas). After investing 31 years of my life in the Arctic, I wanted to have SOMETHING to show for it--publicly. So I grabbed one of these window decals and stuck it on the rear window of my SUV (yes, of course I drive an SUV--I'm an Alaskan!). A very pleasant surprise for me was the unexpected side effect of finally being able to find my vehicle in a large parking lot! A big white label with ""AK"" in bold black letters is pretty easy to spot even from a couple of isles away. And, of course, NO ONE ELSE around has one!It looks good and is well made.

"I enjoy the original Storage Wars (California) and loved hating Dave Hester because he is one of those jackasses who focuses on driving up the bid simply to hurt other buyers--on units that he doesn't even want! Just a bad person. But, hey, every show has to have a character we love to hate. Storage Wars - Texas is essentially identical to the original Storage Wars with a similar pallet of characters. Where the California edition has its ""evil"" Dave, the Texas edition tries to provide us with its love-to-hate New Yorker named, Victor ""The Outsider"". Unfortunately, Victor is not as successful at bidding other buyers up nor winning coveted lockers as Dave was; so Victor isn't as easy to hate. He's too often the underdog. A character who we aren't supposed to ""hate"" because he's supposed to represent a genuine Texan is Ricky Smith. I found Ricky to be the guy I love to hate more than any other because of the fact that Ricky spits out lots of Southern cliches and silly phrases, appears to be the 2nd least intelligent character on the show (the most ignorant being Lesa Lewis), and just fits all the stereotypes of an uneducated, trailer trash, redneck. By contrast, his nephew who goes by the nickname ""Bubba"" seems to be one of the most intelligent buyers on the show. The name ""Bubba"" would fit Ricky much better, really, since Ricky's head seems to be little more than a hat rack to hold his ridiculous cowboy hat. Another parallel is where California has it's eccentric, Barry Weiss, the Texas edition has a quirky doctor named, Moe Prigoff.Overall, the buyers on the Texas edition don't seem as keen, sharp, and intelligent as the buyers in the original Storage Wars (California). Even so, if you like auctions, buying & selling, collecting, or watching people fight a bidding war, you'll like this show. If you live in Texas (like I do), you'll probably get nauseous at the stereotypes and cliches (thanks, Ricky, you moron), but if you're not from Texas, you may find all that stereotypical, touristy stuff charming. In any case, it's a fun show to watch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FINMT9ZCCDNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007HYMHEE#wasThisHelpful","R3FINMT9ZCCDNK","A17V6IWPTMUXXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V6IWPTMUXXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoy the variety of tasks and skills that Nicole teaches in this show. She does an excellent job of not only teaching about real estate but also hands-on, how-to construction skills necessary to do the remodeling that she undertakes. Yes, she hires professional contractors to do the bulk of the time-consuming projects but she clearly knows her way around a tool belt and can actually DO much of the construction work herself. So she will tell viewers HOW to do specific tasks, demonstrate how to do it, and explain WHY you do it the way she does it. She'll show you how to do it before she turns the rest of the project over to the contractors. VERY educational! From sheet rock, to framing, to painting, to electrical and plumbing fixtures she covers all the disciplines and specifically hones in on the tasks that can be DYI. In regard to things such as plumbing and electrical wiring, she explains what is needed and why but she always defers to licensed professionals for inspections and repairs. It's good that she shows DYI viewers this because not only can it be VERY unsafe to attempt electrical or plumbing repairs yourself, but in most jurisdictions it's illegal. Most jurisdictions require electrical and plumbing modifications to be performed by a licensed professional in accordance with building and fire codes. Yes, that can be very expensive but it's the best (and legal) way to tackle plumbing and electrical mods; however, Nicole shows how DYI'ers can save money in other areas by recycling some fixtures and doing most of the cosmetic work yourself. Nicole knows her way around a job site and can talk shop with experts in any construction discipline and it shows. I'm very impressed with this show and have learned a great deal about home improvement from it. You'll learn what to expect and what to look for. That will help you avoid getting ripped off by stores and contractors too. Highly recommended for those who want to tackle some home improvement with their own 2 hands and don't want to look like a complete idiot while doing it!On the side, this show tries to display how she juggles being a single mom while doing all of this but it comes off as being a bit ""put on"". Lots of talk ABOUT being a ""family first"" mom, but not much shown. It only takes a modicum of insight to realize that she spends the vast majority of her time working on these projects and doesn't put as much into motherhood. Of course, that's fine for the show because no one cares to watch a mother trying to raise her kid (well, maybe other women might watch a show about that). Fortunately, if you watch this show to learn about renovating a house, that's what you'll see. You may hear some talk about being a mommy but you don't see much of it. Just wanted to put that info out there in case some men were turned off by the prospect of watching yet another reality show about some woman struggling with her kids...this show ISN'T that. She doesn't have 19 kids, she doesn't train dogs, and she's not a super nanny.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R167HWMEJHM9K5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLEAGH0#wasThisHelpful","R167HWMEJHM9K5","A17V6IWPTMUXXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V6IWPTMUXXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just got this Combat Medic decal for my Jeep window. It's gray/silver (not shiny chrome foil, though) lettering with black boarder. The sticker itself is transparent so that when the decal is affixed to your window, it actually looks like it's painted on the glass....or it should except the seller packaged it improperly. I got my decal from Creative Borders in Orlando, FL. When I first received the package in the mail, I wasn't sure what I'd received because inside the plastic shipping envelope was a small cardboard box. It actually looked like I'd received jewelry (like a ring). The box was small enough to have easily fit a ring box inside. Well, what Creative Borders had done was COILED the decal around and stuffed it in this small cardboard box! So when I took the decal out, it wasn't nice and flat...it was rolled like a poster. Of course that stretches the decal and causes it to pull off the backing in a couple of spots when it is allowed to uncoil and lie flat. The decal then had 2 bubbles in it from where it was pulling away from the backing. The worst part of that is that if you have to wait (say a few days) before you can put the decal on your window, dust will collect where the sticker has bubbled away from the backing and the sticker will no longer adhere in those spots. Also, because of the poor shipping method, great care must be taken with affixing the decal to make sure you can press out all the bubbles and wrinkles.In any case, the decal looks great, made in the USA, and let's me rock my veteran status with American pride!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3WZSL6LNVWQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00928B2LW#wasThisHelpful","R3WZSL6LNVWQ1","A17V6IWPTMUXXY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17V6IWPTMUXXY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This vest is made of polyester with a very smooth, shiny texture. It's polyester satin, really. Almost like silk. This vest is the same texture and quality that you'd find in a wedding tuxedo.The vest is basically 2-ply. There is a white, polyester liner. The back of the vest is also white polyester. The American flag pattern is only on the front of this vest. The buttons are what I call ""bubble type"" buttons (I'm not a seamstress; I don't know the lingo) and those, too, are covered with the same satin that the front of the vest is made of. The buttons are color matched the the stripe they are in so that there is no ugly interruption in your stripes (i.e. red buttons on red stripes and white buttons on white stripes).There are no pockets in this vest (including no interior pocket). There is a white belt on the back of the best to allow you so give it a snug fit. I bought the Large vest. I'm 5'9"" and 185 lbs. and it fits perfectly! The vest that I got is for men. It's cut for men and it wouldn't fit right on a woman. I assume they make these for women also. There is a variety of sizes available on eBay if you can't find it on Amazon.I'm a bassist and I bought this vest to wear for my 4th of July and Memorial Day gigs. It looks and fits GREAT!

"4 out of 5 StarsFor original review, see the Prism Book Alliance blog online.I have to admit that I read these out of order. I did not read St. Nacho’s, so I had no previous opinion of Jordan and no knowledge of his history with the previous characters. I do have to say, I did not need to read the previous book at all to understand or connect with this one. In a way, I am kind of glad I did not read the first book, because from what I gathered in this one, I would not have liked Jordan much.I enjoyed this story. It was a great portrayal of two broken men working together to be the best they could be. I enjoyed learning about Jordan and about Ken. Both men had great potential and both men grew as the story progressed. Both men struggled to see that they were worthy of love. While I expected Ken to be the more broken, Jordan ended up taking the prize on that one. And what a broken man he was. I connected to Jordan and was very happy he found ways to heal, even if he has a long road ahead still.I liked Jordan. I felt sorry for him and his struggle, but was so glad he owned his mistakes. He was not a one man pity party. He was not depressed or overly self-deprecating. He was stronger than he gave himself credit for and often tried to put others first. Yes, he had his moments of self doubt and self hatred, but he was not so over the top with it as to be annoying. He was a well rounded character and I fell in love with him easily.However, I was a bit baffled by Ken. He started off as this broken shell but never really followed through on that behavior. He was presented as broken, and he was physically, but his behavior kept me off balance, because I never truly got a grasp on his personality until the very end. He alternated between being a scared, broken man and being this big, bad Alpha Male determined to save Jordan. I just didn’t know when he would be which personality and it hindered my enjoyment of this story a bit because often I felt his actions were out of sync with the story.I also finished the story feeling let down that we never found out why Jordan was attacked or who did it. I thought for sure, with the imagery presented, this would have been a plot line that would have been brought to fulfillment, but it never was.I have to finish this review by giving the author props. She reminded me every so often throughout the story, that this love happened all within a few weeks, but I never once felt that insta-love cheesiness. I actually kept forgetting that only a day or two had passed, because she gave me everything I needed to connect with these men and invest in their relationship. I understood their attraction and why things progressed beyond infatuation. It helped that there was a bit of the mystical involved, but overall, this was well done for such a short time frame. I enjoyed it and was left with a satisfying, warm, fuzzy feeling.I now need to read the rest of this series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12U03L44AOUC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003F77D3C#wasThisHelpful","R12U03L44AOUC0","ANZ16BHO3WGU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANZ16BHO3WGU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 out of 5 StarsFor original review, see the Prism Book Alliance® blog online.Z.A. Maxfield  became one of my go-to authors for well-written, believable romance stories after I read St. Nacho’s- I can’t believe that was five years ago. This is the first book in the St Nacho’s series and we meet Cooper Wyatt, a mysterious, pierced and tattooed biker who pulls into the tiny California coastal town of Santo Ignacio. He’s just passing through, as he has been anywhere he stops for the past several years. He’s a now drifter, a loner, but has his own dark secrets. He also carries a violin…In St Ignacio, Cooper meets Shawn, a deaf waiter at St Nacho’s Bar – the irony of being attracted to a deaf man when music is Cooper’s only love, is only one of the emotional surprises awaiting him in this magical place.The idea of a slightly ‘out of this world’ town that changes one’s life is appealing, and Maxfield manages to depict Santo Ignacio as one of those places without resorting to fantasy or mysticism. Cooper finds people in this small town who are willing to take him as he is; to love him as he is, and ask for the same in return. Sometimes this is all a transformation requires.Z.A. Maxfield gives us characters filled with humanity, even the secondary characters who provide the background for Cooper are vivid, if flickering images. This author only gives us the minimum we need to understand these characters and the role they play in Cooper’s re-awakening. I wish the reader could have gone a little more deeply into the character of Shawn Fielding, who plays a critical role in the book, but I like the twist we get, where he is concerned.There is a lovely counterpoint created by the other small town in Cooper’s life, Great Falls, where he grew up. As Cooper’s re-emerges from the shadows of his past, Jordan Jensen, whose depiction is only slightly less fleshed out than Cooper’s, seems to be there to pull him back. To understand Cooper you need to understand Jordan too, and that becomes vital in the final act in this gentle drama.I wish the character of Cooper could have been a little more gritty and Shawn, as I mention, a little more substantial, but this is the beginning of a wonderful comfort read of a series. If anything the series matures and gets better as it progresses, and I recommend St Nacho’s, Physical Therapy, Jacob’s Ladder and The Book of Daniel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXAS6KT83X5HK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003FMV3YW#wasThisHelpful","RXAS6KT83X5HK","ANZ16BHO3WGU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANZ16BHO3WGU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 out of 5 StarsFor original review, see the Prism Book Alliance® blog online.The Long Way Home was a good suspense and crime drama. I loved the way Kevin’s ability was used and how it was treated. I loved the drama of it all and that I didn’t know who did it right away, but was able to use the clues to figure it out. Though I am still unsure of the why of it all. I understand why Andrew and why Connor, but I am not sure of why there was the need for the other boys. There were a few loose ends that I felt weren’t wrapped up fully, but I still enjoyed the mystery and tension.I liked Kevin and Connor’s relationship once it got started. I do have to admit, I wasn’t following the romance at first. It was very hot/cold and more that once I found myself having to back up because I thought I had missed something that I discovered was just not there. But once I just forgot about the fact that I did not understand the start of the romance, I enjoyed the results. These men were good together. I loved the humor and snark. I found myself chuckling often. There was great passion between them and they were so HOT yet romantic together. I loved that yoga was turned into a spectator sport and would have loved to have more visuals of their dancing.Even though I absolutely hate the lack of communication and the “leave him for his best interest” tropes, I thought they were well done and rather realistically portrayed. Kevin’s doubts were well founded and often his concerns would have been correct. I can understand why he felt as he did, though his methods of coping annoyed me. And I am glad Connor came and showed Kevin that his fears were incorrect.I liked Kevin’s evolution as he became more open and accepting of his gift. I liked that his struggles were mirrored in his reactions and as he listened to his therapist, he was able to be the hero and use his gifts to their fullest.I enjoyed this story. I was on the edge of my seat and loved the tension that kept pulling me along to the end. I felt there were some questions left unanswered, but they did not diminish my journey. I did, however, think the ending was perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MTIE2R6N5ZPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XT8606#wasThisHelpful","R1MTIE2R6N5ZPP","ANZ16BHO3WGU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANZ16BHO3WGU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 out of  5 StarsFor original review, see the Prism Book Alliance® blog online.I can’t count the number of times I have been told that I simply “must” read Drawn Together by ZA Maxfield. I have started and stopped reading in the first chapter more times than I care to think about. Even when I decided to finally bite the bullet and read it for this Retro Reads spotlight, I had to make myself sit down and read it. In short I had a mental block against this book.I have to say, having finally persevered… that mental block was completely and totally unwarranted. This story was fabulous. As I said before, it took some getting into. The first chapter didn’t grab me. However, just like there is something about Rory that wouldn’t allow Yamane to walk away from the straight fan, there is something about Drawn Together that just kept me turning page after page.In all honesty, it wasn’t even the chase that kept me turning the page. It was all about the interplay between Rory and Yamane. I found myself rushing through the few scenes that were not from one of their points of view. I found myself needing to get back to those two. I knew they would eventually triumph over the baddies. Let’s face it, this is a romance novel, there was no question there. But learning how they would find their happily ever after became and imperative.I think there are some people in this genre that can relate, at least a little, to Rory. There are probably some that can relate to an extent with Yamane, as well. However, whether or not you can relate directly to either character, you will be charmed by both of them.This book isn’t perfect. As I said before, there are some scenes from minor character’s points of view. I am not a huge fan of scenes from the antagonist’s point of view. However, my love for Rory and Yamane superseded my lack of excitement about those scenes.I there are also a few times background information for Yamane is thrown around without context, so I couldn’t fully assimilate the information into my mental picture of the character.In the end, however, Rory charmed me just like he charmed almost everyone he met.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W8Z4KPMJPRVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WC99OW#wasThisHelpful","R2W8Z4KPMJPRVH","ANZ16BHO3WGU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANZ16BHO3WGU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.25 out of 5 StarsFor original review, see the Prism Book Alliance® blog online.I really enjoyed the first book in this series, Jack: Grime and Punishment, and so was happy to pick up this book for our Retro Reads. I wasn’t disappointed!Eddie was adorable with the way he dressed up to impress his niece’s teacher. Equally adorable was the way he was clueless to said teacher’s flirtations with him. When they finally connect there are some roadblocks.I really liked how this book tackled the disability dyslexia can be and how Eddie overcame it. That coupled with Andrew’s Dad’s problem, there were some serious conditions talked about and dealt with. It didn’t get overwhelming, though it did tug at the heartstrings at times.Eddie’s family is great as is the crew at The Brothers Grime. The set up for a book 3 is there, though at the time of this review, it has not been heard about.If you enjoyed the first book, you’ll be sure to enjoy this one.

"3 out of 5 StarsFor original review, see the Prism Book Alliance® blog online.Chasing Mr. Wright is my first book from author Aimee Nicole Walker. I am torn on how to review this story. On one hand; I adored these characters. On the other; the lack of proper editing and proofreading prevented my full enjoyment of Chase and Gray’s beautiful story of fated love.This story is fairly formulaic, but the characters are well built and likable. In the end, you want them to find their HEA, and you want them to find it together. They have an auspicious enough beginning, once they do finally start to get together, the fact that they are incendiary is a shock to no one. They are fated for one another.Where Chasing Mr. Wright loses points in my book is four-fold. First, the proofreading was simply not done. There were too many missing or incorrect words and punctuation marks. Secondly, there is a lot of story that simply didn’t need to be there. A good professional editor would have reigned in places where Gray and Chase’s story started to drag. As much as I hate to say it, I think we didn’t need quite so much Cruz in this story. We also didn’t need quite so many encounters between Chase and Gray. Many of them didn’t add to the story. Third, there were many instances of switching tenses between present and past tense in the same sentence, much less the same paragraph. Finally, the passage from the grandmother’s book bothered me. It was supposed to be a passage from historical M/M novel, but was full of modern slang and just wasn’t believable. Most of these issues are things that should have been corrected during editing. Even a competent beta could have prevented many of these mistakes, but that isn’t the job of the beta.Unfortunately, these are all issues I repeatedly find with self-published authors. If a reader is paying for a story, and I did pay for this one, they deserve an author’s best work. Said work goes beyond putting the words on the page. How those words are crafted and presented are at least as important as the plot and characters. These issues detracted from an otherwise sweet and lovable story for me.Our story is told in alternating first person narratives. These switches are well marked, but I still had a hard time following whose head I was in at times. The first chapter is very confusing because nicknames are used as if we should know who they are, and so many people are in play. Once you get the cast of characters straight in your head, however, you will fall in love with all of them. Well, maybe not Devon or Damian.All that said, I need Cruz’s story. I need Ben’s, too, and maybe Liam’s… but I really need Cruz’s.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5ES94S9NPT40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT7TBTS#wasThisHelpful","R5ES94S9NPT40","ANZ16BHO3WGU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANZ16BHO3WGU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 out of 5 StarsFor original review, see the Prism Book Alliance® blog online.Impacted is the first in the Bay Area Professionals series and introduces us to a lot of new characters. For me this would have worked better and been a little easier to understand if we had not also had all their POV’s as it does become difficult to follow at times.On his drive home from a vacation Scott Gregory stops off at a bar and meets a man that gives him the best sexual experience of his life. Instant attraction, matching needs and explosive orgasms leave Scott thinking ‘if only’ and the other man, Robin Kennedy aka Red, wanting a second night.Scott Gregory is a gay man and a closeted submissive. He is also a sought after dental surgeon who has recently landed a dream job with the opportunity to buy the dental surgery from its current owner after 12 months. The problem with this ‘dream’ is the current owner of the practice is certifiably crazy and a raging homophobe so for the next few months Scott is living very much in the closet.Weeks later Scott comes face to face with Red when he starts working at the same dental practice as a hygienist. The attraction is still there, in fact it seems to have increased tenfold, and the two start seeing each other immediately in secret and enter into a D/s relationship. Things move very quickly but it works as they live with the stress of keeping everything about themselves out of the public eye and away from their boss.Scott’s old friend Susie also joins the practice and although I liked her well enough I didn’t want her point of view or life problems as part of the story. They are a bit like the three musketeers as Scott and Red introduce her to the lifestyle in the hopes she can find someone that lasts longer than a couple of dates.Scott comes across as clingy and needy, not helped by his childhood experiences, but Red seems to be good for him and able to give him what he needs. A twist in the story, a heated argument and a pissed off Dom opens Scott’s eyes to what is important in life. A quick make up and a very abrupt ending leaves you needing to read book 2 immediately.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K12C1BJSXZPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1615810234#wasThisHelpful","R3K12C1BJSXZPL","ANZ16BHO3WGU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANZ16BHO3WGU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 out of 5 StarsFor original review, see the Prism Book Alliance® blog online.I wasn’t quite sure what to expect with Astounding!. I’ve loved previous works by Kim Fielding so knew that I was sure to enjoy it, whatever “it” was. The cover with the RV and the knowledge that Carter worked on a Sci-Fi magazine made me think alien chasers and Roswell. This was not that.What this was, however, was a journey of self-discovery and finding love. That sounds clichéd, but I found Astounding unique and fun. John is an alien unlike most and so sweet. Carter is a little tarnished and worn down, but John brings out the best in him. Together they are electric.I really liked Keith and Freddy, they were good and supporting friends. I also liked the cameo of Ery and Karl from Ms Fieldings book Bone Dry. It was nice to check in on them.I found a few spots in the book dragged, but other than that it was quite engaging.

"4.5 out of 5 StarsFor original review, see the Prism Book Alliance® blog online.I had the pleasure of meeting author Rayna Vause briefly at the RT conference in 2014, but I haven’t had the pleasure of reading her words until now. I was intrigued by the concept of Demon of Mine. Suit porn combined with a unique spin on the heaven and hell mythos? Yes, please. Actually, I usually steer clear of demon and angel stories. They rarely end in a way I can believe or about which I care.Demon of Mine, however, was able to bust through my dislike for the trope. It was entertaining from the beginning to the end. While some heavy topics are discussed, Cancer and death, I never felt the weight of these issues. I just felt Ryan’s determination to see his sister live her life and Xavier’s determination to get Ryan everything he wants, including his life and that of his sister.This story is all about love and sacrifice. It teaches us the many faces these two compulsions can take. It teaches us the one sometimes means the other. It teaches us that one can transcend the other. It teaches us that fate plays a role in the everyday. It entertains us from the first page to the last.I will certainly be following this series in the future.

"4.5 out of 5 StarsFor original review, see the Prism Book Alliance® blog online.I had first read Captive Prince a while ago and didn’t care for it as much as some. I found the plot tedious and confusing and the romance severely lacking. However I read Captive Prince Volume Two and found I enjoyed it much more.In anticipation of the release of the third book, I decided to read the rerelease of Prince’s Gambit, formerly Captive Prince Vol 2, and found I liked it even more the second time around.The intrigue and action in this novel is great. The setting is rich and vibrant and it is easy to lose yourself in the book.When it comes to characters, Laurent’s mind is a devious thing and you never know how many steps ahead of everyone else he is. I appreciated seeing further into Laurent’s motivations. I loved Damen and his sense of rightness. I loved that even though he was a slave he still gave his loyalty to Laurent, as he thought it was the best thing to do for his country. I loved the banter between Laurent and Damen; the little back and forth they have.I encourage anyone who read the first book to continue with the second.

"Shakespeare’s Flowers is a book new to me, even though it came out years ago, when Shakespeare himself was still a big name, taught in schools, and so on.  But people still love their flowers, and I think there will always be a market for this book by Jessica Kerr, illustrated by eminent flower illustrator Anne Ophelia Dowden and first published in 1969 by Thomas Crowell and Sons.  Crowell had shot to prominence in the YA world by signing up legendary Denver superstar Lenora Mattingly Weber, who developed her Beany Malone books and their successor, the Katie Rose Belford books, before her tragic end in 1970.  I was about to say, are Jessica Kerr and Anne Ophelia Dowden serious about their names, or were girls called Ophelia back then?  Jessica’s are a dime a dozen, but Shakespeare made the name popular with his famous Merchant of Venice.Jessica Kerr studied all the flowers named by Shakespeare in his canonical plays, and of the ones that survived into the1960s, Anne Ophelia Dowden, who drew only from nature, obtained specimens and captured that just-plucked quality that’s so poignant about cut flowers.  The book is handsomely printed in Belgium with the pastels drawn from the flatlands surrounding Antwerp—same pastels Herge used when creating indomitable Tintin, and employed by persecuted Luc Tuymans in his photorealistic paintings of Mandela and other political titans.  We discover that there are two Shakespeares, the townsman and the countryman, and each had his own special flowers—those cultivated in London gardens, and the “wildlings” of the green and the forest,  When Shakespeare was a boy, his mother hung a twist of dried herbs over the doorway to her kitchen: these were not only used to give flavor to pot roasts or to heal wounds, but they could actually kill witches and spectral intruders who tried to pass into the cooking place of the house of Shakespeare.  Ninety percent of Elizabethans believed in fairies and ghosts, and each had flowers sacred to them.I knew nothing of all this, but what I did not realize, and Kerr refers to it only lightly, was that some of Shakespeare’s plays contain not a single flower, while in others he uses them sparingly.  I keep asking myself, what is with that?  Kerr assumes that The Winter’s Tale was written at the end of Shakespeare’s life, when he had returned to Stratford and “much preoccupied with the growing and planting of trees and flowers.”  How does she know this?  Because they appear so often in the late romances—a circular form of reasoning, but oddly persuasive.Some of Shakespeare’s flowers are gone today, victims of climate change but also of changing styles of horticulture.  Gillyvors, for example.  They were like carnations (in The Winter’s Tale, the “fairest flowers of the season/ Are our carnations, and streak’d gillyvors.”  Kerr suggests that what gardeners call “pinks” are similar to the flowers Elizabethans called “gillyfors,” yet they functioned as spices similar to today’s cloves, and were used to spice up mead, so they were also known as “sops-in-wine.”  In Love’s Labour’s Lost, we have the verse about “lady-smocks all silver-white,/ And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue/ Do paint the meadows with delight.”  Botanists think the “cuckoo-bud” was the buttercup, but there’s no being sure.  Cuckoo-buds were brilliant gold, but so might have butter been in those days before Land o’ Lakes, Imperial, and Country Crock Butter.I love Kerr’s writing, its flourishes of wild imagination coloring in the dim spots in our lack of knowledge.  “There is one flower in Ophelia’s ‘fantastic garland’ that we have not met before.  The crowflower is thought to be the pink flower known today as ragged robin, found where land is moist or marshy.”  This would fit in with Kerr’s thesis that all the flowers in Ophelia’s fantastic garland were among those he himself could have seen while walking along the river Avon, perhaps in a trance, to get more into the character of Ophelia in her mad moods, but it begs the question about the crowflower being the same as the ragged robin.The biggest shock was that the pansy we know was pretty much the “little Western flower” Oberon describes in A Midsummer’s Night Dream, and yet it had nothing to do with pansies in Shakespeare’s plays, which is known in the USA as a “Johnny-Jump-Up,” and where Shakespeare lived—England—they call it “heartsease.”  “”Heartease has many other quaint names such as ‘Three faces under a hood,’ ‘Tickle my fancy,’ or ‘Pink of my John.’”  It is this flower, which Shakespeare calls “love-in-idleness,” that is thought to be the sacred flower of Cupid, and he shoots it at young lovers, and if you put one apiece on the sleeping eyelids of your beloved, that person will wake and fall in love with you forever should yours be the first face they see upon opening their eyes.“Three faces under a hood,” of course, was transmuted by Ezra Pound in his famous poem “In a Station of a Metro,” and therefore began modernism with a bleak bang.  In other news, we find out that in the reign of Elizabeth I, pubhounds did not dunk roasted crab in their tankards of ale…  they put in glamorous crab-apple blossoms!  That was their popular Christmas dish.  My birthday’s on Christmas Eve, so the apple blossoms dunked in ale will be on me, or my name’s not “Pink of my John.”","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16BIWO36MO4BP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0690731639#wasThisHelpful","R16BIWO36MO4BP","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Big Builders came out the year I started the fourth grade, and it became an important book to me.  As an adult I can see what appears to be an ideological message I never really understood as a kid.  But what kid would?  Or do I mean, what boy would?  I still don’t understand why I was so fascinated with builders and junkers both, could stand for hours watching construction crews erect even the smallest of buildings, and I loved seeing things go down, too, as they often were in the Robert Moses-dominated Long Island of my youth.  I hear from my grandchildren (now grown themselves, starting families of their own) that their own kids love videos involving big trucks and that they are the best babysitters around, these videos.  You can leave the house for hours and your kids will literally not know you are gone.That’s how I was with this Whitman “Learn-About” book by the utterly strange and compelling immigrant figure, E. Joseph Dreany.  The back of my tattered copy of The Big Builders reads, “In that part of northern Canada where log cabins and tar-papers shacks are still plentiful, and where winters mean deep snow, long icicles, and temperatures that tickle the sub-zero mark—that’s where E. JOSEPH DREANY, aithor and artist, was born and raised.”  I wish I could show you some of his illutrsations but they are quite fanciful and cinematic.  On the front cover a crew of four hard-hats reach out to each other from opposing red-gold girders as they lasso the Golden Gate Bridge, above the raging waters of Hoover Dam while above soars the then-new United Nations Building.  It turns out these workers are Mohawk Indians, who have the “iron nerve” to takes to stand without safety belts with only a steel beam to stand on in heavy winds.  “Once they came from an Indian reservation in Canada.  Now they live in Brooklyn.”  Dreany doesn’t talk down to kids, exactly, and it was from this book that I found out that the iconic Lever Building was the first NYC building to be erected without setbacks, from the third floor up.  A giant slab on its end, like the UN Building that followed it.

"The Big Builders came out the year I started the fourth grade, and it became an important book to me.  As an adult I can see what appears to be an ideological message I never really understood as a kid.  But what kid would?  Or do I mean, what boy would?  I still don’t understand why I was so fascinated with builders and junkers both, could stand for hours watching construction crews erect even the smallest of buildings, and I loved seeing things go down, too, as they often were in the Robert Moses-dominated Long Island of my youth.  I hear from my grandchildren (now grown themselves, starting families of their own) that their own kids love videos involving big trucks and that they are the best babysitters around, these videos.  You can leave the house for hours and your kids will literally not know you are gone.That’s how I was with this Whitman “Learn-About” book by the utterly strange and compelling immigrant figure, E. Joseph Dreany.  The back of my tattered copy of The Big Builders reads, “In that part of northern Canada where log cabins and tar-papers shacks are still plentiful, and where winters mean deep snow, long icicles, and temperatures that tickle the sub-zero mark—that’s where E. JOSEPH DREANY, aithor and artist, was born and raised.”  I wish I could show you some of his illutrsations but they are quite fanciful and cinematic.  On the front cover a crew of four hard-hats reach out to each other from opposing red-gold girders as they lasso the Golden Gate Bridge, above the raging waters of Hoover Dam while above soars the then-new United Nations Building.  It turns out these workers are Mohawk Indians, who have the “iron nerve” to takes to stand without safety belts with only a steel beam to stand on in heavy winds.  “Once they came from an Indian reservation in Canada.  Now they live in Brooklyn.”  Dreany doesn’t talk down to kids, exactly, and it was from this book that I found out that the iconic Lever Building was the first NYC building to be erected without setbacks, from the third floor up.  A giant slab on its end, like the UN Building that followed it.  Now we see these buildings and don’t even appreciate the power of the Mohawk Indians that made them—like the artisans who created Mont Ste.

"Finishing School has the sort of raw edge of the pre-Code films, the sort that shocks you a little because you pause and ask yourself, ""Did she really say that?""  There's the one sequence where the girls are in a taxi looking forward to a weekend of gin and sin, and the youngest girl decides she wants to experience the weekend without her braces.  It's like something from a John Waters film, the way that they actually reach into her mouth and grasp at the metal wire until it's wrenched out--just not all the way, so that the poor girl is stuck there with three or four inches of mousetrap steel sticking out of the left side of her face.  She doesn't even blink an eye, she's like an animal who just wants to maximize pleasure.  The shocking thing is that among the girls egging her on is Frances Dee, who until now has been the goody two shoes girl who is from the highest of American aristocracy, shocked by the casual drinking and sex play of her classmates.  Now she reveals herself as just as amoral as the rest of them.  That picture of the girl with her braces wedged into one side of her mouth is as disturbing as anything Man Ray or Luis Bunuel was making around the same time.  Can we credit the presence of Wanda Tuchock behind the camera, a Hollywood screenwriter credited here as co-director, for the picture's deeply unsettling picture of women together on a spree?The film benefits from a raft of astonishing performances, from Frances Dee herself, to Ginger Rogers as her roommate ""Pony,"" to Billie Burke as the vain, selfish mother (like Gladys Cooper in the later ""Now Voyager"") to Beulah Bondi, who could often go sentimental but here is a hard case operator, cold as they come, and always watching and lurking like a cobra.  And then there's Bruce Cabot from King Kong who is a total love god in this picture, handsome as they come, and more understanding than Dee has any right to ask of him.  He's like a big elongated version of the present-day literary critic Kaplan Page Harris, with the same knowing grin.  Tuchock seems to know how to make the most of Cabot's limited acting abilities--just train the spotlights on his cheekbones and let shadows rest on the bones of his forehead and he will seem to be irresistible enough to make even the goodest girl go ""bad.""  He's a waiter in the hotel where Rogers and Dee go to have sex with frat boys--then he's an intern at a children's hospital fighting disease--then he's a crusader in the war against stuffy finishing schools--and he comes down the chimney at Christmas Eve like a lithe, dark, wet-eyed Santa Claus with a big gift for the poor little rich girl.  The thing with the pre-Code movies is, you have to be more adult than it's possible actually to be nowadays, to understand what is actually happening in them.  And this movie, as you can tell by the various reviewer's wildly differing synopses, is not easy to follow--to say the least.  But it is magnificent, for all its cruelty, like an early Pasolini film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3YZ97163YS22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004P8R9UM#wasThisHelpful","R3YZ97163YS22","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Charles Monroe Schulz was a household name even in France, where I as an American boy growing up in French provinces had my own subscription to the International herald Tribune from ages 6 to 10.  In this remarkable book of Conversations, we discover much about the lure that held Schultz a prisoner of French thought, feeling and culture, including his service in WWII as an American GI.  Professor Inge, who published this book within a few months of Schulz’ lamentable passing in the year 2000, reproduces the notorious Peanuts strip that Schulz created for the Sunday comics on the 49th anniversary of D-Day, in which the skies are filled with white foamy clouds, American soldiers huddle in prayer on long benches built into hulls of airplanes, and then they are dropped in chutes onto the bloody beaches of Normandy on June 6, with those huge crucifix-like objects the Vichy government erected in the sand to prevent invasion.  One Charlie Brown-like boy in a huge checked cap rocks in the surf, only his face visible—is he drowning?  Underneath a box caption: “June 6, 1944, ‘To Remember.’”  The Sunday strip puzzled Peanuts readers back then and continues to act as an anomalous reminder that for Schlulz, like William Faulkner, the past was not dead—it’s not even past.The continual return to childhood is treated again and again in these interviews, which span a good 45 years.  As they go on, they get more ponderous, but so does Schulz, while many of the interviewers seek to find out why Peanuts lost so much of its punch in later years.  Few will now remember that it was part of the sick humor movement that changed American laughter in the volatile 1950s, like Lenny Bruce, Nichols and May, Albee plays like Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?  But childhood is cruelty and that’s where Peanuts excelled—with the existential nightmare of Lucy always grabbing the ball before Charlie Brown can kick it, or the cloud of dust that attends the eternal outsider Pigpen.  “I couldn’t do that now,” Schulz says, examining some old cruel comic strips.  Even the expression “good grief” had too sadistic a connotation for the aged Schulz.  Did he live a lifetime of regret?  Seems like it.  Modernism played hell with one’s values, and devils like Lucy masquerade as psychiatrists for five cents a session.  Anarchic Snoopy flips into air and barks at the planes flying overhead, and in one of them Schulz kneels, praying over the Norman coast, among a group of boys he will never see again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R252TT3BELTWZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1578063051#wasThisHelpful","R252TT3BELTWZX","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gephyromania indicates a keen interest in bridges.  I’m sure I’m not the only one who didn’t know what this word meant before turning to TC Tolbert’s brightly colored Ahsahta Book.  I knew the opposite, gephyrophobia, a fear of crossing bridges, for it is a fear that has possessed me since I was a child.  But for the trans person there may be both: a fear of the bridge, and yet a compulsion to build and cross, and cross back.  I met the author earlier this year, after several years of hearing about her/him from mutual friends, most of them poets, as one of the most charming, attractive, and talented poets in the West.  It didn’t take me long to connect the work I had read in Gephyromania with the bridge-building of the trim, sharp subject before me.  Instantly we fell into one of those talks where two people finish each other’s sentences.  Or three people, for we had an old friend, the poet Samuel Ace, with us too.  In Gephyromania the speaker announces, from within parentheses, that “I am the least brave person that I know.”  I understood this as a reaction from one who has been called “brave” for the gender and poetic choices s/he has made for so long it is like breathing out and breathing in, and perhaps a nod to other forms of courage.What, I asked myself, is the symbolic function of parenthesis within Tolbert’s text?  They form a version of fort, like Freud’s construction of “fort/da,” a forested space in which to hide or protect one’s body from attack.  Perhaps a confessional booth--must find out if Tolbert was raised Catholic, as I was—a ceilinged space in which one can speak truth with the hope of forgiveness, or to announce oneself without fear of contradiction.  That this place that is a revelation of fear is a space in which one can deny being brave—indeed, in which one can declare one to be the least brave person—that’s paradoxical, like something from an unfinished Bataille story.We always hear that in Italian, “stanza” means “room” and here, on page 84, the little room of parentheses is the only thing you can see on the page—besides the page number itself—two words in parenthesis: “(and still).”  Here the phrase lies hobbled to the left edge of the page, but because of the horizontal, Doug Powell-like orientation of the poem vis a vis the book, what one might think of as the left, turns out to be on the right (close to the book’s spine) like some Elizabethan alchemy performed by John Dee.  What I’m suggesting is that Tolbert is harnessing the shapes and rhythms of the poem to mirror the disconcerting trials, trails and exhilarations of trans subjectivity?  I wish I knew more, but reading and re-reading this marvelous book will keep me firmly on the take for as long as I can hold on.  John Wieners told me he had to stay “on the take” to find all the poems he wound up writing, and through the sometimes difficult patches of his life, there was this one tendency that allowed him to live—the habit of acquisition.  Tolbert’s breakthrough is to add to this habit the one of, not diminution, but of walking away from, of rolling one’s box up a hill till its shape changes to something one can recognize as one’s own.  Like Kate Bush used to say, ""If I only could, I'd be running up that hill.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E8EURZE5Z3W4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934103527#wasThisHelpful","R2E8EURZE5Z3W4","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I walked into the living room and the TV was on but suddenly my wife, sitting near the remote, snapped it off as though it was something she didn’t want me to see, her face nearly expressionless except for a gleam of worry in her eye, the sort of look one wears when one’s keeping a secret.  But we are both New Narrative writers and usually there are no secrets between us!  When I picked up the remote and switched it to reverse, I could she that she was watching some kind of highly colored vintage melodrama set on the Island of Capri.  Eventually she broke down in giggles and admitted hysterically that she was watching Sophia Loren and Clark Gable in Melville Shavelson’s It Started In Naples (1960).This is really my kind of picture and not hers, so I must have infected her with rom-com fever!  “Well, rewind it, I’ll watch it with you,” I offered, but she wouldn’t hear of it, she was too caught up in the action.  She said she would just recap things for me.  “Previously, on It Started in Naples,” she began, and quickly running through how this little 8 year old boy was the center of a custody war not between two divorcing people (perhaps there was no divorce in Italy in 1960, we guessed), but between Sophia Loren, whose sister had married a bohemian American ex-pat called—we never did find out what he was called, but he was the younger brother of important US corporation lawyer Clark Gable.  And her sister and his brother had perished in a Fiat crash, or perhaps the car had gone off the narrow twisty mountain roads above Capri’s beautiful blue waters—leaving behind a son whom aunt Sophia Loren—a second rate cabaret entertainer with little talent but a fabulous figure—was trying to bring up, when she thought of it.  Eventually they were going to get together, but not before a lot of neorealismo hijinx and a lot of vino and cheese and grapes went down, and sexy dancing and captivating photography.  Many on IMDB claim that this is their favorite movie of all time.  Well, for one thing, it is a blistering anti American satire of imperialist business and law practices, the whole “Ugly American” thing Clark Gable embodies.  This is harsh pseudo Billy Wilder stuff!  It’s like A Foreign Affair with Loren in the Dietrich role, and Gable in the Jean Arthur role.  Gable is incredibly withered and shrunken, but still magnetic, and game for anything.  In this role it’s almost tragic that his American sophistication and wariness of being “played” almost loses him his chance to find the one boy he had never even known he wanted, his 8 year old self, half American, half pleasure-mad Italian.The little boy is like nothing on earth I’ve ever seen in the movies.  With long arms and legs, and tiny playsuits, his face often dirty, he gets drunk, sneaks cigarettes, just wants to have a good time in Capri.  His English is rusty, and we could barely make out what he was saying half the time, but he’s learning American slang (“I’m a tough guy, see?”) as fast as Gable can dish it out.  Often in his underwear—a weird Italian pair of Ur-Jockey shorts you’d never find on an American boy--he stays out all night, steals trinkets and things he thinks his aunt might like, knows far too much about sin and gambling, and avoids the hated school house.  His mouth always running, his bare feet stirring up a continuous whirligig cloud of dust, like the old Roadrunner cartoons, or Pigpen from Peanuts.  He’s thoroughly criminal, like little Jackie Earle Haley from The Bad News Bears, or actually like a boy from an earlier Italian strain of cinema, like the boy in De Sica’s Bicycle Thief.  De Sica is in the movie too, playing Gable’s lawyer, super tall and handsome and expansive and a double-crosser, like everyone else in this tourism-driven island.Loren is gorgeous, but more slovenly than usual in her US films, often wearing one weird blue ensemble with green underpinnings that doesn’t know if it’s a house dress or a cocktail dress.  It’s like the producers forgot to buy her any more outfits.  This one factor allows he movie to go into overdrive, insisting on its status as “neo-realistic,” that she should keep wearing the same dress every day like an ordinary housewife of Italy.  And the sunny criminality of the boy (the child actor, Marietto, who actually was about 13 when he played the role), and De Sica’s practiced vamping, it’s practically a potted history of postwar Italian cinema.  But in bright color, brighter than anything Visconti or Bava ever achieved.  It’s like the cinematographers and set designers here were practicing for upcoming Jacques Demy movies, for not until The Umbrellas of Cherbourg would there be a movie where you really didn’t care what was happening on the screen, everything was so luscious like flowers blooming before your eyes.  When Gable and Loren slip out of a motorboat and into the velvety waters of Capri’s Blue Grotto, part of your brain knows it’s not them, but you don’t care, they’re svelte silhouettes at play in all the moonlit waters of the earth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30QRDAN2PVGPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006FO8M0#wasThisHelpful","R30QRDAN2PVGPM","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Buffalo’s doughty little BlazeVox Press, publisher of many recent landmarks in contemporary poetry, has issued a volume of political poetry from Morani Kornberg-Weiss, a name new to me, with a title invoking the great Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish—an epistolary collection like Katy Bohinc’s recent Tender Buttons book “Dear Alain.”  Kornberg-Weiss cites Jack Spicer’s landmark 1957 volume “After Lorca” as a source of inspiration and as a parallel, since like Spicer’s letters to Lorca, Kornberg-Weiss is writing letters and poems to a poet deceased (Darwish died in 2008 in Houston, Texas), whereas philosopher Alain Badiou, addressed and wooed by Bohinc, is happily very much alive.  And yet in a way the gendered thrust of “Dear Darwish” aligns it with Bohinc’s cheeky-were-it-not-so-oracular mode of address, since Kornberg-Weiss is female, addressing a famous male, in a culture that “prefers that women keep their gentle hands clean.”Spicer too was a bit cheeky in addressing, and even manufacturing replies from, Federico Garcia Lorca, but because they were both male subjects the playing field was more even, and the writers’ politics similar.  I take it that “Dear Darwish” has been criticized for its imaginative re-think of idealized “ally” strategy.  She, Morani Kornberg-Weiss, is an Israeli dissident poet firmly opposed to the actions of her nation, and living in voluntary exile in the United States.  She has read Spicer thoroughly and has applied his theories of “correspondence” to the facts of a conflict soaked red with blood, scrubbing with words “until this body becomes nothing…  I am a skeleton walking among poets.”  She renders well the brutalities of prison, of torture, of the systemic withholding of what Darwish called his “id,” the loss of the ID badges in the “blind spot of the mid-century.”Beyond Spicer, this poetry reminds me also of Plath, and her insistence on speaking of the ravages of war and abuse even within the supposed privilege of domestic life.  Critics saw an overkill, an unseemliness, in such Plath poems as “Daddy,” or in the yoking together of the deaths of the Rosenbergs into the breakdown melodrama of The Bell Jar.  What can poetry do in the face of such stalemate?  “Life, initially,” Morani Kornberg-Weiss tells us, “is about unintention.”  Hers is a poetry so unruly that one keeps landing on lines that the mind keeps trying to parse into gentility, but, as the poet reminds us, “What is mild to one person may be terrible to another.”  That is the risk of all political action, including the action of writing and reading poetry.  “Dear Darwish” is a serial poem to ponder at length, to read and re-read, as I have done during the past eleven months.  She quotes Robert Duncan as having said, “We cannot rid ourselves of the form to which we now belong,” and yet she unclenches her fists to reveal the lines in her hands, that indicate, mmm, maybe we can.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTVUUJUTV4CUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609641507#wasThisHelpful","RTVUUJUTV4CUF","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disney’s “Frozen” has some magical sequences and tuneful numbers, but mostly people respond to it because of its story of sisters who can’t live with each other, can’t live without each other.  The simple plot must hold a deeply felt Marion Woodman appeal to a variety of audiences—the largest of which, apparently, girls under ten, millions of whom have made home videos of themselves singing “Let It Go” and released them on YouTube in cute outfits and (sometimes) bewilderingly sophisticated, perhaps parent-supplied backgrounds and props.Idina Menzel can be imperious in real life, but in “Frozen” she seems deeply sorry for having offended anyone and for having turned all of Irindell into a winter hell without a single flower.  And also for hurting her sister Anna (once again!) with her magical power of coldness.  The ingenious screenwriters have simplified the plot of Hans Christian Andersen’s Snow Queen story of the Danish Romantic period, so that now instead of an evil snow queen menacing a brother and sister (“Kay” the brother and “Gerda” the sister), the siblings are both female—perhaps they took their cue from the way “Kay” never sounded like a boy’s name anyhow… instead of three characters, they reduced them to two by making the evil queen and the devoted sister the same person!Kristen Bell employs a beautiful strong voice as Anna, and she is so funny your sides will hurt at some of her byplay with Kristoff and Olaf, yet halfway through she becomes increasingly out of her game, for a reason I can’t disclose—[SPOILERS AHEAD]Okay, because Elsa has shot a chip of ice into her heart, the way the Snow Queen did to Kay in the old Andersen story—[SPOILERS CONCLUDED]As she grows weaker and weaker, she has to undergo some dramatic suffering rather beyond Bell’s own “Veronica Mars” comic charm.  Well, even tragedy queens like Angelina Jolie might not have been able to handle the depths of the part, so I would give Kristen Bell a good “B” for doing her best….  If Billie Whitelaw was still alive she could have given Anna that precipitous Camille-like decline and tragic illness inherent in the part.  And having Jonathan Groff as Kristoff doesn’t help the situation much.  Luckily here the little Snowman and the big Reindeer come in and steal the show with their heroics.  That snowman, “Olaf,” is the most original cartoon character in eons, and his big oblivious number about “Summer” is more surreal than anything Man Ray ever made in or out of Hollywood.  Suffice it to say, me and my wife were like two seven year old girls watching this film and for the first time in forever we burst out into applause and clapped until our palms grew raw and chapped.  I wouldn’t say that the cold never bothered me anyway, but I felt pretty heroic after watching “Frozen” and look forward to at least fourteen other sequels—fingers crossed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RUB10RFQ2BUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G5G7EXY#wasThisHelpful","R3RUB10RFQ2BUO","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently I read Hubert Gregg’s memoir Agatha Christie and All That Mousetrap (1980), his account of directing thrillers on London stages in the postwar period, and while I disliked intensely his contempt for Agatha Christie’s writing and character, he pointed me to one play that, he said, beat out anything Christie had done, and should have been a great success but instead flopped.  (The summer heat in London theaters in 1958 insured its doom, while annoyingly to him, Christie was running Witness for the Prosecution, The Mousetrap, and The Unexpected Guest all at the same time.)  The play that failed was called Speaking of Murder, by an American couple, William and Audrey Roos, and Gregg speaks of it so vividly I thought I would look for it and see if it matched the hyperbole.Well you know what, it almost does!  Gregg speaks of the third act as being the most suspenseful twenty-five minutes of stage writing in the 20th century and I can imagine that, properly directed by Hubert Gregg, it must have created a sensation.  The set-up is sort of like a rewrite of Rebecca, as told from Ms. Danvers’ point of view, if we found out that Mrs. Danvers had killed Rebecca, and was now planning to kill Joan Fontaine, to have Max de Winter to herself.  Well, nobody suspects a good housekeeper!  The play takes place in Westchester, or Connecticut, in a suburban village where a hearty paterfamilias (played by Lorne Greene on Broadway) is about to marry Connie, a beautiful Hollywood actress, which annoys Annabelle, the British housekeeper whom we quickly find out will not let that marriage take place under any circumstance.  It’s a one set play, the great room of a Tudor-style country house with one odd feature, a vault opening off a corridor, a soundproof, noiseproof, mothproof, totally airlocked room of claustrophobic dimensions, four feet by four feet by seven feet.  We find out that Charles Ashton’s grandfather had this vault built for his rare book collection, but that it was so expensive he couldn’t afford to buy any rare books for it, so now they use it to store mink coats and the like.We know Annabelle’s plans right away.  She made away with Elizabeth, Charles’ first wife and the mother of his two adorable, vulnerable kids, Janie and Ricky, and she won’t be sent away, not by Connie.  She is going to trap her in the vault somehow and she spends Act One in a rehearsal for murder by waiting to see how long it takes Joe, Connie’s dog, to suffocate in said vault.  She’s cold as ice and deadlier than a rattlesnake, beneath her English peaches and cream perfection.The play is well written and its dialogue is sprightly and stimulating, with a certain amount of suburban satire, and Connie’s tales of a Hollywood career spent in tedious movies playing the Eve Arden part.  One hates to see Joe die, but reading the play I was trying to imagine getting a dog to do so many things, how do they train a dog to play such a part?  Must have taxed even Hubert Gregg’s directorial abilities!  Estelle Winwood plays a bibulous dowager who’s been blackmailing Annabelle for forty dollars a month, which must have been a huge sum in the Mad Men 1960s.  Most of all I was struck by how similar the story of Speaking of Murder is to something Charlotte Armstrong might have written.  Not to put too fine a point on it, Speaking of Murder is so much like a Charlotte Armstrong plot that I’m surprised Armstrong didn’t sue for plagiarism.  Just shake up The Chocolate Cobweb, The Albatross, and The Unsuspected and you have Speaking of Murder in a nutshell.  What a meaningless title, too, though after the success of “Dial M for Murder,” the producers must have wanted the word “Murder” in the title, even though no one speaks of murder in the whole play from beginning to end.  Anyhow I wonder if William and Audrey Roos, who wrote novels under the name “Kelley Roos,” imitated Armstrong in their novels too?  Or maybe I have the chronology backwards and that Armstrong was under the influence of Roos?","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19C7ELR1VM8GA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001IP8B02#wasThisHelpful","R19C7ELR1VM8GA","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As an American boy growing up in France, I got used to the French way of doing things very quickly—so quickly that my Dad worried that French ways were taking away some essential kernel of ""American-ness"" from me.  It wasn't overnight, of course, for French ways are so different than those my parents had taught us on Long Island—but after awhile I began to think of every French product as better than the ones I had left behind in Smithtown.  The game of Risk, for example, I preferred infinitely to the bourgeois American Monopoly with its sordid focus on Capital.  The Risk we played at home, of course, was itself a bastardized version of Albert Lamorisse's French original.  Luckily we could play both versions often on one bureau, sweeping our pieces madly in the French style and being more sedate and mannered when we went back to the American board.  Anyhow Dad was glad that there was at least one American staple I found superior to its French avatar, and that was the simple ballpoint pen.  Though many of my classmates a l'ecole had, of course, beautiful pens that were almost family heirlooms, and many carried the Montblanc pen like it was a badge of cultural superiority, I was always so glad when cousins and merchants back home airmailed me et ma soeur the latest round of Pilot pens—the beautiful Pilot with their jaunty caps and their slim, yet strong, plastic encasements.  ""Encasements""—is that how you would say it in the US?They had to be strong, for I was a rough and tumble athletic teen, always ready for s gang fight or a rigorous game of football, and the pens in my back pocket sometimes broke—if they were Montblanc pens—and a sharp collision with turf, or another garcon's foot, might leave mon cul a hideous mess of blue or blank ink.  I ordered the 12 pack of Pilot Hu-Tec-C Maica pens recently through Amazon Prime, and as soon as I unwrapped the brown paper of the box, my years in De Gaulle's France came back to me like the madeline that made Marcel swoon back to an earlier, simpler time, in Proust's 7 volume novel Remembrance of Things Past.  Of course with today's sleek Japanese influence the pebs themselves are rather different, and kind of clunky, wouldn't you say, their encasements encumbered with useless protrusions—though the glittering jewel cameo laid into each pen top is charming, like a diamond almost in its brightness.  Like other owners, I too am perplexed about the color range Pilot is giving us in the Hi-Tec-C 12 pack.  There are something like three or four oranges—from gold to apricot to a pale root beer—why so many I wonder?  It's not like many people of any age or gender do much writing in orange shades do they?  Oh, maybe they do in Japan.  I bought out some old French stationery that I kept, a stone blue, and when I tried writing a note to ma soeur with the ""Apricot Orange"" pen I couldn't even see any marks on it!  Looked like invisible ink.  Similarly there is a scarlet and two pinks, and I can't tell them apart,The caps are constantly being mixed up, but maybe that's just me.  Each 12 pack should be issued with a separate, extra assortment of tops, just in case they slip onto the carpet while writing.  My wife said, why not use the orange and black pens you complain about everyday and every nuit, and make a pen and ink drawing of the San Francisco Giants stadium—our uniforms, you see, and orange and black.  I think I will.  She is always the one with the best ideas and she knows her colors well, having had them ""done"" herself by a certified New Age color consultant.  Boasting all those orange shades—the Pilot 12 pack is what we in the New Age would call an ""Autumn"" set.  ""They write beautifully,"" my wife says, ""and I love them.""  She keeps stealing them to grade student papers with.  We are bringing this pen set to our four-year annual color palette review, and seeing if it makes the grade with our Franco American style.  However I will never lose my memories, not so long as these pens stay on my desk like beautiful reminders of the land of my birth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KND0ZR4AOAUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N92S8FA#wasThisHelpful","R2KND0ZR4AOAUR","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seven Sweethearts would have gotten five stars from me if the producers hadn't saddled themselves with grumpy old Van Heflin playing the lead, a veteran reporter.  I guess he's young Van Heflin, certainly younger than I've seen him before, but his youth does not help him out in this role, if anything it makes him even more unlikeable, for if a boy so young can already be such a wiseass to everyone in the first half of the picture, is there any hope for America?  He is decidedly a cad who sneers at the little Dutch town built into a flat plain of Michigan landscape, and sneers at the crazy hotel he's booked into, and sneers at Cuddles who runs the place, and the seven sisters all with boys' names.  We see everything through Van Heflin's eyes, and there are many improbabilities to swallow, and yet under the master hand of the great Frank Borzage, all of this goes down smooth as silk--the romance, the music, the sexy Marsha Hunt as the oldest sister, directed to impersonate a great camp object like Mae West.  Borzage knows what to do in every frame of film, though the set designers don't make things easy for him.  I can just picture the commotion in the art department when Joe Pasternak sent down this script and they realized they were charged with making a miniature Holland with tultips and wooden shoes and milkmaid outfits and yodeling, and still manage to make it ""American"" as well.  Not a single inch of the old Arts and Crafts style hotel goes unmarked by Netherland hideousness, baroque to the extreme, and fresh tulips everywhere, inside, outside, on the balconies, on the breakfast table, and in case you don't notice, there are songs about them.  Little humpbacked bridges, ice skating, Dutch meals with unpronounceable consonants, and those horrid beanie caps placed flat onto Kathryn Grayson's long curly hair.  Grayson as ""Billie"" is directed to constantly snicker or sniffle in close  up after she delivers a comeback to Van Heflin, and the camera lingers on her itchy nose and fidgety fingers so many times that I realized, this wasn't some Tourettes blooper left in the movie by mistake, but it is supposed to be an adorable twitch and we see Van Heflin melting for her a little harder every time this sniffle comes into play.The plot is rather like Kiss Me Kate, isn't it--I wonder if when Grayson landed the role in Kiss Me Kate is she thought to herself, I played this part years ago, except in Kate she is playing the Marsha Hunt part, the oldest, crabby, disagreeable, vain sister who must be married off before her younger sister can get married.  It's the oldest story in the world, so the writers must have said, ""Let's have six of these suffering sisters, and let's make SZ Sakall the father!""  Usually I like Sakall but here, he is a monster, and the back story that's supposed to help his understand him (that Marsha Hunt is supposed to be the spitting image of her late mother, and that's why Cuddles can't bear to see her go or deny her anything, only makes him seem even more sexually perverse than he usually is.  My God, he is such a strange actor!  Bunuel must have longed to cast him in a movie, but MGM and then Warners had him wrapped up for decades, always officious, always self-centered, always the malaprop, and usually lusting secretly after Doris Day or Jane Wyman or some other comically sexy babe.There is basically nothing wrong with Seven Sweethearts, and I loved every minute of it, perhaps for its overstuffed décor and its strange political allegory (they are supposed to be in a simulacrum of Holland, at a moment when Holland had been swallowed up by Nazi invasion, and yet MGM did not yet allow the screenwriters to allude to the Nazi party directly).  If only Van Heflin had even a soupcon of charm!  For really, there hasn't been a picture to match it in seventy years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JX5E5EFJVC4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EXA8Q4#wasThisHelpful","R1JX5E5EFJVC4P","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Despite the illusion of giving understanding, what seeing through photographs really invites is an acquisitive relation to the world that nourishes aesthetic awareness and promotes emotional detachment.""  Or so says Susan Sontag in her best-selling tome On Photography.  Paul Halter, France's great thriller builder and furnisher, has another take and presents us with a photo seen on the cover of a novel by the hero, who walks away only to obsess about it later, enough so he goes back to the bookstore where he spied the book and buys it, the better to snip the image from the book jacket and stare at it for hours, distracting himself from his work and trying to wonder why this picture is giving him deja vu when, from all appearances, it is a picture of a past so long ago it must have been shot before his birth.This man, John Braid, is a British husband in a lovely little suburban town who takes the train each day to go to work in London, and what he does few people know or care.  Readers get suspicious when an acid bath murderer is introduced.  I didn't exactly understand what was going on with the crimes of this acid bath murderer, but it sounded really creepy.  It also made me think this murderer, whose identity is unknown, must be a man, and so I began to suspect all the men in the story one by one.  It couldn't be John Braid, that's too obvious.  He is tormented and horrified by his own past, so much is plain, just like killers in many books from The Lodger through to today's sleek thrillers like Dragon Tattoo.  In viewing The Picture from the Past as a Thomas Harris-style ""psychological thriller,"" one comes to sympathize with the wife of Braid, Andrea Braid, even when she breaks the second law of marriage by asking her neighbors what could be the matter with her husband.  She is a ravishing vision who would, claim the police, excite any red-blooded male, and at first I was thinking that her alliance with the new owner of the town ""bric-a-brac store,"" as they call it in England, seemed suspicious to me, even quasi-adulterous, but after awhile, John Braid was so strange I found yself thinking that if I were married to him, I would seek kindness and advice elsewhere.  This is in 1959 England when divorce was hard to find.  We don't ever discover much about Andrea's past, and for a book that has so many layers of ""pastness"" interweaving with each other, this seems doubly significant.  Halter seldom allows his heroines many girlfriends—few of his books would pass the ""Bechdel test""—but usually they have the support of their families.However, ""The Picture from the Past"" reveals that family is poison.  Two separate storylines, one occurring in 1959, and the other, in the years right before the Second World War, give us families apparently filled with prosperity and devotion, but in reality they are rotten from within, and not merely from the excesses of capitalism.  Compare Graham Morris' ""bric a brac store"" to the vast dump heap that Dickens uses to symbolize modern society in ""Our Mutual Friend.""  Halter is not quite Dickens—for one thing, he seems to get all things English slightly wrong—but in his industry, his prodigious gift of plot and suspense, and the variety of his technique, for no two books are the same—he is the next best thing, and John Pugmire brings his French into English in a thoroughly chivalrous and imaginative way.  I was stunned by the multiple revelations of the last fifty pages of the novel, and I never even guessed that one of the characters in the book was none other than—but I mustn't go on,  And you got to love his names: ""Yvan Highlander,"" anybody?","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U567NM83A73B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QX39KZY#wasThisHelpful","R3U567NM83A73B","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first read the book as a teen, I guess, I read it directly after Murder in Mesopotamia, and I thought I had guessed the killer only to be confounded when it turned out to be—well, never mind! My brilliant idea was that, you know how Renisemb is always looking back longingly at her life with sexy fisher king Khay, now lost to her? What if Khay was secretly alive and disguised as one of the other characters or, perhaps, as an old mummy case, and like the Phantom of the Opera, obsessed with destroying those who pose a danger to Renisemb? So many times it seemed Christie was just about to reveal exactly that! But no. I still think it would have been an OK solution, if perhaps overly Gothic and Murder-in-Mesopotamian. I guess Khay must have been some kind of Archie Christie figure, young, virile, cute, athletic, potent, yet too good to stick around?","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI5WJL88LX4PC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006207413X#wasThisHelpful","RI5WJL88LX4PC","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The Despairs” might be the best of all of Cid Corman’s many books of poetry.  (He is said to have written over seventy of them.)  In later life, he lived in Kyoto for decades at a time and his poetry became inflected by Japanese syntax and form, so that most of his poems are short.  He wrote haikus in the style of the great old 5-7-5 masters of his home country and his adopted land, for example, “The Wanderer Theme” which reads, “Coming back after/ all this time only to have/ to find yourself gone.” He showed us that many of his poems could fit on one page of a then-traditional brand of a Japanese composition book, small enough to fit into a hip pocket, for example.  Life wasn’t luxurious for Corman and his long-suffering wife, particularly in Corman’s final years when Japan found itself in a recession and prices rose, for everything had to be imported and the little island, so inventive, began charging for everything, as do we in America at the time.  Corman was visited by a continual procession of American and Canadian admirers, maybe as many as five or six a year, the kindest among them bringing treats like cans of Campbells soup, or maybe fresh vegetables like artichokes, things unavailable in Kyoto except among the super-rich.  In return, Corman always had a little book he had printed himself and he might give you one on your way home.The Despairs has a gloomy title, but we come to understand that nothing will get the poet down, not seriously, though he flirts with foul temper and, like other expatriates, sometimes regrets having left his homeland.  A host of old American friends are invoked—George Oppen and William Bronk among them, Bronk in filthy, Rabelaisian terms as though there were bad blood between the two.  And there’s a note of whining about old age, though not despair as we know it philosophically, but even a bleak poem might wear a sprightly title like “Acme.”  Here’s the poem, aired out with blank lines and plenty of blank space all around the page: “Isnt it/ / obvious/ you are as/ / good as dead/ already?  And it wont/ get better.”  (He abhorred the apostrophe as a form of punctuation, arguing that it detracted from the look of the word and called attention to that which is not there, just as his fellow Black Mountain-influenced poets made a fetish of the word “yr” for “your.”)When he returned to the US for a brief fundraising visit I saw him in the second floor gallery of a Market Street emporium on an engagement for the San Francisco Poets Theater.  He was going to fill the bill solo, he announced, for in the years since he was away he had written over five thousand poems.  That night, as the fog rappelled down Market Street as if in the pathetic fallacy of parkour, and as the hours of the Western clock told us it was seven p.m, then seven fifteen, then seven twenty, and finally midnight, he read them all, none smoother nor truer nor more packed with old man defiance than the magnificent poems of “The Despairs.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I2NXDY46YK9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1891812300#wasThisHelpful","R1I2NXDY46YK9M","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We are presented with an audacious epistolary: a young American poet, based in New York, writes in English to the eminent French theorist Alain Badiou (born in Rabat, Morocco, in 1937), and writes him love letters of astonishing honesty and passion.  Echoes of Max Ophuls fill my mind as I read through the first fifty pages, letter after letter from Katy, no response from le philosophe--you've seen Joan Fontaine write pages and pages to Louis Jourdan, filling the screen with impassioned hand, in Letters from an Unknown Woman, right?  It's the saddest picture in movie history, so my first instinct is to say that young Bohinc has set her sights too high, and that he, ""dear Alain,"" won't even remember her if shown a picture of her after her death.  But then finally I get it, that what she is proposing is no ordinary love affair, but rather a test of love, a test to be played out according to her understanding of his writing, and the main action of the book turns into an interrogation, then a subversion, of his tenets, of the monstrances in which his words are displayed: his books and articles and public statements.  As she writes, she changes his writing, at least its import, perhaps its meaning.Tender Buttons has published many books that demonstrate this sort of twisty, suspense-driven turnabout, so I expect that whenever I pick up one of their books it is not going to be what I expect.  Into this tradition Bohinc fits beautifully, but even so, the surprises are earned.  The reader must bring a lot of attention and empathy to meet her on the page, and to be wise enough to distinguish lover from writer from artist, melancholic from joker.  I'm sure I stumbled a couple of times across this lengthy book, but there was always something beckoning, a pennant faintly flapping upon Mont Blanc, to keep me murmuring ""Excelsior"" and going forward.  Well, for one thing she's witty as hell, and for another, she has a gift for extravagant metaphor, perhaps from hip-hop roots, that delights in transforming itself into every variant of itself imaginable.  Maybe that's what love does--love with a capital L, as she insists you spell it--creates a hall of mirrors around the loved one that produces infinite lights and angles.The lovers live parallel lives on either side of fame; they experience the same events, like the resignation of Egypt's Mubarak, and she reads his reaction to Egypt int he papers and he reads hers in these letters.  They are either end of the spectrum of age, and of gender, but ungodly connections bring them together.  And she can sometimes boast that she knows more than he about this or that--not only matters of the heart, but cold facts, like math.  ""I suppose you've mapped sociality like a chessboard. But I'm mercurial, at best.""  In the next life, she recalls, the philosopher is going to reincarnate as a dancer; but as the poet will turn into a janitor, will he still want her?  Cocteau or Demy sort of transformation turns old Ophuls plot into something more like a sun-warmed fairy tale, but Dear Alain convinces me, and will you too, that miracles can happen even in the most blighted of social circumstances and broken civic systems.  I enjoyed it very much, and it spurred me to direct action, and to going back to the basic arithmetic I abandoned as a teen, and one can ask no more of a book or a friend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SZOHZGRQZ9OQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0927920123#wasThisHelpful","R1SZOHZGRQZ9OQ","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thom Wolf takes pen in hand to bring us the thrilling story of what actually happens on the set of the spaghetti westerns of the 1960s and 70s.  A film scholar as well as one of today most acclaimed erotic novelists and short story writers, Wolf combines the critical acumen of the reviewer with the raw passion of one who fell in love with the good looking stars of these ""westerns all'italiana"" as much as with their violence, suspense, and revolutionary underpinnings.  The (fictional) movie he chronicles is called Dollars in the Dust (1969) and his protagonist and narrator, young Eddie Drake, is new to film, though hardly to the casting couch, when he arrives in the remote Spanish location used for so many of the Italian coproductions of the period.  He knows little Spanish or Italian, so he's lonely, but buoyed by knowing that the great Hollywood western star Hank Kinney is due on set for the last two weeks of shooting.Wolf writes well of Eddie's loneliness and self-doubt, and about he has to negotiate his hidden sexuality in the mazes of Hollywood and international film production.  There were then no ""out"" stars, or even ""out"" extras for that matter, but among those in the know there have been, for twenty years or more, whispers about the great superstar Hank Kinney, now down on his luck and reduced to playing in the sort of films he hopes will never reach America.  Eddie is all excited to meet his co-star, but when the famous actor arrives he disappears into his trailer and won't respond to the director's entreaties.  In despair, director Benito (sort of a Sergio Leone character, trying to make a masterpiece out of hackneyed materials and a tiny budget) send Eddie in to lure out Hank Kinney.  In the heat of the Spanish noon, all of Eddie's dreams come true, but first, pure pain.Not only the pain of fearing that your dreams of stardom will evaporate like dollars in the dust, but the pain of being invaded by the titanic male members first of insatiable Italian bit player Sandro, and then another one for whom the huge encroachment of Sandro will have only been a loosening up.  Like many of Wolf's most memorable characters, Eddie experiences life through the sensitive membranes that make up his hot, molten, stretchable core, and between these two guys he's often left too sore to sit comfortably on his palomino.  That feeling, and the endless plains of Pamplona, and the unforgiving sun of Spain, are the things I will take away from Wild West Hero long after I stop reading it with one hand, longing for Eddie to find the happiness he deserves.  It is a book to treasure, to inflame, and you will never look at Django or Once Upon a Time in America in quite the same way after reading about the secret lives of their Wild West Heroes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO9BABBPTZ9NT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKNBIL4#wasThisHelpful","RO9BABBPTZ9NT","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading Harlem Nocturne, I was constantly reproving myself for how little I knew about the Double V campaign that took place during World War II here in America.  Indeed I had never heard of it before.  Double V stands for ""Double Victory"" and it was an initiative pioneered by leftist and progressive groups trying to convince black American workers to put their backs into the War against Fascists overseas, while pursuing the nascent civil rights struggle at home.  As Farah Jasmine Griffin explains, this double campaign was something new; in World War I we learn that black leaders were known to downplay their own political causes in times of national warfare, presumably to show white folks that black men and woman could magnanimously put being ""good citizens"" ahead of their own basic human rights.  Well, no more of that in WWII, at least in Harlem, but Griffin shows how the struggle to keep two separate victory campaigns alive simultaneously was not always easy, perhaps especially for the women artists of the community during the War and in the troubled years immediately afterwards.Only incidentally is this a biography, but I did ménage to learn far more than I had already learned about the three whom she selects as her principals.  Pearl Primus based her modern dance choreography of what she could observe as ordinary black life both in the US and in Africa, insisting on the unbroken chain that linked the two continents.  Herself an accomplished dancer, though with a body sometimes dismissed as clunky and short, she could jump straight up into the air five feet or more, from a standing position, a feat that left onlookers amazed.In contrast, novelist  Ann Petry hailed from the black bourgeoisie of Connecticut; Griffin describes her initial descent into Harlem almost as an act of ""slumming,"" but she was assuredly drawn to working class life and the hardships endured by women in the Harlem homefront.  Was she a communist?  It's hard to say, though all three of the subjects of Griffin's book found that, if you ignored or shunned the leftist arts and political organizations, literally no one else supported you at this time.  Frustratingly, many of the most interesting parts of her subjects' lives occurs after Griffin leaves them (roughly around 1950), and we learn only in an epilogue that Petry basically abandoned her role as America's greatest female black novelist in 1953, writing only stories and children's books until her death, and we never really find out why.  I for one would love to read THAT HILL GIRL, a vehicle for the white star Kim Novak, that brought Petry to Hollywood in 1957, but Griffin supplies just enough material on that project to tantalize, not enough to please.Mary Lou Williams was my favorite story, perhaps because Williams was the least ""diva-like"" of the personalities Griffin treats.  (Although who doesn't love a great diva?)  I remember seeing her when I was a boy, at the Smith Haven Mall in my hometown of Smithtown, Long Island, playing jazz piano in public and entertaining a whole shopping mall's worth of shoppers.  My mother told me to remember this moment forever, for Mary Lou Williams was a genius.  I wanted to hang out with my gang, but she said, hush, just be still, take this moment and listen to the gods with both your ears.  I stood there and eventually I could understand what my mother was talking about.  God bless them both, my mother and Mary Lou Williams, and thanks to Dr. Griffin for producing such a readable, if much too brief, book on a stimulating time and place.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDOP7Z0JEJYIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465018750#wasThisHelpful","RDOP7Z0JEJYIM","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw this young man read a few years back, and I made a mental note of his name, and then I went to an open reading at the San Francisco Museum of Performance + Design when I heard he was going to be what they call the feature.  He’s got a lot of charm as a performer, he’s tall, good-looking, and he can even bring out a guitar and sing like Glen Campbell, so what’s not to like?  But sometimes all that charm can fool a poet’s audience into thinking there’s more there than there is there, as Gertrude Stein once wrote about Hemingway or somebody.  I vowed I would wait until a press put out Brent Calderwood’s first book, so I could read the words without the distraction of that personality, just to make up my mind.  Now The God of Longing is here, and I can report, even if he was a troll his poetry could still deliver.I start with the title, trying to remember my ancient Greek and asking myself, who was the god of longing on Mount Olympus?  Calderwood’s writing veers sharply between the high romantic mode and the slangy, quotidian I did this I did that of O’Hara, only he’s more explicit about sexual matters than even the old horndog Frank O’Hara allowed himself to be.  The first poems in the book all reach back to various bygone eras of romance, from the pre-Raphaelite “The Golden Hour,” to the Rodgers & Hart Tin Pan Alley minor key “Stay Little Valentine Stay,” to the postwar homosexual irony of “Ballad of the Kind Young Men.”  Later the poems pass through the region of great geological unrest—the days of the quake.  But not everything is loud, nor cataclysmic, in this collection.  Thematically there’s the tension of gods versus men, the tension between boys and men, the passages of time that turn a sweet love sour, that turn a boy into a man, and how these passages sometimes run, like a subterranean creek, deep underneath the surface of life so that you don’t really know they’re occurring.  In every case, both loud and quiet, Calderwood finds a vehicle appropriate for what he wants his poem to do.  (In that sense I wasn’t wrong, in thinking of him as a performative poet, but it’s the poems themselves that are performing themselves on every page.)Turns out the god of longing is from Augustine, and his name was Himeros, and in the name of this god we detect the words for “him” and for “Eros.”  Calderwood’s characters speak of a broken home, a brother fatally ill, an absent father; we get the picture of a boy isolated by his fears and by the pressures of his peers to be studly and straight; a fat boy who, slim as he makes himself in gay adult life, can never get over the shame of being a freak.  These are strong issues and Calderwood creates tension wisely by reining in the emotion with a variety of formal devices.  In “Abecedarius,” one of the most striking poems, each line of free verse begins with a successive letter of the alphabet, from A to Z:  “So he goes to the room marked BOYS at/ Twelve each day, pretends to/ Urinate, then stays in a stall till the bell rings at one.”  Elsewhere, in a more comic mood—though one equally resentful of the marks of beauty each man must carry like armor, Calderwood writes a poem about anal bleaching, and he makes it a villanelle—again, I suppose to ward off the bad magic of his subject matter.I actually hate such forms but it’s a mark of my respect for this young poet that I’m giving him the thumbs up despite his attraction to the formal.  Elsewhere, in “Swim,” we find the three-line stanza beloved of William Carlos Williams, the triadic measure he called the “variable foot,” supposedly one that could contain the raw power of America; and next to “Swim” the astonishing intimacy of “Intermission,” in which a speaker examines his boyfriend’s frenulum, in prose, to the point of no return, or so I read it, whereupon the poem erupts into the broken line of verse.  If you don’t know what a frenulum is, don’t worry, he spells it out in a delightful allegory of him and Eros.  In The God of Longing, Calderwood’s most striking poems resolve and revolve around an ever-shifting display, a pageant on the age-old conflict between Apollo and Dionysus, between the ecstatic experience and the quieter moments of remembering it, or wanting it so bad, so bad that sometimes it’s good, real good, exquisite in fact.Expect to see this book on many of the “best of 2014” lists, and Brent Calderwood, get ready, a lot of young men will be picking up this book and wanting to write just like you, and to get there, they’re gonna start by first investigating your frenulum.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JAVPX6C9GWWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937420817#wasThisHelpful","R3JAVPX6C9GWWQ","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What can an everyday person do to help change the world?  Enlightened Season Two maps the territory in an erratic, sometimes aimless way that eventually delivers its punch through underplaying (yes, even Laura Dern and her mother try underplaying here, to great result) and some script surprises which I dare not reveal in this public space, eve though the show's been cancelled and anyone who cared for it has doubtless subscribed to HBO and gone for it.  But anyhow when the end times came for Enlightened I put aside my grudges and totally embraced the ethos of the show, confusing and arbitrary as it is/was.I should add that some varied acting helped the pace of Season Two.  Viewers, some of us, had a hard time with Laura Dern's continual swing between relentless optimism and Nazimova-like gloom, which occurred in every episode; one wanted to reach out and counsel her, Amy Jellicoe, don't stop taking your meds just because you saw a flower in your mother's garden.  And Christa, her assistant, obdurately chipper and phony, and Mike White sitting there looking like the underside of a log in every episode, his lips twitching--well, the director made them all act this way  We looked forward to Luke Wilson showing up once in a while not because he's a better actor, nor because he used to be a hunk (sorry, that boat sailed long ago) but because he gave some relief from the one dimensionality of everything else we knew about the world of Enlightened.  Southern California is a two-edged sword in this series, one blade ripe for satire of New Age belief in self-improvement, and the other blade trying to cut through the thorny, perdurate fiber of corporate culture with its lies standing in for truth.  But Season Two brought us Molly Shannon and James Rebhorn as the top players at Abbaddon and the show got much more intriguing instantly.  And also late in the season, we got a blast of Charlie from GIRLS in Hawaii trying out rehab and failing miserably, right before he got fired from GIRLS itself, poor guy.  Yet another victim of corporate culture, meta style?  He was good in this show too.Did they know ahead of time, last year, when Laura Dern was pushed into the bowels of Timm Sharp's Cogentiva, that the humble IT department would be put into use, episode by episode, in a Herculean effort to bring down Abbadon?  Every time you saw the word Abbaddon engraved in stone on its gleaming building surface, you were reminded that it was the name of Satan in ancient Babylonian teleology.  (The show was never about subtlety exactly--Luke Wilson's first name, for example, was ""Levi"" and his last name ""Callow.""  Mike White makes characters' names the way John Bunyan did in Pilgrim's Progress.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDCVQHXFZ3WAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOTCHRU#wasThisHelpful","RDCVQHXFZ3WAQ","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember seeing Paul Lynde on TV game and variety shows when I was a boy, and then seeing him in George Sidney's version of Bye Bye Birdie.  What an astonishing dad he made, with that somewhat handsome face that crumpled at the drop of a phone call or a sign from Ann-Margret that she was growing up.  He was great at reacting, and that's rather rare in screen acting, but you could watch the whole movie if Christian Marclay-like photoshop interns blacked out ninety per cent of it, cut out the soundtrack, and just left his expressive face react to his daughter's confusing combination of daughterly pampering and siren-like keening.  She--Ann-Margret--embodies life, or youth, as no other star ever could, and Lynde watching her seems like an old man, though he was what, 33 when the movie was filmed?  His is the gaze of death, puzzled death, death mystified that life goes on without him, life has got another life to lead, outside of the family structures Dad embodies.Of course the authors make clear how ironic this set up is, since Lynde was himself running headlong from the disaster of his own nuclear family (and the line of individual deaths it entailed) and his own drive for pleasure was no less pure and driven than Ann-Margret's.  Now that I think of it, funny how neither star had any children themselves?  I'm not saying there was a curse on Bye Bye Birdie, but--In fact how could there be when Janet Leigh, playing the Spanish songwriter Rosie so memorably with the black wig, was already the mother of two lovely daughters?This is all prelude to my concise description of Center Square as a biography of a great showman who used alcohol as a crutch to make his way through a difficult, if charmed life.  The authors have apparently interviewed a number of players in Lynde's life,. though unfortunately the editing of the book obscures their original research, making it seem as though they surrounded themselves with twenty years of TV Guides and let the chips fall where they may.  But a vivid picture of a legend shines through.  He had his own cadres of celebrity fans, if we can believe authors Steve Wilson and Joe Florenski--including Garbo, who sent him a fan letter (where is it now?), Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne; Harry S. Truman--an unlikely bunch all around.  Hollywood Squares, of course, propelled him into superstardom, and eventually he clawed his way into the  center square, sometimes attaining a political edge that made remaining in the closet a moot issue.  ""According to the old song, what's breaking up that old gang of mine?"" he was asked, and after a pause he ventured, ""Anita Bryant?""  You tell em Paul Lynde!  I came away from the book thoroughly impressed by Lynde's durability as a star, and his sex, drug and alcohol problems I chalked up to the perils of fame, but I wasn't prepared for the incident of July 1965 that occurred here in San Francisco, on the eighth floor of the famed Sir Francis Drake Hotel here on Powell Street, coincidentally enough right around the time famed San Francisco poet Jack Spicer was writing his final poems very close by.That was the night that Paul Lynde checked in with a bartender boyfriend and before the wild party was over, the younger man was dead.  Bing Davidson plunged to death after lowering himself out of the window ledge and clinging by his fingertips.  The last thing he saw was Paul Lynde's leering face hovering above him and one by one his fingers slipped.  Bye, bye,. Birdie!  Kenneth Anger left this lurid story out of his book Hollywood Babylon.  Was he paid off I wonder?  Kenneth Anger: we thought you had integrity!  Anyhow I can't walk up Powell Street now without thinking of the poor man, Bing Davidson, cute, smushed up victim of a comic's lust.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K4EQBQGMN2G3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=155583793X#wasThisHelpful","R3K4EQBQGMN2G3","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Spoilers ahead!  Of course the novel ended after only 50 percent of the book was written--there was the ""Sapsea Fragment,"" though some think Dickens didn't write that piece at all, and that it was the product of Forster's hand  Dickens did sketch out notes; and he instructed the artist he had chosen to illustrate the periodical version for which he was writing month to month, on the sorts of things that would be needed in the second half, and that's why Drood nerds--the ""Druids"" as they are sometimes known--have been arguing about this novel for many many years.  It takes big balls to go ahead and finish it, but on the other hand it's almost irresistible.Part of the problem is what we know of the plot seems irretrievable obvious.  Many are convinced that Jasper, in a fit of opium induced madness (""wickedness"" is the word constantly in play in the novel) kills his beloved nephew and throws him into the quicklime of the cathedral underbelly.  And that the second half of the book would feature Dick Datchery bringing Jasper to justice.  But if this is the case, argued the Victorian writer Andrew Lang, there is no mystery whatsoever, except that it seems clear that Datchery himself is someone else we have already met under another guise, and his unmasking might provide a surprise.  And so, there have been zillions of continuations, but a paucity of actual suspects outside of Jasper.The BBC version shows an awareness of many of these issues and actually surprised me with an unexpected ending.  As soon as Datchery starts inquiring (in some scenes definitely not written by Dickens) into the career of the elder Edwin Drood (thought to be long dead), well, my little mind was going, No!  They can't be playing it that way!  But play it they did and by Gad, I liked it!  The post-colonialist reading of Edwin Drood is especially marked in the new second half, but you figure, Dickens was going somewhere with the Landless pair, they weren't just dropped out of India into Cloisterham without a social justice point to make.  My friend Alistair Johnston has complained on his blog that not one single font visible in any of the many words, signs, or texts visible in this film had been invented in the 19th century, so that to a specialist like himself the show is unwatchable and, he would argue, even to one without any knowledge of typography, one's unconscious registers the disparity and smells out the falsity anyhow.  For me it was the casting that disappointed.  Matthew Rhys was fine in the part of Jasper but just too magnetic and charismatic to play the unassuming sad sack guy no one notices slipping in and out of Princess Puffer's opium joint.  Why get someone who smoulders more than Olivier, more than Logan on Veronica Mars?  And on the other hand, the young people are all properly young, but they're all ugly!  Rosa Bud is supposed to be gorgeous, well, a perfect flower, but this girl reminds me of Sissy Spacek in the last scenes of Carrie, and Edwin Drood is like something John Jasper scraped off of his shoe, what a mess.  The actor is called Freddie Fox and both first name and last name are lies!  Oh, I know, does anyone remember the US movie of 1980,""FAME""?  And Paul McCrane played the young, sad, gay boy mooning over the comedian boy?  Paul McCrane when he still had hair (big, permed. Bozo hair) and his name was Montgomery?  They should have called this show, The Mystery of Paul McCrane.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NV9KM6QOCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077PBPVE#wasThisHelpful","R3NV9KM6QOCZ","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Celia Fremlin was one of the word's great mystery writers and she is too little known today, but fifty years ago she was acclaimed around the world for her suspenseful, yet often hilarious novels detailing London domestic life.  I don't remember many of her male characters but she was wonderful with women, and her novels show us a world of put-upon women having to deal with the ignorance of society and the general cussedness of men.  I was about to say she was the UK version of America's Charlotte Armstrong, but Armstrong did not concentrate quite as much on the torments of family life as did Fremlin.  The Trouble Makers brings us close into a neighborhood apparently populated with women who don't much care for their husbands, to the point that, to a modern reader, it isn't quite clear why they don't divorce the SOBs and move on.  But perhaps in those days the institution of marriage was worshiped with more fervor, and the institution of divorce perhaps not quite so practiced.All the women on the block look down on poor Mary Prescott, whose husband Alan is mean and fierce with her, critical about everything, able to silence her with a single dark glance or if something is wrong with his dinner.  Our main character, Katharine, has gone back to work part-time but is still trying to raise three daughters all under ten, and to please her husband Stephen, a cold fish almost as trying as Alan Prescott.  The main entertainment the female characters have is getting together and discussing how awful their husbands are.  Katharine is bright enough to realize that there are less despairing ways to spend one's time but somehow the pleasures of gossip and community have their places in what is otherwise a doleful life.  Every moment of every day is awful for these women, and turning the pages one learns more about how to light a fire, how to ruin a pudding, how to stop your child from crying while swotting over 9 year old exams, how to light a Guy Fawkes firework--all these purely English details which will leave you perfectly happy you don't live there--or maybe you didn't live there in 1963.  Suddenly Mary's friends realize that she has become obsessed by a dark man in a raincoat haunting the neighborhood and trailing her in the local ""building site"" (a vacant lot) and the whole thing ends up in a tremendous climax in the very last lines of the novel.In one scene a braggart housewife invites Katharine and Stephen and another couple to dinner and tells them that the splendid meal she's just served  was made up of odds an ends she found in the larder.  The husbands turn to their wives accusingly, asking them why can't they be more like Stella.""Stephen and Mr. Plumber both nodded at Stella in admiring agreement, and Katharine succeeded in hiding her total disbelief.  Fresh prawns--button mushrooms--thin strips of veal wrapped round black olives--these are not the sort of items a housewife's eye lights on when she looks round her larder to see what she's got.  It would take a lunatic to believe it--or someone else's husband.""Celia Fremlin won the Edgar for best mystery of the year in 1960 for her masterpiece The Hours Before Dawn (her first mystery, though apparently there was an nearlier ""straight"" novel which I would love to read, sort of a Nancy Mitfordish book), and she lived on to a great age (94!) but by that time her books had largely gone out of print, and all three of her own children had died before her, which I always think is so sad!  Anyhow once you start the habit with Celia Fremlin you will always be reading and rereading a handful of her early novels--her first 5, or 6, or 7.  Fans still debate whether the decline began with POSSESSION or with PRISONERS BASE---somewhere in there she wasn't so scary and her characters were not so amusing.  I imagine it's hard to take this all in, for you newbies who haven't read Fremlin, but at her best she could be laugh out loud funny at the very same time as she's making you uneasy and looking over your shoulder to see if a dark man in a raincoat is slouching behind you, his face unreadable but aglitter with menace.  And why is the pair of scissors missing from its drawer?","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SK6VVZX1I3WN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000X9UO3Q#wasThisHelpful","R1SK6VVZX1I3WN","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, the theme song has got to be one of the catchiest tracks Gary Lewis and the Playboys ever laid down.  I never heard it before, but now it's in my head day and night and I wake up singing it, even from little catnaps.  That would be enough to make Way Way Out one of the top movies of 1966, but on top of it you have Jerry Lewis in a truly splendid performance, one in which he seems totally generous to his costars, allowing each to have a chance to shine, and as another reviewer mentioned, he's just as good in the ordinary moments as in his demento slapstick ones (which actually I have some problems with ordinarily)--he was a star I despised as a kid, couldn't understand why my parents adored him, what a ego-bound goofball, and yet as I see his movies today none is without interest and I can admire his skill and his power.He actually looks kind of sexy in this, even in the bizarro astronaut costumes they give him, including those yellow satin lounging pajamas astronauts wear on the moon--satin with what look like hundreds of tiny bugle beads sewn across the chest and down the forearms, perhaps to beef up the beefcake factor.  Connie Stevens, his female opposite number, wears a hot pink minidress and a multicolored striped bodice with it, when she and Jerry entertain their Russian cosmonaut friends, played by Dick Shawn (another one I couldn't stomach as a boy) and Anita Ekberg with chocolate colored hair, who enters the space house in a one piece swimsuit made of white lyrca and a lot of anticipation....  She tumbles to the ground and asks if she could sleep there to annoy Dick Shawn.  Forgot to mention that most of the furniture is made up of transparent pillows, like beach balls you could blow up and seal off.  The designers must have been very influenced by Pop Art and Andy Warhol's futuristic fantasies--there's a wide screen TV in every bedroom blasting in earth signals--westerns, Frankenstein--a TV framed in classy wood frame as though it were a living painting, and the primitive remote Jerry plays with is like a miniature cash register or abacus with huge buttons to drag six inches down into their slots to change the channel.Plus, you have Dennis Weaver (as the previous astronaut) gone to seed, ""gone native"" in his long sojourn on the moon.  I wonder if Duncan Jones or whoever wrote that movie ""Moon"" with Sam Rockwell, saw Way Way Out, or maybe this is just part of a long line of films about how lonely it must be on the moon and how it could turn men mad! Anyway Dennis Weaver out Dennis Hoppers Dennis Hopper in his totally seedy, weird performance as ""Hoffman,"" for which he should have won the Oscar.  He filed off his upper and lower teeth to give him that edge of madness, the kind that Antonin Artaud displayed in the asylum.  I find it very telling that the official website of the late Dennis Weaver omits this movie entirely from the star's filmography, while including even TV commercials and guest spots on ""That Girl"" and the like.  And yet they would prefer to pretend Dennis never ""went there"" as he did in Way Way Out.  This is like the latterday Pat Boone pretending he never acted in the lewd Vincente Minnelli innuendofest that was ""Goodbye Charlie.""  People!  Wake up!  Be proud of the time you sawed of our teeth and acted stoned and morose and needy.  It may never happen again!Anyhow, Anita Ekberg says she'll sleep on the couch and skeptical Connie Stevens (actually quite good in this movie, with some complicated scenes to play) says, ""OK, I'll fetch you a pillow, and how many blankets do you like, one or two?""  And Anita tosses back her chocolate hair and gargles, ""No blankets, just a pillow.""  Then the Russians make space vodka using capsules and water and everyone has a Russian party on the moon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JN21A0OITAJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0029LX16S#wasThisHelpful","R3JN21A0OITAJU","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grabbed this book for a reason: I'm from Long Island myself and as an adult in California I'm haunted by the memories of the houses I saw and visited as a child, a teen, a young adult on the North Shore of Suffolk County.  I wonder whose house I was in; I wonder if they're still standing, and the evocative cover of Long Island Modernism 1930-1980 promised the exact answers to many of my idlest daydreams.  Caroline Rob Zaleski's history is, for the most part, exceedingly well researched and imaginative; she has a huge sympathy for modernism in this era in which it has been reviled and, we see in the text, continually defaced and overbuilt.  In some cases, like the famous Frank Lloyd Wright houses, the owners came to realize they were living more in a cathedral setting than anything homey, and covertly added toilets and the like, and central heating.  The earliest house in the book had only a water pump outside the main structure to provide water for all of its residents.  And we see that some modernist architects called for vast rooms impossible to heat in Long Island's frigid winters, though they must have been lovely in early October and mid-to-late April.Long Island in this period was a strange combination of farm and beach land, and growing suburban kitsch and sprawl.  Wealthy people came to live right next to the poor settlers, and often the latter turned to serving the former, like the society pictured in the 1960s sitcom Green Acres.  (Or its converse, The Pruitts of Southampton with Phyllis Diller.)  As Rob Zaleski shows, the great architects came and saw and conquered, more or less, though neighborhood associations and the like sometimes vetoed innovative plans because they were just too weird.  My town, Smithtown, prided itself on its colonial atmosphere, having been founded in 1664 by a man who made a wager against native peoples that he could ride around huge chunks of forest on the back of a wild bull; and whatever land he traversed would belong henceforward to him and his descendants.  A giant statue of a bull greets visitors to Smithtown at the junction of Route 25 ad 25A, anatomically correct, and in my day it was the sport of the high school kids to paint it genitalia red and green at Christmastime, orange and black at Halloween, green for St Patrick's Day etc.  Most of the houses and buildings were generic, split-level ""Shingle Style"" cookie cutter schlock, those that were not 300 year old former blacksmith shops, but now and again we would be greeted by something authentically Deco or Bauhaus in our midst, a quiet home, sprawling at one end or the other, with nothing cute about it, nor ornamental.  I remember one house in my neighborhood, on Eckernkamp Drive between River Heights and Landing Avenue, nearby Sweetbriar Park and the Nissequogue River, that was just amazing, as if Mies Van Der Rohe lived there, and of course he didn't, but who did?  Since no kids were ever seen entering or exiting the house, we had no plausible way of finding out.Rob Zaleski has organized her survey according to architect, and each chapter gives us the accomplishments of a great visionary, so  that perhaps individuals who made only one cool house might get lost in the shuffle a bit; at any rate, it's an effective method of getting the reader through vast quantities of social history.  In architecture as perhaps in no other art one sees the power of money, vast quantities of it, to make a change.  Perhaps it took less money to build the Conger Goodyear House in Old Westbury than it did to construct Versailles, and perhaps the Goodyear house is a bit less fussy, but both exude the solidity of state powere and perhaps something of its woeful playfulness.  A prewar photo of the Goodyear shows us the ""long gallery,"" with its barrage of then contemporary pictures lining the wall as seen from the lanai, a splendid Picasso guitar, a Matisse, a Segonzac, Cezanne's ""Peasant in a Blue Smock"" winding up with a Salvador Dali so new it must have been still wet.  Rob Zaleski takes her vocabulary for discussion of each house with the terms the architect or the family used, so a sentence studded with quotations appears quite often, there's one on page 140 in which we are told we are ""looking through the `long gallery' toward the `sunroom.'""  It took me awhile to understand the reason for all this internal quotation, but ""now"" it's quite ""comprehensible.""Many of the families remain colorless, perhaps because they have watchful descendants, but Rob Zaleski is capable of Answered Prayers-like innuendo which spices up her style from time to time.  Her pages on ""Villa Rielle"" (Rielle Hunter, anyone?), the cozy mansion of the playgirl baroness Gabriele Lagerwall in Lloyd Harbor speak volumes about the dissolute lifestyle of the very rich and those who invent perfumes like ""White Shoulders.""  These people often knew exactly what they wanted and their architects struggled to take care of their demands.  Richard Neutra added a hydraulic contraption to one side of the bed in John Nicholas and Anne Brown's Fishers Island home, because Anne loved to smoke in bed and wanted an ashtray type thing that would descend into the servants quarters so they could clean it and return it to their mistress' bedside table.  Other colorful clients included a Westhampton hotelier who had Charles Addams come in and create a large mural over the bar in which the Addams Family characters went fishing and swimming in the ocean outside the Dune Club, and a Hempstead theater mogul who built a grand modernist movie palace at exactly the wrong time, commercially, to do such a thing, but who managed to scare up Edward Steichen and Carl Sandburg to attend the opening,  By the end of the book these architects are working on large somewhat brutalist state universities and other public buildings and some of the fun goes out of the writing, but all in all this is a fantastic read and even better, the book benefits from the services of a fantastic photo editor.  Simply put, everything you want to see that's mentioned in the text, is right there, in a gorgeous period photo.  It beats the internet!Finally the book intrigues in its several accounts of the US sculptor Mary Callery--I've heard of many artists but never of this one--and Rob Zaleski makes a case that she is dreadfully under recognized today, whereas sixty years ago she was one of the leading (I was about to say ""female"" but strike that) artists in the USA and what we see of her work is fantastically period and more.  What gives, when someone mentioned in the same breath as Calder, Noguchi, Brancusi, not once but all of the time in the 1950s, gets completely forgotten?The house I was looking for is not in this book, sadly enough, so if any of my readers know Smithtown, and know the house on Eckerkamp between River Heights and Landing Avenue, right before that curve onto the bridge over the Nissequogue, and perhaps you have kids and the present owners have kids, have them mingle and get back to me with, who was the architect and how did he come to build that house in Smithtown of all places?  I looked it up on Google Earth and I swear I saw some kids playing in the shadows.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21LBDK3Z9I2O4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393733157#wasThisHelpful","R21LBDK3Z9I2O4","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a box of Sabudas for Christmas and spent my first days of the new year trying to decide which among my friends (nearly 2,500 on Facebook, many of whom I actually know in real life) deserved these cute little suckers.It was agonizing for awhile, then I realized there was another way out--order another box, or maybe a small case.  Six come in a box, and I had at least three dozen friends who are softies for daffodils.  Tragedy!  Amazon was stone cold out of em and didn't know when they would get more.  My rep said to try MOMA instead, but have you ever tried ordering something from MOMA when you live thousands of miles away?  Their customer service is fine, that's not the problem, but they send you the daffodil boxes in clouds of organic styrofoam....  Literally enough to coat the whole floor of my San Francisco apartment in flat white, a white that rustles in your ear when you try to pick up a few pieces off the carpet, the white that chokes up the Tyson vacuum when you try to suck it up tubewise.  It became a challenge to find the boxes of cards amid the inundation of white flyaway foamcore pieces, and this was a challenge my three cats were happy to meet.  Whomp!  There goes one into the box, panicking when he can't find his way out.  Whomp!  There goes the littlest one, the one who likes to play with new toys.  To her, foamcore's like catnip.

"Like many readers today, I was hooked by Patti Smith's memoir of a few years back, very moved by its razor-sharp recall and the generosity with which she was able to look back at a very distant time, acknowledging the heartbreak and the pain of some of the scenes she found herself in, but in general compassionate enough to see the beauty even in the darkness.  And I kept thinking as I was reading JUST KIDS, what old-time book does this remind me of?  Finally after a two hour hunt through my bookcases, I remembered this book, A BUNDLE OF TIME, the memoirs of Harriet Cohen.  A friend had pressed it on my some years back when I told him I had never heard of Harriet Cohen, and now she has become a watchword to me, a sign of utter sympathy and high culture, like the code of recognition between strangers that E M Forster writes about in ""Two Cheers for Democracy.""  ""I believe in aristocracy... -- if that is the right word, and if a democrat may use it,"" he averred.  ""Not an aristocracy of power, but of the sensitive, the considerate... Its members are to be found in all nations and classes, and all through the ages--there is a secret understanding between them when they meet. ""For me that's what connects Smith and Cohen, but I should back up and explain that she was a British pianist, quite beautiful, who knew all the great modernists in England and abroad in the 20s and 30s at least, which is the period she managed to write about fullest in this book, published posthumously and cobbled together from scraps by the publishers shortly after her untimely death in 1967.  You can hear her piano playing on Youtube, and it will not be to everybody's taste; she has little power and often seems like a dilettante or a ghost, preferring lovely little things with too many or too few notes.  But if you are in the mood, she is completely convincing and you can see why many of the great artists of her day wanted her to premiere their new works.  And she can write like a dream!  And she was movie star beautiful, there is not a photo in existence which shows her as anything but a goddess.  Her career was stalled by anti-semitism, or ""racialism"" as it was then called, in the period between the wars she comes to realize the dangers of Nazi ideology years before the dopey politicians of England and France.  She was an activist even though her life seems otherwise comfortable and wealthy from the start, oh, and I forgot to say that her gender probably also hindered her from full acclaim, for many of the conductors for whom she might have worked dismissed her as a sort of musical Anais Nin with wrists too fragile to play her instrument properly.Her best trait in writing is her ability to draw the reader into the innumerable social and aesthetic scenes of the day.  She knew Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Bax, Holst and scores of British musicians--the book jumps forward in time a little to present accounts of her friendships with (and letters from) the somewhat younger Britten and Tippett.  She traveled widely and met Manuel de Falla, Sibelius, Stravinsky, Ravel, Richard Strauss, musicians of dozens of lands.  And she knew the writers too.  She was a particular pet of Arnold Bennett, H G Wells, Somerset Maugham, George Bernard Shaw, and she spills dozens of anecdotes about them, not just charming but really incisive.  She is the sort of voice, like Patti Smith, that you want to hear about everybody from--she inspires trust in the reader.  I learned more about Einstein (yes, Einstein!) from this book than in the multi-volume biographies on the man.  In a way, a cynic could find this penchant for famous names amusing, like the second act number Judy Holliday sang in Bells are Ringing (""Drop That Name!"") but Cohen was there, and invariably she saw the tiny things that make each human soul memorable, unique.  Karsavina, Horowitz, Busoni, Ethe; Smyth, they swim through these pages like beautiful jeweled fish.Nobody, not even Patti Smith, can give us a complex cameo like Harriet Cohen can.  Here's one taken more or less tat random, plunging my finger into the book the one might consult the I Ching: ""Lytton Strachey had wanted me to meet Ottoline Morrell almost as soon as we became acquainted, and I was anxious to do so, having seen this astonishing creature only from a distance.  In her enormous hats, swathed in pale, floating, chiffons--the tinkling of jewels at her ears like sounds of pagodas, somehow she called up unimaginable delights even if the beholder were only a woman.  She had a proud head that reared like that of some wild creature in a forest, one awaited a neigh.  When she gave her hands in greeting, she gave herself.  I adored her on sight.""Gershwin wrote ""Lady Be Good"" for Cohen.  Rilke seems like he was in love with her.  Thornton Wilder told her that she was the true ""woman of Andros.""  But one reads ""A Bundle of Time"" for Cohen's writing, its firm, yet delicate tracery of the varieties of human experience.  ""Talking of Bartok,"" she will write, ""Gray once described him to me as 'completely inhuman.'""  (It is like Cohen to remember and credit those friends of hers who came up with striking remarks.)  ""It is true that his very appearance suggested pure spirit, the intensity of his gaze, that slender, later-attenuated form--'like gold to aery thinness beaten' as Donne had it--gave him an almost diaphanous quality.  But the reserve, the aloofness that I had expected was simply not there, as he sat laughing at the small supper party after the concert.""  The reference to Donne is so Harriet!  As is the twist, the narrative surprise of the slender beaten gold apparition becoming full human through the power of laughter.  My copy of the book is marked now with dozens of colorful post-its marking her wise and witty remarks, but I could sit here till 2014 and not get them all down.  You must read this book and let it change your way of seeing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OHUTVRFD2GEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0571085741#wasThisHelpful","R3OHUTVRFD2GEP","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our book club decided to read this book for its debut meeting, and we met Saturday afternoon, each carrying a copy of Calasso--it is a strangely heavy book, with deep satiny paper that convey sort of well the dozens of period visuals from Ingres and Manet and Delacroix, et cetera, but lugging it around becomes a chore.  In addition, the manner in which Calasso constructs his chronicle is, as others have testified, byzantine as a shaggy dog story but ten times as portentous.  We had started the book hoping to read a biography of Baudelaire, but that was not to be.  It is rather a book of emblems, each page turning inward to reveal another charming anecdote about life between the Empires, and the continual struggle of men to become number one in French Parnassus.  At the center of them all, we find eventually, not Baudelaire, but Saunte0Beueve, the professional journalist for whom Calasso has nothing good to say, who wrote long articles on culture that apoeared every Monday morning for decades, who boasted of his election to the Academie Francaise and who relished his position as gatekeeper to culture.To him Baudelaire was a rogue whose Paris Spleen and a few of the poems from Les Fleurs du Mal were works of genius, but on the whole, like Bartleby, he would prefer not to.  Calasso bypasses the discussion for an extended side trip in which he tracks Sainte-Beuve's hilarious response to Flaubert's overheated flop Salammbo, the successor to Madame Bovary and different from it as night from day--well, actually, Calasso reveals, they are more or less the same book, one told in the modernist realism Saint-Beuve valued highly, and the other a novel of a civilization (ancient Carthage) which Flaubert retreated to  in an attempt to keep his own interest in writing flagging, like the modernday pornaddict who must keep raising the stakes to feel any excitement whatsoever.  Saint-Beuve spread out the attack over three long, delicious Monday articles and oh how Flaubert burned!  When Baudelaire wrote privately to Sainte-Beuve to remonstrate, he took an unusual tactic to restore Flaubert's place as the first writer of France, but I mustn't spoil what all of us in the book club saw as the turning point of the story.Indeed Calasso himself reminds me of Sainte-Beuve.  he is definitely the man who knows everything, as my friend Brandon asserted approvingly last night at the ATA.  He has every fact at his fingertips, and is especially eloquent on why Sainte-Beuve spoke of ""Kamchatka"" as the far-off, apocalyptic land on which Baudelaire laid his ""folie,""  That is, through able deconstruction Calasso brings out all the edges and shadows with which educated French men of culture would have seen the terrain of KAmchatka, its position in regards to Asia and Russia, its culture and even its shape, and all this im the service of establishing Sainte-Beuve's own anxiety and perplexity about where, finally, to ""place"" Charles Baudelaire, the disturber of modern life.  And Roberto Calasso's a little like that too.  Though he seems like an pantomath, wise and assured, there are some storms he cannot weather.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK9W2TQCRPW2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374183341#wasThisHelpful","RK9W2TQCRPW2A","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book basically because of pressure from Amazon, or maybe pressure isn't the mot juste, but you know when it tells you that ""People who Bought this Book also Bought,"" and it shows you four photos of other book jackets?  Well, this one had pictures of the recent biographies of Henry Fonda, Dana Andrews, and Elizabeth Montgomery from Bewitched and since I owned all of them, I figure, why not join the other ""people"" in question and get this book too.  The funny thing is that, despite all expectations, this book was actually the best, by far, of the four biographies.I have to agree with the other reviewer who praised Spoto for his restraint here.  Yes, Rachel Kempson married Michael Redgrave even after he told her upfront he would always be gay and would always be looking for outside affairs with men.  And yes, Vanessa went and did the same thing with her first husband Tony Richardson, who wound up tragically dying of AIDS long after Vanessa had gone off him.  Previous reviewer praised Spoto's refusal to speculate on the connection between these two marriages but of course it is exactly the heart of the family narrative that we are given, like a hinge.  It all seems to be about, well, did Vanessa know about her dad, or know about Tony?  Spoto can't say.  That's all right.  It is a puzzling coincidence perhaps, and makes me look closer into the private lives of Liam Neeson and whoever it is that Joely married because three times is the charm.  Be that as it may, one wishes that Rachel and Michael, who are so big in this story, were better represented in the movies than they appear to be.  We hear much about how great Rachel was as Volumnia and Dorcas and other minor Shakespeare parts, and how towering a Lear and Macbeth was Michael, but without a filmed record, it's hard to judge.  I did love Rachel Kempson in The Jewel in the Crown, but I get her mixed up in my mind with that UK actress who often plays Emma Thompson's mother because, well, because she *is* Emma Thompson's mother.The financials are given here, frankly, and they give a throughline to a complicated story: how Michael and Rachel had no equity really, because even when they were momentarily rich, people wouldn't give them credit because as actors they had no fixed source of income.  I hope Liam Neeson is managing better than his in laws' family, otherwise the next step is invariably a theatrical boarding house where you have to share the kidneys and mash with a table teeming with ambitious understudies and faded hasbeens still looking for their spotlight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MWCL2S3BU3Y4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307720144#wasThisHelpful","R3MWCL2S3BU3Y4","A30TK6U7DNS82R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30TK6U7DNS82R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For 40 years, I used a  ""double"" SS sink but just had the kitchen remodel and got one of the newer ""D"" shaped sinks along with a dishwasher. I saw this item and read the reviews.  My sink measures 21 1/4 side to side x 18 7/8 front to back.  I found many items( especially plastics)  are not dishwasher safe so I needed something to let those items ""drip dry"" after hand washing. It may cover my drain by an inch or so......but doesn't impede water flow or access to my disposal at all.Mine came completely coated in a black plastic type material with a rubber cover on each foot.  Yes the ""front feet"" are slightly higher than the back as most ""D"" sinks are made angled toward the drain because of it's placement. THIS IS NORMAL ON THE NEWER SINKS.  Mine sits perfectly flat in the sink.  I like the black as I know over time it will not show stains or rust from hard water like the white one could. Great for rinsing out morning coffee or tea cups or those plastic items you cant put in a dishwasher.  Very sturdy and will hold any sized pot or cast iron cookware without a problem.

"This Extra large mat was purchased not to be used as a drying mat, but a sink protector. Kitchen was remodeled and installed is a  deep 21""L x19 W ""D"" shaped sink with the drain set to the  rear of the sink.  No one makes a sink mat large enough to cover the bottom. When I saw this, I decided to get the 2 pack so my sink bottom is protected and I have one matt I can use for drying.  I flipped the mat over so the ribs are on the bottom of the sink for water flow which works great. I made  a circular cut out ( see photo) for the drain/disposal.  Mat also seems to cuts down on the splash back from the spigot I use to experience.  Had spaghetti and the mat didn't absorb or get stains from tomato sauce.

"The ONLY chicken stock base I use.  Been using it since the 1970's.  Tried other brands, but they just don't have the rich chicken flavor that Spice Island manages to capture.  I start with 4-6 containers ( 32oz each) of REDUCED SODIUM chicken broth, add the vegetables and simmer. Then I pressure cook chicken thighs and legs in a cup or so of the broth with the skins left on. Once that's done and the chicken ( and mushed up skin) is added to the vegetables, I  add the chicken stock base until I'm satisfied with the overall flavor.  Sometimes  I add a whole jar, sometimes only half. Depends on the quality and fat content of the chicken. Roasters are better than Fryers due to more fat.  Anyway,  If you start with the LOW SODIUM or SODIUM FREE broth, your end product won't be overly salty as most stock bases are really salty to begin with.

"Gave these a shot.... We are lake property owners and  Seagulls seem to love to sit on our pontoon boat and make ""deposits"" all over the canvas.  So we've been using these mylar silver windsocks to keep them away.......AND THEY WORK!!! . We've been using ones from another vendor here on Ebay selling similar ones. Those had some issues with construction, namely, no end swivels to attach it to anything. But I rigged those up and used them for 2 summers until one of them was destroyed by 45mph winds from a freak thunderstorm.These came quickly and I was quite pleased at the weight of the mylar strips and length.  It's quite a heavyweight. But upon closer inspection, I have my reservations.  Both of them had issues with the grommets punched through the upper sleeve...... where the string attaches. Both socks had sharp edges left from the grommets that weren't punched closed completely with the ends folded over. So I got some pliers and did that. One of the windsocks sleeves at the top wasn't closed together at the bottom. Someone forgot to tape it. So I did that.  The previous windsock used heavyweight fishing line........these have white nylon type cord. Swivel & clips on these are mickey mouse and thin.  I'll have to change those out or I think any kind of strong wind could deform and stretch them out.....and there goes the windsock.

"Temperature test: To test how well the adhesive stood up to heat (it doesn't get that cold here), I put one of the clips on the metal frame of a south-facing window that gets sun for most of the day. After many days in the 80s and 90s, I could detect no deterioration of the adhesive.Cord size: The clips are seem designed for cords that are 1/16-inch to 3/16-inch, the former being the gap in the resting state (narrower cords will slip out) and the latter being the widest I could get the clip to open.  The body of the clip is 3/8-inch wide, allowing the cord easy play (repositioning).Supported Weight: The specifications don't give a weight supported. However, the advice ""1 clip for every two feet of lights"" implies that these clips won't hold much weight. Wrong. These clips will support *far* more than that. This is important should various critters see your string of lights as providing an alternative climbing route. I would expect that these clips would have no problem with the weight of a rat or squirrel (extrapolation, not experimentation).""Transparent"": The clips themselves are transparent but the adhesive strips themselves are white. This is OK if you are putting the clips on a white background, which is what is pictured on the package. However, when mounted on other color backgrounds, the white ""pops"" out and even makes the transparent clip more noticeable.Horizontal runs: The adhesive strips are rectangles that don't match the contours of the clips. When the clip is installed to hold a cord horizontally and the clip is facing up (natural positioning), there is a pocket about 1/8-inch tall above the strip (and behind the top of the clip) that can collect debris. The adhesive strip must be installed length-wise behind the clip and thus when the clip is horizontal, the pull (release) tab sticks out to one side. To my eye, this looks very wrong. However, it can be mitigated if you are willing to plan carefully enough to ensure having a light positioned in front of it.-- Douglas B.

"The ""easy set"" mechanism is finicky. When it works, it is truly ""easy set"". But I have encountered extended periods where I pull down the easy-set handle and the trap refuses to stay set. I have been unable to determine what the difference is (and I am mechanically inclined). What *tends* to work for me during such episodes is to hold the easy-set handle down and use my other hand to lift each of the doors in turn to fully-open: This is only a fraction of an inch higher, but it lets the cables go slack. When I let the doors settle back into position (with the cable taut), this usually fixes the problem, and if not, repeat of this does.Advantages in locating the trap:--------------------------------I use live traps for mice and rats. While one can be reasonably successful setting traps for squirrels and chipmunks in relatively open spaces, my experience has been to be successful with mice and rats, you need to locate the trap in sheltered locations. This poses two basic problems:1). You need to be able either to position the trap without triggering it, or set the trigger with the trap in position. The trigger on the small Havahart traps are so sensitive that they will be set off by even slow movement into position (no sudden changes in direction or speed, no bumps). This model is no exception. However, the Easy-set handle makes it easier than sibling models to reset in a location that is awkward or hard-to-reach.2). There needs to be suitable clearance around the trap for the mechanism to move to release doors. The classic Havahart design has a rod that swings out and up from the side of the trap, requiring too much space to be located behind furniture (such as a couch). On this model, you need very little clearance on the sides, but you do need clearance above the trap for the handle to swing through. This is a potential problem: Years ago, I had rats in my attic and the trap was constantly being triggered without catching anything. I borrowed a surveillance camera and what I saw was that the rats, being cautious, would climb on top of various platforms to look and smell for danger. They used that Havahart live trap as such an observation platform, and while getting on top (before venturing in) they were triggering the trap -- sometimes by bumping the mechanism and sometimes simply by jiggling the trap. Putting something like a single sheet of newspaper over the top of the trap *might* discourage this behavior (It didn't impede the trap springing shut in my experiments).Construction Quality--------------------Excellent. Heavier duty than my earlier model (with which I never had a problem).One issue: There doesn't seem to be a reasonable way to replace the cables (between the doors and the lever) if such should become necessary (each cable terminates inside a part riveted to the door).Issues with baiting the trap----------------------------If you read the instructions and/or watch the videos, there is very little about baiting the trap for mice and rats, yet this is one of the most difficult aspects of setting up this type of trap. With a one-door model, you can put the bait on a tray in the back of the trap (enticing the critter to climb over the trigger plate to get to it). Even this is not simple because the tray tends to spill if you need to maneuver the trap into a hard-to-reach location. With a two-door trap for rats and mice, the only real choice is to suspend the bait above the trigger plate -- this encourages the critter to put its full weight on the trigger plate, to jiggle it, and if this isn't enough, the additional weight of some of the bait falling on the plate can help. My practice is to use tissue paper to create a small bag holding some nuts or sunflower seeds (remember you want a material that lets the smell of the nuts/seeds reach the critters). On some models, I can push a narrow metal rod from one side of the cage to the other just under its top and suspend the bag from it (the rod passes under the string that ties off the top of the bag). I haven't been able to do this with this model because the clearance between the top plate (with the handle) and the cage's mesh is very narrow -- too narrow for any of the rods I have on hand. I have thought of adding a loop on each side to hold the rod up high enough (using wire, string, cable tie,...). However, for my first deployment, I ran string from the bag through the two holes in the top plate. For me, this is unsatisfactory: The bag doesn't hang as high as it would with a rod, and it took too much readjustment to set up. See photo under ""Product Images from Customers"" (not at the top of the page, but to the right of the beginning of the reviews).For a single-door trap, you can temporarily remove the door at the back of the trap to insert and position the bait. With a two-door trap, both doors are spring loaded -- when your hand is inside the trap, the door is pressing down on your forearm. The pressure is annoying but not painful, but it does impede the free movement of your hand inside the trap. One solution is to latch the door in its open position. The manufacturer provides no instructions on how best to do this, or any mechanism to make it easier. What I did was slide a metal rod across the cage just under the door, using the mesh to hold it in place.OK for long-tail critters-------------------------When the doors snap shut, there is a fraction of an inch at the bottom left for the animal's tail. Note: if you trigger an empty trap, momentum takes the door all the way to the bottom, but I stuck various small objects there to confirm that it would crush or hold something similar to a rat's tail (my neighborhood has Dusky-footed Woodrats and their tails are very long -- 150% of body length).Explanation of my rating/my priorities--------------------------------------I down-rated this product primarily because the ""easy set"" mechanism failed to engage too often. I saw the advantage of that mechanism as being better suited for hard-to-reach locations. With earlier models, one often couldn't maneuver the trap into such locations without triggering it, and resetting it in place was difficult/unpleasant. If the easy-set mechanism were reliable, it would have eliminated much of this problem of putting traps in such locations.A lesser part of my down-rating this model was the difficulty noted above about baiting. This review is targeted at a typical consumer, not the professional trapper, and thus *their* ease-of-use is important. Many homeowners are unlikely to have readily available the metal rods I mentioned above. Many will not have the mechanical experience to quickly recognize what should be done. Tiny improvements in the design and instructions could have alleviated this issue.Caveat on ""Live Trapping""-------------------------Note: Many people mistakenly think that live-trapping an animal and releasing it in a distant location is humane. I have been told my knowledgeable people that it typically isn't. If you are releasing an animal in a location suitable for that species, other members of that species have almost certainly claimed it as their territory and will attempt to drive off the intruder, with injury or death (immediate or deferred) for one or both. Consequently, there are often laws against relocation of wild animals (the bottom of the product's instructions advise the purchaser of this possibility, but without explanation).I use live traps to relocate mice and rats from inside my house to my yard immediately outside. The rats occasionally find a way into my attic and after I plug the hole, I use live traps to catch any that might remain in the attic. Also, I get mice in my house when my cat get irritated at being ignored for too long -- he zips out to the yard, grabs a mouse and drops it in the middle of the living room. His notion of ""quality time"" with me is not catching the mouse, but the cooperative chase. Sometimes I catch the mouse, sometimes not. However, I do know where mice like to hide and I leave a live trap there. Aside: Before you say anything negative about my cat's behavior, recognize that his need for ""quality time"" is part of what makes him so lovable.Live traps can be useful in the office as well as the home. I once worked in a building that had an infestation of rats -- they had relocated from an adjacent building that was being torn down after sitting empty for a decade. One morning as I was about to sit down at my desk, I noticed a large snap-wire rat trap where I normally put my feet. I negotiated with the Facilities Dept to let me use a live trap in my office area (and save my toes).-- Douglas B.

"The primary test of this product is how well it lasts and performs when much of the water on the windshield is sprayed up from the road surface and thus is contaminated with dirt and oil and being rubbed across the windshield by the wipers. I live in a locale where winter is the rainy season and unfortunately this review sample arrived two days after what was likely the last non-trivial rain for many months so I have been unable to do this primary test before this review was due.I use this type of product outside the rainy season because it makes cleaning the windows faster and better. Since I try to park under trees for shade, bird droppings are not just inevitable, but almost immediate. And then there is dust from unending construction in the area. So far, this has been doing an excellent job. For comparative testing I left some window areas untreated -- a strip on the far side of the windshield and on the rear window, and I treated only one of my station wagon's back panel windows. Substantial positive difference.Application was easy. From the instructions, I expected a significant haze to form -- and be buffed out -- but there was a barely perceptible one (not complaining -- it means that there is little product being wasted).The cap on the bottle has two minor problems:First, it pours sloppily. This is not a problem when treating a windshield because you don't need to be precise in wetting the cloth. However, if you want to do a small job, such as the outside mirrors,...Second, that the cap is to be pulled up to open the center hole is not obvious to some -- it takes more force than people expect and the label on the cap is difficult to spot and almost impossible to read (small print, minimal elevation produces negligible contrast in many lighting conditions). Consequently, some may treat it as a cap to be unscrewed.--- Douglas B.

"I used this on a passenger car to finish drying it.* It had more than enough capacity to complete the task itself. It had excellent absorbency, quickly picking up the beads/droplets.When I tried to wring it out before hanging it up to dry, I got very little water out of it. It was at the point where it had absorbed enough water to *start* to impede its picking up all the water during the first pass, but it was still far from soaking wet. I put it through a brief spin in my washing machine, but it was still more moist than I expected.  Since wring-and-reuse was not important to me I didn't experiment further, but if it is to you, you should look to other reviews.My perspective is that strong absorbency is a perfectly acceptable tradeoff for not being easy to wring-out.I didn't find the pockets to be useful when wiping down horizontal surfaces (hood, roof). Pushing the towel around with my hands in the pockets was little different from just have the hands on the back of the towel. In fact the latter often offered more comfortable positioning of the hands. Since I was using the towel on a regular passenger car, I can't say how useful the pockets would have been on a taller vehicle with side panels to dry (a van, a bigger SUV, ...).I have used this towel twice during the time allotted for submitting reviews.====* The car's finish was still in very good conditions, so most of the water ran off, leaving only smaller bead/droplets.

"Note: Amazon has combined the reviews for all the different colors of this product. The colored versions have lower ratings, especially the Burgundy one which has many reports that it bleeds badly. I have the white ones. Amazon also lists this product under ""Automotive"", which may also bear on the reviews.This is a very thin towel, but turns out to be very absorbent. For 1-3 person-days of dishes that had been given time to drain/air-dry on a rack, a single towel easily handled removing the remaining water, and did so with a single pass of the towel, and seemed that it could have handled more. Being thin may be an advantage because the towel more easily conforms to the contours of the dish, glass or utensil being dried. And they are easier to wring out. They *might* also air-dry more quickly, but I didn't do that experiment -- my climate and usage pattern allows these and my other dish towels enough time to air-dry.For those who care about such things (I don't, but know people who do), this towel is smaller than (my) traditional dish towels.

"The ""Lay-Flat technology"" is better described as the hose relaxing to flatten out on the ground. This seems to happen best when the hose is largely extended. The last remnants of the loops flatten out into meanders. If you are dragging the hose and there are still full coils, those coils seem to even out in both size and spacing, unlike many of my other hoses, and this may be a result of the hose ""relaxing"" into this state.Several of the other reviews here report that they had a problem with kinking. I have seen no evidence of situations that lead to that. It may be because I have been using the hose in warm weather (mid-70s to low-80s). Or it may be my usage pattern. When I want to extend the hose to a set position, I don't drag it, but carry and uncoil. When I am dragging a hose during watering, I am moving slowly, which gives the ""Lay-Flat technology"" time to balance out the coils and avoid the situations that I see leading to kinking with other hoses.When I am done using the hose, it has curled nicely -- it has memory of being curled, but little bias about the diameter (I have done a medium and large diameter).The female hose connector is wonderfully large. I had no problem gripping it even with muddy hands.Experience: I have used (deployed) this hose about 6 times in the month I have had it (I received the product in exchange for an honest, timely review).Update: After just over 2 months a kink developed.-- Douglas B.

"I have had occasional problems when connecting this cable to *one* of my two USB 3.0 external drives, but not to the other. I could see no difference in the micro-B connector on this cable and the one that came with that drive (Seagate). However, it doesn't seat quite as firmly as the cable that came with that drive, but it does seat firmly on my other drive (Western Digital). My current thinking is that the lesser flexibility of this cable (below) results in the connector being pulled ever so slightly out, resulting in a failed connection. Note: It is irrelevant to the purchaser which connector (cable or disk enclosure) is to blame for the loose connection -- the purchaser has to adapt/suffer.The hood on the Micro-B connector is thicker than those on my other Micro-B connectors. The body itself barely thicker, but the plastic inset logo item makes it noticeably thicker. If you have a device where hood clearance is an issue, you should look closely at the picture on the product page. The logo inset starts 3mm from the front edge of the hood and I expect that it can easily be pried out of the hood (typically attached with mediocre glue).----Performance: ExcellentAs a proxy for a direct test of the performance of this cable, I connected it to one of my external disks (Seagate Expansion 2TB Desktop External Hard Drive USB 3.0 (STBV2000100)) and downloaded a 7GB file from that disk (to an internal disk). Using the 4ft USB cable that came with that disk, I saw speeds of 114MB/sec. Replacing that cable with this 6ft cable, I saw speeds of 112 MB/sec. Additional cable length inherently produces some YMMV degradation in performance, and I regard this as excellent. I speculate that some of the negative effects of additional length were offset by the better quality of the cable.----One of my external drives runs off power from the USB connector and I have seen no problems. However, other reviews here stated that they did have problems, so that is something that you (the reader of this review) may want to explore.----Cable size:The cables that came with my USB 3.0 external disks were 3/8-inch and 1/4-inch in diameter (4 foot and 1.5 ft long respectively). This cable is 1/2-inch, indicating it has some combination of larger gauge wires (better transmission) and better insulation (electrical and physical). This cable is substantially stiffer (less flexible) than the thinner ones that came with those drives.----My usage:I move my external drives between several computers and having an additional cable saves me the hassle of plugging/unplugging from the cluttered back panel of my primary deskside computer. However, for a cable that one uses with a laptop and that one throws into a bag, the thinner, more flexible original cable is more convenient for me. Combined with the potential loose fit problems noted in the opening, this product is probably not a good candidate for such situations (but you are also unlikely to want a 6ft cable for such).----Grip: Both connections have on one side a clear plastic rectangle with the ""amazon basics"" logo (see their photo). I am of two minds about this. As a positive, it provides a good visual marker of which side is which (if you can remember). As a negative, it is a bit more slippery (if you have a USB port that is overly tight). And my experience is that that such insets tend to fall out after a year or two (the glue fails), which may not be bad because that leaves the depression for either improved grip or a custom label.-- Douglas B.

"One of the common problems with using an extension cable is that it can expose design limitations of the cable it is being used with. The situation is analogous to household power extension cords: A standard cord may be adequate for a 6ft length to an appliance, but for 50ft, you need a heavy duty cord.Advice: Rather than connecting an extension cable to your existing one, you are often better off replacing a short USB cable with a long-enough one. First, short cables often scrimp on materials to save costs -- they are good enough to work that that length, but not with an extension. Second, connectors typically introduce some YMMV degradation -- a single cable is better than two connected ones.Advice: Don't buy a longer extension cable than you need: Length itself introduces degradation of performance.----Charging cable? Dicey:Other reviews here complain that this is *not* a good charging cable (I didn't test it myself). Many devices that use USB for recharging are capable of drawing 10W (2 Amps), but the USB 3.0 spec is for only 4.5W. Short USB cables, with less resistance, can often accommodate the larger power draws than the spec, whereas a longer cable may not.- Also be aware that the limit may not be in the cable, but in the port supplying the power: Some are designed to only supply the rated power (one of my computers has one USB 2.0 port designed to supply 10W and the rest supply only the specified 2.5W).- Be aware that USB 3.0 ports supply more power by using additional wires within the cable. If the device you are charging uses a USB 2.0 connector, it cannot make use that additional capacity.----My usage: My deskside computer has two USB 3.0 ports that are closely spaced. When I have a flash drive plugged into one of those ports, it blocks the other port. I want to be able to use both ports, one for an external disk and one for a flash drive (both USB 3.0). Having an extension cable also brings out the connector for the flash drive from the back of the computer (in the middle of many cables) to the top-front of the physical desk top -- much more convenient.----Performance: ExcellentAs a proxy for a direct test of the performance of this cable, I connected it to one of my external disks (Seagate Expansion 2TB Desktop External Hard Drive USB 3.0 (STBV2000100)) and downloaded a 7GB file from that disk (to an internal disk). Using the 4ft USB cable that came with that disk, I saw speeds of 114MB/sec. Adding the 9.8 ft (3m) extension cable, I got 108MB/sec (5% decrease) which I regard as excellent, for both the additional length (245%) and the additional connection (between the two cables).Note: I would NOT use this extension cable with an external USB 3.0 disk for the reasons stated in the opening ""Advice"". I used it for testing because it provided the highest transfer rate.----Grip: Both connections have on one side a clear plastic rectangle with the ""amazon basics"" logo (see their photo). I am of two minds about this. As a positive, it provides a good visual marker of which side is which (if you can remember).

"Adjustability: The base is heavy enough that you can easily adjust the gooseneck with a single hand. And the gooseneck more than sturdy enough to stay in position through modest bumps (which also suggests that it is durable).The gooseneck is rubberized: It is easy to grasp and it doesn't show smudges. However, that does mean that the gooseneck has a different (visual) finish than the base and hood -- not something that pops out at me, but more than shown by the product picture here (as of this writing).----The switch is a depression in the front of the base and is not readily visible from various angles, depending on the ambient light. However, for me it didn't need to be: It was right where I expected it to be and visible enough when I looked there. However, the switch is discreet enough that it is largely invisible for someone not looking for it, that is, as home-decor, it doesn't interrupt the lines of the lamp.The light has three levels. The medium setting was good enough for some reading, but I predominantly used ""high"". The switch steps from low to high. This is not a push-switch, but a proximity switch: I found that I could activate it when my finger was an 1/8-inch above the surface. You can trigger the switch either by (lightly) swiping your finger over it or bouncing your finger over it. I tended to do the former most, but that was simply because swiping was easier when I was reaching out to it. The switch is triggered only in the narrow area over the depression.If you are using the lamp for only brief tasks, the need to step through the levels may be an annoyance. I was initially annoyed that ""high"" wasn't first on the cycle--because that is what I wanted most--but came to appreciate starting at low. First, it was easier to cycle to high at the beginning of the task, rather than cycling to turn it off. And then I found that I would often stop at the medium level as good-enough.----Color temperature: There is a growing body of research on how different spectrums of light affects the brain, and is often expressed as the ""color temperature"" of the light produced. Daylight (bluish white, 5000-27000K) stimulates the brain. This is a problem when used during the evening because it takes the brain time to ""calm down"" and this delays the onset of sleep. This lamp produces light at 3000K, which is at the top of the ""warm"" range, equivalent to a Soft White Fluorescent and in the middle of the range for incandescent bulbs (2700-3300K). This makes it a good lamp for reading in the evening (I haven't found anything under 2700K).----The lamp has an external power adapter. Some people understandably dislike ""wall warts"", but I regard this as an advantage. My experience with other LED lights is that the failures that occurred were in the power adapter, not the LED bulb. If that happens, an external power adapter can be trivially replaced--the hardest part is plowing through all the listings for similar adapters to find the needed one. The label on the bottom of the lamp calls for an adapter producing 10VDC/350mA.The ""wall wart"" is horizontal -- it sticks out to the side of a wall outlet and can be used in the top socket leaving plenty of room to plug in something in the lower socket.In case you are curious, the power adapter that comes with the lamp is a ""Constant Current LED Driver"" model HLV3512T1 (I didn't find any online *retail* listings for that precise model, only wholesale ones, and under multiple manufacturer names: Waiberlon, Huibolong).-- Douglas B.

"The diameter of this speaker is a bit less than the typical soft drink can and thus makes it well-suited to sitting in a drink holder in a vehicle. Similarly for having sound come out the top. However, all the controls are around the base of the device, forcing you to pick it up to make any adjustments. One-handed operation was possible for me (5'10"" male) but might be difficult for smaller people. The controls have very low visual contrast with the body -- a passenger had difficulty operating it at night (until she had it illuminated by the car behind us).I cannot see myself ever using this as a speakerphone while being a driver -- it is too awkward and requires too much attention. Nor would I bother to have it used by most of the people who are passengers with me: They tend to reject my directions of how such a device works in favor of their own intuitions of how it *should* work. And even for such simple functionality, I found myself repeatedly ""experimenting"" to get it to do what I wanted.However, as a portable speaker for around the office, house or yard, it did quite well. It has a good texture that makes it easy to carry. The weight and slip-resistant bottom kept it in place.I have given it a mediocre rating because of what I view as poor design of the controls and because the design of the connectors sacrifice what I regard as the more common and important functions in favor of functions I see no value for (chaining together multiple speakers).----Sound: The sound produced was surprisingly good, significantly better than other BT speakers of similar size that I have encountered (although most of those have somewhat lower prices). The produces a good range of frequencies and in balance (no need to adjust the player). I used it with various types of music and didn't encounter anything that was displeasing (in contrast to some others which are irritating to me on Rock and similar because they have far too little base and have too much treble).----Bluetooth: The range for this device is very similar to my other Bluetooth devices.Realize that this is BT v3.0 which doesn't include low-power capabilities in BT v4.0. My understanding is that the primary advantage of BT 4.0 for a speaker occurs when it is often in ""standby mode"" (connected, but no audio being sent to it).----Recharging: By a provided micro-USB cable. This is a standard cable, despite the connector on the speaker being non-standard (below), thereby making replacement trivial if it is lost, misplaced, or forgotten. The package also includes USB power adapters for both auto and wall-plug (much appreciated).I tended to use this speaker in shorter session, and thus would loose track of how much charge was likely left on the battery. It would have been very nice to have an indicator, but most of the competing products don't seem to have one either.----Connections explained -- as best I can infer:The physical USB connector is not wired as such. A conventional USB cable (provided) is used only to recharge the battery -- it does *not* provide a hardwired connection between a computer and the speaker. The data pins on the USB connector are instead used to provide an analog Aux-In stereo connector.Included in this product is a cable with a 3.5mm stereo connector and a micro-USB connector. The manual shows this as intended for chaining multiple CAN speakers together. However, it can also be used to connect the Line-Out of a laptop or similar device to the speaker (the manual makes a vague mention of this). However, with my computer, setting the volumes to max on both the computer and the speaker produces only medium volume (far less than when connected by Bluetooth).DISADVANTAGE: This arrangement means that if you are using a hardwired connection for the audio -- for example where there are competing Bluetooth devices -- you have to run the speaker on battery power (the connector is not available for the recharging cable).NOTE: The 3.5mm connector on the speaker is Aux-Out (vs Aux-In on many similar products).----FM Radio: The instructions are grossly inadequate for the radio. My first attempts to use it failed miserably. As I stepped through the stations, all I heard was loud static where the stations were, which I mistook for reception problems. When I turned down the volume way down, I could hear the stations. Because the speaker has no similar problem producing good output from a BT connection, this suggests to me that this is not a problem with the speaker portion, but noise being introduced within the electronics, for example, the speaker coil broadcasting to the antenna (feedback). On most stations, I found that I had to substantially turn down the volume to get rid of the noise/static, leaving a fairly narrow range where it was loud enough to hear without that static.The radio is of limited usefulness because you have to step through stations without any indication of where you are ""on the dial"", making it hard to get back to a desired frequency/station. The instructions mention ""pre-set"" stations without explanation of setting or accessing (and experimentation failed).When automatically scanning through stations, it pauses for 2-3 seconds before stepping to the next one. For me, this was a bit too short to recognize and respond. Although I could use auto-scan and then manually back-up, I found it more convenient to simply manually step through stations.My product came with a telescoping antenna for the radio, but the manual described the antenna as a wire that is combined with one of the provided cables. I don't know if mine is the new version, or if it is an old version being phased out.----MicroSD card slot: I didn't use this.----Douglas B.

"A major factor in my rating of a book is how well it meets its own description and advertising. This presents a problem for this book because the publisher's description is so broad and vague that I couldn't tell what was its intended audience or focus. But this reflects a failing of the book: It does a variety of things adequately, but none particularly well. If you are new to this topic, there is enough that the book will probably be an enjoyable read. However, if you already have an interest and have read news stories and magazine articles, there probably isn't enough to keep you reading (unless you are obligated to write a review).I am a scientist, and as such, I prefer a focus on the ideas: How they develop, the key hurtles, the missteps, the insights, how various threads came together (and some separated). There is some of that here, but it is no better than a secondary part of the book.Instead, the book is structured around the author's interactions with several research groups. You get biographic sketches, some cute stories, walk-throughs of the research facilities, overviews of those groups' research programs, and overviews of their key discoveries with some mentions of related ones by other groups. Unfortunately, none of this is particularly deep, although many of the important concepts and issues related to (animal) intelligence are touched upon. And in several sections (especially dolphins/porpoises and elephants) there is a lot of discussion of behavior that is peripheral to intelligence.Structuring the book around the visits and interviews not only expends considerable space on those aspects but largely precludes the range of quick mentions of results from other groups than would have provided a more complete and sophisticated account (again, my bias for an idea-centric account).The book makes multiple brief mentions of the revolution in thinking on non-human intelligence, but there is no insight and it seems unaware of much of what was happening, for example, it portrays the revolution as more recent than it was.* However, this is not unexpected -- most scientists I know are unwilling to talk about such aspects in detail to reporters, having been burned and seen colleagues be burned.There could have been an interesting book about ""Doing Science"" in this area -- the personalities, the design and analysis of experiments, the politics, ... Or there could have been a book about animal intelligence itself, weaving together what had been discovered by disparate research groups. But this book tries to do both, and winds up doing neither. The book is well-enough written that many may find it moderately enjoyable, but given all the competing writings available, I can't recommend deliberately choosing this book.--* I was a grad student in Artificial Intelligence in the 1970s and there was a lot of interesting interactions between the fields.-- Douglas B.

"I have some experience with options and was interested in understanding more sophisticated strategies. The first part of this book assumed a novice investor -- someone who was far from ready for the later portions of the book. It was tedious reading because the incessant repetition of basic points such as you need to limit/control downside risks. This was made worse because many of the relatively simple examples had explanations that weren't, and I had to pause to convince myself that the problem was with the explanation and not my understanding. This did not bode well for the meat of the book.The book lost credibility with me when I found myself reacting that it was badly oversimplifying. This was not the simplification that occurs as part of a phased presentation, but presentations that could mislead the reader because they don't realize what they don't know. My biggest objection was that the advocated approach seemed to badly understate its costs: the costs of the options and other financial products and the cost of your time needed to manage this approach. The approach doesn't seem practical for those who seem to be the target audience for this book.-- Douglas B.

"This book poorly represents the source material on which it is built, and only infrequently gives the reader links from the text to the relevant item in the alphabetized list of sources at the end of the book. Most of the interesting details, complexities, ambiguities, speculations and conflicts do not make it into this book. Composites that were created hundreds of years later are treated as if they were originals (example, the myth of Merlin of King Arthur).The story telling is very poor. This feels like the preliminary stage where an author is talking about what he knows as a method of finding coherent story lines and deciding where to focus what he will eventually write.Most frustrating is the backwards storytelling. The book often starts a topic with a point in modern culture, such as a recent movie, and then muses about that ""monster"", then declares most of what was said to be wrong, that it was different in the past. This is a valid, and often interesting, approach if you are trying to untangle the various threads leading to the current version, but his book simply jumps back to an earlier version without any of that. It turned out that I already knew something about many of the ""monsters"" in this book, but even that was enough that I found myself constantly saying ""He doesn't have this quite right"" and ""Doesn't he know about ..."".He repeatedly gets cause-and-effect reversed. He repeatedly assumes that stories were based on preexisting monsters, ignoring the possibility that the monster was created in service of the story. Even when there is substantial, even incontrovertible, evidence against that assumption.For example, he offers Frankenstein's monster as an expression of existing human fears, and only weakly acknowledges later that it was the novel that created the fears (of what science might eventually make possible). Similarly, he claims that the movie ""Jaws"" was merely an expression of innate human fear of sharks, rather than a mild concern that became a major cultural phenomenon through brilliant visual storytelling and musical scoring.Similarly, he treats H.G. Well's ""The War of the Worlds"" as representing an innate fear of space invaders, only to retreat into saying that it might have been intended as an allegory on colonialism/imperialism. But the book then continues to use science fiction monsters as arising from the human psyche rather than being literary creations to facilitate the exploration of the ideas that are the real theme of the book.For dragons, his starting points include Harry Potter (the movies, not the books) and ""How to Train Your Dragon"". Although the book acknowledges that there were dragons in various places around the world, most of the types of dragons and their locales are missing from this book's consideration. And even for the dragons included, it only gives a hint of how different they were, mentioning only two of the optional features: fire-breathing and flying. Aside: I worked for a company considering dragon themes and was amazed by the number of different types of dragons from all around Eurasia, and that many weren't monsters but rather protectors of the human household where they resided (and cat-sized or smaller).The book reports little of the considerations about how these aspects may have come about from distortions in retelling. For example, the book mentions the poisons in the bite of some dragon-like lizards, but doesn't take the next step: The pain and other symptoms from such a bite could be reported as analogous to being burned by fire. And the darting tongue of these lizards has been described using an analogy to flames (both ""flicker""). From either, or both, it is a short step to ""fire-breathing"". Instead, the book focuses on instances where the cause might have been on ignition of gases (coal mines and decomposition).At only one point do I remember the book bringing a measure of analysis to ancient legends: For Beowulf, the book separates the reported _observable_ actions from the _interpretations_ of the events. In many other places, the book is incredibly credulous. For example, in another case of ""dragon fire"" being speculated to be from gases from decomposition of bodies, the book repeats an account where the opening of a single coffin ""incinerated hundreds"" (pg 114).Similarly, the book offers earthquakes as an explanation for the Minotaur. I have been in (medium) earthquakes that sounded like a big train coming at me from a distance, which the Minoans could easily have thought sounded like a big stampede of big bulls. But not a single bull. And not one running a twisting and turning path in a very restricted area (a maze under the palace). Nor is the frequency and pattern of earthquakes a good match to an animal that needs to be fed with periodic offerings. Earthquakes are at best a small fragment of a possible explanation.In analyzing Medusa's gaze turning men to stone, the book treats this as arising from people frozen with fear. It ignores other legends from around the world where people are turned to stone (example, Lot's wife in the Bible). Many of these legends are speculated to have originated as ways to explain rock formation that looked human, and possibly as part of stories to help people remember navigational details.The book's notion of ""monster"" is often loosely applied. For example, unlike the book, I wouldn't classify the dinosaurs of the movie ""Jurassic Park"" as monsters just because they were large and predatory. Similarly for the demons in the ""Ghostbusters"" movie.So if this isn't in the book, what takes up so much space? Musing about human nature. Musings about the use of monsters in literature and art and the transformations, for example, from the original vampires to the literary Dracula to idealized lovers for teenage girls (eg ""Twilight""). And lots more of movie monsters and aliens, but surprisingly none of the radiation-created monsters of the 1950s and 1960s (""Godzilla"", ""Them!"",...).Although the book mentions and briefly considers a number of the very interesting explorations of what might account for various historical monsters, that treatment is far too shallow to be satisfying, especially considering the available sources. Some of these monsters are attempts to rationalize processes that people of that time didn't understand, for example, germs, contagion, plagues, sleep atonia, flammable gases from not-understood sources. Other monsters seem to have been storytelling creations in response to fears. The book touches on the latter, but never deeply enough for me to call it ""the science of"". And the book gives examples of some steps in the cultural evolution of individual ""monsters"", but again without the detail, discipline and analysis to qualify as ""the science of"".If you have a budding interest in the science of monsters, this book has enough to further pique your interest and is just good enough to put up with the fluff and natterings. However, the inadequacies of the pointers to more detailed accounts may discourage many readers from any additional pursuit. Much of the listed source material is unavailable to the typical reader. For example, among the first 13 source listings, there are dates of 1810 (a chart), 1895 (NY Times article), 1912 (French language book), 1921 (two translated books) and specialized professional journals.-- Douglas B.

"My usage: I used this to sharpen several mass market kitchen knives, a pocket knife and two larger folding knives.My background: I keep a sharp edge on my knives. I learned to sharpen knives with a whetstone (40+ years ago) and having be using it on my high quality kitchen knives (Wusthof, Henckel, Shun) because I haven't found a successor that I was happy with. I have not tried this sharpener with these knives because they haven't needed sharpening in the month I have been using this product.Summary: Very happy with the results.Usability: The handle is generously large. I am a 5'10"" male and a much larger hand would have comfortably fit. The sharpener was stable and the feet kept it from slipping. In some other reviews here, there are complaints that this is not the case, but I suspect that they were using too much pressure (the instructions call for only ""moderate pressure"").Note: As with every pull-thru sharpener I am aware of, this is designed for right-handed use -- holding the sharpener in your left and the knife in your right.Durability: The case appears to be very durable plastic and is likely to easily survive being dropped. However, it is hard to judge the internal mechanism, which appears to be all plastic. I would advise being gentle in turning and setting the dial -- someone inclined to ""just force it"" may wear out or break the mechanism in a short time. The manufacturer lists the coarse and fine sharpening elements as replaceable.Instructions for general use: Simple and well stated on the packaging insert. However, I would fault them for not mentioning the use of sharpening steels/rods in addition to this product to reduce the loss of material to sharpening when re-alignment of the edge was all that was needed.Instructions for _specific_ knives: On the back of the sharpener is a listing of the *most common* angles for the basic categories of knives. Inside the folded insert is a table of the specific angles for various brands and subtypes of knives. Since you will probably want to keep this, you need to be carefully cutting open the package.WARNING: If you have been given good kitchen knives, do _not_ use the common setting but check this table -- many are _substantially_ different from the common settings.This same information is available from the manufacturer's website, but with two gotcha's. First, although the label on the sharpener lists the manufacturer's URL, it doesn't give its model number and the table is found on the page you get to via that model number (suggestion: write the model # on the bottom of the sharpener). Second, the table on the web page is badly formatted for both onscreen viewing and for printing. I reported this shortly after receiving my sharpener, but haven't heard back.Aside: The reason I want to be able to print this out is that people know I know how to sharpen knives and so part of a dinner invitation is the reminder that part of my helping with prep is to sharpen their knives. I would like to be able to take an easily folded copy rather than the original (which is on cardboard).Note: The angles in the table are the ones specified by the knife manufacturers and may not correspond to the available settings, but are typically close-enough. For example, some of the specified angles are odd numbers, but the sharpener allows only even numbered angles.Note: The Cronidur line of Henckel knives -- the extra hard steel -- has a recommended angle of 12.5 degrees, which is below the listed settings. I have been able to set the mechanism to what appears to be 12 degrees, but it didn't want to let me turn it below 14 without some jiggling.-- Douglas B.

"I really like this flashlight because it so nicely goes in various of my pockets and yet provides brightness that I associated with much bulkier lights. When out-and-about, the Fingertip Speed Control Focusing feature changed how I use my light -- it makes zooming into a spotlight so fast and easy that I routinely do so to check out noises and movement, whereas the more common twist-to-zoom has a much higher threshold for doing so: It takes two hands, time and often taking light off the area of interest.The core deficiencies of this flashlight arise from it retaining the proportions of the much larger models in the HP series -- while this model may be much smaller, the fingers of its users aren't. This is the basis for my 1-star deduction: In the smaller HP5 this was an acceptable failing, but not so much here.Coverage/Range--------------Without context, the range given in the spec is of little use except for comparing models in the same series. This is an attempt to provide some practical metrics, but they are very much a YMMV -- my eyesight, ambient light, ...For a sense of illuminating the path in front of me, I used a section of street well away from street lights because it provides a known, consistent texture and easily estimated distances (10 ft wide lanes).In Flood mode, an oval 30 ft wide by 50 ft long. In Low Power mode, what I regard as the usable oval shrinks to 15 ft wide and becomes too dim about 15 ft out.In Spot mode, the bulls-eye is about 2 ft diameter, and the overall oval is about 10 ft wide.For judging the ability of the Spot mode to illuminate distant objects, I combined three tests: ability to show gross texture of a fence (such as larger knots in the boards), ability to show the type of construction of a garage door (slats, panels,...), ability to show details of sidings of houses (eg shingles, and type).100 feet on the Normal (high power) setting; 60 feet on Low Power.Grip----The body has conventional texturing of a small diamond pattern. The flat areas on opposing sides  is not cosmetic, but improves both the grip and comfort for me. The diameter of the barrel is too small for me to grip for long with my fingers simply wrapped around it. Instead, I pinch the light between my thumb and first two fingers with the butt near the base of my palm. This has the advantage pointing the flashlight with a more neutral wrist position. And because of the light weight of the light, I didn't find this grip to be tiring.HP5 vs HP6: The HP5 and HP6 are siblings with the same physical profile, except that the HP6 is longer to accommodate a second AA battery, which supports a brighter light, 170 vs 121 lumens (spec), and slightly longer runtime, 5 vs 4.5 hours (= 11%) (spec). This length difference does noticeably affect my grip. With my preferred grip (above), my third (ring) finger barely touches the butt of the HP5, but all 4 fingers engage the HP6. Although it feels like I don't have a good grip on the HP5, I have not had the slightest problem -- its lighter weight make the pinch grip more than adequate. For me, the choice is one of the easy ""pocket-ability"" of the HP5 vs the brighter light of the HP6.Switch------The protective ring around the switch is poorly designed. Inherited from the larger models, it has opposing gaps seemingly intended to make it easier for your finger to press down on the switch, especially in one-handed operation. However, when the overall design was scaled down, these gaps were not adjusted upward to accommodate fingers comfortably. They are too small for when I am holding the light with my thumb over the switch. They are barely adequate when using my forefinger, and even then I tend to arch the finger to press _down_ on the switch, rather than _across_ it. (I am a 5'10"" male).Additionally, the gaps have the wrong alignment for me. I like to hold the light with my fingers on the flat section, and this has the high points of the ring under my finger or thumb. I have tried holding the light with the gaps aligned to the finger on the switch and found that the diminished grip on the barrel isn't worth the tradeoff.The scaled down protective ring also fails to adequately protect the switch from inadvertently being activated when being carried in a pack, suitcase, ... If pressing on a flat surface, the switch enters Momentary Mode somewhere between 14-16 oz (2-3 times it own weight).Focusing--------Focusing with one hand was easy and natural for me. I can push the head forward (for Spot) with my thumb. The ""Fingertip Speed Focus Control"" ring also allows one to pull the head backwards (to Flood) with my thumb and forefinger. However, the small gap in front of this ring reduces my ability to grasp it firmly enough to easily pull backwards. Usually I am able to uncomfortably pull back using the ring -- the problem grasping occurs at times such as when my hands are sweaty, but may also be a problem for people with weaker grips. In those circumstances, the hood is short enough that I can easily hook my forefinger over the front of it and pull it backwards. Recognize that going from Spot to Flood mode is something that you rarely _need_ to do quickly and easily -- unlike going from Flood to Spot. Consequently, I would classify this design issue as an inconvenience, rather than a problem.The manufacturer's claim of ""Focus provides superior beam consistency from spot to flood, with no dark rings typically associated with focusing flashlights"" is misleading. The flashlight _does_ provide great beam consistency in both spot and flood positions -- which are the ones that matter to me. However, in the intermediate positions, the center will be much darker than what you have in flood mode, and it will be surrounded by a bright ring. I don't see these intermediate positions as having any utility.The ""Beam Lock System"" did not work well (which it does on larger models in this series) -- it is strong enough to hold the position if the light is standing on its hood, but not good enough for normal bumps and pressures, for example, when it is in my pocket. Plus, there is no tactile feedback to tell when the lock is engaged. However, I regard this as insignificant because it is so trivial to reset the focus between Spot and Flood.Holster and Lanyard-------------------This flashlight is small and light enough that I just slide it in my pocket. There are relatively few circumstances where I would want to use a holster, and the provided holster makes that less likely. The holster is bulky because it is made of the same thick, heavy-weight, durable material as the holsters for the larger flashlights in this line (for which such materials are appropriate and welcome).The flap on the holster is fastened with Velcro. The belt loop is also fastened with Velcro, but with the addition of a snap. This snap is a useful addition in situations where the Velcro may be incremental loosened by the holster being jostled, for example by underbrush. Other holsters address this problem by having a second belt loop that is permanently sewn to the holster underneath the Velcro one so that you can select which to use. I don't have the means to test the tradeoffs.The provided lanyard is similar to what you get with Point-n-Shoot Cameras and similar consumer electronics. With the HP series, the lanyard is round and soft (vs on the G series where it is flat). The diameter of the provided attachment cord is 1/32-inch, but the rectangular slot can accommodate much larger (5/32s **xy** 3/16s wide by my measure).Rechargeable Batteries OK-------------------------I have used it not only with the provided Alkaline batteries, but NiMH LSD batteries (Eneloops, ""precharged"", ...). Simply confirming: I didn't expect this to be an issue with a Coast product.I asked Coast Customer Support why the product literature didn't mention rechargeables and got the response that although they did not anticipate problems and had successfully tested with a ""handful"" of NiMH rechargeables, they have not ""properly tested"" the full line. They correctly added the warning that ""Light output and run time will vary depending on the batteries used."" In searching the Web, I found claims that rechargeables could shorten the life of the flashlight itself, but this appears to be confusion with potential shorter _runtime_ from a set of rechargeable batteries.I like using rechargeables in this light to accommodate the relatively short runtime -- I am less likely to defer putting in a topped-off battery.Background: There are various formulations of white LEDs and the common ones require over 3V or 4V to operate (which is why cheap versions are designed with 3 batteries).

"If you like to read military history, most of the book is fast-paced and well-written, with lots of interesting tidbits, and at one level, highly enjoyable. On the other hand, if you like to read military history, you will likely already know much or all of the episodes here (I expect that my knowledge is somewhat above average for the likely audience for this book). I found myself repeatedly disappointed by mediocre renderings of situations: They left out some key aspects and slid over others. Worried that I might be being too harsh, I compared several to the corresponding Wikipedia entry and found the Wikipedia sections did much better within similar limited space.The big disappointment of the book is that it doesn't get beyond the mantra of ""Generals need to be relieved, but with potential of a second chance"", and at various points the repetition of that mantra becomes tedious. The book not only fails to attempt to reconcile various perspectives on generalship and relief, but routinely fails to even recognize that it is advocating contradictory perspectives (details below). And many of the big issues of this period are not mentioned or dismissed in a few sentences.I term much of the book as ""cataloging"" because it provides synopses of the examples, but rarely ventures into providing true insight. In the case of multiple generals who were not fired, or were belatedly fired, I got little sense of why. And in the final example of a firing (Col Dowdy in Iraq), I got to the end of the tactical description and thought that the book's assessment would have been that the general (Mattis) had made a bad mistake, but the book went on to praise the general.I was highly disappointed in the treatment of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. I suspect that since the author had cataloged much of this in his previous books, he didn't want to repeat it here. However, the thinness of his mantra didn't give him enough of a base for a new perspective.This book's perspective on management and leadership is so simplistic, abbreviated and constrained that someone with real-world experience is likely to dismiss it outright. It is based on a false dichotomy between distant, hands-off management and ""micromanagement"". It ignores that training is rarely good-enough to fully prepare you for a job, and that there is a lot that can be done to get a new job-holder up-to-speed faster. The sink-or-swim approach wastes decades of training and experience where the person has deficiencies that are readily fixed or compensated for (eg by teaming). Sink-or-swim requires a ready pool of replacements, but the book argues that generalship is a rare commodity and documents that failing generals were not relieved (eg Mark Clark) because there wasn't a viable replacement available.The latter portion of the book undermines its own thesis by placing the root of the problem much earlier in the pipeline, with who becomes field officers and how they are trained. Disappointingly, this is but a brief recap of much discussed points, with no value-added. The book fails to consider that if/when the potential replacements are similarly unqualified or unprepared, firing is largely pointless. Or worse, if the current general happens to be the best of a sorry lot.In idealizing the ""Marshall system"", the book tends to minimize the situations where generals were not fired, and thus fails to seriously explore them. The highly dysfunctional situation in Italy was a prime example (eg Mark Clark decided to parade his army into Rome rather than try to cut off the retreat of the Germans). And for those generals that got a second chance, what had changed? Were they now better prepared, or given a better fit, or less demanding circumstances, or...? The book doesn't even attempt to answer this.To those who would argue that this book has an important message, the mediocrity and ineptness of recent Army generals has been widely covered, including the author's previous books. And the need to have better follows automatically from that. What is largely missing from this book are sophisticated whys and hows.Summary: This book was like a reception line full of old friends -- it felt good to shake their hands, but there was nothing meaningful exchanged.==== Appendix: Details on above opinions ====The ""relief with second chance"" does not seem to be uncommon among armies -- I recollect multiple instances of such for both the Germans and Soviets on the Eastern Front in WW2. The book doesn't give me a sense of whether the ""Marshall system"" was a different policy, or more emphasis on certain existing policies, or just a name used to distinguish those policies from the current situation in the US Army.----The rise of the officer as technocratic manager: Many histories date this to the 1960s under SecDef McNamara, but this book puts it in the 1950s. I would put this even earlier, with the heavy adoption of Operations Research during WW2. The most famous was Strategic Bombing under Gen Curtis LeMay, partly because of its association with McNamara. During the latter portions of the Korean War, command staffs were often able to accurately predict the resources needed in a battle. This became the subject of the M*A*S*H episode ""The Grim Reaper"" in which the doctors become angry with a staff officer whose job is predicting the casualties for offensives (he gets the number exactly right, but it includes him). This highly quantitative approach to conflict has been crucial to US military dominance (although not as much as superior training). In failing to acknowledge or appreciate this, the book presents this as simply a bad development rather than one that has tradeoffs and needs to be accommodated.---One of the big issues during this period was the military's attempts at dictating various aspects of foreign policy to the US government. For example, in the aftermath of Vietnam, the Army closed down its Counterinsurgency (COIN) training. The book simply notes that this would be missed in the Iraq occupation. However, the need for COIN hadn't gone away -- The Army was simply pulling a bureaucratic maneuver to try to avoid being assigned that task by arguing that it was incompetent to carry it out. Similar games are played with weapon systems. A common comment by outbound Secretaries of Defense has been their frustration with getting the military to prepare for the wars the country needs them to fight, instead of the wars the military wants to fight. Former SecDef Gates talked repeatedly of the need to reorient the Pentagon to ""fight the wars we are in"".Note: In one of the interviews promoting the book, the author made the point that the Pentagon focused on planning for future wars and neglected actually fighting wars. However, this is not in this book.Many historians and analysts believe that Gen Douglas MacArthur attempted to force the US into a full-scale war with China. This book presents too small a fraction of the evidence for the reader to understand that perspective. While the book mentions the deployment of UN forces near the Yalu that virtually guaranteed the success of the Chinese attack, it doesn't mention that MacArthur knew how provocative the troop movements were (they threatened to cut off electrical power for China from a large complex of dams) and that those movements violated very explicit direct orders from Washington. And the retreat from the Yalu has been called a ""fabricated rout"" -- troops were retreating so fast that they not only lost contact with the enemy, but could send out ground and air patrols for tens of miles and not see any sign of the enemy. Units were moved not to consolidate positions, but to positions that left other units vulnerable, justifying orders to those other units to retreat (and continuing the cycle). Commanders who made successful stands against the enemy were berated and ordered to retreat.The book mentions the problem that firing a high profile general can raise unpleasant questions about the conduct of the war and undermine public support. However, these mentions are very brief (a few sentences) and fail to give the reader even a jumping off point for thinking about this aspect.----The book is inconsistent in what it portrays as the proper relationship between the civilian authorities and the JCS. The book reports an episode where Pres Johnson literally cussed out the JCS after they presented him with two extreme options on Vietnam, neither of which was credible. The first was withdrawal. The second was to so expand the war into the North that it might well provoke China's entry into the war as well as provoking military confrontations with the USSR (in retaliation for sinking Soviet ships). The book presents this as intolerable abuse of the JCS, but if a similar interaction had occurred between generals, the book's perspective was that the superior would have been derelict to not have immediately fired such subordinates.----In a significant fraction of military failures, a key factor is the subordinate not understanding the intention of the commander (often the fault of the superior, but usually the subordinate gets the blame). For example, the Charge of the Light Brigade (1854). While the book's perspective on proper communications between generals is inconsistent, it seems to mostly favor a practice based on the occasional galloper carrying orders of a few sentences (low information, low interactivity). Eisenhower, following von Moltke the elder, said ""Plans are useless, but planning is essential"" but history indicates that too often the wisdom gained from the planning process doesn't get transmitted to those executing the plan.In the Battle of Chosin Reservoir (Korea), the book mildly criticize the HQ for not giving the heavily engaged units better info about the wider picture. But it also criticizes the practice in Vietnam of battalion commanders using the view from helicopters to coordinate their units. Note: the book's criticism of much higher level commanders also becoming involved seems reasonable. But then the book seemingly praises a general for walking into a front line position and talking to soldiers in their foxhole without even announcing his presence to the platoon commander.I would have expected the book to try to deal with the effects of technological change (beyond the helicopter as observation platform) on command relationships. I worked for a defense contractor, and the military's emphasis was on being able to operate ""inside the enemy's decision cycle"" (keep him off balance, staying several steps ahead,...) by having better information faster (acquire, analyze, distribute). (details: eg OODA loop: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act).[Added 2013-05-02]: In the 1990s, I worked on InfoTech projects for a defense contractor. One of the interesting comments about the Gulf War was that InfoTech had allowed the US to execute various maneuvers that would have been unthinkable a few years earlier (because of the high risk of friendly fire, congestion,...). This allowed the US to make more intensive use of the road network and to get troops to where they were needed on the battlefield, thereby enabling the US to have decisive advantages in firepower. This was a result of providing units with better situation awareness and of providing commanders with info so that they could more finely orchestrate -- not micromanage --- their units. The old model of command was rooted in the early and mid 1800s -- von Moltke the elder's theories and strategies inspired by Napoleonic practices. This was dictated by the technology of that time: communication was very slow, sensors were very limited, and the ability to create and update packages of information was slow and labor-intensive, most troop movements were slow (on foot). It severely limited not only the ability to coordinate combat units, but the ability to coordinate logistics for those units.----The book advocates that someone in command of a combat unit should have had combat experience at the next lower level. The term ""combat unit"" is ambiguous -- in some case it simply means a unit in the combat _arms_ (infantry, armor, artillery, ...) and in other cases it means a unit that is in combat, potentially including units not in the combat arms. However, from context, it seems this book means both, a combat-arms unit in actual combat.The book fails to recognize that this formula is what has led to the pattern of rapid rotation -- especially in Vietnam and also currently -- that the book decries (""ticket punching""). The book also fails to consider that this presumes that the US will always be involved in combat of a scale and intensity to provide this experience to a wide enough range of officers.And this prescription also fails to consider other factors can be more important. Suppose there was a threat of war breaking out in Korea. Would the US be better served transferring in officers who had combat experience inside Baghdad to replace officers who had participated in exercises in Korea and were familiar with the local conditions -- terrain, weather... -- or leaving the latter in place?----The book mentions the need to expand the education of the officer corps, but says little about where the  deficiencies are. For example, in Iraq and Afghanistan, the top commanders belatedly came to the conclusion that wantonly killing civilians was counter-productive but had very limited success in pushing that message down even to division commanders, much less the troops. Even the killings of allies and friends in addition to lots of innocent civilians didn't seem to convince commanders that their practices needed to be revised.Dealing with civilian populations is not just COIN, but a standard part of every war. Even the Gulf War, which was fought predominantly in the desert, had a major component fought in populated areas.I would expect any officer to know that ""The Rape of Nanking"" and other Japanese atrocities shaped US policy in the lead-up to WW2. Similarly, they should understand the role of WW1's ""The Rape of Belgium"" in creating anti-German sentiment in the US even before the effects of German submarine warfare. Illustrations of ""The Hun"" with a baby on his bayonet and of women being dragged off to be raped were widespread and very effective. Also the British very effectively used numerous anti-Catholic actions of ""The Huns"" as a counter to the likely anti-British sentiment among Irish-Americans. I would expect them to know that during the German invasion of the USSR, significant populations initially saw the Nazis as liberators, but atrocities switched them to resistance. Similarly in the Balkans, Nazi repressive practices (eg executing random hostages) backfired, greatly expanded the resistance: The action of one guerrilla sniper could cause the Nazis to execute 10-20 people, with each of the dead potentially generating several new guerrillas from family and friends seeking to avenge them. And the conduct of Israel during its occupation of southern Lebanon turned the Shi'a inhabitants from welcoming to resistance: Many Israeli leaders, most notably former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, acknowledge that Israel effectively created Hezbollah.Yet events in Iraq and Afghanistan suggest an officer corps largely oblivious to this history.----The book makes a limited attempt to explain the mediocrity of the upper officer corps in the Army, and that explanation is much too narrow. For example, in the early 1970s, a friend was flying helicopters as part of an armored division in Germany (after flying in Vietnam). He described tank commanders who were so dimwitted (rigid and unimaginative) that they couldn't think in terms of the tactics and capabilities of the helicopters hunting them as being any different from jet aircraft, and consequently in exercises their units were repeatedly wiped out in ambushes by the gunships.That friend also described ""The Dirty Harry problem"": ""Now you know why they call me 'Dirty Harry'. Every dirty job that comes along."" The good officers got the dirty -- but crucial -- jobs. They would spend weeks in the field, in mud, snow and freezing temperatures, where their minor failings or mistakes were easily seen and noted. Meanwhile, the slackers and screw-ups were given 9am-4pm desk jobs where they were home to their warm beds every night. No surprise that the latter saw the Army as a sweet career and that most of the former left.When I was working for a defense contractor, I found that the US Navy officers I encountered were much smarter, knowledgeable and insightful than the corresponding Army officers. I mostly dealt with Major/LCDR to Colonel/Captain, but occasionally briefed to higher (flag) levels. My colleagues had similar assessments.----The book does little to inform the reader of what _modern_ generalship involves. The common misconception is that it involves directing troops during the battle. Whereas many successful generals have stated that their role is predominantly preparing their units for the battle -- logistics, positioning, training, motivation, mission awareness, ... -- and that the speed of battle means that they rarely have information that is both timely and of adequate quality for them to make more than limited adjustments to the battle plans. WW2 German General Rommel famously stated ""The battle is fought and decided by the quartermasters before the shooting begins"". General Honore (Hurricane Katrina fame) states ""...in the Army... If you're going to be a good leader you're going to have to learn how to be a good teacher.  The concept of leadership is teaching.""-- Douglas B.

"This is yet another Hollywood product that envisions/portrays life as an extension of, or proxy for, high school. Although the actors themselves are obviously older, they are transparently playing 15 year olds. Noomi Rapace stars as an over-the-top spoiled brat/drama queen. And there are the requisite doofuses and other stock characters of this genre. The characters' ""adventures"" are a result of a mix of their impulsiveness, rebelliousness, recklessness, carelessness, and other compulsive and pointless risk-taking behaviors, enhanced by stupidity and inexperience.Although it conforms to the teen horror movie convention of having characters take the most unimaginably stupid actions, it does not qualify as a horror movie because the surprises aren't. Plus I had no empathy for any of the characters. And the only (mild) suspense came from monitoring my own reactions: Did I think that this character deserved to die a slow gruesome death, or did I simply want him/her dead quickly so that the movie would be closer to being over? Turned out to always be the latter.From the reviews, I knew to expect a mediocre movie in terms of plot, but I watched for the visuals. Not worth it. Although extensive, the CGI seemed quite mundane, but it may simply have been overwhelmed by the massive, unrelenting stupidity of the rest of the movie.And some of the key visuals contributed to the sense of ""stupid, stupid, stupid"". One of the strengths of the ""Alien"" movie was its claustrophobic feel and that it conveyed the impression of a real working freighter -- it was packed, cluttered, gritty, and suffering from wear-and-tear. In this movie, the inspiration for the ship's interior comes from mansions dressed for a photo shoot. The rooms are humongous and sparsely furnished, leaving vast open spaces. Even the oversized beds -- which seem intended to accommodate partying with multiple simultaneous guests -- don't make a dent in the floor space of the various living quarters.-- Douglas B.

"This is a very unusual book in what it achieves. First, what it is not. If you are interested in this topic and have read some of the prominent earlier books, you may find nothing new of significance (I didn't). And if you are looking for an introduction, there is probably too much that is silently skipped.What it does very well is to create a strong gut feeling for the many failings of the US response, due to incompetence, arrogance, carelessness, ideology that rejected evidence,... The book is written in the style of a thriller, popping back and forth between story lines. I found it a very fast-paced read that constantly drew me forward. Even if you are familiar with the events, you are still likely to find the book very readable because of its organization and approach. However, the problem with this approach is seen in the description of the response to the anthrax attack: It is abbreviated far past the point of losing its essential character. Plus, it was so peripheral that I can't see how it belongs in this book.A big limitation of the fast-paced style is that it precludes analysis and insights into why something happened. For example, an extended analysis of the misconceptions about the ""Manchester Manual"" is consigned to the ""Notes and Sources"" appendix (pp 545-552). Advice: Read it -- it is a critical part of the story. One of my biggest frustrations with the accounts -- this and others -- is that I haven't seen a remotely satisfying explanation of why the CIA didn't have qualified, experienced interrogators as part of its normal course-of-business. Or why the military did not use experienced interrogators from the Reserves -- predominantly from civilian law enforcement -- despite the Reserves being explicitly structured to preserve and provide that capability.In the Epilogue I was taken aback to read passages that were in direct conflict with what was in the preceding chapters. For example, rather than ""struggling to find a proper balance between national security and legal rights"" (pg 508), the lawyers of the Bush Administration used the crisis to push an extreme interpretation of ""The Unified Executive"", and abrogated basic rights, such as warrants for searches even though they could provide no example or even a reasonable argument why the existing FISA procedures weren't adequate. And, as the book shows, after persistently failing to even try to sort out the innocent from the guilty, these lawyers put their efforts into blocking attempts to make them do so. My assumption is that the author was attempting to placate some of his sources by being able to point to these passages, deflecting them from what was written earlier. However, I couldn't help but wonder if he hadn't also shaded (softened) what was in the earlier chapters to manage his relationship with those sources.I have serious problems with the sourcing of the claims that the waterboarding of KSM provided actionable intelligence: It is listed simply as a CIA report with no assessment of its credibility. The book had already mentioned that there were multiple instance of the CIA taking credit for information obtained by others (especially the FBI). The reality was that the CIA and the Bush Administration were repeatedly and consistently caught in deceptions and outright lies about what information had been produced by waterboarding. And about the efficacy of waterboarding: They initially claimed that a single session caused the subject to immediately reveal all. Then it was a few sessions. Then 40. Then 183. Then that although waterboarding didn't directly produce intelligence, it had made KSM more compliant to subsequent interrogation. With only a small part of this extensive history in the book, how is the reader to judge whether this CIA report is credible or just more self-serving lies? Granted there were too many major deceptions and lies during this period to expect the book to even touch on most of them, but this was a big enough part of events and of the book to expect a more critical presentation.In summary, I have very divided feeling about this book. I love the way that it gives the reader a strong _impression_ of these events, but I dislike how its focus hides that these are but _representative_ stories and that there was a much bigger picture.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VJ8LW47RD390/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451669380#wasThisHelpful","R2VJ8LW47RD390","AHPV4F8IVSC39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHPV4F8IVSC39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My cat responds to various sounds from my TV and computer, especially bird and animal calls. He charges up to the speaker and often spend some time trying to locate the source. With this video, absolutely nothing. He didn't even turn his head. And I am not surprised, because the sound track lacks any of the complexity of a bird or animal call. The sound is more like the ""chirp"" of an electronic alarm. It is played constantly, with no variation, and has no relationship to the video. You don't hear the rustling of leaves during the video of squirrels searching through those leaves. Nor is there a flutter of wings when birds are on-screen.My experience with cats is that sound is more important than vision for engaging them. Example: Most of my cat's favorite toys are lures on the end of a line. Dragging them across open carpet produces little or no response, but add a rustling sound by crossing a newspaper sheet or a plastic bag, and he charges from across the room and pounces.My cat has only infrequently shown interest in the pictures in standard TV programming, so he is not a reliable judge of what is here.

"The box says ""crunchy oat cereal with just a hint of CINNAMON"", but I would classify it has having a moderate cinnamon taste, which is a reasonable level for this type of product. I would have been disappointed if there was less. The problem is that here cinnamon is the predominant taste -- the underlying squares are quite bland.  In most recipes, cinnamon functions as an accent, and for good reason. Without a base flavor, the impact of the cinnamon is fleeting and unsatisfying.Although the box claims that the cinnamon is ""baked into"" the squares, a very noticeable amount winds up in the milk and on the side of the bowl (as specks), which is more what I would expect from it being a coating.The squares are definitely crunchy and stand up well to sitting in milk.3-stars = ""It's OK"" : I wouldn't buy it for myself, but I wouldn't refuse it if someone else served it to me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GE30Z964L7F5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OVPKCI#wasThisHelpful","R1GE30Z964L7F5","AHPV4F8IVSC39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHPV4F8IVSC39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: Amazon has combined the reviews for the 1TB, 2TB and 3TB versions of this product, with the 3TB version dominating the negative reviews (as of 2012-11-24), so pay attention to which version is being reviewed.The target market of the Seagate Expansion Desktop line seems to be people who want to add a performance drive, but don't want to, or cannot, install an additional internal drive, that is, this is a drive they won't be moving, at least not frequently. For example, a laptop where the extra storage can happily stay behind in the office. Or a small-form-factor PC (mini-PC, HTPC, ""nettop"") that doesn't have space. There are other lines of external drives from Seagate (and others) targeting more transient/mobile uses.For a range of potential buyers of this drive, the product information provided may be too sketchy. The focus of this review is to fill in some of the missing info, and it is structured to facilitate your skipping details that don't interest you. Note: At the time of this review, the product information here at Amazon is more than you will find elsewhere, including Seagate's website (no spec sheets, ...).TRANSFER SPEED:The drive in the enclosure is the same model used for internal drives in performance desktops (details below).With USB 3.0, transfers to this drive are slightly faster than the same transfers between the (older) internal SATA drives in my current computer (details below).The drive has the performance needed to benefit from USB 3.0: In my experiments, USB 3.0 transfers are 60-200% faster than USB 2.0 (details below).COOLING:Heat is the enemy and can shorten the lifespan of drives. For a drive that seems intended to be always on, I would have expected cooling to be a significant design feature. The enclosure is passively cooled with holes in the bottom and back. However, this doesn't seem to be enough to enable real/effective convection cooling (using rising heat to pull cooler air across the radiator). The enclosure is thin plastic (metal would be been a better conductor of heat).Part of the basic drive is a metal plate that serves as a radiator, and the typical installation positions the drive with the plate on top or to the side to facilitate heat rising off it. Here, the drive is positioned with the metal plate on the bottom to have it close to the vent holes in the enclosure. However, the enclosure's feet are absurdly thin -- the equivalent of 12 sheets of paper thick. Not only does this restrict air flow to the drive through those holes, it also turns the surface that the enclosure sits on into a heat reservoir, further inhibiting cooling. I strongly recommend increasing this gap. For example, I am using the (optional, unused) thick feet that came with another enclosure. And I recommend positioning it where it will benefit from the existing airflow in the room (and avoiding dead spots). Putting the drive on a sheet of aluminum, or other highly conductive material, negates the heat reservoir effect of typical furniture. Aluminum foil also worked, although I wouldn't recommend it as a longer term measure because the inevitable crinkles will inhibit air-flow.As an experiment, after powering down the drive and allowing it to physically spin down, I flipped the enclosure upside-down -- ventilation holes above the drive's radiator plate -- and the temperature dropped quickly (no surprise). Recognize that there aren't holes on the top of the enclosure for good reason -- to protect the drive from spills and to reduce dust reaching it -- so you should consider doing this only if you are going to remember to flip it back in a timely fashion.STATUS LIGHT has poor sightlines:There is a small blue LED that is lit when the drive is ready to use. There is a slight delay between the drive being powered on and it being spun-up and ready to use. This light is located on the top of the enclosure at the back. I would have much preferred it being on the front of the enclosure -- where it is on most similar products -- because it would be much less likely to be obscured. I put the disk next to my monitor stand and my sightline to that light is obscured by the monitor.NOISE:Caution: I am 60 years old -- younger ears will be more sensitive. In the evening in a typical residential setting during large-scale file transfers, I can hear the drive when my ears are about a foot away, but at two feet, I don't hear it even when I am listening for it. The whir of the drive tends to blend into the fan noise of most computers. The only time I have been aware of the drive has been when using it with my super-quiet computer in very quiet environments, such as after midnight, and even then it was only vague awareness.SPIN-UP?:The drive automatically controls power usage (see APM below). User control seems to be solely through the USB connection: The drive powers up when the USB connection is established and powers down when the connection is broken, either by physically disconnecting the cable, by a software ""Safely Remove Hardware"" operation. There doesn't seem to be a way to re-connect other than power-cycling or physically ""cycling"" the USB cable connection (neither of which I find attractive). When the attached computer is powered up/down (including sleep or hibernate), the USB connection is established and broken, so the drive is automatically powered up/down, as expected and desired.CAUTION: Unintended Spin-up during Sleep & Shutdown:Even when the computer the drive is connected to is in Sleep (ACPI S3) or Shutdown (ACPI S5), the drive _can_ spin/power up, and thus heat up, if you plug it in (power cycle, but not if you simply leave it plugged in). On _my_ computer, this occurred regardless of the BIOS ""Power Management Setting"" for ""USB Wake Up from S3""--I had expected that ""Disabled"" would make the USB port appear disconnected. However in S5 with ""ErP Support"" (""<1W in S5"") enabled, this spin-up did not occur. This spinning up can be easily missed because it does not generate an event that wakes the computer -- the only warning is the small blue LED that is easily missed because of its position at the back of the enclosure (above).ADVICE: (1) Plug this enclosure into a socket that you won't be tempted to ""borrow"" - when my computer is in Sleep/Shutdown (S3/S5), I am long habituated to such borrowing being harmless. Failing that, label it (Being paranoid, I did both). (2) Consider enabling ErP Support in the BIOS (after checking what this disables). This is trivial: The warnings to less experienced users against modifying the BIOS is because once they start, some just can't resist fiddling with settings they don't understand, and that can get them into lots of trouble.CABLE:The connector on the enclosure takes the USB 3.0 Micro-B connector, so although the other end of the provided cable plugs into USB 2.0 ports (it is a Standard-A connector), you cannot use your generic USB 2.0 A-B cable should you misplace this one. Not a serious problem because this cable configuration is increasingly common and seems destined to be the ""normal"" cable.PROBLEM with SeaTools for Windows (v1.2.0.6 = current):The information reported by ""Drive Information"" is unreliable: Most of the time it reports values of zero (displayed as ""0"", ""False"", ""Unsupported"",...), but occasionally it reports non-zero values. The problem seems to be with SeaTools, not the drive -- CrystalDiskInfo and PassMark's DiskCheckup (free for personal use) gave me credible (and extensive) output. Be aware that not all third-party utilities for reading S.M.A.R.T. data handle USB-attached drives.RELIABILITY:Can't comment: I have had this only for a few days. If you haven't bought a drive recently (since the floods in Thailand), you may be surprised by the widespread decrease in warranty periods (this model's is only 1 year) and the increased reports of early failures of many models.AUTORUNWhen you first mount the drive, the Autorun (if enabled) is a program to help register the product. I see no evidence that it does anything else. There is no other software included.SN confusion: The registration software reports the serial number in reverse order (""12345678"" is displayed as ""87654321"") from what is printed on the enclosure, the outer packaging, and what is reported by SeaTools.NO SECURITY CABLE SLOTfor a Kensington-type Cable (example). Mentioned for those few customers for which this is relevant.FIRMWARE UPDATE??One review here mentions a firmware update to CC9H (2012-June-15 by ""RandomGibberish""), but I couldn't find mention of it on the web except in copies, and apparent extracts, of that review on other sites. Details below.WINDOWS UPDATE (added 2012-11-24):From other reviews here (see 1- and 2-star sections), unpatched Windows 7 Backup doesn't work with the 3TB version. Seagate's response is given in the comments to those reviews and seems to be that a standard Microsoft patch should fix this problem. That patch is KB982018 of March 2012 and I had already installed it as part of normal Windows-Update. However, it was listed as a ""Recommended"" (vs ""Important"" or ""Optional"") patch, so some may not have installed it. For more information, see those reviews and Seagate's responses (in the comment sections). Since I don't have the 3TB version, I cannot confirm that info.======= DETAILS ========TRANSFER TESTS:I transferred several mixes of files from one internal drive to another, and then from that internal drive to this external drive.1. 9GB of photos: 37MB/s between internal drives; 40MB/s via USB 3.0; 24MB/s via USB 2.02. 8GB single file: 87MB/s between internal drives (range 82-98MB/s during transfer); 94 via USB 3.0 (range 88-102MB/s); 32MB/s via USB 2.0Note: The internal-internal transfers has slight disadvantages in these test: (1) Not a freshly formatted file system (but freshly defragmented), (2) space on the middle of the platter rather than the beginning, (3) older technology (below).THE DRIVES:The drive in my enclosure is a Seagate ST2000DM001  (part# 9YN164), which is a member of the Barracuda 7200.14 series: SATA 6Gb/s, 64MB cache, 4KB sectors (Advanced Format technology). The internal drives used for comparison are 20-month old Seagate ST310005N1A1AS-RK, which are members of the Barracuda 7200.12 series: SATA 3Gb/s, 32MB cache, 512B sectors.HEAT:With the air gap underneath the enclosure widened (to 0.3"") and the drive positioned at a corner of my desk (for air flow), the maximum drive temperature was 45-47C = 113-116F (S.M.A.R.T. ID=C2 via CrystalDiskInfo), and was fairly consistent for ambient temperatures of 73-82F. This level was reached after 2.5-3 hours with moderate but intermittent activity. For sustained activity, it was approached after the transfer of about 20-40GB of normal files (several tests), with only a small increase for a subsequent 40GB of similar files.For comparison, the temperature of the corresponding internal drive being used in the transfers had only half that increase -- 10C=18F -- rising only to 36C=97F, both drives having started at ambient 26C=80F. Recognize that 47C is _not_ a bad temperature -- on devices I am familiar with, concern and alarms start at 55-60C -- but lower temperatures are better.2013-03-17: [ For some time, I have had the drive sitting on a sheet of metal (aluminum) that extends over an inch beyond both sides, providing a radiator (rather than a heat reservoir) below it. I had noticed that this substantially reduced the rate of increase in internal drive temperatures, but I hadn't done a reasonable test. I just copied 170GB (yes, ""gigabyte"") of data to the drive starting at an ambient temperature of 21C=70F. Increases: +7C @ 90GB copied (impressive), +15C @ 140GB, +20C (= 41C) @ 170GB (final). This was a continuous transfer taking 90-120 minutes (failed to record exact times). At these temperatures, the thickness of the conductor is irrelevant: standard kitchen aluminum foil worked just a well in a second test as the 1/16-inch thick sheet (that I had salvaged from a broken laptop cooler). If you choose to use aluminum foil (ignoring/reveling in its tackiness), recognize the inevitable crinkling makes taller feet even more important. And recognize that YMMV, so check how well your set-up works, using the utilities mentioned above (or similar). ]During active transfers, the drive draws 8-10W (power=heat). Less than a minute, sometimes seconds, after the transfer stop, power consumption drops to less than 0.1W (my Kill A Watt EZ shows 0.0W), although the drive continues spinning (I can feel the vibration with my fingertips) -- see APM below.Because I suspected that the enclosure was a factor, I measured temperatures beneath it. For transfers of 40-80GB (eg, a disk image, a multitude of photos), the increase was 16-20F (36C=97F at 77F ambient). In most of my tests, this increase came during the first 20GB but there were two cases where it rose much slower for reasons unknown. The temperature on top of the enclosure tended to be 9-12F above ambient.  After I powered off the drive, the temperature below rose another 1F (loss of the small airflow created by the platters and heads?) and it was almost an hour before it dropped 2F (latent heat in the desk below it?). When I powered on the drive after it being off for 3 hours, the drive reported being still 12F above ambient (SMART data).Absence of convection: I put some thin hairs (from my cat) next to the vents at the back of the drive and the air flow was so negligible that they didn't even quiver.APM (Advanced Power Management): PassMark's DiskCheckup, under Device Info, reports that APM is enabled with the level set to ""Minimum power consumption without Standby"". When a drive enters Standby, it spins down and parks its heads. Excessive spin-down & parking can reduce drive life, and this APM level seems to be a response to problems with earlier versions of this (and similar) drives.Aside: Regarding a complaint in another review about the power supply being a ""wall wart"" instead of being integrated: Recognize that an integrated power supply would add roughly 25% more heat to the enclosure (based upon a typical efficiency of 80% for switching power supplies) and that this would almost certainly raise the operating temperature of the drive. Manufacturers may choose wall-warts and bricks for lower costs and other reasons, but sometimes it is also good design.FIRMWARE:My unit came with firmware CC9E. However, when I went to Seagate's web page for firmware updates, the entry for this model mentions CC4H as current -- four not nine for the third digit -- and doesn't mention the *E as one of the relevant versions for my disk's part number. Normally a product's firmware is a single sequence, but Seagate _may_ have bifurcated the firmware because of difficulties making the internal and external versions of the code co-exist.Seagate's ""Drive Detect"" software (link on their firmware page) malfunctions for this drive (but works for my other Seagate family drives). Web search found people asking questions about the CC9* series, but no useful answers.To find the web page about this, go to the Seagate website and search on ""Firmware Updates for Seagate Products"" and click on ""Barracuda (1TB/disk platform)"". Aside: I cannot provide a direct link because of Amazon's well-motivated policy of prohibiting external links because they are potentially malicious.-- Douglas Moran","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37I21BF2CRM75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00834SJS0#wasThisHelpful","R37I21BF2CRM75","AHPV4F8IVSC39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHPV4F8IVSC39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2-stars for being a poor, but not un-watchable, aerial combat movie. I was strongly tempted to deduct a star for bad treatment of Tuskegee Airmen's story, but that didn't seem fair since Hollywood routinely ignores the compelling elements of a story in favor of a distorted, hackneyed,formulaic treatment.1. Failure as an aerial combat movie:Anyone who has seen even a modest amount of actual WW2 aerial combat footage will alternate between a series of negative emotions: derisive laughter, groaning, and anger at being treated so contemptuously by this movie's makers. The CGI is heavily influenced by the style and technique of first-person-shooter videogames, but it is so over-the-top visually that any serious gamer would reject it as cartoonish -- lacking any sense of realism. Particularly absurd, the movie treats steel, including armor plating, as having the same explosive potential as vaporized gasoline -- one .50-cal bullet hits it and there is a towering fireball. And the tactics swing between nonsense and hilarious stupidity (but one should know not to expect better from George Lucas).The only faintly realistic part of the movie is that it treats the Germans as the same cartoonish, wooden villains as did the propaganda comic books of that era.2. Failure as a story of the Tuskegee Airmen:The movie fails to give any sense of the importance of their accomplishments (instead citing medals). The movie shows a bomber crew offering to buy drinks for some Red Tails, as a casual ""nice job"" acknowledgement. This trivializes what happened. The Red Tails so excelled as escorts that bomber groups lobbied hard to have them assigned to their missions. And their reputation became such that their mere presence produced a substantial boost to the morale of the bomber crews. Without effective fighter escort, the bombing campaign would have been severely limited -- the costs of many targets would have been prohibitive. The movie presents the Red Tails as reducing the number of bomber crews killed, instead of them enabling those bombers to deliver heavy blows to the German war machine.The challenges the Tuskegee Airmen faced are only lightly touched upon: With only a few trivial modifications to the script, this movie could have had an all-white cast. The biggest failing is that the movie gives no sense of how this experience turned the elite of the Negro community -- many of the pilots qualified for the military program because of pilot training in a civilian program at Tuskegee University -- into part of the elite of American society. What the movie shows is generic ""frat boy"" behavior, but when you listen to the accounts of the actual pilots what you hear is how aware they were of the importance of what they were doing and the disastrous effects if they failed. And of the habits of focus, discipline and toughness it reinforced that served them so well later.The movie lacks any of the foreshadowing of the important people that many of these pilots would become. The DVD's extras include interviews with some of the airmen, but I didn't notice it covering anything I hadn't already seen elsewhere. Plus, ""extras"" are supposed to be that, rather than (partially) remedial for the failings of the primary product (the feature movie).-- Douglas B.

"Forgive me for saying the following so forcefully, but despite this complaint being pervasive in other reviews here, it didn't register strongly enough with me.The intended audience I picture for this book is one where detail and sophistication must be sacrificed in favor of repetition, that is: Severe problems with both short-term and long-term memory. Uninterested in the topic, but being forced to listen. Below average intelligence and general knowledge (example: Will not know that Arizona is in the US). If this is not you--and I doubt it is--be prepared to endure a lot to find the sparse content of this long book.For comparison, this book is far worse than the typical ""motivational"" business book, a category that is infamous for books that are bloated with unnecessary repetition and that offer shallow and questionable analyses. In this book, it is not uncommon to encounter pages that have 2-3 repetitions of the book's mantra, with yet more instances a few pages on. Sometimes it will go on for multiple pages repeating what had just been said immediately before. And examples are cited repeatedly as if new. If this were a lecture, you could go out, make some phone calls, get a pizza and come back without having missed anything.----Most of the examples are of the form that chooses an under-performing economy and _declares_ it to be the result of ""extractive"" policies. Extractive policies cover a wide range--expropriation, extortion/bribery, excessive taxation,...--but there is rarely even an attempt to explore the details or complexities. Or to quantify. My expectation was that such considerations would have yielded interesting insights. The book treats extractive vs. inclusive policies as a binary choice, rather than a matter of degrees.The explanation of the examples are grossly over-simplified and too often get significant details wrong. See other reviews here for numerous examples. The book had the feel of ""Don't let facts get in the way of the story.""This is a book where shallow analysis is the most you can expect, and you'll rarely get even that. Its critiques of other theories, such as Guns, Germs, and Steel:... by Jared Diamond, involve creating strawmen that can be trivially demolished: The book exaggerates those books' claims that other factors were (highly) influential to the outcomes, portraying those claims as being that those factors were absolutely determinative, which the book can then dismiss with a single counter-example.One of the key tests of a theory is whether it can explain why seemingly similar situations produce different outcomes. Unfortunately, in multiple places in this book, the ""explanation"" of different outcomes is simply a _statement_ that the underlying situations must have had (unspecified) differences. For example, it claims that the greater freedom of the peasantry in western Europe after the Black Death flowed from the labor shortages the Plague created, but then acknowledges and waves-off that the similar situation in eastern Europe led to greater repression.Before committing to this book--I was about to be stuck for hours in a hospital waiting room--I quickly sampled some passages and found them to be exciting. But that turned out to be because they were evocative of my existing knowledge. When I actually read the passages, my intelligence was insulted. It was history dumbed way down, to the level of a big-picture, broad-survey course. Although the authors' professional specialties are Economics and Political Science, that is not reflected in the book: The explanations and analyses are unsophisticated/trivial -- what one might expect from students in introductory courses on these topics.While there are indeed some interesting passages, it is not worth plowing through all the rest to find them.Near the end of Chapter 5 (about 150 pages), I gave up on the book. The authors had lost all credibility with me and there was no reason for continuing patience with the book.-- Douglas B.

"I was given this already assembled, but it looked to be easily and quickly assembled with a minimum of tools (a wrench). It is _very_ solidly built. The picture here is a good representation of its appearance.Security: Although the depth of the mailbox might cause you to infer it provides security, it doesn't, except that that appearance might cause a potential thief to bypass it for easier pickings. The mail flap allows me (5ft10in male) to reach in with my bare hand and get most envelopes without undue effort. If the envelopes haven't fallen flat, extracting them tends to be trivial.Moderate problem: The mail slot is just under 11-inches wide, forcing the letter carrier to insert magazines and large envelopes short-side first, but the box is proportioned for those items to be inserted along their long edge.  This give rise to the problems noted in (3) below.Now the minor problems:1. There is no convenient place to leave out-bound letters. I have tried leaving them sticking out of the slot, but too often they have slid down into the mailbox where they are not visible to the letter carrier. The flap on the slot hangs loosely, so I suspect that the wind and/or vibration from passing vehicles creates enough play for the letters to slip down.2. The height of the pedestal seems to assume tall raised curbs. My yard is at street level (with valley gutters) and consequently I had to build a 9-inch tall concrete platform to get the mail slot to the minimum required height. Although you need a concrete platform (or similar) to bolt the mailbox's pedestal into regardless, an in-ground slab takes less effort and skill than an exposed platform.3. There is no lip at the back of the mailbox (where you open the door). A common situation is that the letters don't fall to the bottom of the box, but create a ramp that other letters are resting on. Consequently when you open the door, those letters will slide out unless you catch/block them. Annoying when the ground is wet.I am an engineer, so I added a lip (a strip of cardboard for now), but my experience has been that many people will not think to do such.Note: This happens routinely with 8.5x11-inch materials -- which my letter carrier inserts first -- but often happens even with normal letter envelopes because the letter carrier inserts them short-edge first and they doesn't slide all the way to the back.4. The hinge for the back door is to the right. For the right-handed, you are opening the door with your dominant hand, rather than having it to deal with the mail in the box. This was a real problem before I added the lip inside the door.5. There is very little space for house numbers, and even then, only the smallest available. Although it may be enough for the letter carrier, it is unlikely to be enough for someone driving down your street at night looking for house numbers (and where I live mailboxes are the conventional locations for house numbers).Details: The small ""cube"" just below the mailbox measures 1.5""H x 3""W in the front. The smallest self-adhesive numbers I could find in the hardware store were 1.5x1 inch, so there is room for only three _square-cut_ digits, and only two slant-cut digits (the big box hardware chains here carried only the slant-cut versions). The space on the sides of this ""cube"" are only slightly larger, but not enough to allow the next size up digits or a fourth digit. On the front,the left side has a suitable mounting surface a bit under 7""H x 1""W. By trimming the margins on 2""H x 1""W digits, I managed to put my three-digit house number there (gold numbers on a black background for aesthetics). The other locations on the mailbox are too small for even these digits.-- Douglas Moran","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J0JQAH994020/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003OZ3BGS#wasThisHelpful","R3J0JQAH994020","AHPV4F8IVSC39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHPV4F8IVSC39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Complexity and ambiguity are basics of the spy novel, but there is none of that here. This book is a mediocre procedural that only tangentially involves spies or espionage. Its covert activity -- an escape route -- is something ""that just works"" (largely) and there no fun of discovery of what it takes to run a complex operation of that type. Would that my vacation trips were so easy to arrange and ran so smoothly.The story feels like it has been simplified -- plot and characters -- for easy conversion into a screenplay for a theatrical movie (but unlikely to be good enough for cable). Although many words are expended describing the characters, the result is only two-dimensional, uninvolving stereotypes. The story has the sort of linearity and choppy jumping from scene to scene that I associate with screen plays rather than (non-pulp) novels. The starkly condensed plot requires a level of omniscience of the part of multiple characters, in contrast to what I expect of the genre. Everything comes easy to the protagonist, similar to a Jason Bourne movie but without the ""wow"". Although the regional and ethnic animosities are mentioned, they are missing from the actual story. The characters have an astounding credulity, especially considering the escalating crisis, and they provide nearly immediate agreement to requests that put them at considerable danger but have miniscule reward.Friends had suggested that I read the books in this series and unfortunately this was the first one. They (and professional reviewers) described these books as rich in sense-of-place and historical details. I found little of that here, other than a coarse timeline of how WW2 entered the Balkans. Plus, the author lost lots of credibility with me with his yammering about the Walther PPK pistol: He repeatedly highlighted it, but got much wrong. (The PPK is what James Bond famously carried in the movies)DETAILS: He has the protagonist ask for ""the detective version"" of the PPK, which is redundant: PP = PolizeiPistole and the ""K"" indicates the detective variant. The PPK excelled at concealability, but many concessions/tradeoffs were made to achieve that. It lacked stopping power (.32 cal), tended to jam and was effective only at short ranges. This was acceptable when the pistol was expected to be primarily used as a threat or intimidation, particularly against the unarmed. For example, making an arrest. It could also be a deterrent, keeping an opposing gunman far enough away for long enough. However, when the protagonist is called up by the army, he makes the inconceivable, and very deliberate, choice to take a PPK. And when the protagonist uses his PPK on a covert mission, it does not ""bite"" his hand, as the PPK was wont to do. This is a very distinctive mark in a highly visible location that would likely have had him immediately detained by any police or border officials he encountered.-- Douglas Moran","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MOZI5W2CINBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812977386#wasThisHelpful","R1MOZI5W2CINBV","AHPV4F8IVSC39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHPV4F8IVSC39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The initial setting dispensed far, far too much soap. My first attempt to use it produced a stream that lasted so long that my reflexes had me pull my hands back away (defeating ""no drip""). It produced more than a half teaspoon of soap, which for the soap I was using was more than enough to lather not just my hands, but also my forearms (I am an average sized male), and quite generously. At the lowest setting I could manage, it still dispensed enough soap to fully lather my hands, so it will still be much too much for those with smaller hands (children especially) and a somewhat lower setting would still be adequate for me. What I had expected was a minimum setting that was appropriate for small hands, that would require two spurts for mine, and three spurts if my hands were particularly greasy or if I needed to clean my forearms (for example, sap from gardening).In attempting to adjust the device, I first thought the initial setting was also the lowest setting because no matter how much I pressed the ""-"" side of the rocker switch, nothing changed. Then I noticed that even though I was pressing on the far side of the switch, both sides were going down together. I got the switch to work as intended by putting my fingernail against the ""+"" side for drag. Since I don't see other reviews reporting this problem, I suspect that my switch is an outlier. However, other units may develop this problem with use.Since I was given this unit for evaluation, I decided to test with ""grocery store"" liquid soap--the refill bottle in my cabinet was a private-label version of Dial. The instructions say too little about what are suitable choices of soap, primarily that it is designed for ""low viscosity"" soap, but with no practical example that would allow you to know that what they think of as ""low"". Since I would expect that many potential customers would want to use this to dispense Purell-type soaps (gel, higher viscosity), I was surprised that this was not addressed in the instructions or the promotional materials. Are there any problems with such soaps?  For example, does the higher viscosity reduce the life of the mechanism? Does it reduce the effectiveness of the no-drip feature? Or does it work OK even though this isn't the intended viscosity?I got this unit primarily for the no-drip feature. I have been using manual pumps where a full pump dispenses too much soap and a fractional one results in a slow drip. I have been using the unit for 18 days and it does seem to be no-drip and I like the predictably of the dispensed amount. It is attractive. It has a reasonably small footprint and is stable.Advice: Important to test placement realistically. In my first attempt at locating the dispenser, I stood next to the sink and moved my hands around to see where the sensor triggered and found it to be in a fairly tight area under the nozzle (good). However, the first time I walked briskly up to the sink, I triggered the dispenser while reaching for the faucet handle. This difference is inherent in this type of sensor -- I had just underestimated the cushion I needed to provide. And if you have a cat that likes to drink from the sink, realize that the cat's tail can be very far ranging.Minor: Several reviews commented on the difficulty of removing the stickers and the underlying adhesive. For me, the bottom sticker (on the front) removed easily and cleanly. However, as other observed, the top sticker was very firmly attached and it took many vigorous attempts to pry it up with my fingernail, and that left visible tiny scratches in the plastic ""chrome"" (even though I was running my nail parallel to the surface to avoid this). Unlike others, my stickers did not leave much adhesive behind, and that was easily cleaned up with alcohol and modest rubbing with tissue paper.-- Douglas B.

"This style of organizer was already a classic back in the 1960s when my parents used it to organize and store receipts. This product has the same quality materials and construction that it has had for decades. My previous one of these (from a competitor, same construction) has lasted for more years than I can remember.This style of organizer was designed to fit upright in the top drawer of a standard desk, but is also a convenient size for other locations (it fits in the side pocket of a backpack I take to meetings).Although storing receipts and coupons are the most commonly cited use, there are a myriad of others.

"I generally liked this product. I loved its being so much smaller and lighter than traditional battery chargers. However, there was a big issue and a variety of small annoyances.The big issue I encountered was that the charger never transitioned to Maintenance mode (trickle-charge). I had used the car in a way that didn't recharge the battery (series of very short trips on a cold night with a passenger that insisted on using the electric seat heater). I could hear the weaker rev'ing of the starter. When I got home, I connected up this charger, but 8 hours later, the status lights indicated normal charging mode, when I would have expected it to have long been in trickle charge. However, the battery seemed to have been fully recharged (from healthy sound from the starter motor).Related to this is the absence of a finer-grained charging status, for example a 3- or 4-element bar. On traditional battery chargers there is a gauge showing the voltage difference between the battery and what the charger is supplying. As the battery charges, the needle on this gauge drops. This lets you know when you are close to charged, or that the battery isn't taking a charge. And when you are initially connecting the clips, it helps confirm that you have a good connection. For example, I know from prior experience with these traditional chargers that there are several bolts on my engine block that would seem to be excellent grounding points, but aren't (insulated by thread-lock glue?). When I experimented by attempting to use these bolts, this charger gave me no indication of this problem -- the status lights were the same as when I connected to a good ground. Consequently you don't get an indication of one of the most common problems using a charger -- an inadequate connection of the clips.The hanging hook is a very useful feature. Unfortunately it seems to be made of a very brittle plastic. While it may be adequate for hanging the charger on a wall, it is grossly inadequate for the pictured use of hanging from the hood latch -- a situation when you are likely to be frazzled and may inadvertently stress the hook. When I encounter features that apparently compromise quality for trivial cost-savings, I always wonder if there are hidden ones critical to the functioning of the device.The product is better than what is pictured. Instead of a cord ending in battery clips, it has the Bosch C35AC0 Quick Connect Cable Harness for C3 Battery Charger with Built-in Cable Fuse to which the battery clips are then connected. This harness provides the option -- which I didn't test -- of being left attached to a battery to provide a simpler and surer connection of the charger, and is especially useful for infrequently used batteries that are maintained on trickle charge (for example, boats, classic cars). Also, if the charger is to be used by someone who just can't understand the concept of where to connect the clips, this is an excellent accommodation. If you use the charger with multiple batteries, you might consider getting some/all of them their own harnesses. Additionally, my experience is that this is the part of a charger most likely to be damaged, and it is an advantage that it is easily replaceable.Although the manual is very short, it could be much better organized and laid out. Before you get to the two pages of operating instructions, it has four pages of warnings that should be obvious to almost anyone likely to be using this charger. I know that these are required to be there, but the way they are presented may well cause impatient or easily frustrated people to just stop reading. The big annoyance involves a very nice feature: The cover folds out so you can see a keyed picture of the charger while you are reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the legend for the keys (numbers) is not provided until after those names are being used (in the ""Warnings""). And the basic instructions for operating the charger, including turning it to Standby before unplugging, is not in the ""Operating Instructions"" but part of a long individual ""Warning"" at the end of the ""Warnings"" section, and consequently easily to miss.DEFICIENCY: The manual for this product is available only as hardcopy. Because so many of my product manuals are available in electronic form, my ""bookshelf"" is on my computer and portable devices. This had the advantage of not only having manuals readily available and easily searchable, but it is easy for me to add annotations and bookmarks (I use the free FoxIt Reader as alternatives to Adobe Acrobat as well as Nitro PDF Professional V6 that is much cheaper than Acrobat, especially during its frequent sales and rebate offers).DEFICIENCY: No registration for this product. In the old days of mail-in registration cards, processing them was often an expense that wasn't worth it. But on-line registration is very inexpensive and something I would think well worth it for notifying customers in case a problem/defect is discovered in this product.What were they thinking?: The manual suggests using the packaging for storage, but that packaging is probably too fragile for anything but infrequent use where you are very careful taking it out and putting it back in: The cover is very thin plastic (reinforce-able or mend-able with normal packaging tape), and the base is a little more substantial. The packaging is closer to what you want to minimize the amount going into the waste stream.========================Advice for purchasers:The manual tells you to cycle the charger into standby mode (blue ring) before unplugging it (but doesn't say whether that is to protect the device or you). I found this to be non-obvious and thus hard to remember. I used my label maker to put this reminder on the charger (but Bosch, it would be nice if you had this on the next version).-- Douglas B.

"The manufacturer's product literature says that the dog and cat versions are identical except for the dog/cat distinction on the outer packaging (and minor color differences). Consequently, I am reviewing this for both cats and dogs. My examples skew feline because my cat had the most transparent reactions (as should be expected).Be aware that it is _not_ what most people first think of when they hear ""fountain"" (from the description). Instead it is a wide horizontal spray that can be somewhat above the water surface, but not high enough for it to register with me as a ""fountain"". Or, the water level may be set to have the outlet at or below the surface, creating a broad current or, in smaller bowls, a churning.My assessment was that this device offered no benefit over my current habit of frequently changing the water in the  bowl, and that the device had the substantial negative of creating a hassle that I expect would decrease that frequency.  However, since I had been given this for evaluation, I felt I couldn't simply report it got a solid thumbs-down at my house because I might be an outlier. So I loaned it to a neighbor with a dog and two cats, but it was quickly returned -- the device and the flow generated at lowest setting ""overwhelmed"" their water bowl. I then loaned it to another neighbor who has dogs, and again it was rejected. While I would have preferred that they had given their pets more time to habituate to it, I was asking a favor of them and their negative reactions were strong.The basic problem was that the pets that weren't repelled by it didn't find it attractive enough for the owners to deal with the device.1. Does the device actually encourage more drinking? Not that any of us saw. Often the contrary.2. The power requirement limits where you can locate the bowl, not just proximity to an electrical outlet but where the cord won't get in the way (tripped over).3. Changing the water in the bowl becomes slightly more time consuming with the device. When taking the bowl to the sink to empty and refill, you need to unplug/replug: I found myself shifting to topping-off instead of rinse-refill. Although the device is easily detached from the bowl, my inclination was to rinse without doing so. Note: Unlike many pet owners, I choose to not have the water bowl in my kitchen, which may create a different cost/benefit calculus for me.4. The water level in the bowl needs to be more closely monitored. First, its surface relative to the outlet port determines the effect (spray above surface vs churning of surface). However, you can't let it get to low or the motor will lose suction and burn out. Although the bottom of the device is less than 1/4-inch high (suction cups not depressed), suction may well be broken before dropping to this level, but this level is not documented.(3) and (4) were tradeoffs that convinced me and my auxiliary testers that it wasn't worth using. I am sensitive to these tradeoffs because I got the original Drinkwell many years ago (late 1990s?) but gave up on it after a few months because cleaning was so difficult that it was preferable to let that cat ""remind"" me to let him drink from the sink faucet.Bowl size: Although this will _physically_ fit nicely in small bowls commonly marketed for cats and small dogs (eg 5.5""d x 2.5""h, 3 cups), the lowest speed setting on the pump produces vigorous flow across the full surface, which seemed to be off-putting. A larger bowl of 7.5 inch diameter leaves some calmer areas. A larger bowl is also needed to accommodate the narrowed range of water depth (see 4 above). The device displaces about 1/2 cup in the bowl. For determining what diameter bowl you need to accommodate the water consumed between refills: The outlet is 1.5 inches above the bottom of the device.Water temperature: Because the pump sits inside the bowl of water, it warms the water noticeable. During the attempted habituation, I put my finger in the bowl (to try to encourage the cat) and noticed that it had become lukewarm in only a few hours. I had put out a second bowl, in a less convenient location as an alternative, at the same time and its water was still chilled. I don't know if this is an issue for the pet.Fragile cord: The first 21 inches of the cord have heavier insulation, but it becomes a very thin, light weight cord. I am sensitive to this because my cat ""explores with his mouth"" and particularly like to chew on cables. But this would also seem to be a problems for some dogs, such as the Terriers, Miniature Pinschers, Chihuahuas..., that seem ""programmed"" to at least give such a good grab and shake (or at least those of my friends engage in this, but they weren't part of my test). This seems to be a common enough concern that it should have been part of the design. As an illustration of how common it is for cats to chew wires and cables, there is a product called ""split loom tubing"" whose intended use is for cable management in automobiles, computers, office furniture..., but is also used by cat and dog owners to ""armor"" cables. Guess what? Shortly after I did a search on Amazon for this product in bulk, I got one of those ""other products you might be interested in"" emails featuring cat products, but not cable management.Color: Since both cats and dogs have good perception of the color blue, this device was probably very prominent in the water bowl, especially when coupled with the sound and water ejecting from it. My cat found it threatening -- he braced to receive an attack as he maneuvered around it to get to his food. I might have been more successful at habituation if I had gone in steps, first putting the unplugged pump in the bowl and only later turning it on. After belatedly turning it off, I couldn't ""un-ring the bell"" -- my cat continued to be visibly afraid of the device and avoided the bowl until I removed it.Note: there is a _possibility_ that the white version might not have been as visually intrusive.Noise: The noise was acceptable for me, but not for my cat. There are lots of similar motor noises in my house and my cat dashes up to investigate when they turn on (he is very brave with me there as ""backup""). However, this was a noise that he found very threatening -- remember that cats and dogs both hear high frequency sounds that humans don't and the pump is interacting with the water, the bowl and the surface it sits on.""Not attractive"" examples:Example: The neighbor with dogs has a small fountain in the backyard that the dogs like to drink from, but it quickly gets dirty from debris that continually falls from a nearby redwood tree. Although the dogs would drink from the bowl with the Drinkwell at night when the doggie-door was locked (skunks and raccoons), when they had a choice, they would bypass the bowl for the outdoor fountain.Example: The cats that loved to use their paws to drink from dripping facets and garden hoses had no use for this device.My guess is that our pets like a narrower stream of water, rather than the flat spray produced by this device.Possible drinking problem for cats:1. Cats do _not_ lap up water the way dogs do. Instead, the impact of their tongue on the water creates a very directed ""splash"" up into their mouth. The agitation produced by the pump _might_ impede a cat's ability to create this controlled splash.2. When a cat dips its paw to drink, you can see the water droplets on top of the fur and it seems unlikely that the water penetrated to the skin. However, the force of water coming out of the pump would likely push the water all the way through to their skin -- that they don't like this is the basis of the advice to use squirt bottles for interrupting bad behavior.-- Douglas Moran","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XKO1DYD8AGTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QGYY92#wasThisHelpful","R2XKO1DYD8AGTM","AHPV4F8IVSC39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHPV4F8IVSC39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, be aware that some other reviewers, including highly credible ones, reported their cards as being slow and having memory errors. But for the one memory card I tested, I found no such problems.Speed: I was able to get 18-19MB/sec reads (advertised as ""up to"" 20) and 13-14MB/sec writes (advertised 15) for a collection of 200-400MB video files using my best memory card reader. 30-40% slower for collection of 1-4MB photo files (8-9MB/sec writes). See ""Appendix"" below for how I conducted this test.No normal case: Many memory cards come with a case that you can put in a pocket of a camera case, ... This has no such case, but the plastic packaging can function as a very light-weight case (albeit much wider than it need be).Reliability: I first used the built-in error-checking function (trivial check), then copied 13-14GB of photo and video files to the card (which formats down from the advertised 16GB to 14.8GB), then copied from the card to my hard disk and compared that to the original (using KDIFF3). I repeated this 3 more times with somewhat different collections of photos and videos. Before copying a new set to the card, I did a quick-reformat on the card (rather than deleting files). The binary comparison of the files retrieved from the card to the originals found no differences (no memory errors, reading or writing).  Rationale: Pushing and pulling data in long continuous runs often reveals errors that show up only infrequently in normal intermittent use, but I don't know if these few reps were enough to trigger this effect for this category of product.---------Appendix: Speed Test Set-up:Readers: I tested using two readers, one than came built-in to one of my computers and one of the sort of cheap plug-ins you get for transfers when you aren't really concerned about speed. Both were less than a year old. The latter under-performed the former by 33-50%. So when you read other reviews, be aware that performance may be limited by the reader. Downloading directly from my somewhat-dated camera was worse, but since its spec recommended only Class 6 for video it is not surprising that it didn't provide faster USB transfers.Files: I created two sets of test files from actual photos and videos already transferred to my computer.  The first was a large collection of photos (JPEGs), ranging from 1-4MB. The second was a series of video (AVI) ranging from 200-400MB. My collection of photo files transferred at about two-thirds the rate of my collection of video files, and part of that may be attributed to the hard disk and its file system -- I saw a somewhat slower transfer speed moving those files between hard disks as I created the testing sets. Since the collection of 200-400 MB video files transferred at close to the advertised speeds, I didn't try collections of other sizes of files.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V9RBALDOFVPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TS1IG4#wasThisHelpful","R2V9RBALDOFVPZ","AHPV4F8IVSC39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHPV4F8IVSC39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It takes a really bad movie to make Liam Neeson boring, and this is such a movie. The plot is a collection of blatant ripoffs from other movies that were mindlessly cobbled together. In this category of movie, the ""MacGuffins"" (or plot coupons) don't need to make a lot of sense because the action and pacing is _supposed_ to pull the viewers along, and not let them recognize that it is a MacGuffin, much less linger on it. This movie fails in both regards. First, the MacGuffins are so in-your-face preposterous that I couldn't not think about them. Second, the slow pacing of the movie didn't give me the opportunity to ignore how preposterous they were. Third, the action sequences are boring because they are mundane technically and I had no investment in any of the characters or in the story.Liam Neeson's performance most of the time feels like a reading during a walk-thru (possibly one to determine why a scene isn't working). A photo of January Jones (the wife, third-billed) seems to have more on-screen time than the actress herself, and even when she is on-screen, the script and director seem to use her as little more than a mannequin. Diane Kruger (second-billed) gives a much more animated performance, but the script has her character as such an incoherent combination of parts that it comes across as ""sound and fury, signifying nothing"".The preposterousness of the plot is hard to even partially explain without spoilers, but here's what I can say: The impetus for the whole story is Neeson's character leaving his briefcase at the airport, something that that character would _never_ have done. When he comes out of a coma four days after an accident, he finds that no one came to the hospital looking for him. Whether he is the real Dr. Martin Harris, an impostor, or something else, I could not conceive of any circumstance where he would not have been missed and someone would have tried to find him, and succeeded. When what is really happening is finally revealed, it only confirms how preposterous this MacGuffin was. Similarly, the bad guys attempting to kill him makes absolutely no sense from their perspective, and it is there simply to enable various chases and fights.The two Dr. Martin Harrises are impossibly perfect in their identical knowledge of events and trivia. Not just far, far more than the plots requires, but detrimental to the plot. And preposterous relative to what the viewer eventually learns.The best example of the how lazy and ill-conceived the script is can be seen in the coded message MacGuffin: The message is something that could have been trivially memorized. Even if there were some reason to write it down, it would have drawn no attention as clear text. In fact, the only purpose of the trivial encoding is to draw the attention of the characters to that information and its importance.The MacGuffin of none of Dr. Harris' scientific collaborators being able to identify him is a ""homage"" to the 1920s and 1930s when long-distance travel was difficult and expensive.  The update is inconsistent. He talks with the collaborators on the phone, but doesn't use video chat -- an international collaboration is more likely to use Skype than traditional telephony. He has a web page with a picture on it, but none of the collaborators had visited it. Although to be fair, there are plenty of other movies in that category committing similar sins.The over-arching MacGuffin here, involving genetically-modified organisms, is so in-your-face stupid and nonsensical that  middle-school students are likely to spot it and be insulted, unless they had already given up on the movie.For the inevitable (negative) comments citing ""willing suspension of disbelief"": This normally applies only to a few contrivances _necessary_ to enable the plot (example: awaking from a 4-day comma alert and physically robust). Wholesale lack of internal consistency in the story is acceptable only for full-throttle action thrill-rides such as ""24"", parodies,...Added 11/28/2011: Using a crossword puzzle as an analogy to the plot puzzle presented to the movie's viewers: When you finally get the ""solution"", you discover that the clues fit together only if you misspell some words and enter wrong words as answers to others.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXCUWFYJOE3HH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004A8ZX28#wasThisHelpful","RXCUWFYJOE3HH","AHPV4F8IVSC39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHPV4F8IVSC39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Solid, well-built. Excellent connection of the hood to the cable (there appears to be a sleeve that extends up the cable from the hood to protect this vulnerable location).My use is undemanding, transferring pictures from a digital camera, and there were no problems. There is no noise filter, but at this (short) length, you probably won't be using the cable in a location where this would be an issue.Clearance: The hoods are the same size as on my other HDMI cables (not slim, not fat).Grip-ability: below average. On the HDMI hood, the ribs on the top and bottom provide an adequate, but less than good, grip. The ripples on the sides are totally ineffective--even in the best of conditions, my hands slipped over them. There are no ribs on the mini-HDMI hood, but the raised labeling provides some texture. In a standard home/office environment, I had no problem pulling out the connectors.  However, if your grip is weak or you are likely to have sweaty hands, you might want to look for a more textured hood. However, there seem to be relatively few manufacturers of this type of cable and the ones I have seen all have the similar limitation.The 1-star deduction is for the grip-ability since this is a cable that one tends to connect and disconnect often.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28VJI33X47BDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CLYEAK#wasThisHelpful","R28VJI33X47BDV","AHPV4F8IVSC39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHPV4F8IVSC39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this book because I heard that it had been widely read in the Obama White House as background for decisions on the Afghan war. Although the lessons of Vietnam are unquestionably relevant, I found nothing in this book that added non-trivially to what is already known. Nor was there a whiff of a fresh perspective. Nor was it a clearer, more concise distillation of those lessons--to the contrary, this book felt bloated with irrelevant trivia.This book fails as both a history of the US escalation in the Vietnam war and as a history of Bundy's role in those events.  It fails in the latter because it is an incredibly shallow account. It fails at the former because its focus on Bundy causes a lot to be left out. The author collaborated with Bundy on an unfinished account of this period and the reader would expect that to have produced innumerable insight. Wrong. The vast majority of this book is what one would expect of a mediocre historian with limited access to Bundy's papers and then having an interview with Bundy lasting an hour or two.There are reviews such as Richard C. Holbrooke's in the NY Times ""Book Review"" that find the book interesting for Bundy's ""tortured"" search for self-understanding (""Bundy emerges as the most interesting figure in the Vietnam tragedy -- less for his unfortunate part in prosecuting the war than for his agonized search 30 years later to understand himself.""), but then characterize that search as unsuccessful. I would recommend the Holbrooke review as giving a better sense of Bundy than this book.There are bizarre gaps and non-sequiturs. For example, the ""Weekend Cable"" that initiated the effort to remove Diem was send while Bundy and other senior advisers were out-of-town for the weekend. The author treats this as a fait accompli and hence not Bundy's responsibility. But Bundy's assistants played a leading role in its formulation and there was a large gap before the coup happened (three months), allowing plenty of time to reverse it. And there is no attempt at an explanation of why Kennedy decided not to wait to hear from his senior advisers before approving such a major policy change.The participants in the decision-making process are portrayed as individual actors, resembling professors at a departmental faculty meeting. Large assessment efforts are reported as if they were individual efforts of the person in contact with Bundy (eg, George Ball at State). At no time did I get a sense of them as part of larger organizations. If this lack of awareness of organizational behavior was Bundy's, it should have been highlighted by the author. Whatever the explanation, ignoring the vast knowledge in this area renders this account incompetent.I was surprised that this book didn't provide a description of Bundy's job, National Security Advisor--or why it came about, or what Presidents Kennedy and Johnson expected of that position. Although the expectations have varied between presidents, a common thread has been to coordinate, challenge and integrate the input from State, Defense, CIA..., thereby reducing the unavoidable institutional bias, blindspots... making the result be greater than the sum of the parts.The book largely ignores organizational bias (""When the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail""): For example, the tendency of the military is to re-conceptualize a war into one it has trained to fight instead of doing what is needed to win. In Vietnam, the lack of a meaningful strategy allowed this to occur unchecked. In Iraq, Cheney-Rumsfeld deliberately marginalized the generals who had learned the lessons of Vietnam and supported generals who pursued strategies and doctrines that were un- or counter-productive, but ""politically correct"".The writing style is mediocre to poor. The author dispenses lots of minor facts and quotes without trying to establish any coherence. Most of the details are the gossipy little things that establish insider credentials, but don't advance understanding of events. Items that feel very germane are mentioned, but never followed up on. For example, the book mentions that Bundy's assistant Mike Forrestal regarded Bundy's intellect as ""two steps below..."" but doesn't provide a basis or context. Another example, in an early meeting on Vietnam, President Johnson is reported as making two unsuccessful attempts to get his advisers to think more freely about events by using analogies (pp 123-4). The first attempt was a risque analogy (typical Johnson) that was laughed off. The second was not understood as such by the advisers, nor by the author. This misinterpretation by the author of something that seemed glaringly obvious to me undermined the credibility of his accounts of Johnson behavior.The book has a moderate dose of JFK worship, about what one should expect for this category. While this produced the usual un-asked and un-answered questions, they are so peripheral to this book that they were of little consequence. The usual worshipful speculation that if JFK had lived, he would not have continued making bad decisions about Vietnam makes for a final chapter that can be skipped.By page 104, I was ready to give up on the book but plodded on. What had been covered were two points. First, Bundy was considered among the very brightest, but the evidence is only the positions he occupied, not what he had done. Second, President Kennedy had a raft of advisers who persistently gave him bad advice which he challenged and rejected. Little mention of any advisers giving him good advice and no explanation of why he kept advisers that had ill-served him.The remainder of the book focuses on 1964-65 and the decisions and non-decisions leading to escalation. It enumerates the various assessments that Bundy chose to ignore, but Bundy goes no further than to claim that he thought he knew better. I didn't spot anything that you wouldn't find in any competent political history of these events and this period.The author's questioning of events come in belated spurts, with no attempt to provide answers. For example, the questions about what happened in the first part of the book don't come until page 136, and the questions for the remainder of the book don't occur until roughly page 214.The book is laid out purely chronologically. However, the chapters that break up this chronology into segments have as their titles the purported ""lessons"" of this book, even though there is no corresponding thematic organization.  Ignoring this, the lessons are poorly supported by what you will find in the book. Examples:Lesson 1 is ""Counselors Advise but Presidents Decide"" and is transparently disingenuous to anyone with experience in organizational behavior. It has often been pointed out that the decision about what are the choices can be more important than the ultimate choice (the book acknowledges the most transparent of these tactics: Providing only non-viable alternatives to the choice you advocate). Decision-makers have to count on their staffs to identify and explore alternatives and options and to provide the pros and cons needed to make the choice. Bad advisers subverting the decision process has been an issue since time immemorial. Sometimes the leader has created an organization culture that leads to bad advice; sometimes he is a captive of the advisers he inherits. For example, in May 2011, Obama passed over his reported choice for Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine General Cartwright, because of opposition from the military establishment and Republican senators. Cartwright's sin was to have responded to Obama's request for options on Afghanistan with true alternatives to the policy advocated by the military establishment.Lesson 2 is ""Never Trust the Bureaucracy to Get It Right"" but the evidence is that the (civilian) bureaucracy got it ""close enough""--they identified problems, produced reasonable assessments and pushed them upward--but their assessments were suppressed and ignored by the politicians, their appointees and a few (upper-level) members of the bureaucracy who were politically ambitious or excessively accommodating.  The same thing happened in the Iraq war as the Cheney-Bush administration not only suppressed intel and professional planning, but inserted their political operatives into the bureaucracy to produce the desired intel and recommendations.A lesson of Vietnam _should_ have been that bad political leadership can severely warp a bureaucracy. For example, the CIA learned that truth-telling would damage one's career and consequently assessments were fudged, shaded and muted. The accounts of the lead up to the Iraq war indicate that the lessons of Vietnam _were_ understood by the CIA professionals--they pushed back hard against intense brow-beating by top aides to VP Cheney and were defeated only when Cheney-Rumsfeld created an intelligence office staffed by partisans.  Similarly for the military, most prominently General Shinseki whose career was effectively ended for speaking truth to power. What was left were generals who were willing to feed the Bush administration's delusions, for example, after reaching Baghdad, Gen. Tommy Franks, rather than working to secure the country, was pursuing a plan for total withdrawal of US troops within 60 days, even though the plan's ""peacekeeper"" replacements were non-existent (other countries were resoundingly rejecting the US pleas for such troops).Lesson 5 is ""Never Deploy Military Means in Pursuit of Indeterminate Ends"". You would think that this would explore the change in psychology of what can and must be done. You would think it would explore the effects of ambitious military officers and their allies in the press and politics attempting to dictate policy, and give examples. You would think that it would follow up on an earlier quote about the civilian authorities having the most control over the military before deployment and then quickly losing it to events and the military experts. However, you would be very, very wrong: The accounts of the politics after escalation were no different from before.Absent a meaningful strategy, the military services focused on showing that the type of war they _wanted_ to fight was what would win the war, rather than adapting their operations to what was actually _needed_ to win (Marine Corps was a partial exception). This encouraged inter-service rivalry, not cooperation. This led to misleading measures (body count) and counter-productive operations (search-and-destroy rather than protection of the population). Also, the military leadership warped the organizational culture, becoming focused on careerism (""ticket-punching"": rotation through jobs at a pace that typically didn't allow one to become effective before moving on). Note: These assessments of the military mistakes are not mine, but the broad consensus of military officers and military historians.The author's reliability suffered when he credulously plugged in a quote from his collaboration with Bundy: ""No one asks ahead of time what kind of war it will be and what kind of losses must be expected. The military of 1965 was almost trained _not_ to ask such (cowardly?) questions"" (pg 182). This is false. To the first part: History is littered with states very explicitly _asking_ these questions and shaping their military and war plans accordingly. To the second: The US military started using Operations Research during WW2 to assess military plans, both damage inflicted and casualties. Robert McNamara became famous for his role in this work (bombing of Japan). During the Korean war, they could often accurately predict how many casualties would result from taking a hill or moving down a mile of road. They used this not only to try to ensure they had adequate forces, but to have adequate capabilities to evacuate and treat the casualties (this became part of an episode of the TV series M*A*S*H). The interesting, and unasked, question is why Bundy believed this, even in retrospect.The author refers to a second rationale for escalation, but doesn't follow up or even expand upon it enough for most readers to recognize the full argument.  The phase repeated several times is ""visibly _do_enough_ in the South"" with the explanation that this meant blood and treasure (eg pg 221).  This argument was the inverse of avoiding being seen as a ""paper tiger"": It saw Vietnam as an _opportunity_ to demonstrate to the Soviet Union and China that the US had the strength and national will to absorb significant combat casualties, and taking those casualties in an irrelevant war that we knew we could not win made it an even stronger demonstration.My background: I was a teenager during the 1960s in a conservative rural village. When the older brothers of friends came back from their first tour, I was surprised at what they said. They saw the SVN government as corrupt and incompetent, and said that most of the peasants hated it and supported the VC despite their brutality. Even though they saw the war as unwinnable, some were volunteering to go back immediately for a second tour (I didn't understand this until years later). For my 9th grade geography class, I chose Vietnam as the country to report on. The history I found in the public library contradicted much of what the government was saying and I presumed that we were being lied to. When the Pentagon Papers came out, I discovered the situation was much worse: That our leaders couldn't be bothered to do basic ""homework"" before asking Americans to die for their country. I was hoping that this book would answer why the official most responsible for putting together this information (Bundy) didn't know what an 9th grader and various Marine riflemen knew.-- Douglas Moran","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30LKAHY00NR5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KAB4SI#wasThisHelpful","R30LKAHY00NR5E","AHPV4F8IVSC39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHPV4F8IVSC39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For most books, I read large portions at once, but with this book, I couldn't get through any of the short chapters without putting the book down, often several times. In Chapter 5, at about page 80, I gave up and started jumping forward but continued to find the same deadly dull writing. Instead of writing that pulls the reader in and then forward, the book treats the reader more like a captive audience, for example at a mandatory motivational presentation, and one that can be bludgeoned into agreement using pointless statistics and repetition of its perspective. If the book hadn't included biographic details, I would have guessed that the author's background was in Marketing or PR and that she had no feel for, or interest in, the subject matter. I would not have believed that she had actually played any of the games being discussed, or done much more than briefly watch. And the author's description of the critical concept of ""flow"" is so very bad that I had to wonder if she understood it.The book bounces between the abstract vision and overviews/mechanical descriptions of specific games. Although there some _generic_ guidelines about what makes for successful games, there are little on why certain games became successful and others failed. I expected this book to go far beyond what a perceptive individual would have discovered while playing games, but I don't remember a single such insight. My childhood was more than 40 years ago, and most of what I encountered in this book I learned then from non-computer-based games--we were constantly adapting games to meet changing circumstances and to keep them fresh. I am painfully aware that modern children are deprived of this experience by organized youth activities and video games, but this book offers much too little to link modern childhood experiences, good and bad, to what it takes to make a successful game. For example, in the Harry Potter series, the game Quidditch is one that no one would actually want to play, but when I have mentioned this to various children, I get blank looks. Although this book contains the information needed for this judgment, it is not structured in a way that one would likely to discover it.The style of the book is likely to be aggravating to a large portion of the potential audience. In addition the proselytizing style of ""Here is what I want you to believe"" (above), there is extreme partisanship for computer-based/computer-mediated games that conveys an active contempt for reality. I misinterpreted the title, thinking that the book would be about how to apply lessons learned from computer-based games to the real-world. Instead, the book repeatedly asserts that reality is inherently boring and that work needs to be come part of the fragment of the universe of games that she calls ""games"". The book ignores that many people find their work so interesting that they sacrifice other portions of their lives.  Similarly for traditional  hobbies. When I arrived at MIT in 1969, we freshmen were cautioned to delay for a year taking courses based upon that earliest of computer games, called ""programming"", because it could be so addictive that we might slight our other courses (many of us ignored this advice). If you look at programming-in-the-small and various software engineering methodologies such as Rapid Prototyping, you will see that they meet the criteria for being games. And listening to people in other professions, I often hear description of work structured as a game.The book has opaque expectations of its audience. On one hand, the descriptions of the types of games that she focuses on are geared to those with little or no experience with such games. But this audience is ill-served because she fails to use larger universe of games and game-like activities to provide the intuitions and other hooks to better understand what she is saying about her type of games. On the other hand, those that are familiar with those games get no reward for slogging through what they learned way back when they first started playing those games.What I expected from a book on computer-based games were observations that were applicable to the larger universe of games and game-like activities. Computer-based games have substantial advantages for researchers. The computer itself supports substantial cheap instrumentation of the game for large numbers of subjects. The tethered nature of play simplifies adding sensors, such as heart rate monitors and eye-trackers, to the players and coordinating that data with what is happening in the game. And elite players are easier to recruit because many of them are in the same communities as the researchers (versus Olympic or professional athletes). Although the book mentions such research being done, only abstract, high-level mentions of the _results_ are given.The author's partisanship for her small category of games apparently causes her to be oblivious to an apparently large body of knowledge on games in general (impression based upon my repeatedly bumping into that work despite it being far from my area of expertise). The  author talks about how her type of games change people, but fails to acknowledge, much less utilize, observations about how different choices of children's games interact with culture. A culture chooses games that reflects its values, and the games shape the children--their skills, their attitudes, their personalities--to reflect those values. But more than that, success in those games is postulated to have a role in sexual selection that skews the population towards those genetically predisposed for those values.The most famous quote about games is ""The battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton"" (attributed to Wellington) but I didn't find it in this book. It is the likely inspiration for various organizational psychologists and military historians to ruminate on similar linkages. And there were a series of psychological studies starting around 1970 to correlate various personality attributes of professional football players not only to the position they played, but how they worked and socialized within the team.And this partisanship seems to be responsible for the author ignoring a large class of games that would seem to fit within her vision. For example, one of the earliest video games was developed in the late 1960s to help teach geometry to children, first in high school, then elementary school (Logo Turtle, Seymour Papert et al), with the virtual turtle later being supplemented with physical robots.Similarly absent is the massive overlap of her games with simulators oriented to the real-world. It is hard to imagine a book like this that doesn't mention the 1984 movie The Last Starfighter that linked video game mastery to heroic real-world performances. Instead, what the reader gets are insipid statements that games like ""Guitar Hero"" help develop a few skills relevant to real-world practitioners.Instead of the author insisting that her thesis/vision is correct, she should have showed/persuaded me.-- Douglas Moran","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBC8P8C7OKB5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594202850#wasThisHelpful","RBC8P8C7OKB5K","AHPV4F8IVSC39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHPV4F8IVSC39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Teaser: Discover how Fox News is part of the Liberal conspiracy to destroy America, as are the Weather Channel, ESPN, ...This is a review of how well/poorly the book delivers on what it advertises itself to be. It is _not_ about politics, except as necessary for examples.I picked up the book because I dislike much of what I see from Hollywood, both in terms of themes and portrayal of characters. I knew from the summaries that I would disagree with much of the author's politics -- I am 60 and grew up in a conservative rural village whose values differed from those of modern (post-Reaganite) conservatives -- but I didn't see that difference as a problem because I was interested in the observations, analysis and perspective of a critic from within Hollywood. My training in advocacy -- political and commercial marketing -- was to seek out and pay close attention to those with different perspectives, especially your critics, competitors, and opposition, because that was one of the best ways to find weaknesses in your ideas and in the presentation of those ideas and thereby improve your case (ideas and presentation).The overriding problem with this book is that it has all the hallmarks of the author never having heard even the slightest challenges to what he is saying, and thus it is littered with silly, stupid and disingenuous statements, obvious contradictions and gross hypocrisies. For example, the book would have you believe the teaser above (and explained below). If I hadn't felt so ill-served by the various reviews and recommendations, I would have simply stopped reading, but I felt I owed this review to other potential readers.  Plus, the book quickly became a train wreck that was too hard to look away from.What follows are examples of the failings of the various aspects of this book. However, if what you are looking for is a rant against liberals (rants of various flavors are a legit category of books), or you otherwise want to believe the book's thesis, I suggest that you skip to other reviews.One of the primary _advertised_ features of this book are the interviews with major Hollywood insiders. It would have been fascinating to read what those people said, and avoided saying, in response to probing questions from a conservative (or other person from an dissimilar viewpoint). Unfortunately, those _interviews_ are nowhere to be found in this book. What you do encounter are scattered short quotes that are indistinguishable from those he excerpted from what he had read.  I quickly came to discount the quotes: Many didn't support the claims he made of them and there was a rhetorical pattern of small, often fragmentary, quoting that is a strong indicator that the quotes were carefully selected and massaged to fit the preconceived thesis rather than having had any role in the development of that thesis. Since the author went to Harvard Law School, I am presuming that he is well-aware of basic rhetorical tactics and tricks (both detecting and using) and that their occurrences in this book are largely intentional. Additionally, when the background and perspective of the author and interviewees are as different as here, my experience is that I should expect to ""hear"" decidedly different ""voices"" in their quotes, as well as differences between the various interviewees. And that difference should be still be present even when the author paraphrases their comments. There was so little of this in this book that it raised humongous red flags about the representations of what was said.The author doesn't let facts, or ignorance of facts, get in the way of his thesis. Crucial to his explanation of how the Left controls Hollywood is that the advertisers have been duped by the networks about what shows to sponsor, sometimes with complicity of those in the ad agencies doing media buys (ad placement). He claims that the corporations (retailers and manufacturers) don't know who is buying their products or how customers make buying decisions.  He claims that there has been scant research in this area, and dismisses that research as tainted by methodological problems and the Leftist connections of the researchers. In the book's presentation of this topic, you won't find a mention of the corporations' marketing departments or of the portions of advertising agencies that develop campaigns, or ... (pp 10,...)The author totally discredits himself on his secondary thesis: That there is pervasive discrimination against conservatives in Hollywood. Note: I have no basis to judge whether or not this is true, I am simply saying that the book fails miserably in making this case.- The book's primary example of this discrimination is Michael Moriarty for being fired from ""Law & Order"". The book presents only his self-serving explanation -- one that doesn't pass a basic ""smell test"". A quick check on the web finds both an alternate explanation (""erratic behavior"") plus various pieces of evidence providing credence to that explanation (example: his overblown ego seems competitive with that of Charlie Sheen and Donald Trump). If political beliefs was the reason, why did L&O later hire Angie Harmon, someone who routinely appears on lists of prominent Hollywood conservatives?- The author's secondary example is himself (pp xvi-xvii). He recounts how he was supported by a top Hollywood producer (Goldberg), had his work actively shopped around by three agents, had support from an entertainment attorney whom he identified as a liberal, but that ""a producer on one of the shows"" said that he wouldn't work with the author (After reading this book, I too would refuse to work with the author, and it has nothing to do with politics). From this one person among many, in an extreme example of confirmation bias, the author decides that ""liberals employ a mirror form of McCarthyism on a large scale."" (pg xvi)- His third example is Patricia Heaton who says she is having difficulty with work because she is a conservative. Since she is currently starring in ""The Middle"" and formerly starred in ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", a detailed explanation is called for, but not even a hint is given. Neither is her situation compared and contrasted to prominent conservatives who seem not to have problems. While Heaton isn't in the top tier (eg Tom Selleck, Kelsey Grammer), she seems comparable to Angie Harmon who seems to have had consistent work (see her IMDB profile) and to have had no problem being hired by liberals since most of that work has been in what the author categorizes as part of the liberal agenda, for example ""feminist legitimization"".- The author also cites similar claims from unnamed conservatives, but he states he is unsure of the validity because ""many of those that complain that they can't get work _can't_ make the grade."" (pg xvi, emphasis in book)- Although the book mentions writer-producer Donald Bellisario (NCIS, JAG, Quantum Leap, Magnum PI, Airwolf,...) who is a highly visible conservative, there is no discussion of the success of people like him.And in all his interviews, the author apparently never thought to ask how liberals rationalized the claimed freezing out of conservatives.The primary thesis of liberal propaganda is pure conspiracy logic: If the author judges person A to be part of the conspiracy, then everyone who simply worked with A is probably part of the conspiracy, as is everyone who worked with them, ad infinitum.  Am I overreacting to mere hyperbole? In the Prologue (pg xii), he states that Hollywood is ""a carefully constructed mechanism designed by television's honchos to blow a hole in the dike of American culture. Television's best and brightest wanted to set American sliding down the slippery slope away from its Judeo-Christian heritage...And they succeeded. ... planned ... coordinated ... implemented by a vast group of like-minded politically motivated people..."" And when TV executives are quoted as wanting TV to be about ""more than just ratings"", the author interprets this as a desire to destroy American culture (What else could that phrase possibly mean?).The author seems to treat his proffered quotes with absolute credulity, not considering possibilities such as self-aggrandizement. Nor does he consider whether what the person reports happening did actually happen. And most importantly, he doesn't even think to ask whether the message that these people thought they were sending was the message being received.  The book's description of various shows, most significantly ""All in the Family"" and ""Family Ties"", have only a passing resemblance to what I saw in first run and how people around me reacted to them.The ""begats"" occupy a large portion of the book, but you might not want to skip them because intermixed in are analyses of TV shows that are hilarious for anyone not drinking the book's Cool-aid. For example, ""Charlie's Angels"" was part of the Leftist conspiracy to destroy America's values because ""Women were doing what men traditionally did and doing it well."" (producer Goldberg, pg 179). If you take this quote seriously -- although you shouldn't because the show was universally described at the time as ""T&A"" -- ask ""Why this show rather than the earlier 'Police Woman' (Angie Dickinson, 1974-78)? Or 'Honey West' (1965-66)? ""Basic human psychology is to try to impose an order on events even where there is none. Conservatives, with their belief in a simple, authoritative, powerful hierarchy, exacerbate this trait. Consequently, ""disorderly"" explanations -- involving statistics, game theory... -- tend to be rejected in favor of determinism via a hidden hand or conspiracy.  This book treats what seem to be normal business decisions, both good and bad, as a result of the liberal conspiracy.  Most notably he has a section ""Liberalism for Sweeps Week"" (pg 198) where his argument seems to rest on having causality reversed: He seems to assume that Sweeps Weeks _inherently_ have large audiences, thus the appearance of salacious and controversial material during those periods must be part of the liberal agenda to push that material at those large audiences, whereas the conventional explanation is that such material is emphasized during those periods to _draw_ large audiences because those ratings set advertising rates. His discussion of business and economics is a painful example of how badly our elite schools are failing to educate students.The overall writing style is vague and non-specific, making it virtually impossible to refute individual sections with facts or logic (because his defenders can easily claim that that is not what he meant). Instead there is a stream of assertions that will convince those already predisposed to believe, and probably no one else. Fortunately, it is not laden with the impenetrable terminology that emanates from Leftist echo chambers.  Some of the contradictions appear to be strategic, for example, despite the book claiming a vast monolithic Left-wing conspiracy, he has a brief passage on pg 13 saying that ""most"" and ""many"" Hollywood liberals do not engage in this conduct.  And in his final chapter, he presents himself as a reasonable constructive commentator, in stark contrast to what has come before.Over the years, there has been extensive discussion of how the aptitudes needed for various segments of the entertainment industry skew toward those that tend to be found in liberals/not found in conservatives.  For example, most successful comics are disrespectful of authority and the status quo. Although the book makes a few brief mentions of fragments of these ideas, it isn't enough to help the reader think about how much of the liberal-conservative imbalance is due to natural selection vs discrimination and conspiracy.  And much of the entertainment _industry_ is based on satisfying the human appetite to be stimulated by the new and different, yet the author seems to label any of this of which he disapproves as part of the conspiracy.Many of the contradictions appear to arise simply from him wanting to blame everything on the liberal conspiracy.  For example, narrow-casting ""inherently leads to liberalism"" by dividing us and hence liberals are behind destroying the broad-casting model (pg 10) but subsequently claims are that liberals are pushing broad-casting to reach large audiences.The author cites the comedic meme of mocking fathers as dating back to the ancient Greeks and Romans (Aristophanes and Plautus, pg 88) and yet he subsequently attacks writers working in this tradition for trying to destroy traditional values. While I would agree that this meme is badly overused, laziness and incompetence seem to be a better explanation than conspiracy (to paraphrase a traditional admonition).The book is advertised as providing an interesting conservative perspective on various classic TV series, but it is slight and shallow and often focuses on one or two specific offenses to conservatism. For example, in several places the book classifies ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" as a very conservative show but also places it in the liberal ""vanguard"" (pg 94) because an episode that involved a mistaken case of mistaken identity that was resolved when the other couple was discovered to be Black.  Since this was part of the book's criticism of ""realism"", was the unforgivable offense simply the very brief appearance of a Black couple onscreen?  The author denounces a variety of shows for the ""realism"" of including members of minorities and other groups, and then turns around and criticizes ""Law & Order"" for including too few minorities for ""realism"" (pg 202).This attack on L&O has long been shown to be disingenuous: L&O focuses on complex cases, often involving power, wealth and unusual intersections of law and morality. These cases don't have the same ethnic patterns as the vast majority of crimes (burglary, robbery, low-level drug dealing,...), contrary to the standard conservative attack on L&O. I am not arguing that L&O doesn't have a decided liberal viewpoint, but rather pointing out that the _book's_ portrayal and argument are dishonest.The author well knows that scripts for episodes may come from a writer with no previous or future association with the series (he describes shopping such a script in the Prologue).  Yet his analyses of series repeatedly use isolated episodes that are not representative of how I remember those series.  This is confirmation bias/cherry-picking to the extreme.The author's criteria for a show being part of the liberal conspiracy often seems to be that it isn't 100% what he regards as ""conservative"". For example, while acknowledging that ""The Simpsons"" targets everyone, the book classifies it as ""liberal nihilism"" because _some_ of those targets are conservatives. And in the Prologue (pg xi), he misrepresents the episode ""Something About Marrying"" (Season 16, Episode 345, 20 February 2005) as ""propaganda for liberal values"" because ""the City of Springfield was legalizing gay marriage"". However, if one were to actually watch the episode, or read a summary from the Web, you would find that legalization was a cynical mercenary ploy to bring in tourist dollars, that is, it was not support of gay marriage but exploitation of an underserved market. For show after show, the author equates a show's _mentioning_ a topic with promoting and propagandizing for the Leftist position on it.Similarly for people: Ted Turner is classified as part of the liberal campaign (pg 61) primarily for being a pioneer of cable channels (narrow-casting), but also mentioned are instances where he deviates slightly from modern conservatism, for example protecting habitat even though it is through a buffalo ranching business. However, not Rupert Murdoch, whose Fox News is based on narrow-casting and whose Fox Network is denounced in this book as having a much larger role in the liberal conspiracy (by coarsening the culture). Go figure.""Happy Days"" earns its spot in the liberal takeover of Hollywood on the basis of a couple lines of peripheral, seemingly innocuous dialogue in a single (unspecified) episode (out of 255). This is attributed to one of the writers unsuccessfully attempting to introduce the subtext of a foreshadowing of Vietnam into the series (pg 116). So  on one hand we are told of a lone writer unsuccessfully attempting to sneak liberal propaganda onto TV against the vision of the producer and the network executives (that the show be ""innocent"") and on the other hand we are told that all those people were part of a pervasive conspiracy. And since when is foreshadowing regarded as liberal propaganda? It is a basic story-telling technique, for example, it appeared in Homer's ""Iliad"". Author Shapiro points out that this attempt went undetected by everyone and thus is proof of how effective liberal propaganda is. Hold it: Its total ineffectiveness proves it was effective? By this point in the book you shouldn't be surprised that failure ""proves"" success, that an individual's isolated action ""proves"" conspiracy and that apolitical is political.So why are ""The Weather Channel"", ESPN, Fox News... subversive? In flailing about to create a vast Leftist conspiracy, the author includes cable channels / narrow-casting (above), not thinking through the implications.  This is a mistake he would not have made if he had made even the slightest attempt to be honest about this development. The conventional history is that cable TV systems arose to simply distribute broadcast TV in areas where reception was poor. In the mid-1970s, the technology and economics made possible  distribution of additional content to fill the vast amount of unused bandwidth on the cable systems. The cable company owners found it highly profitable to include these additional channels, and corporations and entrepreneurs found it highly profitable to create channels for underserved markets. While the author cites valid observations about _some_ negative social and political effects of this change, attributing it to a liberal conspiracy is indicative of the author's mindset.The book lists the top 15 current shows for Republicans (pg 255), but makes no attempt to reconcile these entries with previous criticism, for example ""Desperate Housewives"" (#10) which he had classified as having ""deep political content"" (pg 53). Similarly for ""Two and a Half Men"" (#15).Similarly for the author's own ""The Best Conservative Shows in Television History"":#6: ""Gunsmoke"":  Miss Kitty, one of the four main characters, is a career woman and business owner: a prostitute who became a madam (acknowledged within the show). And the show clearly implies a long-term sexual relationship (more than 20 years) with Marshall Dillon without the benefit of marriage. Yet the author condemns ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" for ""feminist legitimization"" (pg 36) because Mary has a career in traditional ""women's work"" (subordinate, supportive of male characters) while (unsuccessfully) seeking a husband.#3: ""Magnum PI"": Magnum lives like an indulged ""trust-fund baby"" -- lots of luxuries, negligible responsibilities -- in adolescent revolt against the authority/surrogate-father figure (Higgins).  The author likes the show because Magnum is presented as former military. But Magnum has neither military bearing nor attitudes: He is immature, undisciplined, dishonest, sloppy, imprecise, avoiding accountability. Boyish charm may cover a multitude of sins in Hollywood, but not in the military. Of the series' four main characters, the two representing Conservative values are a foreigner (Higgins) and a minority (T.C.). Not criticizing the show (it was very good), just the author's reasoning.#1: ""24"": Jack rejects the Rule of Law and traditional ethics for ""The ends justify the means"" (which may not qualify as even situational ethics). He has contempt for authority and the hierarchy. The show trashes the notion of ""Character counts"" by having anyone be trivially corrupted by the bad guys. The ""plots"" reject the belief in an orderly world, instead depending on a constant stream of deus ex machina.  There are career women in the workplace doing traditional men's work, and not only is Chloe far superior to the men in tech, women are among the front-line warriors, shooting and killing terrorists! The horror; the horror! And while the author has the violence here as cathartic, very similar violence in ""The Untouchables"" had previously been denounced as part of the liberal conspiracy.If you are seeking the unchallenging comfort of being deep inside an echo chamber, this book may fill that need.  However, if you are a critical reader or intellectually curious, this book will be an offense (whatever your politics).-- Douglas B.

"Basic construction: The back is a semi-rigid material that holds the case's shape, but allowing limited flexibility.  It has the feel of material that won't become brittle with use (but don't know about ""over time"").  It's corners are nicely rounded so that they are unlikely to poke you. The nylon fabrics (two types) on the remainder of the case _feel_ like ones that are tough and stand up very well to abrasion and other wear-and-tear (The manufacturer does not ID the fabric beyond ""nylon"").Zipper is large and robust, with nice pull tabs on the two sliders. The padding inside the case extends to form stiff lips under the zipper that serve to force the contents of the case inward, largely avoiding contact with the sliders and thereby avoiding jamming the sliders. However, if you overstuff the case, the contents can come in contact with the sliders. I _briefly_ experimented with the situation and the sliders push aside the thin fabric that was in their way.Opening: The zipper goes fully around three sides of the case, but there is an accordion fold that prevents you from fully opening the case. This is a good thing because you can open the zipper fully when hung on your shoulder or belt without the contents falling out. The accordion fold is almost 3 inches high and allows the top to open wide enough to easily pull out the largest object that fits inside (the basic opening is roughly the internal dimension and then there is additional ""give"" from the sides folding down and stretching).Padding is memory foam in a diamond pattern (similar to very low rise ""egg crate"").The internal pocket is at the back of the case that is created by a soft, stretchy fabric. It is 4 inches high and 0.5 inches deep (when stretched in neither direction).  With the case mounted on my belt, it was easy to reach my hand down all the way into the pocket.  However, the pocket doesn't seem to be a good match to my uses. It is bigger than needed to hold a extra memory card. I don't know what else I would put there: From other cases, my well developed reflex is to put the back of the camera against the back of the case, and this argues against having irregularly-shaped, hard objects in this pocket.The product literature cites the internal pocket as a good place to store things such as a USB cable. Possibly, but I wouldn't. In addition to the concerns above, I would worry about the ends working their way up in the pocket and protruding over the padding.Shoulder strap: It adjusts from 29 to 53 inches long (reasonable range). The connectors on the strap are excellent quality snap clips with swivels. However, the tabs on the case that the strap connects to seem to be very lightweight compared to everything else. Be aware that the strap itself is only 0.5 inches wide. For the likely weight of the camera in this case, this will likely become uncomfortable very quickly, so you will likely want to invest in a slip-on shoulder strap pad. For comparison, I have a camera case half this size whose strap 50% wider.Belt strap: The belt strap is fastened on the bottom with Velcro. I much prefer the arrangement where there is an second belt strap that is sewn to the case at both ends. While there a situations where the Velcro attachment has real benefits, most of _my_ usage is more appropriate for a fixed strap.  The problem with Velcro-only is that it slowly wears out with use, not just when you fully open it, but from all the tugs on the case that break only a few connections at a time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU2Y1HHS9VZZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OR14HI#wasThisHelpful","RU2Y1HHS9VZZT","AHPV4F8IVSC39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHPV4F8IVSC39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is much shorter than the page count implies because of the small size of the physical pages.  This is both good and bad.  It is a fast, entertaining, motivational read and covers an amazing amount of ground without becoming repetitive.  The problem is that it rarely dips below the identification and classification of good/bad bosses to give _usable_ explanations of what they were doing right, or what were the traps that caused well-intentioned bosses to do the wrong things.My experience mentoring people on these issues is that they immediately grasp the principles espoused in this book, but they have a hard time spotting the details in the workplace. A mark of being a good boss is that people don't notice what you are doing, but are merely aware of that things are going well (a point acknowledged in this book). And for bad boss, people tend to notice only where they are spectacularly bad and miss most of the components and contributing factors.Consequently, although the solo reader will likely find enough to justify time spent, this book seems intended to be a starting point for group discussions--whether it be a formal class, a gripe session, or... It would likely serve well to get the juices flowing and to provide topic outlines to focus the discussions.-- Additional thoughts --Especially noteworthy: Most management books focus on top management and mythologize their contributions. This book forcefully points the limits of management, and even ventures into the role of lower and middle management in protecting employees from the managers above them.  However, the book provides only faint images of what actually occurs.  For example, at an all-hands meeting for the division I worked in, the VP and Senior VP were openly derisive of the CEO's recent initiative because they needed to maintain credibility with ""the troops"".Although the author works in Silicon Valley (at Stanford U), the issues related to smaller technology companies are barely touched upon.  For example, in the literature on ""managing geeks"", a common observation--that I can personally attest to--is that a meeting that has sales and marketing pumped up will often have the engineers snickering, or at least rolling their eyes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O003TFRDD5ME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446556084#wasThisHelpful","R3O003TFRDD5ME","AHPV4F8IVSC39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHPV4F8IVSC39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Around nine years ago I had the opportunity to take a preaching class from Julius Kim, now I have the opportunity to review his first book on homiletics: ""Preaching the Whole Counsel of God"" (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2015).  This book is a detailed introduction to preaching and also includes some helpful notes on interpreting Scripture.  Basically, it’s an in-depth but concise resource for interpreting and preaching God’s Word from a Reformation point of view.The book has four main parts: 1) “Discovering the truth of the text according to the human author,” 2) “Discerning Christ in the text according to the divine author,” 3) “Designing the sermon according to truth, goodness, and beauty,” and 4) “Delivering the sermon for attention, retention, integration, and transformation.”  In these chapters, Kim emphasizes prayer, serious textual study, a Christ-centered study and sermon emphasis, sermon structure, application, illustration, and delivery (just to name the main parts).  I appreciate this book because it is balanced: Kim does a nice job of touching all the bases, so to speak.  There are even two example sermons for the reader to study.Although this book is under 250 pages, there is a lot of information between the covers!  I appreciated the section on the design and delivery of the sermon, where Kim gave 12 points on how the brain hears, retains, and listens to speakers.  For example, since studies (and experience!) have shown the brain can only retain so much, preachers should avoid preaching “fire-hose” sermons, where info gushes out like crazy.  This material on neuroscience and hearing/listening was mostly new to me, so I found it quite interesting and helpfulIf you’ve read other preaching books, some of the parts of this book will be a review.  This book, like most preaching books, talks about outline, structure, illustrations, application, and eye contact (for a few examples); though I had read or heard some of this material before, I appreciated reading it as a reminder of good study, sermon writing, and preaching habits.Do you need a Reformed, Christ-centered, and detailed introduction to preaching the Word?  I very much recommend this one: ""Preaching the Whole Counsel of God.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FM6XT671JO8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310519632#wasThisHelpful","R2FM6XT671JO8D","A33B3XCIXB4ZVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33B3XCIXB4ZVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you want a colorful book packed with cool facts and trivia about different countries and regions of the world, this is a good book to have!  Our boys (ages 7-13) really liked some of the cool trivia (for example, you'll read about a volcano that was heard 3,000 miles away when it erupted!).  I even enjoyed looking through it (the colorful landscape/rock of China was really fascinating!).If you're looking for a book with all the specific facts of a country/region, this won't be the book for you.  In fact, as some other reviewers noted, all the places in the book aren't technically countries.  Also, I was hoping for a little bigger cut-out on each page showing a little better where in the world each region/country is found.

"In a word, this book is an in-depth guide on how to make a local church one that is wholly involved in biblical counseling.  From a Baptist perspective, the book talks about biblical counseling in general, counseling and small group ministry, conflict resolution, training counselors, and it talks about counseling and evangelism/outreach. ""Biblical Counseling and the Church"" is a mini-library for churches who want to become counseling churches in a very purposeful way.I appreciated the chapter written for pastors: ""Dear Pastor: Shepherd God's Flock"" by Deepak Reju.  It was a good biblical reminder about a pastor's ""shepherd' duties.  I also thought the book was balanced and rounded; it covered many crucial topics that have to do with counseling and church life.  There were a lot of practical tips for church counseling - from starting a counseling ministry to expanding it and sharing the vision.  I also was glad to see a commitment to Scripture and a Christ-centered approach to counseling.  Those things are a must in biblical counseling!One weakness of the book, in my opinion, is the emphasis on small groups.  If your church doesn't have an ongoing and driven small group ministry, many parts of this book will not be relevant for you.  I'm not opposed to small groups, but such a focus on small groups sometimes makes it seem like small groups are the heart of the church.  Similarly, though there was a chapter and some discussion about counseling in smaller churches, I felt like the book was written mostly for larger churches (attendance over 150 or 200 up to several thousand).  I'm the pastor of a smaller church (between 50 and 100), and more than a few times I thought, ""But that won't work in a small church; it's not possible....""My final quibble with this book is that it is lacking in the area of ecclesiology/church polity.  As a Reformed pastor, I was frustrated by the lack of discussion about elders' roles and deacons' roles in the area of church counseling.  Several parts of the book aren't applicable to Reformed churches because of different polity.  I only point this out for readers who may be concerned about church polity and counseling; I do believe the book is a valuable resource for any reader who wants to learn more about biblical counseling in the church.Who should get this book?  It's perfect for Baptist churches looking to implement biblical counseling into the very fabric and structure of the local church.  Others will appreciate this book as well, since it does cover a variety of issues.  Even if you disagree with parts of it (as I did), I'm confident most readers will benefit from it.  Thanks to the editors, authors, and publishers for getting this out!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6FFCD9NMVTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310520622#wasThisHelpful","R6FFCD9NMVTU","A33B3XCIXB4ZVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33B3XCIXB4ZVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hesitated big time to spend this much money on a tablet/laptop.  I seriously was not sure that a $600 laptop would work for me just fine.  My thoughts after using the SP4 for a short time?  I like it very much!  Here are the pros/cons - from a first time Surface user:1) It is super fast (I have the 128GB 4GB Ram, i5).  This morning I turned it on and was checking email online in 10 or 15 seconds.  All the programs so far are very responsive for me.  The internet works fine, and it connected to my work printer quickly and easily.2) It is quite user friendly.  I've only used Windows 10 on a different laptop for a month or so, and now using this SP4 is easy.  I'm not a super-fan of Microsoft, but I'm not disappointed with Windows 10 on this SP4.3) It is very portable.  With the Microsoft Keyboard and a nice hard case, the SP4 looks sleek and is easy to carry around and use (note: it isn't ideal to type while the unit is on your lap).4) The pen is awesome.  The eraser works great, and the painting and note apps are sweet.  The way it is held magnetically to the tablet or keyboard is slick as well.5) All my plug and play hardware worked flawlessly (from a wireless USB mouse to a USB hub/converter for a different screen).CONS:1) Microsoft's apps suck.  I know this isn't specifically related to the SP4, but the email app isn't great, and there aren't a lot of other excellent apps.  (I have heard you can get an android emulator for the SP, FYI).2) The battery is just average - I wouldn't call it horrible, and I didn't expect it to last a super long time, but it's just average.3) I did have an issue that a few apps wouldn't open (e.g. mail and my Bible software program).  I had to google it and found a fix after about 30 minutes.  Not the end of the world, but a little frustrating.  It all works fine now, FYI.4) The keyboard isn't included in the price.  You have to buy it separately.  I knew that from the get go so it wasn't a surprise, but I think it's pretty dumb to have to buy a keyboard separately.In case you're wondering, there is a fan on this unit - but it's not too loud.  Also, I purchased mine from the Microsoft website, and it comes with a one year warranty.  Anyway, I could go on, but all this to say: I'm impressed, and so far I really like my SP4.  It's perfect for my studies, writing, internet use, music listening, and a few extras.  The price is up there, but if it lasts for me, I'd say it is worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34CWN6ZJFD5PE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01606KJ6C#wasThisHelpful","R34CWN6ZJFD5PE","A33B3XCIXB4ZVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33B3XCIXB4ZVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got my Surface Pro 4 a few days ago, and have been using this Urban Armor case along with it.  I do really like it; it is solid and sturdy, and won't really twist or bend too easily.

I did have to work just a little to get the SP4 into this case, and I did fudge up the corner of my screen protector doing so, but it's not really a big deal.Anyway, I do like this product and recommend it.  I haven't dropped my SP4 yet (I hope I don't!), but if I do, I do believe this case will protect the corners (FYI, it doesn't protect the screen).

"How do you explain the American sexual revolution that has been taking place since the sixties?  And what is the Christian church to do about it?  These are important questions for us to ask. If you want thoughtful and informed answers to these questions, you’ll want to get Albert Mohler’s new book, We Cannot Be Silent (Nashville: Nelson Books, 2015). The subtitle shows the aim of the book: “Speaking truth to a culture redefining sex, marriage, and the very meaning of right and wrong.”  In just over 200 pages, Mohler does a nice job explaining the sexual revolution, critiquing it from a Christian perspective, and offering constructive advice for how the church should move forward in the midst of this revolution.  It is a timely book for sure!Chapter one is a discussion of how the sexual revolution has affected culture.  Chapter two is a study of how the revolution has negatively affected marriage and family.  In chapters three and four, Mohler discusses homosexuality and transgender issues.  The next chapter (five) is a study of the changing and ultimately the end of marriage.  Chapter eight is a summary of Scripture’s teaching on sexuality, while chapter nine has to do with religious freedom.  Chapters nine and ten talk about how the gospel addresses sexuality and some major questions that arise from the topic of the sexual revolution.  The conclusion of the book is a response to the recent Supreme Court decision on gay marriage.One reason why I appreciated this book is because it clearly explained how the current sexual mess this nation is in finds its roots in the past – before the nineties – back to the sixties and before.  The gay marriage and transgender issues didn’t arise in the last five years out of a vacuum.  Mohler speaks well to this issue.  The book was also helpful in that Mohler did a nice job of explaining how deep and wide this sexual revolution has spread in our culture: it affects so many things, from high school sports to the military to tax laws to doctor’s offices to elementary school bathrooms.  The sexual revolution is a major movement that the church has to face; we cannot be silent!Mohler doesn’t just point fingers in this book; in fact, he doesn’t really point fingers in the bad sense of the term at all.  He examines, diagnoses, explains, and even notes that the Christian church has not always handled this revolution well.  So he gives a loving response on how we should go about dealing with the sexual revolution in a way that’s faithful to Scripture (in justice) but also radiates with love (in mercy).There is a lot of info in this book!  If you’re looking for a quick and light read, this is not it!  However, if you want a readable, yet reasonably in-depth look at the sexual revolution from a Christian perspective, please, get this book: We Cannot Be Silent.  It will be a help to the church as we stand on the truth of God, and speak it – with love!---NOTE: I reviewed this book as part of the Booklook bloggers program.  I was given the book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TIOBN9J7JRLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718032489#wasThisHelpful","R2TIOBN9J7JRLK","A33B3XCIXB4ZVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33B3XCIXB4ZVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are too many study Bibles.  If I’m not mistaken, there are at least fifteen conservative evangelical study Bibles on the market, maybe even twenty plus.  While this fact does make me somewhat cynical, I do think there is a place for a good study Bible on the shelf.  Since I have quite a few commentaries, I usually don’t buy study Bibles; I never did get the ESV study Bible.  However, when a review copy of the new NIV Zondervan Study Bible came in the mail, I was glad to have it after looking through it for just a few minutes.The general editor of this study Bible is D. A. Carson; associate editors include Richard Hess, T. D. Alexander, Douglas Moo, and Andrew Naselli.  In the preface, Carson noted several things about this study Bible: 1) the contributors acknowledge Scripture to be God’s authoritative Word, 2) it is based on the best-selling and most widely circulated translation, the NIV, a “smooth and faithful translation,” 3) it aims to provide answers to questions about Scripture, 4) it provides a wealth of charts, maps, photos, illustrations, and essays, and 5) it emphasizes biblical theology – it highlights the “way various themes develop within the Bible across time.”Various evangelical Baptist and Reformed scholars contributed the study notes: Bruce Waltke, Tremper Longman, Iain Duguid, Craig Blomberg, V. Philips Long, John Currid, (and others) along with Carson and the above named associate editors.  There are also 28 articles at the end of the book that cover biblical-theological themes like law, temple, wisdom, holiness, mission, justice, etc.  Contributors to these articles, along with the editors and others, include Andreas Kostenberger, Moises Silva, Henri Blocher, and James Hamilton Jr.Including the maps, articles, concordance, and charts, it is 2,880 pages long(!).  The study notes at the bottom of each page cover (on average) about 35-40% of the page (you can see page previews online).  Like most other study Bibles, there are helpful tables and charts at various places.  I especially liked the historical/archaeological pictures and also the charts on the OT festivals, the accusations leveled against Jesus, and Jesus’ trials (etc.).  The study Bible also comes with a code for free online access and free access on the Olive Tree app (iOS and Android).  These digital versions of this study Bible are nice; I did get the chance to download and explore them.One downside to this Bible is that it is massive: it weighs around 3.5 pounds and is nearly 3 inches thick.  It’s almost too big to carry around and use with ease!  I would rather have the extra essays and such in a separate companion volume than all packed into one.  The font is also a bit small in my opinion; though I realize larger font would mean an even bigger Bible.Another comment I have is that the biblical-theological emphasis of this study Bible is found mostly in the articles/essays at the end of the Bible.  Yes, the comments/notes do point to Jesus when applicable, but that aspect didn’t stick out for me as I read through many notes.Finally, there is the fact that this is an NIV study Bible.  The translation history of the NIV is somewhat cloudy in the last ten years or so; there’s been some controversy over the way the NIV has leaned recently.  This NIV is, as far as I can tell, the 2011 version.  I’m not an NIV expert, but it seems to me like this version has made a step back towards the 1984 NIV.  I compared quite a few verses, and it is quite similar to the 1984 edition.  The ESV is fine, but it’s not perfect, so I try to use several translations in my studies, including the NIV, NASB, NLT, and the HCSB.  Actually, this NIV Zondervan Study Bible should give the ESV study Bible a run for its money!In a word, this is a good study Bible that I’m glad to own.  It’s probably very similar to the ESV study Bible and other ones like it, but it does deserve to be put on the list of solid evangelical study Bibles.NOTE: I received this Bible from the BookLook blogging program, and was not compelled to write a positive review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R214U9UEOOIZFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310438314#wasThisHelpful","R214U9UEOOIZFP","A33B3XCIXB4ZVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33B3XCIXB4ZVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is written from a Christian perspective, so there are prayers and acknowledgements of God's help.

"One of the newer church planting/missions book on the market is J. D. Greear’s Gaining by Losing (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2015).  The book doesn’t give the details of church planting, but it does tell established churches some basic principles for and motivations to plant churches.  There are two main parts to this 253 page book: first, a sort of introduction; second, Greear’s ten “plumb lines” for sending/planting.  There are also two appendices that give more detail about missions and church planting.The Good:There are a some strengths to this book.  First, it is clearly gospel centered.  The main point of the book is that the gospel is central in the Christian life and in church planting/missions.  It was also a good reminder for Christians and churches to be outward focused; Greear clearly stated over and over that churches must be evangelizing at home and abroad.  We can never forget that!The Not-So-Good:There were some weaknesses to the book as well.  In my opinion, there was too much humor (some cheesy, some seemingly forced) and too many stories about Greear and the church he pastors.  I realize these critiques are small and subjective, but for me they did detract from the book.I do have some bigger and less subjective concerns about the book as well.  First, Greear started the book with a sort of building block of his methodology based on a debatable interpretation of John 12:24.  Typically that verse has been understood to be referring to Jesus’ death and the fruit that it brings (the salvation of his people).  Greear, however, says that verse is about taking our “hands off of what little portion [God has] given to us, ‘die’ to our control of it, and plant it into the world” (p. 16).  “Jesus presents a very clear choice: preserve your seed and lose it; plant your seed for his sake, and keep it through eternity” (Ibid.).  “Life for the world comes only through the death of the church” (p. 20).  In a word, Greear says that we have to give away our resources (die) plant seeds (plant churches/share the gospel), which is what Jesus talks about in John 12:24.  This interpretation is debatable, and therefore from the outset I was hesitant to accept Greear’s application of the text.  So the whole book for me started off on the wrong foot. (There are a few other places where I thought some texts were misinterpreted and misapplied as well, but I don’t have the space here to explain them all.)The second critique I have of this book is that it is sort of a guilt trip.  In fact, it reminded me of David Platt’s book, Radical.  Greear does refer to Platt from time to time, so there are parallels.  I realize Greear said he was trying to avoid the guilt-trip aspect of evangelism, but it was there in back-door form.  For example, he writes, “Failure to risk our lives to the fullest potential for the kingdom of God is as wicked as the most egregious violations of the laws of God” (p. 181).  “When is the last time your sacrifices for the mission made someone question your sanity?” (p. 59). “…You can’t really call yourself a follower of Jesus if you don’t see yourself as sent” [a missionary] (p. 34).  By the end of the book it felt like Greear was saying that all churches/Christians that don’t evangelize in a full-out, risky, petal-to-the-metal way are sinning.Third, there were a few theological aspects of the book that I thought were shaky.  Greear’s continued emphasis was that the church’s/Christian’s main duty, #1 reason for existence, was to evangelize.  Certainly that is high on the list, but isn’t our chief end to glorify God and enjoy him forever ?  Missions is incredibly important, but we won’t be evangelizing in our heavenly homeland; we’ll be glorifying and enjoying God! For me, the book was lacking in the area of eccelsiology; in fact, Greear didn’t really mention elders or deacons.  Perhaps that is one big reason why the book didn’t sit well with me.  His book reminded me of some Acts 29 material I’ve read in the past.  Further, since Greear’s church has well over 1,000 people in attendance each week, I’m not sure his principles and methods would really work or fly in a smaller church of 70 (which is around average in America).Finally, and as a side, I have to point out some trendy jargon that I tripped on: “Believing the gospel leads to becoming like the gospel” (p. 66).  “Ask her [my wife] what she does, and she’ll say she is a missionary to the unreached people group known as ‘the Greear children'” [not exactly biblical; see the covenant theme in 1 Cor. 7:14] (p. 72).  “The future belongs to churches that send” (p. 176).  “Gospel-saturated people become visionaries” (p. 193).  Some of these phrases sound good, but they don’t always make sense.I almost want to apologize for being so critical of this book!  When I got it in the mail, I was honestly excited to read through it.  But as the chapters went on, I was let down more than a few times.  Some of the book is good and helpful, for sure, and at the end of the day despite my criticisms I’m thankful that Greear preaches Christ and gets the News out.(Note: this book was provided for me by Cross-Focused reviews; I was not compelled to give a positive review in exchange).","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PGJX7B500RFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFCPQ3O#wasThisHelpful","R3PGJX7B500RFW","A33B3XCIXB4ZVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33B3XCIXB4ZVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is great!  I use it with two laptops - an older Lenovo Thinkpad (Windows XP) and a newer Lenovo touch screen laptop (Windows 8).  It was painless to set up on both laptops - a quick download later, it's working fine!I like it because it is small, and because it works!  You plug it into your USB drive, and just like that you now have an HDMI port, a monitor plug in, an ethernet port, and the USB port.  I haven't used the ethernet port because I'm wireless, so I can't speak for that, but the other three ports work fine!Finally - I really like to use this adapter to plug my old laptop into my flat screen TV with the HDMI.

They taste sort of like a healthy version of coco-puffs (the cereal); however, I did try a little with some milk, and they don't go so well in milk (not bad, but not great either).The reason I didn't give this product five out of five stars is because it wasn't overly filling - I need a bit more substance in a snack.

"I'm not a table-tennis expert, but our family owns one and we all like to play.  Before we got this STIGA racket, we were using the cheap $5 rackets you can get at department stores.  Boy, is this STIGA different than those cheap paddles - in a good way!It is softer than most cheap-o paddles, so it does take some adjusting.  You actually have to sort of swing to get the ball to move fast because it is soft.  The grip is nice, it is light weight, and feels solid.  The surface is a bit sticky, so lint and dust stick to it.If this racket lasts for a long time, I'd say it is worth the money.  Time will tell, but it does seem like it will last if taken care of.

"I've had (and used) hatchets before, but this is my first experience with tomahawks.  These SOG 'hawks are one piece of solid steel; they are not flimsy nor do they feel cheap in any way.  They are smaller and lighter than I expected (check the dimensions and weight if you're concerned about those things).  They are easy to throw, and do have other outdoor uses - but since they are light and small, it would take awhile and be difficult to chop bigger trees or branches down.  The carrying case is also nice (it fits one, two, or all three) and has a belt loop if you want it on your waist.  I haven't taken the paracord off to see if it is the real stuff, but the handle is wrapped well with it (although note the paracord handle does collect dirt quite easily).As you may have guessed, these are pretty dangerous if not used properly.  My wife was a little apprehensive to see me showing the boys how to throw them.  Do keep these out of the reach of children and young teens, since they could seriously hurt a child if not used properly.  Even an adult could hurt himself if he was using these wrongly since one edge is super sharp and the other edge is super pointy.  I think Homer Simpson got one of these jabbed in his head in one episode, so don't say I didn't warn you!In all seriousness, however, these are nice tomahawks if used rightly and safely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WXPWFUS9UWVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1I7F54#wasThisHelpful","R2WXPWFUS9UWVS","A33B3XCIXB4ZVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33B3XCIXB4ZVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is not a detailed manual of preaching/homiletics; instead, it is a short (240 small pages) explanation of what Tim Keller has learned about preaching in his many years of pulpit ministry.  There are three main parts in this book: 1) Serving the Word (pp. 27-90), 2) Reaching the People (pp. 93-187), and 3) Preaching and the Spirit (pp. 191-210).  There is also a brief appendix on sermon writing.  The bulk of the book is where Keller talks about preaching to skeptics (part 2).  I really enjoyed this book, and will no doubt re-read parts of it.  However, in my opinion, this book was good, but not great.  Let me explain:THE ""GOOD"":1) Keller well noted that the gospel (the work of Christ) must be central in preaching; moralistic preaching will not do.2) I appreciated how Keller explained what it means to preach to people.  Yes, doctrine and biblical truth are important, but we must preach truth to people's hearts in a way they can understand it and be challenged by it.3) The book is full of the wisdom of an experienced preacher.  Keller has been a life-long student of preaching, and his experience and wisdom in this area shows.  There are quite a few helpful homiletic insights in this book - too many to list here!THE ""NOT GREAT"":1) Some of the material in the book is found in other books by Keller.  I've read ""Center Church,"" and Keller's book on idolatry, and quite often I found some of that material in this book (Preaching) was previously said in his other books.  I don't think it's necessarily bad to repeat material, but it is worth noting that around 60% of the material overlaps with his other books.2) I'm not convinced by Keller's three ""levels"" of the ministry of the word (from formal preaching to less formal teaching to even less formal conversation).  He says this book is aimed at two levels, which includes pulpit preaching and informal teaching (like blogging, Sunday School classes, and mentoring).  Despite Keller's claim, this book is mostly aimed at pulpit preaching, but it is confusing how he talks about the ""levels.""  Certainly blogging and preaching are extremely different, and I don't believe this book has much to do with Christian blogging!3) The subtitle of the book should be tweaked to say something like, ""How to preach to urban skeptics.""  I enjoyed many of the sections where Keller explained how to preach to skeptics, but it did seem to be a major emphasis of the book.  Again, it's a good discussion, but preachers also need help preaching to people in suburbia or more rural settings.In a word, this is a short book on how to preach Christ-centered sermons with a focus on presenting Christian truths to urban skeptics.  However, even if you're not a preacher in an urban/skeptical context, you'll benefit from this book quite a bit.  Although I do have a few minor critiques of the book, I do very much recommend it.  Christian preachers can always use more lessons in presenting the gospel!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SKTYSWUJ9SDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525953035#wasThisHelpful","R2SKTYSWUJ9SDO","A33B3XCIXB4ZVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33B3XCIXB4ZVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I grew up with a ping-pong table, and really enjoyed it.  So I was glad to get this thing for our kids to use.  I have to admit I was surprised how small it is - but it does clearly mention that in the description, so I can't blame the company!  The picture I've included in this review shows this table next to a dining room table and entertainment center to give you an idea of the size.  Here's a summary of my thoughts:PROS:1) It is sturdy, heavy, well-built table.  The surface is hard, the balls bounce (and sound) nice on the surface, and it isn't shaky.2) It is nice to be able to store this table away; since it is a small table, it doesn't take up much room when folded up.3) It looks nice; even though it is small, it doesn't look like a toy - it is a real ping pong ball table!CONS:1) I was hoping I (an adult) could play on it better - I can, for sure, but it is a little low for me (I'm just over 6 feet tall).2) The net isn't adjustable.  It works fine, but it's a little flimsy.  I'm sure I could modify it to get it tighter, however.3) As other reviewers noted, it doesn't come with paddles or balls (though it would be tough to ship together - and for around $12 I got a new set at a store.)4) This is minor, but the table and/or bag (note - it's a bag, not a case!) stunk for a few days.  It just smelled like chemicals of some sort, but thankfully the smell is gone now.Anyway, this table is perfect if you don't have the room for a full size one - it's also good for kids to use if they want to learn how to play.  If you know what you're buying - a solid kids' size ping pong table - you won't be disappointed!

"I was looking forward to trying this touch screen deadbolt out, and I'm not at all disappointed!

Here are my pros/cons so far - I'll update them if things change after more use:PROS:1) It is very easy to program - I programmed one code in a matter of minutes (following the simple instructions).2) It beeps loudly when working (to let you know if the door is locked or not), but can still be used the ""old fashioned"" way if the 4 AA batteries die.3) As I mentioned, it looks great.  The numbers on the screen disappear when not in use, so people usually see a black screen w/o numbers on it.4) It comes with a special key thingy that you can use to change keys (the old fashioned keys).5) It is somewhat customizable - you can turn blinking on/off, the noise on/off, auto 30-second lock on/off, and a secure/screen feature on/off (the feature makes it harder to see which numbers are most frequently pressed).CONS:1) There are some questions I have that will be ironed out the more I use it - such as ""how long do the batteries last?""  and ""Is the unit waterproof, or will rain on the front door ruin the unit?  Right now, I can't think of any big negatives, but again, I'll change that if they arise.In summary, if you want an electronic touch screen dead bolt, this one is well built, works well, and I'd recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSFMJJXFZHX1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X6E0O4O#wasThisHelpful","RSFMJJXFZHX1C","A33B3XCIXB4ZVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33B3XCIXB4ZVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First of all, this light is a great idea!  When we first put it in a regular socket and turned it on, the kids smiled and said, ""Cool, dad"" as it flashed a few colors.  I agree - it is pretty cool.  We put it in the bathroom and the kids had fun giving each other a ""light show"" while the other was brushing teeth.  (As a side, note that the bulb is quite heavy; I myself wouldn't put it in a lamp since that would make it top-heavy and the kids would knock it over too easily.)  Here are my pros/cons:PROS:1) It works.  In just a few minutes we downloaded the app (android version), turned the bluetooth on, ""found"" the bulb, and were changing its colors.  (FYI, I tried it on a Galaxy Tab 3)2) The white setting (regular lighting) is very bright - it was nice to have in the room for extra brightness!3) The ""Simon"" game on it is fun; my kids played it and enjoyed copying the light patterns.4) There are various options of use: put the light on a timer, make it blink/change with music, and so on.5) The range of controlling the light (via bluetooth) was pretty good - around 20 feet or so, even through a wall.CONS:1) The light does get very hot.  After about 45 minutes of straight use, it was hot enough to slightly burn a finger.2) The app isn't overly easy to use; it's a bit clunky.  Took me awhile to figure most of it out.  Hopefully it gets updated soon!3) The app is glitchy - it worked about 60-70% of the time.  Again, maybe an update fixes this.In summary, this is a really cool light with some glitches in technology (mostly the app).

"This is a very versatile storage unit!  You can use it as a trunk organizer, cooler, camping buddy, or picnic buddy.  It is solid and well made; both my wife and I were impressed how tough it feels.  You can fold it and tuck it behind a seat easily, or fold in the sides and use it as a cooler, or extend it out and even put things in the small mesh pockets.The reason I deducted one star is because the cooler section doesn't have much insulation.  It is basically a thin foam-type insulation with a special silver lining.  I realize a collapsible cooler can't do it all, but a bit more insulation would have been nice.Other than that, I do recommend this product if you need a versatile cooler/organizer for your car, van, SUV, or camper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25B9NW5C0X2ZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJNLXTA#wasThisHelpful","R25B9NW5C0X2ZV","A33B3XCIXB4ZVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33B3XCIXB4ZVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(UPDATE: Oct 5, 2015: this monitor is still working perfectly for me.  FYI)  I've had several average flat screen monitors before - in fact, this HP replaced a similar sized off-brand flat screen monitor that was a few years old.  I could instantly tell the difference in build quality and picture quality.  This HP monitor is absolutely outstanding.  I'm thoroughly impressed!PROS:1) It looks nice - trendy rather than clunky and old.2) It has a clear, sharp picture that can be viewed at various angles.3) It is highly customizable - the color, effects, rotation, saved setting for certain uses/programs, split screen, etc.4) It was easy to install - just use the disc provided, and a few minutes later it's finished.5) You can use it via HDMI (x2), or VGA.  (As a side, I'm going to see if I can use a Chromecast stick in the HDMI port; will report on that later.)CONS:1) The software works fine, but takes a little to figure it out (not much though--minor critique).2) It comes with a VGA cord but not an HDMI cord (minor critique again, but wanted to point it out).Though I mostly use this monitor as an extended screen for typing/research, a live MLB game looked great on it, as did pictures.  Again, I'm thoroughly impressed, and would recommend this monitor if anyone asked my opinion!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24QKIV1VYJMNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TIJLF0I#wasThisHelpful","R24QKIV1VYJMNB","A33B3XCIXB4ZVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33B3XCIXB4ZVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We were in the market for a new car seat, since our almost-4-year-old daughter out grew her old one.  And, in a word, this Diono Monterey car seat is exactly what we needed!  She really likes it too, and wanted to go sit in it even before we went on a ride.  She's all proud of the two cup holders (one for milk and one for snacks, she says!).  Here's a list of my pros/cons:Pros:1) It is a solid and sturdy seat - there's nothing flimsy or cheap about it.2) It will ""grow"" with the child - meaning you can also just use the bottom (booster) for older kids.3) It is somewhat adjustable - the headrest goes up/down and the sides go out/in and you can lean it back a little.4) Attached to anchor points in our Town and Country minivan, it really provides protection in case of accident.5) It is soft and comfortable.Cons:1) As a seat, it is quite heavy (the fine print says 20lbs).  If you're taking it in/out quite a bit, the weight may become annoying.2) The sides of the headrest do limit the child's sight - ours has to lean ahead to look sideways or slightly behind her.I realize this is a spendy car seat, but think of it this way: 1) It is well built and should provide protection for your child in an accident, and 2) your child should be able to use it for a few years (maybe more), so it's an investment of sorts.  And I'd say it's an investment worth making!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LEQLYJMIWM8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V852GXU#wasThisHelpful","R2LEQLYJMIWM8P","A33B3XCIXB4ZVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33B3XCIXB4ZVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have the ""adult"" version of this water bottle, which is probably too big for some kids.  So when we opened this one, our 3 year old girl immediately noticed it was like mom's, and quickly (and excitedly!) filled it up.  It does fit in her car seat cup holder, so we like that.  Also, the lids/bodies of this water bottle interchange with the bigger one just like it.This is a really good water bottle.  It is not cheap!  In fact, it has a life-time guarantee against defects.  It might cost a few dollars more than some other bottles, but I'd say it's worth it.  I'd for sure recommend this to others!(By the way, though it is advertised as a ""kids"" water bottle, since it is 17 ounces it wouldn't look funny for an adult to use it.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UNFRFPY5F3P6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLNXCZW#wasThisHelpful","R2UNFRFPY5F3P6","A33B3XCIXB4ZVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33B3XCIXB4ZVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a DIY home owner, and for some time I've been thinking about getting a laser measure to replace my tape measure.  This ""Dimension Master 130"" is exactly what I was looking for!

I've messed around with it a bit at home and in my office, and am impressed so far.I like the fact that you can simply measure the square feet of a room with just a few pushes of a button.  I also like the fact that the two AAA batteries are supposed to last for more than 3,000 measurements, and I am happy to see a battery level indicator on the screen (I won't have to worry about dead batteries when I'm out and about).  It didn't take too long to figure out how to use it - the instructions are pretty good.  My wife even tried it and figured it out quickly; I can see her using this when figuring out room arrangements and the amount of paint needed for a room.So far, I'm super happy with this laser measure!

"We've used this in a few laundry loads now, and are generally pleased with it.  It does smell great!  The only issue we have with it is that you have to use more than 1/4 cup (or so) in a regular load if you want a noticeable scent.  The first load we used about 1/8th cup, and couldn't smell much, so we upped it to 1/4 cup, and the smell was only slightly stronger.

"I’ve often found that Christian parenting books begin to sound the same after you read a handful of them.  I wouldn’t quite say, “If you’ve read one, you’ve read them all,” but there is significant overlap in quite a few Christian parenting books.Motivate Your Child by Scott Turansky and Joanne Miller is not exactly like other parenting books.  It is a Christian book written from a Christian perspective, but it is different in that it gives parents practical and biblical advice on getting children to do what they’re supposed to do without being told over and over (and over!).  That does sound impossible, I realize.  (I think I’ve told my three boys to brush their teeth around 10,000 times in their lives, and they still don’t quite get it!)  This book helps in that area.Motivate Your Child is divided into two main parts: 1) Moral development in children, and 2) Spiritual development in children.  Here’s a brief summary of each part:Part one discusses internal motivation and parenting strategies for motivation.  Strategies include right words, proper tone, and discipline/direction.  Part one also talks about conscience, choosing what is right, and dealing with mistakes kids make.  Furthermore, the authors mention compassion towards others, initiative, and consequences in part one.  I appreciated this part of the book because it didn’t just talk about external obedience, but it also discussed a child’s heart and how God’s word directs and shapes a heart.  The little section on goal setting for children was also helpful; we should teach our children about goals in life and attaining them.Part two is where the authors talk about spiritual development in children, including family devotions, the importance of Christian teaching in the home, and teaching kids to apply God’s word to their life (by the parents’ example and by parents’ teaching).  Basically, this part of the book gave some good advice on passing down the faith in such a way that kids are motivated to live it, not just hear it.  I was happy to see the authors mention the importance of the church in kids’ lives.  The authors were also wise to mention how spending time with kids, discussing real life issues and the faith, is good for our kids.  There was even some mention of what to expect as far as roadblocks in passing down the faith.While I don’t agree with everything in this book, there are many strengths.  I liked the emphasis on patience, love, forgiveness, and moral compass and direction.  The book encouraged me to keep working hard to be a better Christian parent.  It’s easy to get discouraged when parenting, and this book reminded me to stay focused and deliberate while parenting in our Christian home.  I suppose one weakness of the book is that there is a lot of info in these 250+ pages.  You’ll have to take notes or mark the book up well to remember all the good advice and biblical principles!  But it is for sure worth the read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U76ASOJWZ4GA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0529100738#wasThisHelpful","R1U76ASOJWZ4GA","A33B3XCIXB4ZVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33B3XCIXB4ZVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We put the Ipod touch away and let our four-year-old girl use this instead.  She was really excited, and for the most part she figured out how to navigate around this LeapPad2 quite easily.  She used her full hour of daily ""screen time"" yesterday and today playing on this LeapPad2 (her older brothers checked it out for awhile too).  Here is a summary of my thoughts on this:PROS:1) The screen is vibrant, responsive, and clear; overall, the LeapPad2 is well built and sturdy (note: an attached stylus is included).2) It is safe for kids to use: they can't go online, buy apps, mess with personal info, or find adult content at all.  LeapFrog is very kid friendly.3) The apps are (mostly) very well done and easy to use.  Our girl likes the camera, pet dog app, and drawing app.CONS:1) It goes through 4 AA batteries in 2-4 hours. I recommend rechargeable batteries or an AC adapter (which cost extra).2) While the apps are well done, most of them are expensive.  For example, we wanted to put kids music on the LeapPad2, but first we need to buy a $5 app to play mp3s on.  I noticed some single apps that were around $25-$30!3) It doesn't have a timer or password for parents to limit time/usage.  Would be nice to have these things for parents (like me!) who limit screen time each day.If the apps didn't cost so much, I would have given this product five stars; I don't mind paying for apps, but I don't want them to hurt the wallet so much!  If you're wondering, you have to connect the LeapPad2 to your computer, create a profile, then using the internet to get apps and such from the LeapPad website, which in turn will be automatically transferred to your LeapPad when you connect it to your computer.In a word, we really do like and recommend the LeapPad2 - it is a good thing for ages 3-9.  You may want to research the app situation (purchasing/downloading) before buying if you're not familiar with LeapPad's methods.  Either way, we're glad we got this; I don't think we'll give the IPod back to our girl now that she has this.  Thankfully, her screen time now will be at least somewhat educational!

"I'm totally happy with this lamp/light!  Actually, I have to admit I'm even surprised it is as nice as this!  I was expecting something a bit more cheaply built, flimsier, and a bit more disposable (i.e. it breaks, you throw it away).  But it is solid, built well, large (around 10 inches tall), and useful.

Five years!2) The LED is supposed to last a life time.3) The carabiner/hanger actually works well.4) It's great for outdoors - hang it on a branch or set it on a table, let it glow, and don't worry about a little moisture.5) You can dim it (three clicks) and the push button switch is easy to use (my 3 year old can use it easily).6) The LED is bright but not blinding, and doesn't drain the batteries very quickly.CONS:1) The base is wide, and it stands well, but there are no rubber grips, so it can slide on flat surfaces.2) I wish it would have an AC power source (that is, I wish I could plug it into the wall if I wanted to).3) It is too heavy to hang in most tents - the 4 ""D"" batteries aren't light!

"I was around 10 years old when Reagan finished his two terms as President.  I can still remember my parents and others saying how much they appreciated Reagan, and that they were sad to see him go.  Over the years I've learned a few things about Reagan by reading or listening to his speeches.  I haven't read much else, but am glad to be ""schooled"" by H. W. Brands in his new biography, ""Reagan: The Life.""  While I do appreciate Reagan, it didn't seem like Brands painted too rosy a picture of him; Brands was fair in my opinion.First of all, the book is well written.  There are quite a few details (names, locations, dates, etc.), but Brands writes in such a way that the details don't bog down the reading.  I haven't read anything by Brands before, but having read this one, I think I'll seek out more of his work!  Here and there the book slowed down a bit (in my opinion), but over all I enjoyed reading it very much.  It read more like a story than a textbook.  Note: it is BIG - my copy has 737 pages of the story, followed by around 50 pages of end notes.  It's not a weekend read, but it is worth working through.Secondly, the book basically follows Reagan's life. The first two chapters cover the first 22 years of Reagan's life (starting in Tampico, Illinois, Feb. 6, 1911).  The next section of the book (around 100 pages) talks about his years in California (1935-1962) where he worked in Hollywood, with the Screen Actors Guild, and for General Electric.  His time as governor of California and his political life up to 1980 is the topic of chapters 16 through 32.  Reagan's two terms as President take up pages 239-706.  The last short part of the book (p. 705-737) covers the rest of his life (to his death in 2004).The only disappointment I had with this book is that it spends very little time discussing Reagan's first years and his last years.  I realize it is a minor critique, but I was hoping to learn more about Reagan as a child and a young man.Aside from the minor critique, I wholeheartedly recommend this book!  It was engaging enough for me that I underlined in it, took some notes, and will no doubt refer to it again in the (near!) future.  Bravo to H. W. Brands for this work on one great American President.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R333Y3Z9NUKAZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385536399#wasThisHelpful","R333Y3Z9NUKAZ8","A33B3XCIXB4ZVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33B3XCIXB4ZVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In fact, it's too flimsy for our girl to color on with crayons while it is standing up.  I'm not sure it's worth what it's selling for right now (just under $40).

"We weren't sure what to expect when we selected this knit bin, but we are pleasantly surprised!  It is made very well, looks very nice, and is not cheap in any way.  In case you were wondering, it isn't huge (check the measurements above) and it is soft and sort of flimsy (it doesn't hold its shape perfectly, but is plenty strong).Right now our little girl uses it to lug her stuffed animals around - it is perfect for her!  It would also work in the bathroom for towels or maybe even to hold a baby's toys.

"I try to be a positive Christian with a positive outlook on life.  Generally speaking, I look on the bright side and press on in the Christian life with hopefulness because Christ is on the throne.  But sometimes I fall into a rut of gloom, cynicism, and I think the cup is “half empty,” so to speak.  From time to time I can identify with Christians who are always gloomy, pessimistic, and critical.  The question is, how can we get out of the rut of gloom?  We should want to, since the Christian faith is not one of gloom, doom, and extreme cynicism!David Murray answers this question in his new book, The Happy Christian.  In ten chapters, Murray tackles gloom armed first with Scripture and secondly with some helpful scientific studies and insights about pessimism and optimism.  If I can make a generalization, Murray is basically calling God’s people to a Christian optimism, or a biblical optimism based on the truths of Scripture.  The book is just over 260 pages.The chapters go like this: To gain a more positive outlook on life 1) focus on facts more than feelings, 2) avoid so much bad news and focus on good news, 3) focus on the fact that Christ’s work of salvation is finished, 4) focus on the strengths of other Christians instead of their weaknesses, 5) focus on the blessed future we have in Christ rather than the past, 6) Find God’s common grace in the world instead of sin and evil, 7) Find things to praise people for instead of critique them, 8) give money and things away instead of hoarding, 9) View your work as a calling instead of a job, 10) be around people of different ethnicities instead of one ethnicity.Overall, I enjoyed the book and much of it made perfect sense.  I appreciated Murray’s call to focus on the facts rather than be led by feelings (I’ve learned that over the years!), and I appreciated his emphasis on the gospel (chapter 3), which leads us to joyful freedom and service instead of a constant negative guilt for sin.  I also appreciated Murray’s call to stay away from so much news/media, since the news tends to focus on the negative and then makes us negative (I agree; I quit following the news years ago and it has helped me be more optimistic).  Murray was also dead-on when he encouraged churches to aim for joy, grace, and a spotlight on the Good News.  His chapter on praising others was also a good reminder for me to work harder to encourage and bless people with my words.There were a few things in the book about which I was less enthusiastic.  First, Scripture citations are endnotes rather than written in the text or as footnotes (minor,  I know, but endnotes kill my reading optimism!).  Second, there was a ton of information covered in this book.  I was almost overwhelmed at times, since Murray did quite a few bullet point type lists/paragraphs.  For one example, in his discussion on the benefits of Christian hope (p. 95ff), Murray lists twelve benefits followed by eight ways to grow in hope.  The notes were good, but it was almost an information overload for me since there were many lists/paragraphs like this (e.g. ten parts of constructive criticism, ten ways of learning to praise others, nine ways to give biblically, eight ways to pursue diversity personally, ten ways for a church to pursue diversity, five truths about giving in leadership positions, etc.).  I realize all readers are different, so perhaps this is subjective, but those lists sort of bogged me down in the reading.One other question I had about the book is the chapter on diversity.  I fully agree with Murray’s emphasis on breaking racial barriers down, since Scripture calls us to love others and since Jesus died for people from every tribe, tongue, and nation.  However, I didn’t quite see exactly how diversity increases joy; does this mean that the less ethnic diversity there is in a person’s life, the less joy he or she has?  Many house churches in China can’t really be diverse; the same can be said about a church in a tribal jungle location or in some rural parts of other countries.  Also, if I have a handful of good Christian friends, can’t they increase my joy no matter what ethnicity they are?  Maybe I’m missing something; and I am honestly open to correction here!  And again, I agree that Scripture does call us away from racism and it calls us to love others based on the gospel and God’s love for all sorts of people.In summary, I’m glad I read this book, The Happy Christian.  The church for sure does need more emphasis on the true, the beautiful, and the good since she usually talks too much about what is wrong with the world.  I’m going to incorporate some parts of this book into my own actions, conversation, and Christian teaching.  It’s always a good thing for me to be pointed in the right way of Christian optimism, since Jesus does reign!  God treats us, his people, like sons and daughters, therefore “lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees (Heb. 12:7, 12)!”NOTE: I received this book from the BookLook program, and am not required to write a positive review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VELKP97U3R7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718022017#wasThisHelpful","R2VELKP97U3R7U","A33B3XCIXB4ZVG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33B3XCIXB4ZVG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Elizabeth George, a writer I admittedly never heard of a few years ago, is rapidly becoming one of my favorites of her genre. Comparisons have been made to others--PD James, in particular--and they are close to the mark. ""Missing Joseph"" is another feather in Ms. George's cap. Few writers capture the psychology, not just of the characters involved, but of the places they inhabit and create--the geography. Without recapping the plot (see other reviewers for that), suffice to say this talent for creating a landscape as secretive and hostile, as cold and muddy and icy as the crime itself is well-presented here.So why only four stars and not five?First of all, keep one thing in mind, I now hold Ms. George to a higher standard than other mystery writers. Giving her four stars is like giving five stars to less gifted writers. That being said, I found the going a little slower than the other novels by Ms. George that I have read. The ongoing struggles between Lynley and Helen, while always intriguing, bogged the story down as much as the muddy roads did. I found myself getting impatient a few times. At one point, I said to myself, ""Alright, already, I get it. I get it. Can we move it along, please?"" Okay, that was my only negative mark against the book. ""Missing Joseph"" has a beginning that will grab you and a conclusion that satisfies. I just wished that the middle didn't get so cluttered. I still recommend this book, along with the others in this series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9782N6RZLF4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553385488#wasThisHelpful","R9782N6RZLF4L","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Elizabeth George's ""Payment in Blood"" is a suspenseful, keeps-you-guessing mystery in the tradition of the ""country-house murder mysteries"". For almost half the book, the reader is cloistered, as are the suspects, in a fledgling country hotel where a horrific murder has been committed. Lynley, Havers and the local police interrogate and inspect as objectively as possible. I would like to stress the ""as possible"" part. There are a lot of preconceptions and prejudices that seem to hamper the investigation--or, at least, derail it for a while. The other problem the police have is that the majority of suspects are theater people who know how to act, especially act innocent.Ego conflicts, jealousies, insecurities abound to confuse things even more. All this adds up to a nicely-paced whodunit with a very satisfying solution! Ms. George is rapidly becoming one of my favorite mystery writers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMNTGP5LMFWCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553384805#wasThisHelpful","RMNTGP5LMFWCT","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Daniel Silva's ""The Unlikely Spy"" is a classic WWII spy novel that is both purist and in the purest form. For me, it was a relief to read such a thriller in an atmosphere uncomplicated -- and oversimplified -- by technology and  high-powered weaponry. Silva has not only read his Follett and LeCarre but he has also read his history. His depiction of the cities and countrysides of England and Germany are remarkable, as are his descriptions of the historically-based characters.The main characters, Alfred Vicary, ""Catherine Blake"", et al, are given dimensions and a depth that one rarely finds in the typical novels in this genre. At the same time, I never felt overwhelmed by any of the background information about them, the main thrust of which was that neither Vicary nor Blake wanted to be in the positions they were in, and yet, they were extremely efficient and credible. The action and suspense is marvelous. This was Silva's first novel, and the promise of good things to come was fulfilled.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRPFSIDZ0MYUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451209303#wasThisHelpful","RRPFSIDZ0MYUZ","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love him or hate him, John Corey's acerbic wit and look at life is unique. At times, his comebacks made me wonder if he did improv comedy on the side; he's that quick. Maybe too quick to be believable. Whatever. I think the difference between DeMille's writing in ""The Lion"" and the earlier ""The Lion's Game"" is that there is a good deal of self-conscious writing here. You could almost sense DeMille's thinking, ""Okay, people are expecting Corey's wise-cracks but I gotta satisfy the action-hungry reader."" To be fair, he succeeded for the most part. I thought the initial sky-diving scene was thrilling. And his depiction of New York City immediately after 9-11 was on the mark.But there was something suddenly two-dimensional about Khalil. His single-mindedness detracted from any third dimension. Corey's my-way-or-the-highway obstinance wore on me. The fact that Kate was, for a good deal of the novel, out of the way, suggested to me that she didn't really belong in this sequel. In fact, she only seemed to be there to be fodder for hospital food jokes.I don't want to be too harsh. The book is fine; it's okay. I just expected so much more after ""The Lion's Game"".

"Admittedly, I struggled through the first 100 or so pages of Elizabeth George's ""A Traitor to Memory"". However, there was enough going on to hold my attention. I am glad I held on because the complexities of the novel and the psychological intrigues were gripping. (Ms. George is to be admired for her uncanny insights into the male psyche--warts and all.) Lynley, Havers and friends are in frustration mode as they attempt to solve a hit-and-run (which  become a few hit-and-runs). Like a snowball going downhill, this book grows on you as it moves more and more swiftly. By the end, I was grateful I was able to hang on.So why not five stars? While Gideon's journal entries were gut-wrenching and poignant, I felt they came at inopportune times, often slowing the narrative pace a little too soon for a little too long. Also, the crime that takes place at the very beginning--and then is not mentioned for pages later--made me think it was much more significant than it actually was. This was a huge disappointment.Still, if you are a fan of psychological dramas and murder mysteries, this book has everything to recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GOI0Q0C5HYRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553386018#wasThisHelpful","R1GOI0Q0C5HYRO","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the third novel I have read by Nelson DeMille and I am hooked--I am late to the party again.Growing up just a couple of hours away from Plum Island, I had heard all the stories and rumors about the place--none of them were good. I had also grown up hearing about Captain Kidd's supposed nearby buried treasure. Taking these two pieces of local folklore, DeMille has crafted another tour de force filled with mystery and suspense.In John Corey, DeMille has also found a perfect voice and vehicle. He is a wise-cracker and a smooth-talker, depending on the circumstances. He has a quick sense of humor. On one level, he is the typical, jaded New York cop but he is self-conscious about it. He often challenges himself to get away from that sort of thinking but not from the instincts that come with it. What I find about DeMille is that while he spins an intricate and grabbing tale, he sprinkles it with insightful and, occasionally, devestating looks at  love, pop culture, politics and life itself.Where do I get my official Nelson DeMille Fan Club card?","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OC3XCNMH1T3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455502626#wasThisHelpful","R3OC3XCNMH1T3E","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first novel I have read by David Baldacci and I am definitely going to read more. ""Stone Cold"" has a little for everybody and a lot for anyone who is a fan of this genre. Mobsters, spooks, secret societies within secret societies, black-clad assassins, a serial killer on a mission and, of course, The Hero and his moll (in this case). I had a lot of fun with this book. My only reason for not giving this a five-star rating was that the main characters are so well-developed that it is at the expense of the secondary characters. One of these characters (I won't mention who) is killed in the process of doing good. However, there was not much given to him, in terms of character development, that I didn't feel like much was taken away. I had the feeling that he was only killed off to (a) show how bad the bad guys were and (b) to show that Oliver Stone isn't so stone cold. Does that mean you should not buy the book? Of course not!

"I had no expectations going into Keith Greenberg's ""December 8, 1980: The Day John Lennon Died"" except that it would be about December 8, 1980: the day John Lennon died. Parts of it were. The rest of it was a kind of Reader's Digest/Monarch Notes summary of the careers of The Beatles and Lennon/Ono, and the developing mental disorders of Mark David Cahpman. To be fair, it would be a morose task to focus primarily on the events of that day. Those of us who are old enough to remember it--and cared about it--have our own personal histories of that night. For many of us, we read about it for days, then years, afterward.The problem was, for me, that too many irrelevant doors were opened for too long, and the relevant ones closed too quickly. There were several accounts of the perceptions of what the guy-on-the-street was doing and thinking on that night. I understand that this was an attempt by Greenberg to give us people with whom we can identify. The problem was we didn't need it. Like I said, the people who remember that horrible night have their own private mental museums about where they were and how they felt when they heard the news.This isn't to say that I disliked the book or wouldn't recommend it.

"Coming away from Robert Ludlum’s “The Prometheus Deception” reminded me of my first day in high school gym class, when I was an overweight teenager. I was self-consciously struggling through every minute; I was amazed at what others could do; I was somewhat certain that some good might come out of it; and, in the end, I was exhausted and glad it was over. The first fifty pages or so went by at a good clip. The next hundred pages were filled with cool gadgets and weapons, vicious fights and a deception, and the death of somebody that the main character, Nick Bryson, knew well. The hundred pages after that were filled with wild technology, wild guns and bombs, incredible action and a betrayal, and the death of somebody that the main character, Nick Bryson, knew well. The next hundred pages were filled with computer razzle-dazzle, fantastic weaponry, double-dealings and explosive battles, and the death of somebody that the main character, Nick Bryson, knew well. Eventually the book ended with tremendous action, super-duper computers, lots of deaths, and a deception and—finally, the end of the subterfuge!Or is it? Ooooooooo!I can hear the question now: “What did you expect? This is a suspense/thriller, after all.” I know, I know. Ludlum follows a successful formula here: lots of action, lots of intrigue, some sexual tension, good vs. evil, etc., etc. I don’t mind that, at all. It’s just that this particular novel belted me one too many times over the head with the formula. How many close-calls, narrow escapes can you have before you say, “Oh come on! Seriously?” How many different double-crosses and triple-crosses by two, three, four different people can you have before you lose your patience or focus? Like another reviewer wondered, ""Was there an editor here?"" By the end of it, I was struggling to care about Bryson because (a) he became almost superhuman and (b) it’s hard to root for the good guys or bad guys when you—like Bryson—don’t know which side is which. I’m sure that’s the point: Bryson is struggling with that issue. However, that doesn’t mean the reader should, too.I can't wait for gym class to end.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R148K2SLXLLDBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312943369#wasThisHelpful","R148K2SLXLLDBY","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just from DeMille's introductory comments, I knew I was in the hands of someone who not only mastered his subject but had also mastered his craft. It is a poignant essay in its own right. ""Word of Honor"" is a success on so many levels: as a courtroom drama, as a character study, as an examination of a marriage under a huge strain, as a look back at the sixties through the eighties, and as a moral exploration of combat, in general, and the Vietnam War, in particular.The narrative of ""Word of Honor"" has been explained and summarized in so many other reviews that I won't bother with that here. What is mandatory to acknowledge is DeMille's understanding of war and his ability to convey its effects and results. The reader becomes an unwitting sympathizer in Ben Tyson’s plight. Even before we learn why he did what he did, you understand him and, even when he appears to be pig-headed, you get the notion that there are reasons for all his stubbornness and actions.The peripheral characters surrounding him present the reader with articulation for what the reader may be thinking. Not only is this a brilliant hook to keep the reader interested, I believe it is also DeMille’s way of acknowledging that there are so many ways to interpret that which is barely understandable. The references to Kurosawa’s “Rashomon” are both expected and essential.I found myself both exhilarated and, at the same time, sobered by the end of the book.

"By accident, I have lately been reading mystery novels in which the writers have used the distant past as part of the settings for their plots. Tess Gerritsen's ""The Bone Garden"" reached back to early 19th Century Boston. Lisa Scottoline's ""The Vendetta Defense"" used Mussolini-era Italy as a backdrop for most of that work. In ""Killer Smile"", Scottoline once again skips back through the decades, this time to the internment camps for Italians that existed contemporaneous with the Japanese camps during WWII. To me, this was the most successful of the three novels.Part of the reason for why I feel this was the most successful was that Mary DiNunzio has more at stake here and more closeness to the events than the protagonists of the ""The Bone Garden"" or even in Scottoline's ""The Vendetta Defense"". Her psychology rings true. She is still grieving, though to a lesser degree, for the loss of her husband. This makes her vulnerable to the plight of a young Italian man,  Amadeo Brandolino, who lost his beloved wife during his incarceration at an internment camp. This leads to his alleged suicide. Mary's grief ties in with Amadeo's to the point where she imagines she can hear his cries and pleas. This was as convincing as it was heartbreaking and haunting.Another element that helped the novel was the depiction of the elderly and their own ties to the past. The residents of Montana who had interracted with the Italian detainees have their own stories and secrets. All this created a melancholy texture to a mystery that was, in its own right, credible and engaging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DUD9CGU1NEQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060514957#wasThisHelpful","R1DUD9CGU1NEQO","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The intriguing thing about histories written long ago is learning about the times of the historians who wrote them. Joel Headley's ""The Great Riots of New York: 1712-1873"", published in 1873, tells us as much about the author's world as it does about the times he is examining. Whereas the descriptions of the ""Negro Riots"", the ""Doctors' Riot"", the ""Astor Place Riot"", the ""Draft Riots,"" and so on, are interesting in their own right, it was Headley's writing and attitudes that grabbed me more. They were so revealing.Headley and his circle believed they lived in an enlightened time but his depictions of class and race are hardly enlightened. Certain equations are repeated:* Irish--drunk, brawling, dull laborers* Germans--peaceful, industrious, keeping to themselves* Black--innocent (meaning uneducated), industrious, victimized but potentially dangerous* Upper and middle class--philanthropic and sensible* Poor--let's no even go thereThis being said, however, Headley's attitude about crowd control and the police are remarkably progressive. He believed that the club was more effective and less destructive than the gun, and that gunfire not only killed the rioters but also provoked further rioting. He believed more in trained, disciplined ""riot squads"" who would know how to specifically handle disorder than the existing (at the time) last-minute gathering up of untrained volunteers.Headley's writing style is also typical of the period. It is loaded with journalistic grittiness but interwoven with some flighty poeticism. (How he loved to describe bayonets ""gleaming in the moonlight"" or ""shimmering in the sun"".) In this regard, Headley's ""The Great Riots of New York"" is a fascinating document.For further study on the specific riots, I would recommend:For the ""Negro Riots"", Jill Lapore's New York Burning: Liberty, Slavery, and Conspiracy in Eighteenth-Century ManhattanFor the ""Astor Place Riots"", Nigel Cliff's The Shakespeare Riots: Revenge, Drama, and Death in Nineteenth-Century AmericaFor the Draft Riots, Barnet Schecter's The Devil's Own Work: The Civil War Draft Riots and the Fight to Reconstruct America","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBU0D8RVVV9D7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605206547#wasThisHelpful","RBU0D8RVVV9D7","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Toward the end of Edward Rutherfurd’s “New York”, Charlie Master muses, “Novelists liked to imagine the interconnectedness of things—as though all the people in the big city were part of some great organism, their lives intertwined.” With this sentence, Rutherfurd is describing exactly what he did in this epic novel which spans four centuries in the life of one of the most complex places (if not THE most complex place) on Earth, in which the generations of a half dozen families crisscross and sometimes collide.For me, the enjoyment of historical fiction is derived from the author’s ability to populate a historical place and time with fictitious but credible characters which enhance both. On that plane, Edward Rutherfurd’s “New York” works well. What also makes the book successful is Rutherfurd’s unobtrusive style which some other reviewers seemed to regard as uninteresting or just plain. My feeling is that if Rutherfurd had employed a more ornate, intrusive or crafted style, it would have added, unnecessarily, several more pages to an already enormous book and distracted the reader from the storytelling. I appreciated the fact that Rutherfurd stayed in the background and let the characters do most of the editorializing and provide most of the “color”. For me, “New York” worked best when it focused on specific events (The Draft Riots, The Blizzard of 1888, etc.) rather than when it tried to capture the general atmosphere and mood of a period. This is not to say those chapters were bad; they just weren’t as good!So why not five stars? Perhaps the attempt to capture four centuries of New York history would prove a little unwieldy for any author. At times, the exposition of events was awkward, just a little forced. When the chapters skipped a few decades here and there, one character was obligated to fill in the blank. I don’t believe that any other writer would have succeeded in performing such a task smoothly, it’s just that some background information came across as historical footnotes disguised as dialogue or interior monologue.That being said, I would strongly recommend Rutherfurd’s “New York” to any reader who appreciates American history, New York City and well-crafted historical fiction. This is among the best to have emerged in a very long time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29EPG5PHIXJ3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345497422#wasThisHelpful","R29EPG5PHIXJ3I","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is refreshing to see an author take a break from an established and successful routine and see him or her branch out. Tess Gerritsen’s “The Bone Garden” is a fine example. She must have welcomed the chance to put aside Rizzoli and Isles (although my copy of the book had the misleading graphic that this was part of the series) for another day. Still, it must have been difficult; writing a stand alone novel must be a daunting taskThe really hard work, however, is left to the reader who is used to her Rizzoli/Isles formula. Admittedly, this was tough for me; I kept making the inevitable comparisons. After getting a few dozen pages into the book, however, I began to enjoy “The Bone Garden” on its own terms. I didn’t expect the back-and-forth between eras. Considering I had read this hot on the heels of Lisa Scottoline’s “The Vendetta Defense”, which does the same thing, I didn’t find the structure to be too distracting. I enjoyed it as much here.The historical aspect of the novel (in a way the book is a tribute to Oliver Wendall Holmes Senior and the pioneering doctors of the time) was a welcome surprise. Early 19th Century Norris Marshall and Rose Connolly are intriguing and credible characters, and far more interesting than the somewhat drippy Julia Hamill and the stereotypical crusty loner, Henry of the present. To be frank, the present day element of the novel was weak, almost to the point where I wished the novel had taken place entirely in 1830. This cost the book one star. Still, it made for a great diversion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MMZVS69781C2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345497619#wasThisHelpful","R2MMZVS69781C2","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I am a big fan of the standard murder mystery, where the sleuth is a detective, cop, lawyer or private eye, I also enjoy the adventures of the amateur sleuths. Carolyn Hart’s “Death Walks the Plank” is an excellent example of the genre. This is my first foray into the “Death on Demand” series so I got a lot of catching up to do. And although I’ve started here, Ms. Hart has an efficient way of letting you know who the characters are and what makes them tick.The Darlings are an extremely congenial couple who embark on a cruise that mixes pleasure and business. The relaxed atmosphere doesn’t last long. Ms. Hart smoothly but with suspense leads the reader along the path to solving the crime. The Darlings have their hands full with this one and Henny and Lauren don’t make things any easier.All told, “Death Walks the Plank” is fine light reading and an entertaining mystery without the jaded, gloom-and-doom despondency that seems to haunt the hardboiled detective. The Darlings live up to their name. Now, I have to pick up the books that came before this one!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GRYL7GQY7TPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060004754#wasThisHelpful","R1GRYL7GQY7TPX","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Lisa Scottoline's ""The Vendetta Defense"", Judy Carrier went and did it: she took on a case that she had no business (as in it was not part of Rosato & Associates' legal business) taking. Judy agreed to defend a man accused of murder who admits to killing--not murdering--his lifelong nemesis, in fulfillment of a vendetta. Pigeon Tony freely confesses to the crime but sees no crime in it. There are mitigating circumstances which go back to Mussolini-era Italy and reach out to a crime committed just a year before the action of the novel takes place. (Ms. Scottoline is to be applauded for vividly bringing to life this tense period.) However, none of this will matter in court if Pigeon Tony testifies, which is what he wants to do. He fails to see why he should be punished for administering a justice he so clearly sees. This is not a murder mystery so much as a ""How do you defend the murderer?"" legal thriller.All this creates an extremely tense, frustrating and frightening case for Judy. The threats are everywhere from the aggrieved family of victim Angelo Coluzzi and its heavy-weight goon, Jimmy Bello.The writing is fairly swift, occasionally getting bogged down with a little too much exposition into the intricacies of pigeon raising and racing. The juxtaposition of the romances--one in the 1940s and the one Judy finds herself in--is well balanced and works.Some elements didn't work so well. I found the depiction of Italians and Italian-Americans to be a bit over-the-top. (I almost expected Chico Marx and Mr. Bacciagalupe to appear.) It was far from offensive, however, because (a) some of the stereotypes are quite true (I can attest to this as an Italian-American), and (b) these characters are generally presented in a good-natured way. My last nitpick has to do with the ending of the legal component of the case which I will not give away here.Still, this is a four-star review which means I sincerely recommend the book for the many things that Ms. Scottoline achieves here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMWOJH1ZPUE5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061031429#wasThisHelpful","RMWOJH1ZPUE5A","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Connelly's ""The Narrows"" (the sequel to ""The Poet"") is a unique mystery that moves from 'whodunnit?' to 'what will he do next?' to 'how do we catch him?'. Appropriately enough, the settings switch along with the plot thrusts: from city to exurb, from a boat in the sea to the 'Titanic' in the middle of the desert. The culmination of all this being 'the narrows': a roaring river, of sorts, in the heart of the city. Complementing this is the shift in narration which others have described and which I think works well.Connelly gives more or else equal time to his two seekers of the truth: old reliable Harry Bosch and FBI agent Rachel Walling (who, I think, deserves her own series of novels). Both Bosch and Walling are professionals who are dedicated to obtaining justice for victims and to protecting society. In this case, however, both investigators have a personal stake in catching 'The Poet'. Walling was mentored by 'The Poet' early in her career and has always regretted her failure to capture him in that novel. Bosch's motivation is to get justice for the murder of his friend, Terry McCaleb (the protagonist of Connelly's ""Blood Work"").As she sparred with Jack McEvoy, in ""The Poet"" so does Walling initially resist Bosch's help. Of course, the two establish a common goal and work well together. While this may seem formulaic, it is positively credible here. And it was at this point, when the two work as a unit, that the novel became irresistible. I couldn't put it down. The wild crescendo will satisfy any reader of suspense/mystery fiction.As is the case with the rest of the Bosch series, Connelly relies on the same major character in ""The Narrows"": Los Angeles. His disappointment in the city for its vanity and cruelty is balanced by his incredible love for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35ZOCF54PKPNW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446611646#wasThisHelpful","R35ZOCF54PKPNW","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"About a quarter of the way through Michael Connelly's dark, yet brilliant ""The Poet"", protagonist Jack McEvoy arrives at the following conclusion regarding the death of his twin brother:""...the picture of my brother kept coming back to me. Now that sterile, lifeless photo bothered me. For I had believed the impossible. I had let [my brother] down and now felt a keener sense of guilt. It was my brother in that car, my twin. It was me."" These simple, economic sentences alone convey everything the reader wants to know about McEvoy--his deep sense of guilt and frustration. But they also prepare the reader for what will follow: these feelings will drive him to pursue the truth, and his dogged determination will lead him through terrors he could not imagine. It is this attention to character that lends so much credibility to Connelly's work, that makes his novels so absorbing.Of course, plot is just as essential to the success of any good novel. The plot more than twists in ""The Poet"". It does pirouettes and handstands without falling down or looking awkward. Yet Connelley keeps a firm grip on our hands as he leads us down the dark and twisted roads of criminal pedophilia and serial murder. The murderer, in this case, is hunting down cops obsessed with unsolved cases. (But there are plenty of other reviewers who will tell you the basics about the story.) The labyrinthine world of FBI behavioral analysis is convincingly portrayed (as well as the love interest that emerges from it).While I am a big fan of the Harry Bosch series, Jack McEvoy was just as engaging as a narrator. Perhaps this has much to do with Connelly's own history as a crime-beat journalist. Whatever. ""The Poet"" is as good a mystery novel that has been written in the last 20 or so years than any other.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CPGY8CV4YDHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446690457#wasThisHelpful","R1CPGY8CV4YDHI","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When the head of the department announces that a new textbook will be used for the freshman writing course, I normally gnash my teeth, break out in hives and make a great moaning. ""Oh, no, I was just getting used to teaching from the other one,"" I groan. Sometimes my despair is justified because the new book just doesn't work for me. Most of the time my grief is unwarranted because the new book is pretty much the same as the old. It's a pleasant shock when the new textbook is actually an improvement. Professors Eschholz and Rosa's ""Models for Writers: Short Essays for Composition"", in terms of content, style and practicality, has won me and my students over.The first thing that struck me was the size of the book. In spite of its 700+ pages, it is quite portable, unlike some other writers' guides that are about the size of a car battery and just as heavy. My students appreciated this, as well. Of course, it's the insides--the guts--that count. I like the arrangement of topics and most of the samples. (While all of us who teach English composition have our own fantasy textbook in our heads, in which we compile what we consider to be the best essays, we have to make do with what we are offered. *Sigh*) I will agree with one reviewer, however, that there are too many excerpts and not enough full-length essays. As far as the short shrift that is paid to MLA style, I can live with that since it is not part of our curriculum. In terms of what my students do need, I found the section on Process Analysis to be especially helpful.And speaking of students, I would be lying through my formerly gnashed teeth to say that they have embraced this textbook. What I can say is that they recognize that the writing neither talks down to them nor is too obtuse to follow.

"In his engrossing ""Honor Thy Father"", Gay Talese proves that four decades ago, The Mafia was not what it used to be, which was basically a monopolistic almost exclusively Italian criminal empire. It is a strange nostalgia. Outside of a few loose canons (like Albert Anastasia), it was comprised of men who were dedicated to secrecy and, especially, order. The trauma that was Appalachia, and the exposures by the Kefauver Commission and Joe Valachi, permanently crippled The Mafia. It is at this point where Bill Bonanno grapples with his new-found and unasked-for position at the top of one of the major crime families of New York and the nation. When his father, Joseph, is kidnapped, the spotlight really falls on him and his family, and where Talese begins his narrative. Talese does a fascinating job juxtaposing the problems of the Bonanno family with the problems of The Bonanno Family. While Bill Bonanno tries to keep things together with lawyers, trusted ""soldiers"", contacts and his father's enemies, he is less successful with his ability to keep his wife and children secure and happy. The agonies and frustrations of Bill Bonanno's wife, Rosalie, is very poignant and credible. I felt sorry for her.And, it is at this level that the book really succeeds, even now as a history. This is not your typical ""Mafia/True Crime"" book. Although there are a half dozen murders and bombings described in the book, there are no detailed, graphic, for-the-thrill-of-it sequences of vendetta killings and murders. The violence is surprisingly low-key, except in one or two key passages. Talese was not in for the shock value. He was describing the frustrating, dangerous and, surprisingly often, tedious (in terms of constant waiting) existence of a mob boss during those years. The stress, the occasional frustrations, and rare moments of success are intriguingly written. There will always be debate about whether Talese's ""New Journalism"" is creating fiction out of history but there is no denying that the book rings true on many points. While one might wonder, ""Did Bill Bonanno really remember what he was thinking twenty years ago?"" when he told his story to Talese, there is little reason to think otherwise. The personal dynamic between Bill and Rosalie or the rest of the family members is given the same attention as that given to the criminal activity. This is what makes ""Honor Thy Father"" so unique in the genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CPW7WLAXD64S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061665363#wasThisHelpful","R3CPW7WLAXD64S","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the pleasure of teaching a college-level class called ""Career Interest Review"". For the students, it is a reminder of the tough time most of them will probably have in the job market out there. On the other hand, I try to convey the point that the struggle would be worth it if they obtain the career or, at least, the career path that they desire. While the required textbook, Making Career Decisions that Count: A Practical Guide (3rd Edition) is fair, I supplement it with Jonathan Milligan's ""Career Manual."" There are several reasons for this. While the other textbook discusses the personality/career dynamic in a superficial and more ""workbook"" manner, Milligan's approach is more detailed without becoming esoteric. It is uniquely written in a way that neither overwhelms readers nor talks down to them. I also use this book because it tempers objectivity and reality with potential and inspiration.""Career Manual"" also explores many of the other elements of identifying a career path and the work environment. Such topics as identifying the different and observable personality types and management techniques, the work environment in general and some of the potential lateral career moves were well-received by the students. The job satisfaction survey was not so well-received because they had seen similar evaluations before. This is forgivable since such surveys can only go so far. Still, Jonathan Milligan's ""Career Manual"", whether you are a student, newcomer to the working world, or a battle-scarred veteran, is a reasonably priced and valuable tool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18OWRTPW09O9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087GFWG6#wasThisHelpful","R18OWRTPW09O9H","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Almost dead-center in Michael Connelly's ""The Closers"", there is a line that goes something like ""Redemption is the brass ring that everyone reaches for."" And this is in keeping with Harry Bosch's thinking in the novels of this period. In the immediately preceding novels, ""Angel's Flight"" and ""Lost Light"", there was a great deal of discussion about Bosch's struggle to fight the good fight, and how there were too many gray areas involved that make the struggle even more difficult.In ""The Closers"", Bosch, now back on the LAPD after a brief retirement, finds himself partnered with his old friend, Kiz Rider, to investigate a case that is 17 years cold. (""Closers"" being the police slang for detectives who close old cases.) As any reader of Connelly's fiction has come to expect, the path to the truth of the case is often twisted, contradictory and dangerous. (And Connelly, as usual, writes in a way that goes above and beyond what one would expect from the genre.) In this novel, Bosch and Rider have to jog the memories of witnesses and participants in the investigation, view incomplete files (if the files hadn't been 'lost' over the years) and make sense of evidence that point in different directions at times. This was no easy task. The perpetrators aside, Bosch's old nemesis, Irvin Irving, is still sniping from the sidelines, making the mission more difficult.But that's the issue!Bosch realizes, by the end of the novel, it is the mission itself, the journey toward the truth, that provides the redemption that he had obsessed over. Although Bosch remains loyal to his belief that everyone counts or no one counts, he is also discovering that the desire to seek the truth for those who cannot find it themselves, is just as important. That is the mission. That is the brass ring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U26L8WWFR1Q7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446616443#wasThisHelpful","R2U26L8WWFR1Q7","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Labor Day is quickly approaching which means my summer of reading murder mysteries exclusively is coming to an end! I have gotten acquainted with a few writers I had always wanted to read, and Tess Gerritsen was one of them. Without realizing it, I had saved one of the best for last.""The Sinner"" was fundamentally different from several of the mystery novels I had read in one particular way: It focused on two investigators--Medical Examiner Maura Isles and Detective Jane Rizzoli--working on the same case but independently, for the most part, of each other. In most crime fiction, you have one investigator who either works with a partner (who is really a glorified side-kick) or works alone. ""The Sinner"" is structured around two women, each with their own personal agonies, investigating a murder and an assault in a chapel which may or may not be tied into the murder of a homeless woman in an abandoned building. Even when they are apart, Isles and Rizzoli work along parallel paths. The novel is its most interesting when those lines cross and the pair have to work together.I liked the fact that Gerritsen avoided the ""buddy"" approach to Maura and Jane. They do like and care about each other, but they are not close, dear friends. (Since most of the action takes place just before Christmas, and at a point where each woman is faced with a personal crisis, I shuddered with dread that the book would end with them slogging a mug of egg nog and singing carols together on Christmas Eve. Whew, they did not.) Gerritsen allows us to view the crimes from two perspectives: the distant forensics of Maura's medical science and Rizzoli's in-your-face interrogatory style. But even if their styles differ, their dedication to solving the crimes is exactly the same. They don't step on each other's toes but neither do they stand arm-in-arm as ""buddies to the death"". They respectfully work together and diligently work apart.I had to shave off one star, reluctantly but I think justifiably, for the resolution and denouement. Not that they were incredulous: they were very logical. However, they were just so rushed. In less than eight pages, the villain is revealed, the villain is pursued, the villain takes a hostage, and the villain is caught. Later on, in one page, the villain's motive is explained. I felt just a little cheated. Still, this did not take away from my overall enjoyment of the previous 300+ pages. This was an engaging mystery well-told, and a great study of two women who would and should become friends but not ""buddies"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZZX8GBEK8WQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345458923#wasThisHelpful","R1ZZX8GBEK8WQG","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Andrew Vachss' ""Two Trains Running"" was just that: at times, it was a rollicking runaway express train, at others it was a slow moving but hugely powerful freight train. Vachss knew just when to slow down for some blistering social commentary and when to stoke the fire to get the plot moving again. Needless to say, I enjoyed the ride.In the novel, a seedier, smaller version of Las Vegas, called Locke City, is threatened to be pulled apart in 1959. The older regime (political, criminal... it's all the same) is run by ""mountain man"" Royal Beaumont and his long suffering sister, Cyn, who can never seem to complete a sentence without her brother interrupting her. For years Beaumont has run the vice, rackets and, basically, the town. But now The Mafia (recently exposed by the Kefauver Commission) is looking to expand into this midwest border town. Represented by the vicious lummox Sal Dioguardi, the Mafia has big plans for Beaumont's domain.What's a poor mountain man to do to protect his assets? Hire outside muscle. Enter Walter Dett, a calm, methodical, uber-sociopath who, in the course of committing a couple of murders, falls in love with a local waitress, Tussy. Another criminal enterprise, an all-Irish gang, run by Mickey Shalare, watches from the sidelines, seemingly neutral. Finally, there is Detective First Grade Sherman Layne trying to make sense of it all, and wondering how much of his own corrupt activity is affecting and being affected by recent events. Right there, you have the elements of a fiery, gripping novel. The climax of this volatile mix is complete and credible.So why did I shave off a star? To belabor my earlier metaphor, the train had one caboose too many. Street rumbles, Black activists, Nazi-wannabees, shady journalists, rogue G-men, meander in and out of the main narrative. Subplots are fine with me but when I invest in them, only to have them disappear, I get the feeling that the author didn't know how to wrap them up. I know that life can be like that, novels shouldn't be, at least, not so many characters and situations simply abandoned after they have caught your interest.In spite of all this, there is so much to redeem this novel. It truly is unique in many ways and, for the most part, a book that stays with you long after you've finished.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y6M7RYW9PEI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400079381#wasThisHelpful","R2Y6M7RYW9PEI7","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have dedicated this summer to reading nothing but mystery novels, and I am loving it! Case in point:Harry Bosch, in Michael Connelly's ""Lost Light"", is now retired from the LAPD, and yet his search for the truth still compels him. In this case, the theft of $2 million dollars from a movie set and the trail of corpses before, during and after the violent robbery is the focus of Harry's investigative skills. In particular, the cold-blooded murder of Angella Benton, an employee of the movie studio, is haunting him and has been for years. As always, Connelly's writing moves well-beyond expertise and craftsmanship; it is an art. I have finally come to realize that there are few as good (and none better) at the genre than Michael Connelly.The mystery and action elements aside, ""Lost Light"" is a great read for other reasons. Fans of the Harry Bosch series may be jarred by the use, for the first time, of the first-person narrative. Although Harry's voice had been so close to the third-person narrator's voice (or is it vice-versa?) in previous installments, we get Harry's immediate responses--his spontaneous reactions--to comments and situations that were only reported in other novels, leaving us to decipher the feelings behind them. This new approach worked well here.Another intriguing element here, and I believe it has much to do with the title and its explication toward the end of the novel, is the exploration of the gray area, the clouded, unclear directions that life presents us. In Connelly's ""Angel's Flight"", Bosch realizes that angels can fly both ways: they can ascend to heaven or become fallen angels. It's one way or the other. In ""Lost Light"" Bosch realizes that things are not that simple. He muses that there is a Paradise Road in LA but also a Devil's Punch Bowl. ""There is no sign leading to Paradise Road,"" Harry realizes. Paradise may have no roadsigns but the path to The Devil's Punch Bowl is just as tricky. While LA may be the City of Angels, Bosch is all too familiar with its evils. Yet, Las Vegas--one of America's largest ""Sin Cities""--holds what may be the key to Bosch's paradise. The novel is filled with such dichotomies.Sad, to say, my summer of reading mystery novels exclusively is coming to an end. But I could think of no better novel than ""Lost Light"" to cap it off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLTBSC4M5G5TJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446611638#wasThisHelpful","RLTBSC4M5G5TJ","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My students want to kill me: bottom line. After spending part of the summer semester complaining about how I have battled cigarettes for thirty years, what my students picked up on was the ONE time I griped about a cheap-O lighter that wasn't working. At the end-of-semester party, my students conferred this lighter upon me as a farewell gift. It was thoughtful. It is sleek and elegant, stylish and black. Perhaps my coffin will be like that once my lungs blacken.But that should not detract from the quality that goes along with the ""Zippo"" name, and this lighter in particular. All the romance (as in ""history and associations"", not lovey-dovey stuff) that is attached to it makes it a keeper. Of course, it works well. My only complaint was that the one and only time I dropped it on the sidewalk, a bit of the black coating chipped off. Maybe it was just bad luck--the way it landed. But I will of course continue to use the Zippo. And as for my students, maybe they'll visit me in the cardiopulmonary ward.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36QWJV1YDSUG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017T2LQY#wasThisHelpful","R36QWJV1YDSUG2","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having her car incinerated, her apartment firebombed, being shot at, lunged at with a knife... that's all child's play to Stephanie Plum when compared to the threat of an old Italian woman giving her the ""malocchio"" or evil eye. In the case of Janet Evanovich's ""Four to Score"" the curse may come in the form of bearing Joe Morelli's baby. As if she doesn't have enough trouble with fugitives, jealous boyfriends and/or girlfriends, a six and a half foot transvestite, rival bounty hunters, Mafia wives, and a killer with a penchant for removing fingers, Stephanie finds herself embroiled with the Morelli family--the old women in particular. Like Macbeth's three weird sisters, these old crones fall into trances, have visions, and make predictions. One of those visions have to do with Stephanie bearing Morelli's son. Horrors! (Well, at least they give her a lasagna casserole to munch on.)As always, Evanovich surrounds Stephanie with the usual ensemble cast: Lula, Connie, Grandma Mazur, Ranger, etc. But Joe Morelli gets the spotlight in this installment, and deservedly so. After all, Stephanie has to camp out in his place after her apartment is burned out. More important, their relationship takes a very carnal turn. Joe and Stephanie have a real stake in this now. When thoughts turn to kitchen curtains and cookie jars, both shudder at the potential of commitment.In the long run though, it is crime that glues everyone together. Who is passing around funny money? What did an angry young woman steal from her ex-boyfriend that is ticking him off and why is she leaving cryptic clues as to where the thing is? Who strangled a convenience store clerk and is scalping and chopping off women's fingers? Who is threatening Stephanie's life? Who might be placing Stephanie's hamster, Rex, in danger? All these questions (well, with the exception of the last one) keep the plot moving at a swift place. And Evanovich's ear for the right humor at the right time is pitch perfect here. ""Four to Score"" is another great installment in the Stephanie Plum series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLMG50CCOETXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312966970#wasThisHelpful","RLMG50CCOETXV","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Being a klutz and as proficient with tools as a gerbil, this was simple to assemble. Right now, I am enjoying the breeze as I type.

"Janet Evanovich's ""Plum Lucky"" is a bit of a departure from the Stephanie Plum series only in the sense that our heroine is taken out of her comfort zone for most of the novel. In this case, most of the action is focused on the casinos of Atlantic City and not the back streets Trenton (although it's still Jersey). The other comforts that are, for the most part, missing are Ranger and Joe Morelli who figure only marginally in ""Plum Lucky"". On the other hand, we spend a lot of time with the intriguing Diesel, who may or may not be from another world. That's okay: other characters are possibly losing their minds or are leprachauns or can speak to animals (a la Dr. Dolittle). Fortunately, Stephanie is grounded by the relative sanity of Lula and Connie. (""Relative"" being the operative word.)But the glue holding ""Plum Lucky"" together is the cantankerous, curmudgeon Grandma Mazur. Even when she is not there--like when she is snoring fitfully in another room or stowed away in the trunk of a car--she's still there. I don't have a problem with her stealing the show from her granddaughter in this novel. How can you argue with an old woman who finds a million bucks in a duffel bag in an alleyway on St. Patrick's Day and believes it is the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow? And what better way to invest that money than by haunting the slot machines of Atlantic City? Stephanie Plum has a lot readers and devoted fans among mystery readers but so does Grandma Mazur. And, in ""Plum Lucky"" she hogs her moment in the spotlight!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EWSR8VOXVA1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312377649#wasThisHelpful","R1EWSR8VOXVA1M","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most of my home and kitchen product reviews center around the fact that I live in a small (2-1/2 rooms), urban (New York City) apartment which I share with a cat. Every square inch has to count, and common sense must dictate its usage. Since I am considerably lacking in ""square-inchage"" (and common sense), I found Heather Lane's ""How to Organize Small Spaces"" to be quite useful. Did I use every tip? No. Did I use even half? No. But I have to admit that many of them did apply, some better than others. For the first time in years, I have seen the back wall of my hall closet. One thing that I did on my own (and I was surprised that it isn't emphasized enough in Ms. Lane's book) was donate a lot of stuff to charities. My stockpile of murder mysteries was donated to a senior citizen's center. And several items of clothing which haven't fit me in years made their way to Salvation Army bin.

What Professors Morrow and Weston in ""A Workbook for Arguments: A Complete Course in Critical Thinking"" have done is to provide teachers and students with exercises that are not only relevant to the course but relevant to their lives.The discussions about media and popular culture (although a bit dated) allow students to see how these elements have made an impact in the ""real world"", in ""real life"".

"The Evanovich/Hughes collaboration, ""Full House"" is, in a nutshell, one part ""I Love Lucy"", one part ""Sex and the City"" and one part ""Criminal Minds"". The parts aren't always as good as the whole, and vice-versa. Billie is a divorced, mother of two, who meets playboy millionaire, Nick. Right off the bat, the book becomes a kooky romantic comedy of the 1950s sitcom type, including a horse stepping on Billie's foot. Within hours, Billie is hoodwinked into ""baby-sitting"" the ditzy redhead, married-many-times sister of the playboy, DeeDee. (Her favorite expression is ""EEYUEEWW!"") Then the sexual tension between Nick and Billie kicks in, and the novel becomes a kind of ""Sex and the City UltraLite"". Before you know it, a series of home break-ins, arsons and explosions rock the neighborhood. These become amplified in the end when the bombings become more intense, and the book ends in an abduction, murder and attempted murder.There is just enough for everybody here and, at times, too much for anybody. Billie's spontaneous turn at striptease outdoes anything Lucy Ricardo might attempt, but in the end proved to be just one of too many distracting and unnecessary episodes. Some sloppy editing (Billie's son, Joel, inexplicably became Joey at one point) didn't help. And where the criminal element was supposed to intrigue me, I was growing impatient instead. I dunno.

"In Lawrence Block's ""A Drop of the Hard Stuff"", Matthew Scudder recounts a tale from his early days of sobriety. While attending meetings, Matt encounters a childhood acquaitance, Jack, who is working his Eighth and Ninth Steps of sobriety, in which the recovering alcoholic must list the people he has hurt and make ""amends"". Well, Jack had not been a good boy and some of the people he had hurt may just be looking to hurt him back. One does, and another may have killed him because Jack dies sober--of a bullet in his head and mouth. The message is ""shut up"". From there, Matt (and the reader) is taken on a wild but sad ride. The outcome will surprise you.""A Drop of the Hard Stuff"" is interesting for another reason. By setting the novel somewhere in the very early 80s (there is a discussion about the ""new twin blade razor"" and a scary ""gay cancer""), Block seems to relish the old fashioned detective work. At the very end, there is talk about how easy it is to Google things and get information off the internet. ""A Drop of the Hard Stuff"" takes us back to the day when walking the streets and pounding on doors for answers were the only ways to crack a case. There were no emails, AFIS, criminal databases... everything was dependent upon a cop's wit, energy and determination: things that Scudder has in ample supply. It is apparent that Scudder was comfortable in that world and, I suppose it's safe to say, so is Block. I think he misses that old school of mystery writing. I can't say I blame him.Like some of the other novels in the Scudder series, there is a lot of talk about alcoholism and recovery. In this novel, however, these elements are key to the plot, so they may not seem as distracting. It was also fun but sad to see some of the old characters--some dead since the early 80s--come back. Everything about this novel--the dialogue, the scenes of a lost New York, the booze worshippers and the Step Nazis--ring so very true.

"As I mentioned in a previous review, one of the pleasures of my teaching job is that I am sometimes called upon to teach a class that is out of my ""jurisdiction"", and ""Film and Literature"" is one of them. The last two times I taught it, I used Dennis Lehane's Mystic River followed by Clint Eastwood's adaptation. This summer I thought I would change things up and use Lehane's ""Shutter Island"" with Martin Scorcese's adaptation. It turned out to be a great decision; the class ate them up.Many of my students remarked that they were chilled while reading the novel; one even compared it to reading a Stephen King novel. And this jibes with my impression (and the impressions of many reviewers here) that ""Shutter Island"", at its core, is a Gothic/horror novel. My students were equally engrossed with the film. Scorcese follows the novel up perfectly. He uses his classic techniques--the long tracking shot, the split second editing and choppy points of views--to make a truly tense and often horrifying nightmare come alive on film. Several episodes involving ""migraines"" are bleached white to enhance the photosensitivity of those headaches. These blanched scenes are often surrounded by shots of haunting darkness or blood red phantasms. The performances all around are on the money: DiCaprio, Rufalo, Kinglsey, etc. are all perfect. The result is a strangely sad film--there is that haunted melancholy that is so characteristic of Lehane's novels that translate so well into film--given the right director. Scorcese was the right director in this instance. This is a terrific film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27PD3B9XTMQMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEBB8NI#wasThisHelpful","R27PD3B9XTMQMA","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always been a big fan of the mystery genre. For years I have been reading Lawrence Block, Harlan Coben and Michael Connelley. However, I dedicated this summer to reading the mysteries of writers I had never read before: Janet Evanovich, Lisa Scottoline and Sandra Scoppettone. Now, I have added one more writer (who also happens to be a woman), Barbara Parker. Her ""Suspicion of Guilt"" just added to my summer reading of delightful skullduggery.""Suspicion of Guilt"" has plenty of the elements that we expect from a novel of this genre. It has a murder (which leads to other deaths), some poltical intrigue, and loads of money in the balance. The (very slowly) simmering romance between Gail and Anthony adds some neurotic spice, although it is a bit detracting at times. It also has the classic battle between an old-timer's fantasy (Sanford Ehringer) about what life should be like versus a young idealist's version (Patrick Norris), and the means by which they will attempt to acheve their visions.What, to me, sets ""Suspicion of Guilt"" apart from some of the other novels is the non-stop office bickering at heroine Gail Connor's law firm, Hartwell Black and Robineau. Although Lisa Scottoline's novels center on a law firm that is always debating about what is legal and what is ethical, Connor's firm wrangles over public relations and the bottom line. To me, this dollar-and-cents element rings just as true as the moral concerns--perhaps moreso. You might ask, ""What does that have to do with murder mystery?"" Answer: ""Everything!"" Read it and see. Another new dimension is the involvement of Gail's moody (but not disturbed) 10-year-old daughter, Karen. Her appearances and participation are breaths of fresh air throughout the novel. And speaking of fresh air, I am heading to Coney Island's wonderful beach with a new mystery in my book bag. I'll get back to you about it later.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL7JU7A2J485K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525937692#wasThisHelpful","RL7JU7A2J485K","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As I have written in previous reviews of editions of Shakespeare's plays, the Folger Shakespeare Library is the most accessible for students to use and for me to teach from.

I could understand their preconceptions; they knew ""To be or not to be"" and ""Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow"". There are no very famous quotes from this play. In any event, they equated Shakespeare with tragedies. They were surprised by ""All's Well That Ends Well"". They were shocked by the sexual references and the entire ""bed-switching"" concept. They loved to hate Parolles and laughed with satisfaction when he is undone.What makes this edition preferable for students are the face-to-face footnoting and explications. Students appreciate not having to flip to the back of the book or have the bottom of the page (and, therefore, the flow of the reading) cut through by footnotes. And finally, there is the price. The Folger Shakespeare Library is always reasonably priced. This is a major factor when you consider what students are already paying for their college education.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XUEHC3K1BW71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743484975#wasThisHelpful","R1XUEHC3K1BW71","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I mentioned in some other health care product reviews that my hair is the only good thing I got going for me. I wasn't kidding. My teeth are always gnawing back at me. I brush, floss, see the dentist regularly but there is no way to get around the sensitivity I experience. My dentist recommended this Sensodyne Repair and Protect product and I went for it. After four or five tubes--pricey tubes, I might add--it was no better than regular Sensodyne or similar products. I mean, it's okay, and it lasts for a couple of hours, but then I feel I need to brush with it again, even if I haven't eaten anything or had any hot or cold beverage at that moment.

"One of the pleasures of my teaching job is that I am sometimes asked to teach a class that is out of my ""jurisdiction"", and ""Film and Literature"" is one of them. The last two times I taught it, I used Dennis Lehane's Mystic River followed by Clint Eastwood's adaptation. This summer I thought I would change things up and use Lehane's ""Shutter Island"". It turned out to be a great decision; the class ate it up.Many of my students remarked that they were chilled while reading it; one even compared it to reading a Stephen King novel. And this jibes with my impression (and the impressions of many reviewers here) that ""Shutter Island"", at its core, is a Gothic/horror novel. The elements are all there: the lunatics; the killers; the evil doctors; the raging storm, etc. Lehane does a wonderful job of making an island feel claustrophobic and a mind wide-open to possibilities--not all of them good ones. Unlike many of Lehane's other works, especially the Patrick and Angie series, this is not really a whodunit. This is more of what exactly is happening and why. Like all psychological thrillers, the path is dark, frightening and full of unpleasant surprises.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y7W2IULRJAMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062068415#wasThisHelpful","R1Y7W2IULRJAMG","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"...some people might need a box of tissues handy. ""A League of Their Own"" is not a sad movie--far from it--but it has its nostalgic zings at the end, as well as a couple of heartbreaking moments. Yes, this is a movie about baseball, and it succeeds at that level--just read the other 300+ reviews. But it is also a movie about the struggles American women went through during WWII: the shortage of eligible men; husbands dead, dying or maimed overseas; the challenges of being taken seriously; manipulative employers and owners, etc. (And, once the war was over, things would not get better for many of these women, as they would be pushed out of the spotlight and into some suburban, kitchen-appliance-filled, anonymous Eisenhower-era home. Although this is not depicted, we know their fates.)The film is shot fairly conventionally, which I thought was appropriate. Penny Marshall allowed her very talented cast to take the ball and run with it, so to speak. (I know, baseball not football.) Hanks and Davis spar each other nicely. The Madonna/O'Donnell sideshow has a lot of appeal. For my money, though, Lori Petty gave a much-needed electrical charge to the screen. She is the most vulnerable, most frustrated character in the film.There are some nice extras here but some were throwaways. I liked the ""Nine Memorable Innings"" documentary--I, especially liked what Geena Davis had to say. Some of the edited scenes were good, other scenes deservedly wound up on the cutting room floor. I could have done without the Madonna video--not one of her best songs or videos. All in all, though, this ""A League of Their Own"" set is a great addition to any movie lover's (or baseball lover's) collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9SAPE6M92J9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800177258#wasThisHelpful","R9SAPE6M92J9S","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Clint Eastwood, consciously, has created or participated in dozens of films that have defined the word ""male"", warts and all. This doesn't mean he ignores women or downplays their role in the world--far from it. But from the spaghetti westerns to ""The Unforgiven"", from the ""Dirty Harry"" movies to the one being reviewed here, ""Gran Torino"", the focus is on men and how they behave (or misbehave).""Gran Torino"" is about a ""last man standing"" in a sense. Walter Kowalski (are we supposed to think of Walter Chrysler?) is the last of a generation of white men who supported his family and defined his life in the auto works of The Motor City. But the complexion of the city (pun intended) has changed over the decades. His Gran Torino, which he rebuilt, is his link to the past. How he defends it, and by ""it"" I mean everything he has ever stood for, is a polar opposite of the weak-willed young man next door, Thao. In fact, Walt goes out of his way to teach him ""guy"" stuff, whether it's guy talk at the barber or buying hand tools (not power tools--important difference) or defending himself against thugs. Walt didn't get this message across to his own son but he tries with Thao, which I thought was important. Walt's continued dispute with Catholicism only emphasizes Walt's sense of rugged, male individuality.Now, Thao's sister, Sue... she's another story. No fear of confrontation for her. She is as in-your-face and brutally honest as Walter. And this is what I meant earlier, when I said that Eastwood doesn't downplay the role of women. Think of Maggie in ""Million Dollar Baby"" or Annabeth in ""Mystic River"". Toughness is a universal in Clint's world, it just seems that men need to be reminded of it and how to use it correctly. In any event, ""Gran Torino"" is a great tour de force, a movie that came out with little fanfare, but a huge heart and lot of grit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGV97THQ66HWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BCNK1Q#wasThisHelpful","RGV97THQ66HWZ","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The history of the interactions among the Dutch, the British and the Native Americans of the New York region is a grim but fascinating one. Most historians tend to focus on the tribes (Lenape, Algonquin, Delaware) who occupied Manhattan and New Jersey. The most successful of these, I believe, is Robert Grumet's First Manhattans: A History of the Indians of Greater New York. Professor John Strong's ""The Montaukett Indians of Eastern Long Island"" completes the picture by giving us a scholarly and, at times, anecdotal account of the peoples who occupied this region long before any European set foot there.The book focuses on the many treaties, promises and agreements made among these groups over the centuries. Some were kept but, sadly, most were vacated. However, the sections I found most valuable were those that concerned the cultural differences not just between the Montauketts and the Europeans but among the Montauketts and the other tribes, including those across The Sound in Connecticut and Rhode Island.On a personal level, I have familial ties to Montauk, and I found the histories of Hither Hills and Napeague to be especially engaging. This book, while scholarly in tone, is not inaccessible to the casual reader; Professor Strong has done a great job in making this arena, this history very accessible. I think anyone interested in the period and the milieu will enjoy this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RKW63333PL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0815630956#wasThisHelpful","R3RKW63333PL3","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a poignant element to unsolved cases, a haunted quality that goes way back in literary tradition wherein the ghosts of the wronged and murdered cry out for justice. ""Avenge my death!"" they seem to howl--think of the ghost of Hamlet's father. ""Swear!"" This sort of case seems tailor-made for Detective Harry Bosch, a man haunted by his childhood, by his experiences in Vietnam, and by the countless dead and victimized L.A. citizens. Couple this with Bosch's belief that ""Everybody counts or nobody counts,"" and it is little wonder why these cases absorb him so.Michael Connelly, in ""Echo Park"" has Harry searching for the answers to a case that has gone and stayed cold for years. (Connelly's most recent installment in the Bosch series, ""The Black Box"", is also in this vein.) Like echoes of a distant cry, Harry keeps returning to his case file on a murdered girl, Marie Gesto, hoping to ""hear"" something different. (I noticed how often the words ""hear"" and ""listen"" were employed when other sensory verbs could have been used.) When a break seems to come, in a van filled with grisly cargo, it seems too good to be true. And like all things that seem to be too good to be true, they usually are. From there, Bosch goes on his mission in his own unorthodox manner. ""Echo Park"", for me, is one of the better novels in the Harry Bosch series. All the elements of the crime and its solution are credible, frighteningly so. Most important, Connelly, early on in this series, was creating a full-length, all-around character, surrounded by equally believable minor characters. And speaking of echoes, I am going to have to echo what other reviewers have said, Connelly exhibits absolutely none of that complacency, none of that weariness, with a character who has been a proven success for decades.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19N05QX1ANXGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=044661646X#wasThisHelpful","R19N05QX1ANXGW","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"97 Orchard Street in New York City, now home to The Tenement Museum, is both an enlightening and sobering place to visit. Visitors cannot help but feel in their bones the thousands of moments of joy and desperation that went on among its walls. At the same time, there is a comfort in the ordinariness that the immigrants who had once occupied those rooms strove to and did maintain. The best way for these new arrivals to achieve this sense of ""home"" was through their cooking. In her book, ""97 Orchard Street: An Edible History of Five Immigrant Families in One New York Tenement"", author Jane Ziegelman (who is also the director of The Tenement Museum's culinary center) traces the dietary needs and desires of the Glockner, Moore, Gumpertz, Rogarshevsky and Baldizzi families.What emerges from these stories is the larger picture: the culinary back-and-forth between the immigrants and their new home in the New World. As Ms. Ziegelman explains, food was a source of comfort and a link to their old customs when times were tough: ""Their dream of a better life gone sour, struggling immigrants had nothing to look forward to, so they looked back instead, savoring the foods of a former existence."" And yet the ubiquitous fruit, meat, poultry and vegetable vendors offered the immigrants with affordable new American foods--can you imagine an immigrant from Latvia seeing and eating a pineapple for the first time?--while simultaneously providing them with the ingredients they had known in Europe.The abundance of meat and poultry in America stunned most of the new arrivals, as well as the American way of cooking them. (Many immigrants had never seen a stove before; they had cooked over small fireplaces.) In exchange, the immigrants provided Americans with new spices and new uses for old ones, and new ways of preparing new dishes. It was humorous to see, through Ms. Ziegelman's writing, how immigrants and Americans approached each other's cooking with, first, repulsion, then curiosity, then acceptance, then assimilation. In some cases, especially for the Jews who required kosher meals, centuries of traditional cooking and religious dietary laws were modified to accommodate the American workweek and mealtime schedules. At the same time, restaurants in New York were putting more and more immigrant dishes on their menus. This is the give-and-take, the two-way street I am suggesting.Finally, Ms. Ziegelman provides the reader with a generous sprinkling of recipes for the curious. Admittedly, I found the recipes intrusive, as I wanted the narration to continue. Perhaps they would have been better off as appendices. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this book and recommend to anyone interested in food and/or the immigrant experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GLQF5IRF9S6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061288519#wasThisHelpful","R3GLQF5IRF9S6P","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A wrestling match is the appropriate metaphor for what transpired between Jane Jacobs and Robert Moses, and their respective camps. It was one of many matches--but probably the most famous--between city planners/developers and the public they would affect. (The issue was recently examined by Michael Sorkin in his ""20 Minutes in Manhattan"" which makes a good companion for this book.)In his ""Wrestling with Moses: How Jane Jacobs Took On New York's Master Builder and Transformed the American City"", Anthony Flint does an admirable job of introducing us to the combatants, describing their strategies and analyzing the results. What I especially admired about the book was that it revealed that Moses was not alone among developers in riding shotgun over what was claimed to be ""in the best interests' of their cities. Other cities were undergoing the same banal, superblock ugliness. As a New Yorker, I tend to be myopic; I thought that ""The Master Builder"", Moses was alone in his desire to bulldoze and replace neighborhoods with hideous apartment complexes and highways. Not so! Also, as a New Yorker, I had not realized how much Moses' reasoning was initiated by the Eisenhower administration and its love for the automobile. (Heck, even Disney got involved in this movement, as Flint tells it.)Also, I must give a nod to Flint for defending some of Moses' motivations and actions. While Moses has been quite vilified, and deservedly for some of his works, he cannot have been a total monster, as he has been represented in many books about 20th Century New York.As for Jane Jacobs, Flint gives us a fine depiction of a dedicated and resourceful woman who was not easily intimidated. She was dedicated both in terms of energy and time for the causes she supported. She was resourceful not only in legal and community activism, but in her use of the press--and children! The scenes describing children circulating her petitions were marvelous. Jacobs was indefatigable, it seems. She accomplished all this while writing a book that would soon become the textbook on understanding the dynamicas of city life.So, there is much to recommend this book, as an introduction to this colossal wrestling match. Just be advised that this is a slender volume, made for a quick read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTEHQ9E9XQ4Q4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812981367#wasThisHelpful","RTEHQ9E9XQ4Q4","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If Dr. Martin Luther King had written nothing else, he would be remembered for his ""Letter from Birmingham Jail""; that is how great this document is. It would and should be up there with ""The Federalist Papers"" and Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address, among other monumental tracts of American history. I have always said this to my students who, after reading this, ask me ""Why wasn't this taught to us in high school? Why do we only know about the `I Have a Dream' speech?"" Good questions.Part of the reason has to do with the word ""overshadowed"" that appears so many times in reviews and analyses of this document. Dr. King had done so much, and said so much, for the cause of civil rights that his letter, while never ignored,  never really got center stage or the bright spotlight. Nonetheless, as Professor Reider justifiably reminds us in his brilliant ""Gospel of Freedom: Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Letter from Birmingham Jail and the Struggle That Changed a Nation"", the civil rights cause never got a more effective, erudite and emotional voice than ""Letter from Birmingham Jail"". The historic importance and background, as well as the literary merits of the letter, have finally been given a well-deserved and long-overdue analysis. (The section entitled ""Everything the Nazis Did Was Legal"" was espeiciall revelatory to me.)Students of American history--and literature--as well as future generations will appreciate this book. On a personal level, I know that I will bring much from this book to my classroom and encourage my students to read it.Rocco DormarunnoThe College of New Rochelle","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14O61JE4LWG5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620400588#wasThisHelpful","R14O61JE4LWG5J","A2WSI8HOWHFDOT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Disclaimer: I received this product of the ""EverKid Pendants Set of 2"" at a discount rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are based on personal use and are not in any way influenced by the seller. This is Darling!!  My twin Nieces take Ballerina Classes and I thought for their class presentation that I would get them something that would make them feel special. They wore them and all the little girls loved them, made my nieces feel like they were the envy of the class. Both of the chains are equal in length (16in) but, the pendants are a little different in size (the pink w/diamond studs is under an inch & the hot pink open with no back w/diamonds is exactly an inch round). These necklaces have been worn now for over a week non stop, showers, playtime, and even sleep, so far they have not tarnished, paint chipped off ar broke. THEY LOVE THESE Pendants with the chain, and I think that it was the BEST gift ever & highly recommend for your girls (of all youth ages)!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIH72T5UG11U0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013IDV2S4#wasThisHelpful","RIH72T5UG11U0","A1BIVOEHWU970D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BIVOEHWU970D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: I received this product of the ""CicaSolution Silicone Scar Stick Keloid"" by: PharmacyDirect Inc. at a discount rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are based on person use and are not in any way influenced by the seller. This Really Works!! My husband had been badly hurt with 1st and 2nd Degree burns on his foot and arm from a ""Radiator Hose"" that broke while driving the car. The fluid had leaked inside the car right by my husband's right leg and foot, plus while trying to stop the car, he got splattered on his arm.  I did some research on burns and scars and this had appeared on my Facebook page one day, and I'm so glad that it did!! The Dr prior to this incident had recommended, Aloe, Cocoa Butter and scar creams to decrease the inflammation and the redness, but none of that worked. I received this about a month later (after finding it) and without hesitation, applied to the scarred burns on the arm and leg.....OMG, within 24hrs the swelling from the scars had decreased, the redness had faded and the swelling from the scar tissue decreased as well. You do though need to be consistent though, I apply this to his scars  (in the beginning) 3X a day  for the first 48 hrs and then as recommended ""2X"" once in the AM and once in the PM. I do plan on getting again once this is used up for what I call the ""Just Incase"" but, hopefully I don't need to use it..This is a Highly Recommended Product for a First Aid Remedy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CXVIMYZP5CLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7JK4O0#wasThisHelpful","R1CXVIMYZP5CLG","A1BIVOEHWU970D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BIVOEHWU970D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

All opinions are based on personal use and are not in any way influenced by the seller.**Written by my Husband** My Wife makes  a ""Carnitas Burrito"" that will make your sit down and cry..It's That Good!! The only problem is that it is such labor to tear up all that shredded pork...=(  In fact, our family only gets to enjoy this treat once a month because the prep simple take too much time. Now that we have these ""BEAST CLAWS"", my wife is making these burrito's once a week!!! =) The claws dig right into the meat like it is butter and tearing couldn't be more fun and easy. I also cook in the kitchen as well, and used these for my Rosemary Whole Chicken. I didn't use the claws to tear, I use them to transfer the meat from the pan to the cutting board..easy as 1-2-3! It also aided as a Fork when I was cutting the chicken with my electric knife. We wish that we discovered this decades ago when cutting, tearing or shredding was needed then.

"This treatise on how the brain works, how it can go haywire, and how to fix it begins with the author explaining that he is primarily talking about the imbalance between the Prefrontal Cortex and the Limbic system composed of several parts in the brain, as the anterior cingulate, basal ganglia, the amygdala, and the thalamus all of which are involved in some aspect of defining your emotions. The right side of the brain primarily deals with emotions, while the left side deals with things like language, logic, and problem solving. This translates into things like when adults have a stroke presenting in the left hemisphere it causes the person to become more negative and depressed while a stroke [whether due to a blockage or hemorrhage] affecting the right side of the brain commonly leaves the person perpetually giddy or even laughing at inappropriate moments, often times resulting in mania.The implicit or non-plastic type of memory [not easily changeable] is based in the amygdala, while the explicit memory system [defined by past experiences] is based in the hippocampus and is more amenable to change since as we gain new experiences it has new things to consider before allowing us to form a course of action. Think of the amygdala as responsible for the FIGHT or FLIGHT response we have all heard about. Since the amygdala is pretty well established early in life and the hippocampus isn't fully developed till later in life, say up to the age of up to 25, by some authorities, we should not judge the crimes committed by children and adolescents as harshly as we would adults committing the same infractions because logic and control develop later in life than raw emotions. Basically the rest of the book deals with this imbalance and how to correct it.The author includes several indices with the first on nutritional supplements, the second on drugs, and then an annotated bibliography. I find a major shortcoming here in that there is little is no mention of negative effects of taking the various supplements let alone the drugs, and in what combinations they might be harmful.Another problem I saw was that the author who works for the AMEN Clinic in Reston, VA and the foreword by Dr. Daniel G. Amen of the same clinic who both give the impression that SPECT imaging is primarily the forte of the Amen Clinic when it is done in many other clinics and hospitals as the Mayo Clinic and Cedars Sinai  to name just two. A further problem is that neither doctor goes on to define the term SPECT Imaging right after it is first used at the beginning of the book. For those interested in what it stands for and how and why it is used; it is an acronym  for SINGLE PHOTON EMISSION COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY. Basically it follows gamma rays given off by a radioactive substance placed in your body. It gives a functional 3-D image of an organ like the brain as opposed to just a linear view. Therefore you can see how the thing [say the brain] works in real time while it is doing something rather than at just one point in time, say as with an x-ray. It can help to identify people suffering from ADD, as opposed to anxiety, or depression by seeing how a person reacts to different stimuli. This type of imaging is also used in cardiac care and in treating various bone diseases among other things. As far as the brain is concerned it can HELP differentiate among those suffering from dementia, clogged blood vessels, epilepsy and seizures, and traumatic brain injuries now commonly diagnosed in many NFL players among other athletes involved in contact sports.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WJOB71ZS3RIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594632979#wasThisHelpful","R2WJOB71ZS3RIN","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this scooter to review with two of my grandsons in mind. The oldest is 6 and about the 70% in height and weight while his little brother  recently turned 3 and is in the 99% in height and about the 95-96% in weight. They already had a three wheeled scooter, so were somewhat familiar with riding a scooter although a three-wheeled scooter is easier to balance on. The older had little trouble, while the three yo took a couple days to adjust to it, but still got the hang of it by about the third day. It was a good fit for the 3yo who is very big for his age, while it seemed a little small for the 6yo. But It only took about 15-20 minutes to assemble and it was rather intuitive.The deck you stand on is plastic but is supported by steel struts underneath. The handlebar are adjustable up and down so can fit kids in a modicum of height ranges with a simple adjustment. The wider than normal tires help with stability issues, especially with the younger kids. While the larger front wheel makes it easier to steer and not lose balance going over sidewalk imperfections. Both of the kids liked the foot brake on the rear wheel.I thought it seemed durable and should last a couple years. My only criticism is I would have liked to see the deck made of metal rather than just plastic supported by a metal frame and I think it would be a little small for a larger 6yo. It brought back nostalgic memories when I was a kid and had an all steel Radio Flyer wagon in red, of course, and my own kids had a Radio Flyer wagon with detachable wooden side railsBut considering the price, I thought it was a good buy and would therefore recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VY25CQNOY9SH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTASIJ4#wasThisHelpful","R1VY25CQNOY9SH","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author delineates each chapter with particular type of con artist and then expands from there. She begins with one of my favorites, Ferdinand Waldo Demara, born in Lawrence,MA on 2/21/1921. One of his wildest impersonations was as a ship's doctor on the Royal Canadian Navy destroyer, Cayuga, when he got tripped up for being too good at the medical profession in saving 19 wounded North Korean servicemen the Canadians picked up in a small boat during the Korean War in September of 1951. Who knows how long he could have pulled off this masquerade, with absolutely no formal medical training had the newspapers not broadcast his medical achievements thereby revealing his phony identity. He also got a job as the warden of a men's prison in Texas, among many many other borrowed identities. There is a fine movie detailing his exploits called THE GREAT IMPOSTOR starring Tony Curtis as a young Fred Demara.The author interjects neat quotes throughout as one attributed to Voltaire on page 6 of the proof edition ""Religion began when the first scoundrel met the first fool."" And soon thereafter states ""The true con artist doesn't force you to do anything; he makes us complicit in our own undoing.""I have two minor criticisms of the book, the first being a lack of cites when quoting figures, at least in the proof edition, thereby rendering them as mere conjectures as with the reference to con artists, ""A third were seen as extroverted, and 35 percent present as quite friendly. About 40 percent were also highly respected by their colleagues.""  [ page 36 of the proof edition] The second point being, I thought the book belabored some points, but all in all a quite enjoyable light read.Having worked with sociopaths/psychopaths/antisocial personality types for 40 years i have generally found the successful con artists who get away with their scams for numerous years are always likable, while the disagreeable types quickly land in prison. They are also  very to extremely intelligent or they couldn't pull it off for so long, although some may disagree with both personal observations. Read the book to find out who and how some of the big time cons got away with it for so long and what ultimately tripped each of  them up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S8OCHRXTEAP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525427414#wasThisHelpful","R2S8OCHRXTEAP5","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A work of historical fiction devoid of 4-letter word exclamations with a steady pace and fairly predictable outcome yet with enough minor suspense to keep the reader engaged throughout. The story was simple and written in the style of a century ago, which is when the events took place.The story begins in 1914 with the three Kopp sisters, Constance, Norma, and Fleurette [or are they really sisters] driving to Patterson, NJ in a horse and buggy when a car driven by the inebriated Henry Kaufman, scion of the Kaufman Silk Dyeing Company, runs into them with his motorcar accompanied by an equally inebriated group of thugs/friends. He denies responsibility for causing the wreck in which Fleurette sustains a broken leg and to which the burden of trying to collect the damages for the buggy repair falls on oldest sister Constance, while middle sister Norma tries to mediate the situation.  The story later involves a kidnapping of a baby boy, denied parentage by the father, and attempts of bodily harm and murderThe story sets up well for a sequel with a love interest between the sheriff, Bob Heath, and Constance. The author does a nice job of character development  of the three Kopp sisters, the sheriff and the all important secondary characters. The plot isn't a hard core mystery and not suspenseful, but is so engaging that you'll want to keep reading just to assuage your own feelings that things will come out rightfully in the end. The author became one of my favorites when I also reviewed  one of her earlier works, THE DRUNKEN BOTANIST, which was far different in tone but just as delightful in its own way.Not as much suspense as some crime novels, but still engaging in a pleasant manner with a lack of offensive language so rare in most of today's story-telling.

"This is my first George Foreman Grill. I Found the grill to be quite light weight, making it easily portable and able to be switched from its standard pedestal base to use on a table or counter-top. I tried three different foods on it before doing this review - Steak, Shish-Kabobs, and Chicken quarters. It did a good job on all of them, and all were cooked outside on my rear deck. However, it did not cook as fast as a charcoal or propane grill. But I couldn't fairly compare it to my large stainless propane grill, as there was a tremendous price difference also. Yet it did fine for grilling up a meal for 2 to 4 persons. And, I could see how it would be quite handy for apartment dwellers, especially those with small patios due to the minimum amount of space it takes up.It did a good job of cooking the different meats I tried while leaving them still juicy, but allowing the fat to drain off. For serious chefs think of the difference between a gas stove and an electric range; for everyone else does it really matter? Most grilling is about the camaraderie anyway. I found some of the same negatives that other reviewers have mentioned, as a plastic drip pan rather than metal and the pedestal base felt a little flimsy to me. Yet it was easy to put together and take apart, if you wanted to carry it to an off-site gathering, assuming you had electricity available. One other negative was that it was missing two screws of the four that used to hold on the legs for tabletop use. I realize that is merely a quality control issue, but still it happened. BTW the screws appear to be #6 semi-pan head Phillips 3/8 inch long. The rest of the assembly was quick and uneventful.All in all a nice grill considering the cost and the negatives versus the positives that I mentioned, and quite useful for those living in an apartment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X3JPZHY694IB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUWZA#wasThisHelpful","R1X3JPZHY694IB","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice all around work shirt with plenty of room to spare. The shirt has extra long tails with an even bottom length rather than a scalloped bottom cut so that it can be worn tucked in or out, depending on your employer's preference. I am 5'10"" tall and weigh about 182. In a LARGE, it would still fit someone 30 pounds heavier and 4-5 inches taller.The back is neatly vented with a cloth mesh piece sewn in the inside upper back and shoulder area to wick away moisture [sweat]. The shirt has seven heavy duty well sewn on buttons. It has 4 pockets and two added loops. There are 2 standard covered breast pocket with cover flaps attached by Velcro rather than buttons. Sewn onto each regular pockets is a smaller attached pocket which is also flap covered and attached by the same Velcro as the larger breast pocket. I am not sure of the purpose of the smaller pockets. It seems to be more of a fashion statement than utilitarian. There is also a smaller loop to the center edge of the left breast pocket and a much larger loop attached to the bottom of the right breast pocket. I am not sure of the purpose of these, except maybe to attach an alligator type clip on name tag where required, say in a medical/government facility. Again, I think this is more a matter of form over function, as I think name tags could be attached to the standard breast pocket flaps. But it is an option for those personnel required to wear tags, which is certainly less expensive than having each shirt personally embroidered.The shirts are well tailored with close stitching. I've worn the shirt two days now. Once before washing and today after washing. It looked neat and fresh after washing on permanent press with NO wrinkles. The button hole loops are also nicely reinforced and fit tight. The shirt gives a nice overall appearance and should look good after many washings.  The synthetic fabric did not keep me too hot, although I made it a point not to purposely stand out in the sun yesterday or today with the heat index hovering around 110.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IC7GGSYBDGII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F4N5I82#wasThisHelpful","R1IC7GGSYBDGII","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 7 piece knife set came with the following: 8"" chef's knife, 8"" bread/slicing knife, 5.5"" serrated blade utility knife.3.5"" paring knife, heavy duty kitchen shears, and a 600 grit sharpening steel, The set came in a simulated wood block wrapped in a pretty candy apple red painted metal. The block with knives weighs right at 10.5 pounds according to my balance beam scale and it has two semi-sticky rubber strips on the bottom to prevent the whole thing from moving around once set in place.The knives seemed sharp right out of the box, but the sharpening steel was a nice bonus, as most people could definitely use it to sharpen up a bunch of old knives they have in their drawers, as I already did. It did wonders for them. Also there are 4 unused slots in the block in which to place some of your older favorite knives.All in all a very attractive and useful addition for the kitchen counter.  The set comes with a lifetime warranty for the original and any subsequent owners with the original proof of purchase; much better than a time limited warranty - too bad my cars don't have such warranties.  There is also a separate 800 numbers for the company in the USA, Canada and Ireland in case of problems or to get some edges sharpened that you cant do yourself.

"The author quite ably describes his sexual experiences and failed attempts to lose his virginity from about age 6 to 18 in this humorous memoir,occurring during the mid 80s through the mid 90s or thereabout. The author grew up in a nicer middle class Jewish enclave just outside the Bronx, but when trying to develop his bad boy street creed he was sure to state he was from the Bronx.The author, Eytan Bayme, makes liberal use of profanities, so if you are offended by that sort of teen age boy talk, stop here and skip this book, If, however, that doesn't bother you, you will find this book humorously captivating and which quite typically describes the average teenager who might be too embarrassed to discuss such subjects as openly as the author did. He takes numerous jabs at making fun of himself in the same sort of self deprecating way as Woody Allen; so if you think Woody Allen is funny, you will enjoy this book, if not, there are millions of others to choose from.A couple of quick quotes which I found somewhat cute but accurate follow.  These are from a review copy, so the the page numbers or even the lines quoted may not appear or be revised in the finished release. '[P]eople like us knew that God wouldn't put things like Pizza Hut and Burger King on this earth if he didn't mean for us to try them...[L] is so unfair when you are a six year old Jewish boy.' [page 2] That goes doubly for one whose family is definitely trying to keep Kosher in all things. Then in describing a fight he had with his 3 year younger brother who was still bigger than the author  He says after kneeing his brother Yehuda, ""[H]e let out a shriek unlike any I had ever heard before, It was as though an air horn were crying over the death of his too young air-horn child."" [p42]I found the book enjoyable light reading  which means you can read some and come back to it later and still find it easy to pick up where you left off and still get a laugh out of the protagonist's antics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NH7JWE6GI4JY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250067227#wasThisHelpful","R1NH7JWE6GI4JY","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fairly Rugged but pricey considering its primary competition, Armorbox, is 17.99 on this date.I found this case to be ruggedly made for people requiring a lot of protection for their phones, as those involved in the construction trades or those expecting to engage in a lot of outdoor activities.  Yet aesthetics is not the strong of this product. This product stresses durability and ruggedness not eye appeal.The outer case is made of some silicone type material as a protector, which it would seem to do its job quite well, while the inner case surrounding the phone itself is made of a softer polycarbonate, as is the shield for the face of the phone.  For those not that familiar with this type of polycarbonate, it is supple and will bend readily protecting what is under it, while at the same time it will scratch quite readily, especially when submitted to grit and sand on most construction projects and outdoor activities, think hiking, camping, or a sandy beach. To better understand my point, think of the lens on a cheap pair of sunglasses and how long they looked good after wiping them a few times. BTW, although this product may have been designed in California it was definitely manufactured in CHINA, as stated on the outside packing.The product also comes with a plastic belt clip on a swivel allowing you to orient the phone both in portrait and landscape mode and on either your right or left side. The clip and the entire product is somewhat bulky, but appears to be rugged.  It is substantially larger than what most people would like for typical office work, but may be indispensable for outdoor activities.Although the product appears rugged, I could only give it 3.5 stars based on the unpleasing aesthetics, especially due to the inexpensively made belt clip and the very soft polycarbonate screen protector, which is sure to scratch in a short period of time used in the applications for which this product is being promoted.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L7NY6VPD4WS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSZM6LK#wasThisHelpful","R1L7NY6VPD4WS1","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My two dogs, Leo and Sherlock, have each brushed their teeth with Greenie products for several years now. They have always enjoyed the green colored, toothbrush shaped biscuits, but seem to really love the blueberry flavor judging by their devouring of them. I normally give them one each near evening TV time while I snack on human snacks.The treats seem to do their job as neither dog has noticeable doggie breath and both have sturdy teeth with Leo being almost 14 yo and Sherlock at 8.5 yo. They are somewhat more expensive than competing brands, but both my dogs seem to love them and it keeps their teeth healthy, which is a lot cheaper than having the vet clean their teeth.

"Have used the original electrodes for about 20 applications before they quit adhering as well as I would like.  To get a per use cost, if you divide the price by times of application, you can see that for a replacement medical product they are still inexpensive although by no means the cheapest. Yet there could be a material difference in the resistance level in different brands causing an increase or decrease in the intensity level of your unit. I would consider a divergence of plus or minus three intensity levels or 10% on Zewa's scale to be considered material. I will report on any other brands I later try and as an addendum to this review should I find such a variance, as cheaper isn't always better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KWH4U6WF56ZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMDYRLG#wasThisHelpful","R3KWH4U6WF56ZH","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have used this for about five days now and it works for me with spinal stenosis and sciatic pain.  I have used the original Maxell batteries that came with the unit for eight hours and they are still good. I normally use program four with an intensity level of 18-21 depending on where I place the electrodes. It has two separate channels each with 30 intensity levels which can be adjusted separately. I have moved the electrode pads to various body areas about 20 times and they just yesterday didn't seem to stck that well. You DO NOT need the gel to make the pads stick so save your money on that.You can use any replacement electrode pads that have a male RCA miniature type connector. The OEM Zewa electrode pads were good for about 20 applications for me. I have purchased another less expensive replacement pack and will report my experience with themThe unit is definitely powerful enough to make you jump on the highest settings so there is no reason to buy a more expensive unit, and with 8 different program settings which offer different pulse rates and duration, you get as many or more programs as more expensive units. The cost of the three AAA batteries is negligible, and if you are worried about that, maybe your pain isn't as bad as you say. Try paying the 175/hr at the physical therapist's to do the same thing plus the cost of waiting and travel time and you quickly see that electrodes and batteries are insignificant. And I have worked in rehab in a VA hospital so actually have some experience in this field.The sending unit is about the exact size of a pack of cigarettes only a few ounces heavier. As this has made a tremendous difference in pain relief to me, I can wholeheartedly recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRJ9GK24NUR6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMDYRMU#wasThisHelpful","RRJ9GK24NUR6F","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have used the cane for about two months and found it very durable. It will stand up by itself on very level ground and even sometimes on uneven ground, but don't count on that. It is much sturdier than canes having an articulating pod for stability and those canes normally come with only three feet rather than Hugo's four feet. It is very light weight with a large rubbery grip handle. It is also somewhat less expensive than the articulating pod canes. In fact, I can see no real benefit to the pod articulating, as most people needing a cane are going to do very little hill climbing, so I see that feature as more of a sales gimmick than a utilitarian feature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NLTTTQMUIVLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IV0BJ6#wasThisHelpful","R1NLTTTQMUIVLQ","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me  first say that adult assembly is definitely required, but no tools are needed.  The platic pieces fit together very nuggly, ao the little ones shouldn't be able to pull them apart once assembled  It also takes 3-AA batteries but they are supplied.  The batteries are needed to make the various sounds and the little peoples' voices.  The on/off and 2 position loudness switch is nicely recessed on the bottom of the toy,  I didn't notice much reduction in volume on the lower setting and the loudest setting should be loud enough with even a TV going in the same room. The plastic edges were adequately buffed ""rounded"" so scrapes from sharp edges shouldn't happen.  When you first turn the toy on, the little voice says ""Welcome to little people place."" Pause  ""Let's discover."" pause ""It's time for Miss Hug's magical rug.""  Pause ""What can you find?""  Very long pause with plenty of time for the kids to push one or more of the other side buttons on the rug.

"This is just a neat wooden block design toy for the very young. It reminds me of some toys I had and my own kids had rather than what is more commonly available for my grandchildren today. The train consists of an engine and two cars with 21 removeable pieces that will instill imaginative thinking for the younger set.  Sure some of the very youngest won't be able to get all the blocks back the way it came [which is a very good reason to keep the sturdy box it came in with a big picture of the train on the side showing how the pieces go together].  It says it is designed for kids 12 months old and up, but if a 12 month old could put it all together immediately where would the stimulus/challenge be for when he/she is a 2 and 3 year old?The colors on the wooden block pieces are bright and shiny and the finish is uniformly smooth throughout.My only concern is that there are several pieces about the size and shape of a Tootsie Roll which may be enticeing for the very youngest to put in their mouth.  For that reason alone I didn't give it 5 stars, yet that problem can be easily rectified by withholding those few pieces for the very yougest, at least until they get a little older.  You can still put all the other pieces on the cars, besides kids will put the blocks on the cars in their own imaginative ways, while thinking outside the so called box.Cute well-made retro type wooden toy that both oldsters and the really young will relate to.

"According to the fabric tag, the entire pet bed is made of 100% polyester. It has a well concealed zipper across the entire back to remove the outer cover for washing. The wrap around the inner filler feels fairly thick and the outer covering is quite thick to prevent destructon by nails.However, in my case neither of my dogs want to go near it, as they are fairly old and set in their ways. One sleeps on a throw rug at the top of the stairs guarding the bedroom at night and the other sleeps on one of two huge doggy pillows in the bedroom. I assume with other animals or at least younger ones, they would be more inclined to try a new bed. It is sort of like staying in a fancy hotel, and yet your own bed feels so much more comfortable when you get back home.My only complaint is the same that others have made, which is that this seems rather pricey for a pet bed.

"The fire truck/resuce unit is made of a softer more malleable plastic so it can take some abuse without immediately cracking..  The unit comes with 2 -3V #CR2032 batteries used in lots of watches & pedometers for instance, which are included, and are used to run the emergency roof top flasher and a siren. There are no talking voices so the batteries should last a while. Little kids are pretty imaginative, so that shouldn't be a problem. There is a seperate button to push for both the siren and flashing light rack. The roof unit comes off to put in new batteries and the whole top of the cab comes off so you can put one or both men inside. The unit is fully assembled except for putting the men inside the truck if that is where you think they should be.  The men have removeable firemen type hats, plus articulating arms and legs to hold a bullhorn, hand held fire extinguisher, the hose nossle and truck teering wheel.  You do need to attached the hose to the reel mounted on the right rear of the truck.  The ladder goes up in the air and has a basket at the end to hold your firefighter.  The ladder moves around but does not extend beyond its fixed length.It should povide hours of fun for the younger set from four to eight or so. Just be sure to warn them not to put the pieces in their mouth as the men are only three inches tall and the other pieces are represented in scale so much smaller.I think it is a good buy for the dollar and is one more toy for our grandsons to play with when they visit.

"The first public orphanage in our nation officially opened its doors with a new building on October 18, 1794, although it was first authorized in 1790. It was located on the penisular part of what is downtown Charleston, SC today and stood a magnificent 4 stories high with a center section measuring 40x40 and two side wings each measuring 65x30. One wing housed the boys and the other the girls with administrative offices and the school in the center section. It was the largest building in the city at the time.This institution was designed to take in the poorest White children only. The children were housed from preschol age until old enough to be bound out into an apprenticeship program, often beginnning at age 8. Children too young to be admitted were referred to the Poor House or to a private wet nurse if still a baby. The children were given a most basic education meaning they at least learned to sign their name.  Considering many of their parents were completely illiterate as was much of the general population of the country as a whole, this was actually an upwardly mobile step. The education opportunities for boys was always more than for girls, as most of the girls were trained as seamstresses of domestics and eduction was not thought to be the most necessary part of either of those two jobs.On the fringes of some cases were two interesting but most shadowy groups of women caring for some of the children the Orphan House couldn't or wouldn't accept, and these were women of color, often working as wet nurses, and also prostitutes. At its peak in 1820 about 1 in 25 girls and 1 in 12 boys from the Charleston area lived in the Orphan House. [p69]""Over much of the antebellum era, Charleston's facilities for the mentally ill were the basement cells in the Poor House.  Persons confined to these cells were fed and protected from the elements, but received little else."" [p76]For much of the period prior to the Civil War the word destitution could be used interchangeably with alcoholism, and in this regard women were on a par with the men.  However, the most common reason for binding over a child was the inability to provide financially for the child commonly due to widowhood, as these were the poorest of the poor and barely scraping by when there were both parents, especially when the parent left alive normally had no skill or trade and was most likely illiterate.The author tells us that  ""Almost three-fifths of the 2000 plus children who came through the Orphan House before the Civil War left to enter a master's house [apprenticeship]...[Yet] in each decade the average trended downward..the share returing to the family increased."" [p142]""When Charleston established the Orphan House in 1790, it was the richest city in the nation...per capita wealth of Charleston was twice that of New England and the middle colonies, even including the slave population [which amounted to over 50% of the the entire poplulion] [p146]  Charleston's fortunes were basically built on cotton and the slave trade to pick it before the cotton gin was invented. ""in 1810 South Carolina produced half the cotton grown in the South; by 1821 that share had fallen to 28 percent and by 1834 it had fallen further to 15 percent.' [p147] Yet by late in the antebellum period Charleston was still the third most industrialized manufactring center in the South only superceded by Richmond and New Orleans.But as all things eventually change, ""In 1951 all the children in residence moved to a new facility at Oak Grove in North Charleston, which continues to the present as the Carolina Youth Development Center."" [p202] Shortly after the move, the Orphan House, Chapel and out buildings were torn down to make way for a new Sears Roebuck & Co. store, which itself was shuttered in 1981.The book provides a nice history of early life in the South of the period and especially a look at how the children of the poor were cared for at the time.  The author provided a most thorough and lengthy section of notes divided by chapter at the end and a complete indes of names of various persons used throughout with page references along with a seperate subject index. Well worth the time for the serious student of southern history and/or of orphans in colonial times..","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31CNMD5S3UAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226924092#wasThisHelpful","R31CNMD5S3UAL","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I really liked about this book in addition to its informative aspects was that the story was told in a conversational manner as if the author's were sitting down with you, the reader, and simply having a friendly discussion about all things neurological. In fact when the authors did slip into medical jargon they backed up and explained it in plain English, so you won't need a medical dictionary to accompany your reading of this book.I want to state that since I am reviewing from a  pre-release or galley copy, the page numbers of any cites are subject to change in the first and subsequent editions.An example of the plain language used is ""How do you begin to understand a sick brain...you do it by engaging the person inside and you do it on a case by case basis.."" [p7] That was the central theme of the entire book - listen to what the patient had to say before rushing to a diagnosis.The authors further explain some basic concepts from medicine and psychology as spheres of orientation written on charts as ORIENTATION  X 1,2,3, and sometimes x4 meaning the person knows1. Self - who they are in reality2. Place - where they are, the city, state, building, and etc.3. Time- the month, day, year, and approximate time of day4. Situation - why they are where they are, their purpose of being thereSince Aphasia [inability to speak] is a common place symptom of several different brain disorders, the authors discuss the difference between the two most common types WERNICKE's and BROCA's and how they differ and what causes each of them. This part is especially interesting to those wishing to know more about strokes.Again, to make clear their main points of always listening to the patients, the authors say ""Symptoms are what a patient reports. Signs are what a physician sees in an examinaton."" [p87]There is a great discussion of epilepsy and status epilepticus [continuous seizures occuring for hours or sometimes days until total collapse from exhaustion].The chapter on ALS was the most emotionally moving as all the patients realized the end result. just not the time of its occurrence.The chapter on Parkinson's Disease was informative, especially in light of the fact that Michael J. Fox was the doctor's patient some years ago. As PD sufferers know but others may not, L-dopa benefits wear off the longer you take it.  They also discuss various surgeries to help cure it and Deep Brain Stimulation with electrical devices.The chapter on Alzheimer's made clear that dementia can be caused by various diseases, it is just that Alzheimer's is the best known.On a more philosophical note, the next to last chapter discusses brain death and how or does it differ from biological death of the entire organism.

"A treat for history buffs in general and specifically for those interested in Tsarist/Czarist history as am I.The three stories are:1. A story of the intimate lives of the Romanov family itelf2. A description of the events from the worker strikes of 1905 until Vladimir Lenin took power in 19173. An observation of the life of the average man/ a peasant at the turn of the 20th century and how it contrasted with the lives of the very wealthy, particularly the Tsar and his extended family.The book is of moderate length with two seperate groupings of approximatley 70 Black & White plates showing the most interesting characters discussed in the narrative.  The chapter lengths are quite short with easy to read narrative and a derth of long and obfuscative words, so that it would be suitable for ate middle school readers andothers expecially interested in Russian History.  This narrative history is further divided into four sections:Part One: Before the StormPart Two: Dark Clouds GatheringPart Three: The Storm BreaksPart Four: Final DaysThe author thought to include a rather extensive bibliography, a more than adequate index, and a page of references for internet sites that also enable further study and a lot more pictures of the times and characters discussed.Most people would agree that the murder of the Tsar and his entire family and some of his entourage along with Anastasia's pet dog was a heinour and brutal crime, yet the author takes great pains and showing that Tsar Nicholas and his wife Tsarista Alexandra or Alix in German [she directly came from the house of ZHesse in Germany] and both she and Nicky were grandchildren of Queeen Victoria of England and also cousins. Actually most of European nobility was quite closely related at the time. Nicky and Alix lived a life that was so far removed from the common man that it is hard to describe. Alexandra thought the main palace at St Petersburg or Petrograd in Russian was too barren and cold, as it along with its outbuildings and servant and other family quarters stretched for approximatley three miles along the Neva River.  So she opted that they move into the more modest  dwelling of 800 acres with only 100 rooms about 12 miles away. Now, that really is roughing it, isn't it?  As a direct contrast we find out that ""most peasants had never slept in a proper bed, never owned a pair of leather shoes, eaten off a china plate, or [ever] been examined by a doctor.As the 20th century began, the blue bloods or BELAYA KOST, comprised of about 870 extended families of the Tsar made up about 1.5% of the population of Russia's 130 million people at the time, yet they controlled 90% of the wealth of the country. Talk about your income inequality. At the time, factory workers in the cities earned about 80 Kopecs/day or 40 cents for a 12 hour day.  Women only had to work 11 hours, so they could get home in time to prepare the meals and clean house for the rest of the family, yet they earned 1/3 of men's wages, and if you think that bad, young children who were forced to work the same 12 hour days as their fathers earned a mere 1/2 kopec/hour or 3 cents for a 12 hour shift.  If anyone complained they were fired on the spot.To put this more into perspective, at the time Nicholas was placed in captive exhile with his family, they took with them ""two valets, six chambermaids, ten footmaen, three cooks, four assistant cooks, a clerk, a nurse, a doctor, a barber, a butler, a wine steward tow pet spaniels, and a bull dog, p;lus later joined by tutors for the children, all of which was paid for by the average factory worker and peasant who were all starving at the time. When the family moved from one location to another it took 50 soldiers to move their personal belongings.  The grand duchesses wanted their bed linens changed daily as it had been in the palace, so they hired and outside laundry service racking up a laudry bill of 428.00 dollars for the first few weeks.The author does a nice job of covering many of the events of WWI and Russia's participation plus the relationship of Father Gregory Rasputin, the so-called STARETS or holyman and emperess Alexandra, who was trying to save young Alexei from death due to hemophilia. There is a nice background story to Lenin's rise to power, but the most mesmerizing part was the stark contrast of how 84% of the populace who were peasants lived as compared to the royals and their extended family. Most people know that the family took their own jewels with them and sewed them into the girls clothing,but what most people didn't realize is that those precious jewel weighed 19 pounds and were worth 14 million at that time.  Reading both sides of the story lets you come away with a different perspective of the tragic events.Well worth the read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20Q0OCHXKSW9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375867821#wasThisHelpful","R20Q0OCHXKSW9C","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author attempts to fill in a lot of minor facts left out by other biographies of Poe, especially in regard to getting some of his works accepted and published by the big name publishing houses of his era.Yet the author does manage to cover the necessary facts of Poe's life for those not having read another biography about him. Poe's parents were David Poe, Jr. and Eliza Arnold married in 1806; both were actors, with his mother considered quite attractive and the more accomplished of the pair.  They quickly had three children  with Henry (1807), Edgar (1/19/1809), and Rosalie (1810). The father forced to take bit parts and always considered the lesser of the pair succumbed to alcoholism shortly after the birth of their last child, and Edgar's mother considered beautiful but frail died shortly thereafter. Edgar was then adopted by a wealthy, but childless, merchant couple John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia from whom he derived his middle name. Although the adoption was in name only never having been legalized, Edgar spent his rather tumultous life with them until 18 when he ran away to Boston. He would have been considered a delinquent by today's standards, often getting in fights, drinking, and engaging in forgery and other petty crimes.  To avoid the bill collectors and others looking for him, he joined the army, whose strict discipline agreed with him, and rose from the rank of private to Regimental Sergeant Major in just under two years. Realizing he cold go no further as an enlisted man, he asked for an honorable discharge and attended West Point where his antics got him kicked out in a mere six months.Edgar spent most of his life dodging bill collectors and creditors due to his various and numerous misdeeds acquiring at least 5 aliasis, the best known being Henri Le Rennet, but at other times publishing articles under his brother Henry's name. To flee the cops he went to live with his paternal aunt Maria Clemm in Baltimore and promptly fell in love with her young daughter, Virginia. They lied about her age and were married in 1836 when he was 27 and she a mere 13. She turned out to be the love of his life and he of hers, with both being mutually suportive of each other until her untimely death from tuberculosis, of which there was no cure at the time, leaving Edgar more depressed and prone to drink than usual.Poe most likely suffered from Bi-Polar disorder, which explains his prodigous output at some times and his deep dispair at other times. He alienated friends and foes alike engaging in physical fights and by slanderous and libelous things he said and wrote about them. These actions cost him numerous jobs and writing assignments resulting in his never becoming a wealthy man.  As an example he earned only 166.00 for the entire year of 1848, which was quite pitiful for a learned man of letters, even back then. Poe also favored poetry over prose, which several publishers told him was far less popular with the general public.  He finally succumbed to the effects of alcoholism  at 5am on 10/18/1849 at the young age of 39.I have but touched on the general facts of Poes brief life, with many more incidents revealed in detail by the author, espcially his relationships with colleages and publishers.  Easy to read and certainly worthwhile for those with an interest in the man who is preeminently famous for the macabre and poems such as THE RAVEN and ANNABEL LEE..","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14MTQCMUGWAPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544261879#wasThisHelpful","R14MTQCMUGWAPJ","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bob Saginowski had worked at his cousin Marvin's Bar for about 20 years, since the time Marv had a crew and Bob was part of it, but Bob's life was pretty much short of anything interesting happening in it in 40+ yars. Even Bob describes himself as a ""never-been loser"". [p10 -since this review is from a pre-release edition, the page numbers in the final edition are subject to change]. This short novel is a reworked short story from a 2009 anthology called Boston Noir and was originally titled ANIMAL RESCUE.Although nothing much exciting has happened in Bob's life the past week, as the story opens, has been different as he explains, ""[I]n the past seven days, he'd found the dog, met Nadia, been robbed at gunpoint, adopted the dog, and been visited by a gangster who tortured men in the back of a van."" p65-66]The book gets its title from the fact that Cousin Marv's turns out to be a money drop for the Chechen Mafia run by one, Chovka Umarov.The pit bull, actually an American Staffordshire Terrier, puppy Bob rescues, gets him acquanited with Nadia Dunn, a presently reformed druggie with a bad ex named Eric Deeds, who keeps popping in an out of her life and was also the previous owner of the dog and who left him bearten in a garbage can where Bob heard his cries and saved him. You see, although Bob leads a boring life, he has scruples ad moral principles and is a protector of abused animals and women. Bob is a contradiction in that he ia a devoted Catholic, yet hasn't taken communion in as many years as he can remember, yet attends mass regularly.  He even names the puppy Rocco, after the patron saint of dogs, St. Rocco.I felt the writing was fairly crisp but with a lot of gutteral slang and slurs to racial/ethnic/and gender groups alike, so if that sort of thing would offend you, then you might want to skip this short novel.I liked it and thought it was page turner with a surprising twist to the ending. Just be assured that Bob doesn't like people who would ever beat a dog, and really dislikes anone who would harm his dog, especially if that person is his girlfriend's ex..","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IAD76G6Y3R2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062365444#wasThisHelpful","R3IAD76G6Y3R2P","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author tries to explain how aniamals are basically driven mad by the actions of humans, and that if we learned to compassionately coesixt with other species we would all be better off.Early in the book the author does a nice job of showing how Alzheimers in humans and dementia in dogs are closely correlated, with the primary difference being that due to the shorter life span of dogs they don't have time for plaque to build up in their brains but instead suffer dementia from atherosclerosis [hardening and narrowing of cranial arteries].She also points out how anxiety occurs among the lower ranking animals of a pack or group with their brains being constantly bathed in stress hormones as opposed to the higher ranking members who suffer from much less stress which can correlate nicely to the differences in human society between the very well off and the middle and lower ranking members of society trying to make do.Something that I never realized before is the primate mothers who were raised in isolation as babies, say in old time zoos and circuses do not know how to nurse and will often push their young away.  They are now provided with lactation consultants by watching other primates nurse theier young and sometimes even human surogates, this use of human females as surrogates more frequently done in poorer countries.We are also told that as late as the later 19th century, it was thought that animals contracted rabies as punishment for some evil act they had done, and throughout the 19th and well into the twentieth century homesickness was considered a physical illness with the terms nostalgia and homesickness being used interchangeably. [p71]Trichotillomania [pulling out your own hair] an anxiety reaction and now considered as a form of OCD in the latest DSM-V affects about 1.5% of males and 3.5% of females in the USA. It is also present in six other primates besides humans as well as among mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, sheep, musk oxen, dogs, and cats. [p144]The author documents some animal suicide behavior with the most famous member being a dolphin named KATHY  [the mani one of six] that played the part of FLIPPER on the 1960s TV show of that name. She literally died in the arms of her trainer, Ric O'Barry on 4/12/1970. [p166] I loved that show, and who didn't love FLIPPER?We are told that 14-17% of all the dogs in the USA suffer from some degree of separation anxiety..

"A poetically told story of how a young black wolf first befriended a few humans, then a larger group, and finally much of the town of Juneau, Alaska. He was seen by some as the natural personification of the wild self-sustaining indivdualism, while hated by others who only thought of him as a natural predator. This is the story of how a wild creature changed the preconceived notions about how a wolf should act. Ultimately it is the story of life and death of one creature, a wolf named ROMEO.The author first spotted Romeo on a frozen lakebed outside of Juneau in December of 2003. He wa still quite young and not fully mature, with the author guessing his age at 2 years or less. He was wary, but never threatening to humans or their four legged companions. In fact, he took a special liking to all the female dogs,without ever mating with any, at least not in anyone's presence, which is how he got his name. He would often steal the toys that human would throw to their own dogs seemingly acting like just another dog.As the author tells us there are less than .02 wolves per each of Alaska's 500,000 square miles, so that many Alaskans have never really heard a wolf howl in the wild and fewer still have actually seen one, regardless of what the movies imply..Although I would like to quote a few lines, I would also caution the reader that I am reviewing from a  pre-release version of the book and the pages cited may be changed in the official editions thereafter.""[I]n the entire recorded history of Alaska, there has been just one confirmed fatal attack by nonrabid wolves on humans...On March 8, 2010, a young, first-year teacher from Pennsylvannia, Candice Berner, was killed two miles from the remote Alaskan Peninsula village of Chignik Lake."" [p79]The author further tells us that ""According to biologists, a ripe old age for a wild wolf is between seven and ten years, though most don't live that long...Even within the boundaries of Denali National Park, where all human hunting and trapping is banned, one study found the average life of a wolf spans just three years."" [pp92-93]Romeo had a habit of disappearing for long periods of time especailly from late spring to early fall often leaving people to think he died.  But Romeo seemed to have had a particular affinity for another photographer, Harry Robison, and his female black Lab mix, Brittain. ""Harry reported that he, Brittain and the wolf found each other and all was as it had ever been. Romeo had once again risen from the dead."" [p144] However, on or about 9/23/2009 Romeo seemed to disappeared for good, at least no human could locate him. So what happened, did he run off with a small pack of wolves who had recently invaded Romeo's territory, had he finally set up housekeeping with a friendly female wolf and started a family of his own, or had some onerous act befallen him? As the author spends the last few chapters explaining this part I won't spoil it for you.I would like to sum up this review in the author's own words. ""His survival was not due to the actions of a few, but the tolerance of many, and the restraint of state and federal agencies - not to mention the actions of the wolf himself.. he might still be there, waiting by the Big Rock for his adopted pack mates to appear."" [p228] At least we can all hope!Captivating and a real tear-jerker for all canid enthusiasts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24CRB660ZVSZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547858191#wasThisHelpful","R24CRB660ZVSZL","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ida Minerva Tarbell was born on her maternal grandparents farm in Hatch Hollow, PA on 11/5/1857 and died of pneumonia in Bridgeport, CN on 1/6/1944. Both of her parents were literate, having each been schoolteachesr for parts of their respective lives. So the idea of educated women was not as novel in the Tarbell household as it was in most other families of the era.  Ida grew up near Titusville, PA where the first oil well was discovered in 1859 and her father was later in the oil business as an independent producer, meaniong he didn't belong to any compaies owned by John Davison Rockeller whose Standard and Excellsior OIl Works was founded in Cleveland, Ohio in 1860..  This later morphed into the Standard Oil Trust [1882] and today is known as EXXON.  By 1877, Rockefeler controlled 90% of all the oil production in AmericaIda attended Allegheny College in Meadville, PA from 1876 to 1880 and accepted the job as the prioress or headmistress at the Poland Union Semenary in Poland, OHio as her first job after graduation.  After two years, she left and began her writing career in earnest, first doing free lance work in Paris and later being hired as a staff writer and finally senior edition for McClure's Magazine when it was an investigatgive journal and not the romance magazine of the mid 20th century.  She found time early in her career to write a well received biography of Abraham Lincoln, before embarking on her true passion, which was exposing what she considered to be the illegal and immorl business practices of Rockelfeller and his business partner, Henry Flagler which was entitled THE HISTORY OF STANDARD OIL.Although she and Teddy Roosevelt were somewhat friends they disagreed sharply on what Ida wrote, as Roosevelt thought she should accentuate the positives of life at the time rather than raking up the muck and thereby causing a big stink as the man did in John Bunyan's classic novel, PILGRIMS PROGRESS did, according to Roosevelt..  Ida openly challenged Roosevelt that he had misinterpreted the novel, which certainly did not further any amicability towards one another.Ida also was not a friend of the suffragette and feminsit movements of her time or today, as she felt women would be more easily corrupted by being allowed to vote and that although she was a working woman herself, she felt  the place of most women was in the home taking care of their families.The sentence structure throughout seems age approprite with a most liberal sprinkling of black and white photos to illustrate many of the points and show Ida from her time as a young gril until just before her death. A well written book with a quite liberal bent to it.  Definitely worth the read for the young adult group for which it is intended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XUBCWNBC79OB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547290926#wasThisHelpful","R1XUBCWNBC79OB","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a suspenseful tale of several gristly murders neatly woven together in the main and subplots. Some may have figured out the twisted and convoluted paths the story takes as it  jumps between subplots, but I, for one did not, until the author explained it in complete detail in the final few pages.The story begins with a stray bloodied Sheltie being found in the woods in the company of a bearded vagrant, called the Walking Man by our hero detective Jack Caffery. It seems the Walking man found a partially torn note around the dogs collar asking for help and explaining it wasn't a joke or ruse. About the same time a middle aged couple Oliver Anchers-Ferrer, his wife Matilda, and daughter Lucia are being held captive in their own home by two seemingly deranged men, but for what apparent motive, plus and their cleaning lady has suddenly gone missing also.  Somehow, these events tie into a horrific, savage and gristly murder of two young lovers some 14 years earlier. The male turned out to be Lucia's ex-boyfriend, Hugo Frink, and the girl his new girlfriend, Sophie Kitson. A supposed serial killer named Minnet Kable originally confessed to this along with other murders, but the evidence tying him to the crime was slim at best; yet the author manages to bring the whole story together in a most fanciful way.The story used great prose throughout as this line from page 347 of the pre-release edition, ""Her eyes fall on the scissors- they drift from her line of sight and she feels their loss the way she'd feel a parting lover."" How cool is that?Indulge yourself and get caught up in this story, you'll be glad you did.  It is a real page turner.

"Thw story concerns Maxine [Max] Revere an attractive 31yo investigative journalist, who has come to the San Francisco Bay area for the funeral of a childhood friend, Kevin O'Neil, who committed suicide, after being accused of murdering his ex-lover and Max's best friend some 13 years earlier. She is met by an elderly couple as the Frisco airport who have watched her TV show and who then ask her to help solve the murder of their grandson. She verifies their facts and decides to do just that. Somehow this murder occurred on the campus of the prep school Max attended and where her best girlfriend, Lindy Ames, was killed some 13 years earlier.  While investigating the murder of her friend, Lindy, and the young man, Jason Hoffman, she discovers the bones of another body on the construction site of her old Alma Mater, which is having a new school gym built. It seems these three murders and the suicide are linked together and she is the only who seems to be able to find the link.  All the while the bad guys and gals are trying to first scare her off and then ultimately to permanently silence her for good.The story is filled with intrigue of numerous sordid affairs, drug dealing, large multimillion dollar construction contracts and Max's single minded resolve to bring a final resolution to this matter.Max is a thoroughly modern woman who uses sex the way some men do, but while being raised by an extremely wealthy family, she is a successful TV personality so isn't ependent on any man. Yet she never knew who her father was and was abandoned by her mother at age nine left to be raised by her grandparents, so she can still see life from another angle besides that of the privileged few.A great and fast paced story line that should appeal to both the male and female audience equally.

"As with most other reviewers, I have used Scott products for years for both my plants and turf needs. This products with a NPK formulation of 12% Nitrogen, 4% Phosphorus, and 8% Potassium in the form of soluble potash with a nice addition of micro-nutrients, makes it ideal for use on indoor as well as outdoor plants. A lot of people forget to fertilize their indoor plants, yet they have no other way of getting new nutrients to grow by with years of repeated waterings.  Just be sure to water after applying , especially on the indoor plants.  O used it on all our indoor plants six days ago and noticed fresh green appearing on both a 6 foot tall rubber plant and a Christmas cactus, which really surprised me. The other plants were of more common varieties and also had the beginnings of greening up.Because of the high 12% nitrogen, this is best used in Spring and early Summer or else you will cause the grass or plants to green up to close to cold weather after which a frost might come and kill them since the greening causes water to flow into the leaves and they will freeze and break off or become diseased, as opposed to brown leaves which have no or extremely little water so can fall off without hurting the plant. Of course, the last statement doesn't apply for indoor plants in climatically controlled conditions. Fall fertilization should have no or very low nitrogen [N] percentages and much higher on the phosphorus [P] and potassium [K] in the NPK label you see on the front of each fertilizer package, as these promote root health when leaf growth is not necessary. The micronutrients  are also needed to balance some other plant needs and to help it fight diseases. On cheaper brands of fertilizer these so called micro-nutrients are missing and the plants suffer because of it.A good and well balanced product for the price with an easy to use applicator included and specific directions for potted plant container sizes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CQT6ZUR4X8UA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071E238A#wasThisHelpful","R2CQT6ZUR4X8UA","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is simply the generic version of the popular heartburn/GERD treatment drug called Prevacid, just like omeprazole is the generic of Prilosec.The active ingredients in each is exactly the same as the name brand product, the other ingredients and the percentages of each such as coloring material and filler are what changes, as does the price, which in this case is very reasonable.  Both Lansoprazole and Omeprazole fall into a class of drugs called proton pump inhibitors or PPIs, which have different mode of action from older style drugs called histamine or H2 antagonists [meaning they work against allowing histamine to form in your stomach] such a Pepcid, generically know as famotidine, or Zantac, generically known as ranitidine. You should be aware that you must take the PPI drugs for several days before they work, as opposed to H2 antagonistic drugs which will work in minutes.  Both classes have advantages and drawbacks, so the perspective user should ask his/her doctor or at least check the literature to see if you might be taking another drug that could interfere with your new drug or vice versa.  But I like generics and have used all four drugs mentioned over a period of years and feel they all have their place. Since, IMHO, the drugs in a class are generally interchangeable one should look at the price and the price of this generic is quite reasonable and I would recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EIGQQ63NC64Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008Y656V0#wasThisHelpful","R2EIGQQ63NC64Y","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fictionalized account of a real person named Albert Dadas, who lived in 19th century France.  He was about 20yo at the time the story takes place.  Albert was hospitalized in a mental hospital named St. Andre in Bordeaux, France, in real life.  The story takes place before much of what we know of mental illness in these times had yet to be  uncovered, and believe me there is still much more to learn. Albert suffered from a Dissociative Disorder called Fugue. The author does a great job of explaining this disorder and all the other ones of the fictional characters who interact with Albert and the doctor treating him in the story. The basic manifestations of a Fugue state are that you wander about, sometimes for a few hours sometimes for months or intermittently for years as was the case with Albert. The problems is that the person seldom remembers much or anything that happened while they were in this fugue state. It should be stated that the person seems generally normal if not a bit strange to most people.  Albert did engage in some rather strange behavior, but his biggest worry was that no one think him a vagrant as he saw that to be the lowest of the low. Let me give one brief quote from page 22 of the pre-release edition ""He walks for days without stopping, without eating, without sleeping in order to feel the gift of astonishment."" The problem is that the person experiencing this disorder, normally set off by some tragic occurrence as was Albert's case, is running away from something and never towards anything so that he can therefore never arrive.The story revolves around the interplay between his psychiatrist and himself with the intermingling of other psychiatric patients stories woven into the main plot line.If you are interested in a fictionalized story of a rare mental disorder [fugue occurs in about 20/10,000 people in a general population] this will be up your alley, if you are looking for a fast paced thriller you may be left somewhat wanting. This is a nice book to read at your leisure over several days. I would also like to mention that the fugue state is occasionally found in severe alcoholism and somewhat in some forms of epilepsy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32EQA6I42X2BW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620403110#wasThisHelpful","R32EQA6I42X2BW","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An intelligent collection of short stories in which the central theme is the possibility of exorcising personal demons from the past.The following is a brief synopsis of the eight short stories in the order presented:1. The Old Priest - This old Jesuit priest is a rapt raconteur, a bit of a provocateur, and outwardly gay. He is particularly fond of booze, hallucinogenic mushrooms, and his ever faithful Camel cigarettes, which he always smokes in a silver tipped holder.  The entire story reverberates with recollections of past memories and as the quote on page 36 from Flannery O'Connor goes, ""All is sacred, nothing profane.""2. Snow Behind the Door - the second story in this series concerns the remembrances of an aging Irish grandmother named Rose, who moved to the NJ Shore-from Philly. A poignant line from this story says it all, ""At my age, all you can do is think of the past."" [p49]3. The City of Gold - the story center on weak and hustler Charlie and his 19yo girlfriend Amber and there relationship with a black/Indian blackjack dealer named Maurice Baltimore. Quite a surprising ending to this story.4. Jack Frost - this is another story set in Jersey and concerns Bobby a blackjack dealer and an interesting player an old Polish Jew, who was concentration camp survivor and to escape his demons renames himself Jack Frost upon coming to America in the 1960s.5. Upstairs Room - another story taking place in Atlantic City in which our protagonist Joe reminisces how he chucked his real life away to be with his current squeeze named Irene Smith.  Joe says of Irene ""[Y]ou've seen women like that, attractive but a little passed it...like they're trying to outrun whatever life has in store for them, and they know they can't, but that doesn't stop them running all the same, and it doesn't stop them from enjoying it either."" [p106]6. Have You Seen This Girl? - in this story, the story concerns Christine, married to Howard, whose sister Darcy, a most attractive tramp comes to live with them and totally turns there lives upside down. In describing Darcy, Christine a cocktail waitress says, ""She is a quick one, little Darcy is...No moss. Strictly teflon: a non-stick surface. Text without content."" [p113]7. The Unexamined Life - Miles Dell, a 44yo, craps dealer in Atlantic city is bored with wife of 20 years Claire, his son Jack and his girlfriend Alison Six and at midlife takes up with an outcast prostitute named Patsy Kogod and her young daughter Stevie, thinking he can save them and himself at the same time - but can he do both or either?8. The Burnie Can - is what I thought the strangest of all the stories and the title refers to an old rested metal barrel used to burn trash in.  Our protagonist recalls the memories of his childhood when one day his mother and grandmother, while working in the backyard coming running in and telling the whole family that they captured and real live dinosaur of small stature under the clothes basket as he tried to escape from under the burnie can. As the story is recounted over the years with family memories added to each subsequent telling the story takes on a life of it own.The book is filled with great descriptive prose and well framed stories that are believable and we have probably all known people who if names were changed could fit many of the characterizations portrayed.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E7OY53E2BFLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0822944294#wasThisHelpful","R2E7OY53E2BFLM","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The authors begin with the premise that dogs, although descended from wolves do not act strictly like wolves especially, when considering a few years ago, the vast majority of what we knew about wolves was from captured animals and was far different from how wolf families lived in the wild.Let may say that if you are a fan of the Cesar Milan school of dog training, you are going to have some trouble accepting the ideas the authors put forth in this book.  They simply do not believe in the ALPHA Dog theory.  For those novice trainers or those who maybe got their first dog recently the acceptance of what the author say isn't hard to accept, for intermediate trainers or advanced trainers, they may have some doubts about the theories postulated. Often the various authors quote various studies, but do not go into the hard data to back up their claims or for even the serious student in this field to see the protocols of the research.  Let me say this is an edited book, so that each chapter is written by a different veterinarian[s].  They are all vets and are trying to promote essentially what is the field of animal behavioral psychology to which only vets may belong, so it is no wonder that the book is sanctioned by the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists.  I am not saying I disagree with the various chapter authors only that the people doing the chapter reviews are the equivalent of union members reviewing the propriety of actions by other union members.  I do agree with the VAST majority of what the individual authors espouse.The book starts off a little slow but fairly rapidly finds its stride and makes for interesting reading.  The way the chapters are presented allows one to stop at the end of a chapter and then begin again a different day without missing anything, as each chapter covers a particular area as chosen by that author, who is as I said earlier also a veterinarian.One of my favorite chapters was Chapter 7 in which the authors go over:1. Dogs don't jump up on you t establish dominance, but to show interest, recognition, and affection2. The authors advise not to do what the dog wants without FIRST making them do something or some behavior you want to establish or fortify first3. Don't vary the length of the leash while walking your dog by extending your arm, simply walk at a brisk pace but don't let the dog pull you. If he/she starts doing that stop and begin again.  This probably varies some from what many dog training classes I have participated would direct, which is to make the dog walk around your right side, come to a sit and when it is paying attention to you begin you walk with a heel off the left foot.4. Dogs were meant to hunt or find their food in the while, so putting some food in a Kong toy or some other brand, slows down their eating and actually gives them something to do to get their food in a more natural semblance of feeding in the wild.All in all a quite nice book with unified themes by all the authors in general. It should probably be considered a welcome addition to the training library for most people. And it was written in easy to understand language.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21WXKEKXF30X9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547738919#wasThisHelpful","R21WXKEKXF30X9","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our story begins on 8/2/1930 in Belgrade Lakes, ME, at the summer cottage of Judge Joseph F. Crater, recently appointed to the NY Supreme Court and his wife of 13 years Stella.  She confronts him about his affair with his mistress Sally Lou Ritz, affectionately referred to as Ritzi, and in the process slams the car door on his hand. Soon after on 8/6/1930 the judge disappears from sight supposedly as he entered a taxi outside a fancy club called Club Abbey, owned by the notorious gangster Owney Madden, who bought the judge his appointment through Tammany Hall. What really happened to the judge, his mistress, his wife, and the maid is what the story is all about.I should mention that much of the story is true and was followed for many years by various newspapers.  The fictitious characters and their back stories are explained at the end by the author, so that a brief read of that short section will clue you in on what is fact and what is fiction.  If you don't want to know simply don't read the final chapter until the end.The story was easy to follow as each chapter is given a date and place where the action takes place and is further identified when either of those two things change.Sally Lou Ritz originally named Sarah was born on dairy farm in Wisconsin but moved to NYC at age 19, three years before our story begins, to find fame and fortune, but ended up working as a high priced escort for the infamous gangster Owney Madden, who put her in touch with the judge so he would have an inside person to let him know what the judge's plans were at all times.  He backs some Broadway shows and gets her the starring role in one musical, but she accidentally gets pregnant shortly before the judge disappears and she can tell him he is about to be a father. Obviously Madden isn't thrilled with Ritzi's condition, so she takes a powder.The maid is a very attractive Castillian named Maria de la Luz Tarascon Simon and is married to a detective  named Jude Simon, the lead detective assigned to investigate the disappearance of Judge Crater.  It turns out that she asked Stella to get her husband the promotion to detective through the judges connections. In the meantime she finds out about the judge and Ritzi and torn between her obligation to the judge and her friendship with his wife.  We also find out that she can't have kids and becomes involved with Ritzi and her condition.  She met Madden at her other job as a tailor for Smithson's where Madden has all his clothes made.It seems that a special commission has been set up to investigate the bribing of politicians and wants Stella to testify about what she knows about her husband's affairs, so she disappears,: Ritzi disappears to avoid Madden, and the judge simply disappears.It all sounds convoluted, but the author does a great job to fit the pieces together with many parts I have purposefully left out.It should keep you enthralled for the entire length and if you are even vaguely familiar with the real story it will make for a very  plausible story to what could have happened..","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JJJWSLPC7M91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038553762X#wasThisHelpful","R1JJJWSLPC7M91","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have used this product on horses in the past and at present on my dog to add in supporting the vet wrap over padding to cover a malingering wound from a sarcoma removal on his leg. It comes in handy as with many dogs they simply tear off any dressing as the wound begins to heal and itch, just as it begins to itch with humans. My vet finds it a necessary part of treatment for this type of wound treatment and so do I. Great product and it is the original J&J product not a generic substitute.

"The story concerns a child psychiatrist named Owen Lerner, who is struck by lightning while feeding a parking meter as he takes his family out to dinner at Rehoboth Beach, DE in the summer of 2008. The other characters of significance are his wife Antoinette, aka Toni, his twin sons Will and Ricky, aged 21 and his 16yo daughter Brooke, plus Will's girlfriend Kyra, who may or may not have slept with both Ricky and Owen. I can already see the humor in that from Will's point of view.Since his ""electrifying"" moment, Owen wants to give up his practice and barbeque, maybe turning that hobby into a restaurant of sorts. Other humorous ideas he has are barbequing the cat, Mittsy, who wants to run away and roasting their now deceased dog Sparkle, who wants to please so much he would willingly allow it.  And if that is your idea of good clean fun, wait there is more. [p52]  There are more humorous moments poked at the expense of disabled people, like Owen after he is struck by lightning. Toni says to him, ""'You'll be back to normal in no time.' He has no intention of returning to normal. How you going to keep them down on the farm after they've had a transcendental experience...Normal is for *ussies."" [p55]The book is filled with an overabundance of cutesy modern expressions as, """"He wondered who belled [called]her."" [p113] and ""The woman in the picture had a Monroe, though Abigail told her that the hole closes up pretty fast if you take out the stud."" [p114]Some more mildly humorous lines were, ""Unless she want to have sex or talk about barbeque, she can't keep his attention."" [p145] and ""You know what's weird...I've lost weird. Some people lose weight or their keys. I've lost weird."" [p161]I found some of the analogies mildly humorous but still strange as, ""The news would have made the Fitzgerald crowd uncomfortable, like baby *oop in the neighborhood pool."" [p208]For those not knowing what Lichtenberg figures are, like myself, I would suggest looking that up early as there is considerable mention of that scientific term.I found the reading somewhat tedious with an inexplicable constant use of unfamiliar phraseology as, ""Our perturbation would be soothed should your peregrinations lead hither for the impending gratuitous holiday."" [p235] and ""[H]is sister's scrambled call for help makes it through his own insecurities: the enormity of your analogue's exploits requires kinship, as do I."" [p238] And yes I did read the entire book with the page quotes to prove it. There you have it.

"The author demonstrates how a hole might be found anywhere with actual example of a real hole in the middle of all the pages.Our male figure in this black ink drawing set of panels begins the story by moving into a new apartment. Our main character is a male as the drawings are fairly anatomically drawn and he is neither a human nor a directly recognizable animal, but to me looks somewhat like a mouse.  That is the nice part about this book in that the figures and story can be what you want them to be inspiring creativity for young and old minds alike, as nothing is totally spelled out in this book.After unloading his moving boxes and making himself breakfast, our main character suddenly notices a hole clear through the kitchen wall leading into the laundry room, but when he goes into the laundry room to investigate, the hole isn't where it was but has moved. As he goes back into the kitchen the hole moves again from the wall to the floor.  He is perplexed by these strange events, so calls a science lab to tell him more.  They tell him to bring in the hole so they can examine it.  After a while he succeeds in capturing the hole in one of his used cardboard boxes and takes it to the lab, where they exam it. They tell him to leave it so they can do a more thorough examination of it.  He goes home to wait for the final verdict as to what the hole may mean, how it got there and why it keeps moving around.  But lo and behold when he gets home, what does he find but?????Since the figures are somewhat anamorphic and there is a bare minimum of printed text, your young reader can make the story into whatever he/she wants it to say.  In psychological terms, this would be considered an open-ended exercise.  It is a neat concept for kids to exercise their minds and be creative.  The other thing is that the kids can see a different story with each perusal through the book. This is a fine example of thinking outside the box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R59ZIHO7BVS4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592701434#wasThisHelpful","R59ZIHO7BVS4U","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a significant part of WWII history that is quite important in understanding how society functions, yet has taken a back seat to the battles and the deeds and misdeeds of men of the same period of time.Since the author's reporting is so engrossing I have chosen to primarily quote her as summary points of the entire book.  Although I have given page cites, this is from a pre-publication copy and thus the page numbers may not be the same as in the final publication copy.As the author recounts, ""[T]he list of teachers and other female Nazi Party activists that I had found in 1992 Ukraine was the tip of the iceberg...Hundreds of thousands of German women went to the Nazi East...and were indeed integral parts of Hitler's machinery of destruction. [p3] In further delineating the number and actions of the participants,""There was no divide between the home front and the battlefront.  Women could decide on the spot to join the orgy of violence...they melded into hundreds of thousands - at least a half million - women who went East.' [p6]""The German Red Cross trained six hundred thousand during the Nazi Era, and some four hundred thousand were placed in War time service...The German army trained over five hundred thousand young women in support positions...and two hundred thousand of those served in the East."" [p6] ""The average age of a female concentration camp guard was twenty six; the youngest was a mere fifteen years old when she was posted at Gross-Rosen camp in Nazi-annexed Poland."" [p15] ""[B]y war's end, about one tenth of camp personnel was female...At least thirty five hundred woman were trained as concentration camp guards; mostly at Ravensbruck [the largest training camp for females]."" [p21]""The Party's biggest supporters...were people like Erna [Petri] - lower middle class Protestants and farmers."" [p70]  The women volunteers saw joining the party as upward mobility considering their typical backgrounds. ""Over time it was expected that that any woman who desired a position in the Party's upper management  would complete some training in the eastern territories. In 1943 more than three thousand young women went to Poland to prepare for their careers."" [p34]In explaining how she felt about her time in service the author states one person's account, ""[S]he saw in the streets at the edge of the ghetto two long rows of charred Jewish bodies. Like Schucking and Struwe, she could hardly avoid witnessing the mass murder. She did not condone it, but she could not stop it either."" [p96]Although after the war very few females as a percentage of those who served the fatherland were tried, those who were were generally treated far more leniently than the men. ""F]emale defendants could exploit the latter prejudice to their advantage. Interrogators and investigators judged women based on their emotion response. Court officials noted when women cried during questioning or proceedings."" [p168] The author puts that last statement into perspective, ""[I]n the first decade after the war - twenty six women were sentenced to death for crimes committed in medical facilities and concentration camps."" [p169]The book is filled with individual stories of a select few women or their families who agreed to talk to the author about their war time experiences.  It is understandable why not more were willing to discuss this topic. But as someone much more learned than I once intoned, ""Those not willing to learn from history are doomed to repeat it!""This was simply an intriguing history that dispelled the biggest misconceptions about the female participants of this Nazi regime and those were that their participation in number was small and that they were NEVER willing participants in the cruelty met out.

"As the distance that the units correspond with each other is determined by what is between them it is good to know some practical limitations or distances at which it will work.  The baby's unit and parental unit worked well about 75 feet apart on the same floor and about 50 feet apart on different floors, and there was a large steel support beam separating them that could have caused interference, but didn't seem to in our instance.The main features of the unit are:1. It has 4 sensitivity settings - We only used the the two highest settings, but, hey, we are also grandparents - maybe that explains it :-)  a. Highest - you can hear everything going on in the baby's room  b. High - you can hear the softest sounds but not extraneous background noise  c. Medium - you can hear definite vocalizations, but normally not burbling  d. Low - the baby has to cry or yell for you to hear him/her2. It has a temperature range setting which gives both a visual warning and auditory alert if the temperature were to get outside the range you set.  We found that it went off a few times when set near lamp as the heat from the bulb caused it to get higher than we had it set for, so don't set the unit under a lamp or at least don't have the bulb on. But that function did work as advertised and would be a blessing in case a fire just starting.3. It comes with a built in nightlight.4. It is supplied with 5 different lullabies to which you can adjust the loudness.5. You can talk to the baby to reassure it or simply to communicate with it by pressing a button on the parental unit, like an old fashioned walkie-talkie!6. It is comes with a rechargeable battery pack for the parental unit which can also be plugged in, in which case the batteries aren't needed.  Be aware that it does take a full ten hours to charge the battery pack the first time or if it gets totally run down. You could keep it plugged in and then only need to use the battery pack when moving about in which case the batteries would hardly get run down at all.  The base or baby unit also runs off electricity but takes 4-AA batteries, which can be the standard type or rechargeable if you prefer those.  They are not included with the unit. The parental unit does come with a removable wrist strap.6. A really neat item besides the temp sensor was the automatic count down feeding timer.  You can set it for a one time use and change the time periods each time or it will repeat on a set schedule.  It gives both a visual and auditory alert telling you it is time to feed the baby.7.

"The author constructs eight moderate length short stories concerning the lives of typical blue collar workers who simply do the same job day after day with little real expectation of hope for a brighter future although they may mouth such things to others for appearance sake. These are basically stories of people who either never had much of chance or through a series of their own bad choices ruined whatever chances they had. There is no light at the end of the tunnel for the main character, who acts as a narrator of each tale.  Most of the stores have the undercurrent of some unnamed war running through them without the exact war ever being named.The stories give a different if depressive viewpoint than most stories you read and because of their nihilism they really lack the resolution most people desire in reading fiction, even when it closely approximates real life events. I would like to offer a brief synopsis of the eight stories:1. Cartography - Rex gets fired from his job as a cartographer for an internet design studio when he rejects the unwanted sexual advances of his male boss. Yet some time after being unemployed he accidentally runs into his old boss and ....2. Paranoia - A white guy named Dean is walking through a rough black neighborhood, when three tough looking blacks call to him. What can this mean and should he run and run to where in this neighborhood.3. Appetite - A short order cook named Ike tires to get a raise from his boss to take out a waitress and impress her more, but is shot down when the boss complains about several meals being sent back. Ike feels that this isn't the night to ask for a raise, but when WOULD BE a good time in his situation?4. Associate - Nick McDonough is an assistant manager at a Wal-Mart store but has sticky fingers to make ends meet. He is also trying to impress the daughter of the guy buying his illegally gotten goods.5. Brief Encounter With the Enemy - the only actual war story. Luke is on the final day of a one year tour of duty in which he has escaped actually encountering an enemy combatant. He has hours to go before being shipped home when he spots something or someone.  ""A tall, bald, fat man, maybe fifty, maybe younger: The enemy...He was walking with something, a sheep or a goat."" [p119] Luke takes aim through his rifle sight and what then?6. Enchantment - Jake Mattingly returns from his deployment with the military to his old job as a sixth grade teacher and also to continue his affair with a wealthy married woman.  His life has had ups and downs, but mostly downs.  His boss asks him to house sit his rather large and expensive house while he goes on an extended vacation for several months. Jake loves the idea of entertaining his paramour in these surrounding rather than his 15'x15' efficiency in the slums, but Jake makes one crucial error in judgment.7. Operators - Zeke starts out after high school as a mailboy for a large concern.  After three years he works his way up to online sales and recommends a high school buddy for his old job.  His friend Wally joins the military after three months, then comes back a hero after a year of deployment.  Wally was nothing when he left, and Jake is somewhat jealous at the reversal of how people see each of them now.  So what does he do?8. Victory - Max, a janitor at a large grocery store is attracted to a 22yo moderately attractive shoplifter, Amanda, and against better judgment frees her from the store detective before she can be arrested.  He falls for her but has a partially crippled left arm that embarrasses him, preventing him from engaging in any prior romantic interludes. His real ambitions in life are to consummate a sexual liaison with Amanda and move up in the store restaurant to the coffee bar.The stories were enjoyable but still depressing, dyspeptic and somewhat dystopian although still entertaining.

"The story concerns a 75yo widow named Ruth Field and her caretaker Frida Young.It seemed that one day Frida simply showed up on Ruth's doorstep claiming she had been sent as part of an Australian government program providing limited assistance to people handicapped in some way and needing assistance with daily living chores.We recognize early on in the story that all is not right with Ruth when she claims there is a tiger that invades her house on some nights, but that he has never threatened her YET.  She knows it is a BOY tiger because of his smell and the type of noises he makes.  This would appear to be the ramblings of a senior with dementia except the Frida shortly after speaking with Ruth claims to have heard, then seen, and finally fought with the mysterious tiger herself. She even produces three supposed claw marks on her forearm from the fight with the tiger, who she managed to chase off that night before he could harm Ruth.When Frida first arrives [p5 of the advanced copy] she tells Ruth, ""I'm not a guest. I come for an hour every morning same time every day...I'm not a stranger, and I am not a friend.  I am your right arm. I'm the help you're giving yourself."" But very quickly her duties expand to 3 hours/day and then to seven days a week as a live-in health care provider. The strange part is that she takes on all the extra duties for a mere pittance of an additional salary beyond what the government pays her. Ruth feels somewhat embarrassed by the salary she pays, but can't afford to look a gift horse in the mouth. But maybe she should because when something seems too good to be true, it generally is. As Frida offers to do more and more, Ruth becomes ever more dependent.  In fact Ruth has a weekend liaison with old lover, Richard Porter a doctor now aged 80, she has not seen for 50 years. Frida seems very protective of Ruth with Richard and even with Ruth's own sons, Jeffrey and Phillip, yet by now Frida has taken to calling her ""Ruthie"" and treats her in a childlike manner.  Since we won't find out the true motivation for Frida's actions until the final quarter of the book, I won't spoil it.  But I can say that the final denouement is worth the wait.A well written story with very good character development that slyly turns itself into a page turner keeping the reader in suspense as to each character's motivations and psyches.

"I had the opportunity to try it out at the range today and liked it a lot.  As typical this time of year down south, the sky changed from bright sunlight to deeply overcast in minutes and then back again a short time later, but we avoided rain.  The point being that I liked the optical characteristics in all light conditions experienced today.  The sun was not in my eyes at any time, thankfully. I felt the optics were bright and the contrast sharp at all optical levels. I did notice some aberration at the highest zoom levels and also had to remove my glasses to get the whole field at that level, but not at the lower levels; for those not wearing glasses this will never come into playI felt that both the coarse and fine adjustment knobs worked smoothly throughout their range with very little resistance and were as good as with scopes costing three times as much. The fog resistant and water resistant lens were definitely a plus as was the lens shade to help eliminate glare from the sun.  It was also easy to mount it to my camera tripod, which is an intermediately priced Ambico. Due to the weight distribution design of the scope, the tripod never gave the feeling that it might tip over.  It also has an easy lock adjustment to allow you to turn the scope for viewing from either side once mounted so that you don't have to look straight down.  I tried it at 15meters, 50 yards and 100 yards plus about 200 ft in my back yard later. I liked it all those distances and feel it would do well at much further ranges. In fact at the 200 feet in my backyard, I soon discovered what I think was a vole scampering through the bushes, as the dogs were inside at the time.As other reviewers have mentioned, I think the case could use a little more padding, but plan to keep it in the box it came in except for taking it from the car to the range stands/benches, but that takes nothing away from the scope.  I also liked the major optic end cap and found it very easy to get on and off as was the eyepiece. The other caps were simply the slip on rubber types, but fit well.It also has separately purchased adapter rings to mount either 52mm or 58mm objects as a camera to it. Basically everything worked as it should, the lifetime warranty is great with a no questions, hassles or fault claims meaning no proof or date of purchase is necessary if it ever gets damaged or quits working, simply a 10.00 fee to cover return shipping. When is the last time you saw such a warranty. The company is located in Whitmore Lake, Michigan, although the scope is manufactured in China.  Great scope for the money - what else can be said.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R197H1RDBPUA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJFAYJ2#wasThisHelpful","R197H1RDBPUA1","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""'Today girls,' said Miss Renshaw, we shall go out into the beautiful garden and think about DEATH.'"" [P3] From the opening we know that sinister things will happen.The vast majority of the story takes place at a private school for girls in Sydney, Australia during 1967 while the Vietnam War was going on.  Our story concerns the teacher, Miss Renshaw, and the eleven girls in her elementary class named Cubby, Icara, Martine, Bethany, Georgina, Cynthia, Dierdre, Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth, and Elizabeth.  The four Elizabeths are given no last names, and only differentiated by physical characteristics as height and hair style.It seems that Ms. Renshaw has more than a passing interest in Morgan, the groundskeeper at the Ena Thompson Memorial Gardens where she regularly takes the girls on nature trips. She makes the girls complicit in her romantic diversions by telling them, ""We won't mention these meetings with Morgan or other stuff will we girls...We won't mention Morgan."" [p19] But the girls were a lot smarter than Miss Renshaw gave them credit for, as ""They all knew...the real reason Miss Renshaw want to go out into the gardens that morning. It was not to think about death. Miss Renshaw wanted to see Morgan.""Soon after Miss Renshaw takes her class, with Morgan leading them, to some nearby Aboriginal caves supposedly to see the cave drawings at which time she and Morgan vanish. Yet as the girls pledged not to reveal anything about Morgan, they can't fully tell what happens to the authorities.  The rest of the book is about just what happened and how it affects each of their lives.The book is a close copy of an earlier book along very similar lines which was originally released by another Australian author Joan W. Lindsay in 1967 and was called PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK Picnic at Hanging Rock after which a 1975 movie also titled Picnic at Hanging Rock (The Criterion Collection) by Peter Weir was made.  The only major plot difference between those two items and the current story is that in the PICNIC version the story takes place on Valentines Day of 1900 and two girls plus a teacher go missing. That book and the movie are also highly recommended.Later in this story the girls get into a lively discussion about whether ghosts really exist, and if they do, can they live outdoors or must they be confined to interiors.  The relevance of this doesn't become important until near the end of the book, so I won't spoil it for you, but do pay attention to who says what about it. Here it differs from the PICNIC book version.The current story is very well told with a somewhat feminine and romantic writing style that imparts enough mystery to attract adults interested in some good clean scary storytelling. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3843T2IYFZMNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763663999#wasThisHelpful","R3843T2IYFZMNO","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderfully told humorous road trip story about a couple, the author David Rosenfelt and his wife Debbie, plus 11 true friends who helped them moved their 25 rescued dogs of various lineages from Orange County, CA to near Damariscotta Lake, Maine using three rented RVs in 2011.As the author says early in the story on page 4, ""[T]he difference between an ordeal and an adventure is attitude. That's how I knew I was in for an ordeal.""In self-deprecating and humble style the author states that 25 is probably the smallest number of dogs they had at any one time in the ten years prior to their cross country adventure, with 42 being the maximum number and 31/32 being about the average.  He also gives full credit to the other males in his party as being real men, while he generally portrays himself as a bit of a nebbish in the vein of Woody Allen.The author and Debbie started a non-profit dog rescue called the TARA Foundation in honor of Debbie's best dog of all time, a golden she still longs for.  David and Debbie keep Tara alive by writing her into his Andy Carpenter  series in which Tara started off as a 7yo Golden and elven years later has only aged to 9yo.  The author says she will never get serous sick or hurt in his novels, nor will she ever die, but she may miraculously get younger if it suits him. :)An idea of the clean type of humor told throughout the book is the experience the author had in trying to book some rooms outside Salt Lake City prior to the move back East. When the motel clerk told him there would be a 50.00/pet cleaning deposit for each dog under 30 pounds and 75.00 for each dog over 30 pounds he said, ""I hadn't done the math, but I was pretty sure we would be traveling with over a ton of dog, so the cleaning deposit would probably be the GDP of a third world country."" [p64]I personally liked the chapter in which Charleston Heston adopts Willie, a chow mix from the author, as I also rescued a chow/golden mix as a puppy, I named Leo, and who is now 12+yo. As with all animal lovers, a picture of Leo is visible on my profile page.This is simply a heartwarming story of love and caring for animals told with insight and humor sure to warm the hearts of all dog/animal lovers and well worth the read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NMCNYJMZLSPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250014697#wasThisHelpful","R3NMCNYJMZLSPG","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a story of multiple seductions, but in many of the cases you begin to wonder who seduced whom.The basic story involves Calvin and Kristien Stevens, a couple in their fifties who are forced to leave California when Kristin's job is lost due to budget cuts in 2010, and she is offered a new administrative position at North Shore State College north of Boston. Cal, who is small time builder figures he can build and repair homes in MA as well as CA, so readily agrees to the move.The book is simply full of great lines as when Kristen apprises her current situation, ""Clearly she'd cut her own losses settling for less than she sought in every respect, becoming an administrator rather than the professor and literary critic she set out to be, and leaving a top-tiered university for a third rate state college because she had no other choices.  She'd lost the man she loved and married another one for something less than love."" [p107] A great summation of the basic plot line by this character.A little later a humorous reference to HARD TAFFY, which turns an otherwise bland character into something much more. I won't spoil that reference with further comment.Another great line is attributed to Matt Drinnan, the somewhat younger lover of Kristin, who conjectures, ""The stolen car [his] didn't worry him nearly as much as the message from Kristen.  The automobile was insured, The relationship wasn't."" [p201]As the story winds down and Kristin contemplates the choices she has made in life, she conjectures, "" She knew that when she returned home and went into the bathroom to wash off her makeup, she'd see the face of a woman for which life has no more surprises."" [226]As this review is from a pre-publication version of the novel, the page number cites may or may not be different in the official publication version.In reading this novel it was easy to suspend disbelief as all the characters and their various personalities were very well developed and could have been your next door neighbors or even family members.

"The story takes place in the area around Sussex, England with two central characters. The first is our narrator, a boy of seven who is never named and the second is his companion and protector named Lettie Hempstock, who says she is eleven and has been that age for some time.Our narrator in remembering his boyhood home says, ""I stared at the house, remembering less than I expected about my teenage years: no good times, no bad times. I lived in that for a while as as teenager. It didn't seem to be any part of who I am now."" [p4] ""I was not happy as a child, although from time to time I was content.  I lived in books more than I lived anywhere else."" [p13]The story begins with someone apparently trying to give money away with disastrous results. The narrator remembers he awoke choking one night and somehow found a silver shilling had gotten stuck in his throat, but can't figure out how that could happen.We get the idea that the Hempstocks, [Lettie, her mother Ginnie, and her grandmother] really are an OLD English family when our narrator asks Lettie's grandmother, who is referred to as Old Mrs. Hempstock, how old she is and she replies, ""Old enough...I remember when the moon was made."" [p33]But then the story takes a different direction when narrator's mother has to get a job due to financial necessity and therefore hires a housekeeper/nanny, named Ursula Monkton to look after him and his 5yo sister. But it turns out Ursula is more than what she appears to be. The narrator's sister gets along fine with Ursula, but Ursula seems to wish harm upon the young boy for reasons he can't figure out.Somewhat well into the book we get further guidance as to just how unique the Hempstock family is when our narrator sees the grandmother sleeping a long while and asks Lettie if they shouldn't awaken her, to which Lettie replies, ""It doesn't wok like that...When she gets tired she sleeps till she wakes up on her own. A few minutes or a hundred years. There's no waking her."" [p150]With a unique ending which explains the whole situation this is great adult fairytale reminiscent of Stephen King.  With an absence of four-lettered words this makes a great read for everyone old enough to understand the nuances.

"This was an inspirational work of fiction that somehow rang true and was believable.The hobo, Barfield, our human protagonist of the story loses his farm, his wife, his son, his farm, and finally after many bad turns in life his will to struggle on. He is saved by Hobo the dog, whom he affectionately calls either dog or Mr. Dog. He prayed to God to send him a sign and he sent him Hobo the dog.The anthropomorphisis of Hobo the dog was cute and endearing, especially as the dog thinks of how to overcome each obstacle of his life which has a corollary in human existence. Most people can relate to the trials and tribulations of both Hobo the dog and Hobo the human and probably to the decisions that each have made with the knowledge they had at the time.Devoid of any four-lettered words, one can surely enjoy the book and its inspirational message as well as being a tear-jerker at times.  I personally loved the part where Hobo the dog pledges to return to the young female vet who saved his life regardless of what and how long it takes.One of my favorite lines is where the trucker, Big Al, in describing another dog he rescued says, """"[His] mother must have been a dance hall girl and the father a 'travelin' man.""

"This was a rather twisted psychological tale of the intertwining of two opposite personality types. The two were Tess, a 38yo dark haired beauty with severe Bipolar disorder as we learn fairly early in the story; while her doppelganger, at least on the internet was Leila, a blonde 24yo rather dowdy loner, whose main interest seemed to be spending all her time on an internet forum site called RedPill.com.uk that was a place to discuss all things philosophical. One other character of importance in all this is Adrian Dervish, who is the originator and moderator on Red Pill.One of the topics discussed on the site was ""Do we as individuals have the right to commit suicide."" Leila thinks - YES!  She expresses this opinion on the site and Adrian arranges to meet her in person and then asks her to help him help another person on the site, Tess, to disappear from sight so she can commit suicide but not hurt her parents with that fact. I am not certain that disappearing from sight with no one knowing what happened to you is better than knowing you committed suicide. I say NO, but that is a personal opinion and goes along with the debate about euthanasia. So Leila takes months to learn all about Tess's past with help from Tess and Adrian. If that makes sense to you, then I fear you might also believe Reality TV represents reality for most people. Let us not forget to mention that Connor Devine, a 30-something lawyer, who had a torrid affair with Tess some years ago, at least in his mind, now has another affair online  with Leila posing as Tess. It's the internet, so they never have to meet in person, therefore, he doesn't recognize the difference between the tall thin brunette and the shorter blonde. We learn fairly early that Tess really likes sex, and she saw Connor as more of a multi-date hookup that went on way too long rather than the love of her life. In reversing the lyrics to an old C & W song, he got more out of it than she put into it!As Tess suffers from Type I Bi-Polar, she loves being manic and hates being depressed - which is the way it normally is, and why so many people with this disorder go off their meds. Leila is an extremely immature and lonely dependent personality type; Adrian appears to suffer from Antisocial Personality Disorder, and many of the other characters seem to be hippies living in a bygone era of thirty years ago. Plus the descriptive paragraphs in this book add about fifty unnecessary pages.You really have to suspend ALL disbelief to get into this story. It was not a page turner, chilling or intense as the back cover exclaims; what it was was an overly long psychological study of the extreme differences between Tess and Leila. So why did I give it two stars; I simply thought the plot line was original. The author has potential if she can lessen the descriptive narrative. One other character of some importance was named Ava Root. Don't you just love the originality of all those names? Sort of like a WASP Directory, just not in alphabetical order!","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROP9VSI360REE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537476#wasThisHelpful","ROP9VSI360REE","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a rather fast-paced horror thriller with Zombies seeming to have wiped out the earth's humans except for some meth-heads living around St. Paul, MN. How and why this came about is the main point of the story, so I won't spoil it for you.In the first opening scene a little girl, with umbrella designs on her socks, appears to be down on all fours playing with her rottweiler. We hear a whine and whimper and as the little girl turns around we see she is covered in blood and rottweiler guts. Hey, I'm an animal lover so I don't think I would have picked on a dog as my victim, but don't worry, as these zombies get much more gross as the book moves forward.The story concerns our protagonist, Chase Daniels, the head meth-head, his girlfriend, KK or Kristen, his best friend Typewriter John or Type for short, and during the first part their main supplier affectionately known as the Albino. Don't worry as there are more people, places, and things to be insulted or mocked as we move along. In this reincarnation of the Zombie myth, they seem to giggle or chuckle just before attacking; thereby earning the soubriquet, the Chucks.Normally one would be for the meth-heads over the zombies or Chucks, but I'll let you decide who to root for. It would seem to be the lessor of two evils with no real winners.  The story does have a neat ending which, I think, will surprise most readers, me included. The book is full of obscenities and campy language in which a character might say, ""It sucks you in like your Hoover gone psycho."" ;-}It was a fun read, not to be taken seriously.

"This is a great piece of drama in which you don't have to injection a suspension of disbelief to envision the events as true or actually happening.  As others have said the film is beautifully photographed with great acting by Saskia Rosenthal.  She plays the 14yo daughter Hannelore Dressler, LORE for short, whose Nazi parents abandon her and four siblings as the Allies close in at the end of WWII, and the parents realize they will be prosecuted and imprisoned. The father simply disappears without further ado, while the mother gives LORE a feeble explanation of being sent to some camp. She leaves Lore a small amount of money and the jewelry she acquired over her lifetime, imploring her to use it to buy food, shelter and transportation for her and her siblings to reach their maternal grandmother's in the country near Hamburg. Considering that Lore's youngest brother was still breastfeeding when his mother abandoned the children, it is up to the now 14yo matriarch of this five person band to see them through.  Ms Rosenthal gives a superbly believable and highly emotionally charged performance.  That is the basic plot, but what happens along the way to Lore and her siblings is what truly makes this story come alive. Her ingenuity in employing  ways of keeping her family alive is amazing.  For all those loving drama this will keep you enthralled from beginning to end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36AI02304X0BE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSTVGHS#wasThisHelpful","R36AI02304X0BE","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We find out that, ""[B]y the late nineteenth century, people were swearing in much the same manner as we do today."" [p230]But the author discusses swearing and taking of an oath from way back in ancient Roman and then brings us up to date while discussing a fair amount of neuroscience along the way. As we find out that most speech is a function of the cerebral cortex yet swearwords are a formed in the limbic system a much lower order part of the brain and is one reason why when some people suffer from dementia they may not be able to speak except for swearwords. [p5]But some parts of the history lesson just seems gross by today's standards as when we learn of the Roman latrine called a FORICAE which was a unisex arrangement with up to a hundred seats with no dividers for people doing the same thing at the same time. [p23] That may even gross out the members of Animal House! ;--0  There is much more revealing about the Romans that the author tells us about, but I don't want to spoil all the details for you.As we move to the middle ages in Europe we learn that ""Medieval people would be much less likely to see representations of sex acts, but would be much more likely than modern ones to witness the actual performance of these acts.""

Hey,, somebody had to empty that chamber pot in the middle of the night.As we quickly move up in time we are told that ""[T]he lower classes swear more than the upper and middle class...[as] modern attitudes toward swearing and social class are the legacy of Victorian social climbers who were afraid to look working-class."" [208]There is an entire chapter devoted to just the F-word and it is interspersed with examples throughout the book, so if you don't want to see liberal mention of it throughout your read, this may not be the book for you.

"Henry Ford was born on a farm in Dearborn, MI on 7/30/1863 and hated farming for as long as he could remember, while loving all things mechanical. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage on 4/7/1947 at his 56 room estate, which he called Fair Lane.  Although that is the beginning and end, it is what is in between that makes this so interesting.William Ford, Henry's father, married Mary Litogot O'Hearn, the daughter of a neighbor in 1858 when he was 35 and she was 21. Henry, in turn met his wife Clara Jane Bryant the eldest neighbor's daughter who had nine siblings.  They met in late 1885 and married on 4/11/1888. They had one son named Edsel Bryant Ford, who helped run Ford for a number of years until he died of stomach cancer on 5/26/1943. Henry always thought Edsel was never tough enough, but still seemed to love him, without ever giving him much in the way of praise. Yet Edsel was the likeable son who got along with everyone at Ford, and everyone seemed to like him, except for some internecine factions trying to curry Henry's favor by encouraging his feelings of Edsel being somewhat of a softy. It should be noted that people always addressed Henry as MR. FORD, and that extended to his wife and son.Henry's method of success was to hire the best man for each position he needed to fill, yet he was such an egotist and paranoid individual that he became quickly jealous if anyone besides him received praise for the their job.  If they did they were soon fired, and no one ever talked back to him or dared say there might be another way to do things including changing the Model T and stayed employed. Henry produced the first Model T on 9/24/1907 and the millionth one in December of 1915.By 1917, Ford had become the largest employer of African Americans in the USA. [p209] Yet this seemed to be negated by the fact that ""At the end of 1913, the Ford managers discovered that that were having to hire 963 workers to be assured that 100 of them would stay with their jobs long enough to learn them."" [p210]He started a company sociology department to help primarily poor and undereducated workers, which seemed beneficent until it was realized that the rules were extremely paternalistic so that he would only hire married men if they were under age 22.  They even had to get permission from Ford to buy the very car they helped manufacture.  And it was no joke that if you were seen driving another make of car you were fired immediately. ""In 1914 the average Ford worker had 207.10 in savings. For those who stuck with the company the next five years, the average has risen to 2171.14."" [p235]  This came about primarily because on 1/12/14 Ford reduced the standard work day from nine to eight hours, and at the same time increased the minimum daily wage from 2.34 to 5 dollars per day, thereby forcing all other automobile manufacturers to do the same.Ford certainly had his shortcomings and among the most severe was his EXTREMELY anti-Semitic stance, which he made public by buying the Dearborn Independent newspaper for that sole purpose. He ran 91 successive weeks of  anti-Semitic articles, before stopping by claiming he didn't know what was being printed in a paper he owned, and also paying millions in libel damages. [pp270-272]But Henry wasn't the dour faced Episcopalian one might think for he seemed to have kept a mistress for thirty five years, actually flaunting her presence at times. Evangeline Cote began in the stenographic pool in 1912 at age 16; three years later she was its head. To help dissuade casual outsiders from suspecting any shenanigans he had her marry another employee named Ray Dahlinger, who worked in various minor supporting roles. Evangeline eventually ran Greenfield Village. He bought her harness racing horses and too many other things to mention. He bought the Dahlingers a house as a wedding gift, a cottage on Lake Huron, then a 300 acre Tudor estate a mile from Fair Lane with 100 head of cattle, and on top of that a Curtiss Flying Boat. Not bad for a stenographer, huh??? He thought she produced him a son named John Cote Dahlinger on 4/9/1923. Although there was no DNA back then Henry treated the boy as his and showered him with too many gifts to list. This part of the book was some of the most interesting.As the author said of Henry near the end, ""When I got to know him better, I liked him more, and less.""  A very interesting read of the man who remains somewhat of an enigma beyond his public persona. BTW Mrs. Ford invited Evangeline to come and see Henry for the last time as he lay dying, so he could be with each of them. Mrs. Ford died in 1950.  Now that is one helluva lady.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XFSAN6NPS8HF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451645570#wasThisHelpful","R1XFSAN6NPS8HF","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me begin by saying the author has certainly done his homework on this subject. I am slightly familiar with this subject as I also collect first editions and antiquarian books. The story takes place in the 1920's and 1930's primarily, although some earlier material is included to set up the background for the main points discussed.  The geographical area discussed, colloquially referred to as Book Row, consisted of the six blocks on Fourth Ave from Astor Place to Union Square on Manhattan.It seems that the most important triumvirate set of book thieves consisted of Charles Romm, a savvy book dealer well known to deal in sophisticated first editions [meaning altered books, which had the effect of eliminating bad pages and removing library marks with a bleaching agent called Javelle Water]; Ben Harris, a Dane dealing in erotica, which was truly banned at the time; and Harry Gold, who was the primary recruiter and hands-on trainer for the actual thieves who stole the books from public and private libraries.We are introduced to Wilberforce Eames, who the New York Times called, ""The greatest living scholar of books in America.""  Another important figure was A. S. W. Rosenbach, PhD, who wrote regularly in popular magazines and papers about books and was a rare book dealer himself.  There were too many others to discuss them each.  But the main storyline concerns G. William Berqquist, a librarian, turned sleuth and who became an official member of the NYPD specializing in book thievery while his salary was funded by the NY Public Library.  He ended up breaking up the ring by assisting Sgt Warren Liese by getting Boston's most famous thief [Harold Borden Clarke] to give up his associates by promising immunity for the charges against him. It seems that Clarke and his associates stole from 34 Libraries in and around Boston, including Harvard, and then tried to blackmail them into buying their own books back to stop further thefts. He was also a well known second hand dealer and wanted to write a book about how book thieves worked - that is simply too weird to make up.The problem with the book as others have noted is that there are simply way too many characters to keep track of and most were discussed with great background detail, which seemed to make the book drag after about the tenth one.  Remember that these incidents happened over 80 years ago and none of these criminals were as well-known as say Al Capone was at the same time.  They were fairly successful, but didn't have anywhere near the same name recognition of the violent criminals of the era. It is a fairly short book that was very well researched, but one must truly be a bibliophile to appreciate it.  For those people it is highly recommended as it should keep their interest, but for most others, they will probably not finish it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JNSKPC52AZMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199922667#wasThisHelpful","R3JNSKPC52AZMP","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book is about the author's love of dogs and her efforts to train psychiatric service dogs and eventually found a non-profit called Possibility Dogs, Inc to do just that.In the first chapter we a introduced to Bob, a burly ex-firefighter suffering from PTSD and helped along the way with his service dog Haska. In the very next chapter we learn of the author's own battle with PTSD, after coming upon a gruesome scene during a search mission she and her partner were not expecting and how this changed her life goals.Ms Charleston seems to have a houseful of mixed breed rescues of various sizes from tiny Pomeranians to her main search dog Puzzle, a female golden retriever. Although she dearly loves Puzzle she realizes that she is simply not cut out to be a psychiatric service dog, so she begins her quest to secure one wanting to train it herself.During chapter eight the author documents the traits she is looking for in potential service animals and how she goes about testing for them. In the very next chapter, which I found particularly interesting, she discusses some rather inexpensive modifications to the home environment that would allow a service animal to help with both physical and psychiatric task assistance. e.g. changing door knobs to door handles, which can also be very helpful to those with severe arthritis; adding a sturdy rope to the refrigerator so that the dog can open it and bring things from inside to the human companion; and adding inexpensive masking tape to a portable phone to make it easier for the dog to grasp and so that its teeth don't mar the phone. There were others but I found these simple and most beneficial.In chapter ten one of her Pomeranians, Misty succumbs to congestive heart failure, and just as the author is experiencing hopelessness and despair, serendipity happens and a neighbor who is allergic to animals has found a starving pit bull mix that very same day and knowing the author's fondness for dogs, asks if she will take in this poor bedraggled puppy, which she does and names Jake Piper [that's him on the cover photo].  Since the rest of the book is about her adventures with Jake and how he becomes a major part of her life, I won't go further. If you love dogs or ever wondered if you, a family member, or friend could benefit from a psychiatric service dog and what it takes to train one, this is the book for you.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z4YUEGAPK9U1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054773493X#wasThisHelpful","R2Z4YUEGAPK9U1","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brontosaurus never was because lexicographically it should have been referred to as an Apatosaurus, since the name Apatosaurus was used first and the Brontosaurus existed as only a minor variation of the Apatosaurus. Of course, whatever you called it the animal itself did exist, however, in science, naming is a really big thing.There many things I liked about the book and a few, I saw, as negatives. First and most importantly of the positives, the author exhibited a deep knowledge about his subject matter, which is dinosaurs in general and his favorite member of that species the Brontosaurus or more correctly referred to as the Apatosaurus, in particular. The author described many facts that made the book interesting as:1. ""Tyrannosaurus lived closer to us in time - 66million years ago than it did to Apatoaurus, which died 84 million years prior."" [p29] Therefore the fight scenes between these two giants, most of us have seen in movies over the years, could never have occurred since they didn't live at the same time.2. ""For all those stunning forces to exist, though, dinosaurs had to have sex."" [p57] He describes how this theoretically occurred in a chapter titled THE BIG BANG THEORY. :)3. It also seems that we know more about about female dinosaurs due to their fossilized pelvic bone structure than male members of their species, since male sexual apparatus would be soft tissue and not become fossilized. [p65] But inquiring minds still want to know!4. It seems that paleontologists can estimate a dinosaurs age at time of death by bone growth rings similar to dating trees. [p69-70]5. We also learn that female dinos did protect their young hatchlings, at least for a short while, and this would have varied with different members of the species.6. Another interesting point made was that TRICERATOPS also never existed as a separate species but was the juvenile form of of a two horned species called TOROSAURUS. [p92]These were just a few of the many interesting points made in revealing a lot about dinosaur lives, but there were some things that would have helped dramatize the overall theme better and the first would have been more drawings or correct photos of the various species the author tried to explain with just words. He gave detailed explanations but as others have said a picture is worth a thousand words, and such photos or drawings these could have been used especially in pointing out the differences between say the Triceratops in its juvenile and adult forms, as the bone structure of the head also changed, which would change the way it looked.But my biggest concern was with the writing and extreme use of descriptive paragraphs as filler to make the book at least 25 pages longer than it needed to be. Let me just cite one example from page 140. ""I remember exactly where I was when ARCHEOPTERYX [a bird like predecessor] was threatened to demotion from its place as an evolutionary icon. I was sitting at an Exxon station in the middle of nowhere Montana, waiting for my rented SUV to finish fueling so I could continue my journey from the isolated town of Ekalaka (where I had been looking for dinosaurs with paleontologists Thomas Carr and Scott Williams and their field crew) down to Thermopolis, Wyoming. After running into a convenience store to buy the requisite snacks and caffeine for my seven hour trip, I checked my messages to see if I had missed anything important while I was in the field.""  I would consider NONE of that germane to the story of ARCHEOPTERYX but the type of trivia that might be shown on reality TV, which is an oxymoron itself. The worse part is that that wasn't the complete paragraph.  There were many other descriptions of roads leading into Dino digs and other useless trivia that simply took away from the flow of the story.The overall story was interesting, the author seemed to truly enjoy telling about dinosaurs, but the descriptive passages were far too numerous and way too long.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZMCJ1JFMEEIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374135061#wasThisHelpful","R1ZMCJ1JFMEEIP","A2368W0H135KQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2368W0H135KQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I think also this movie can be really confusing for people who aren't aware of the literary device that Jason Robert Brown uses, so I'll explain it here. (Not exactly a spoiler!) Cathy's part is sung in reverse chronological order, so when she's singing, it's slowly tracing back from the present to the beginning of their relationship. Jamie's part is sung in chronological order showing how their relationship develops from beginning to end. Their two stories intersect at their wedding.

"This ball washer does what it's supposed to, according to the other reviewers. However, it does not attach to your golf bag, which I think is more practical, especially for a woman who usually won't have a large pocket to put something like this in. I've already got my balls and tees in there. I don't want this big ole wet thing in there too. It seems more practical to hang it from the outside of the bag, near your towel, rather than having to get it out of a pocket. You can get a similar one from Ball-Brite that clips onto your bag. I rarely need to wash my ball when I'm on the green, (which is good because I couldn't do that anyway since my bag would be off the green and in the cart), so other than that, I don't know what benefit there is to having it in your pocket.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HW66JNBX4D7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049RUXH0#wasThisHelpful","R2HW66JNBX4D7P","AYYY3PSX834LJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYYY3PSX834LJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a great fan of the HBO GoT series, and re-watch all seasons every year while waiting for the next one to premiere. After the first season, I tried to read the books, but got lost trying to keep up with the myriad of characters and their back-stories. But as they say, the book is always better than the movie, as books reveal so much more of a character's thoughts and motivations, and this is certainly true of Martin's saga. Plus there are characters and events in the books which are left out of the HBO series. So after watching the series for a fourth time and now being very familiar with at least the main characters, and still having weeks before Season 5 aired, I again determined to read these tomes. While shopping for the Kindle versions of Martin's books, I came across Waiting for Dragons: Re-reading A Game of Thrones, and am using it as a companion book. It is very helpful at reminding me whom certain characters are and why they are important as the author often reveals back-stories and where they appear in future event(s). These are blatant spoilers, but the author assumes that, like him, we have previously read the books.The book is a blog compilation and many of the reviewers have complained that it reads like a, well, like a blog compilation. Other reviewers complained that the author is always whining about when A Dance with Dragons would be released. Except uh, wasn't that the exact and whole point of the blog? The Kindle version is even titled Waiting for Dragons. I don't understand people who give negative reviews because someone they don't even know didn't write a book the way they wish it had been written. And actually, now that Martin fans are all waiting impatiently for Winds of Winter, I find myself completely identifying with the author's comments about waiting for Dragons. And I found his sort of self-deprecating style of writing kind of humorous.I kept my review to 4 stars because I felt there was so much more and more important trivia that the author could have included and didn't. I find myself frequently going to the ASOIAF Westeros.org website to fill in things that this book only references.Also, I think this book would not be nearly as enjoyable were I not reading it along with GoT, so I strongly recommend it in that light.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LCX4S8QFCBLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004X1TYH2#wasThisHelpful","R2LCX4S8QFCBLE","AYYY3PSX834LJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYYY3PSX834LJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We bought this just as a backup coffee maker for when one of us didn't want to prepare a whole pot of coffee. We had previously bought a Tassimo, but never could find any decent tasting coffee for it. The Tassimo was like drinking colored water.

It turned out to be a timely purchase. The same day we got this, I was in an accident that left me with a broken collarbone and shoulder blade, so could only use one arm. But I was able to set it up and make myself a great cup of coffee with very little effort. There's no doubt that it creates a lot more waste than a pot, so we will probably continue using a full size pot most of the time, but when you have company and one person wants dark roast, another wants decaf, another wants tea, etc., the Keurig has cups for all that. Who says you can't please all the people all the time? I recommend researching on the internet the many different types of coffee offered because there are so many, no doubt you can get exactly what you like.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E77T7WXZACZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQ9NIO0#wasThisHelpful","R1E77T7WXZACZL","AYYY3PSX834LJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYYY3PSX834LJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I was a little girl, on special occasions, we would eat dinner at Dale's Hideaway, in Homewood (Birmingham), Alabama. The restaurant had this huge treasure chest and kids could pick out a free plastic toy after dinner - to a four year old, that was incredibly cool! Back then, if you wanted some sauce to use at home, they would put it in a coke bottle for you. Enough nostalgia; Dale's eventually began selling their famous sauce in the local grocery stores and then it spread across the Southeast. But we ran into problems when we moved up north and had to depend on care packages from family or packing it in my suitcase which always resulted in a look-see by the TSA. Somehow recently, we ran completely out. I tried a couple copycat recipes I got off the Internet, but there wasn't anything remotely as good. Then I wondered if Amazon would have it online. Of course, they did. The bottles arrived quickly and in perfect condition.For those who are new to Dale's, note that people mainly use it for STEAKS and it's for MARINATING, not dipping. It is also excellent for pork tenderloins. It is not so good on chicken. Haven't tried it on lamb... Marinate your steaks in a large baggie with just enough sauce to barely cover them. Flip them over about every five or ten minutes, depending on how long you're going to leave them in the sauce. If you aren't used to Dale's, don't marinate more than 20 minutes. If you love it, leave them in for several hours. If you think it's too salty, I suggest trying a shorter marinade time. Or you could try the low sodium version. I tried it once when the store was out of the regular. Bleah! For someone who cut her teeth on Dale's sauce, it was rather like drinking decaffeinated coffee. But it might be a good choice for beginners. Kind of like when people cut their scotch whiskey with water...","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IQ6YI8R7QOD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EO5YR0#wasThisHelpful","R1IQ6YI8R7QOD0","AYYY3PSX834LJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYYY3PSX834LJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is continually compared to Gone With the Wind, but the writing is way below Margaret Mitchell's. It's more like a bad romance novel just without graphic descriptions of the sex. Amber is not a very likeable character and has none of the personality or intellect of Scarlett. It's mainly about a whiny, materialistic woman whose only good feature is her beauty and who chases after and clings to a man who cares nothing about her; he just uses her for sex now and then, and goes on his way when he's done. Come to think of it, he's not very likeable either. They both marry other people and cheat on their spouses. Truly, none of the adult characters in this book have any redeeming values except perhaps one old man that Amber tricks into marrying her. And be prepared for the ending which is so completely abrupt and without resolution that you will be throwing things against the wall because of the time you invested for such a cheap trick conclusion.One other thing I found annoying is that parts of the book just jump in and out of telling the history of King Charles II, as if it's a totally different novel. Then it will abruptly return to the story of Amber and Bruce again.

"Has your experience in church been that women of the Bible are largely ignored? Churches have teaching series about David or Paul or any number of men, but sermons based on biblical women are few and far between. So this study had the wonderful opportunity to help Christians learn about some unique women in the Bible who faithfully followed God. Unfortunately, it has a lot of error and outright fabrication and that prevents me from giving it any more than one star. I like the way the material is presented and the application questions are very good, but if the lesson is not biblically correct, how can I recommend it as a Bible study?The workbook begins very promisingly with several good lessons on Ruth, Abigail, and Gomer. It first falters with the lesson of Mary and Martha where the author blames Martha's failure on a difference in ""spiritual gifts."" However, this is prior to Pentecost; spiritual gifts have not yet begun. Even if they had, there is nothing in the text to support this idea. Christ was explaining about his upcoming crucifixion in about a week and he wanted everyone, including Martha, to listen. This passage is a narrative, not a general prescriptive teaching about the gift of worship versus service; although it does teach us about the importance of choosing the appropriate thing to do at a specific moment in time. Too bad the author missed that.Kelley also inserts her own ideas into the lessons as if they came directly from Scripture. While introducing the second week of the study, she says, ""most women develop their fullest potential in the marriage relationship."" This is an opinion shared by the evangelical Christian community, (and has resulted in some pretty poor treatment of the singles within that community), but it is a cultural idea not taught in the Bible. Women reach their fullest potential through the imitation of Christ. And Paul teaches in 1 Corinthians 7:7-9, 32-35 that it is better to be single because then we are fully dedicated to the Lord rather than being distracted by the responsibilities of a husband and family.I was ready to overlook all this except I then read the lesson on Sarah and it bears little resemblance to the actual account found in Scripture. Kelley praises Sarah's submission to Abraham and glosses over how Abraham allows Sarah to be taken as wife by the Pharaoh - an act that is severely punished by God (Gen 12:17-18). Kelley shows either a blatant ignorance or disregard for the culture of that day and with classic ""blame the victim"" philosophy actually faults Sarah for ""disobeying God"" rather than noting that back then it was the men who made these arrangements and then subjected women to them.Kelly then moves to the Hagar/Ishmael episode and accuses Sarah of interfering in God's plan and manipulating his will. She states ""Sarah experienced ... the consequences of disobedience. When she rebelled against God's authority, her life was shattered. When she repented of her rebellions and submitted to God's authority, Sarah was blessed beyond her wildest imagination. Women can learn about real-life submission from this strong-willed wife."" The problem is that the Bible never accuses Sarah of any of these things or describes her in this way. Her decisions and actions are not criticized. Sarah is the only woman to be listed with the Heroes of the Faith in Hebrews 11. In God's original promises in Genesis 12 and 15, it is stated that Abraham will have many descendants, but it is never stated that Sarah will be the mother. So she and Abraham can't be blamed for thinking that this promised child was to come from another woman. It was a sacrificial and submissive act, not a manipulative one, for Sarah to allow her husband to have a child with another woman. Never does the biblical text indicate the birth of Ishmael was outside God's will or a ""mistake."" It is many years later before God promises specifically that Sarah will have a son and that he will be the child of the covenant.Another lesson that Kelley gets wrong is Eve's. Kelley states that because of Eve's rebellion against God, her children faced the power of sin. She twice calls her the ""first sinner,"" and states that ""through her life and lineage, both sin and grace entered the world."" Kelley also implies that God banished Adam and Eve from the garden because he was angry at Eve for ""tempting Adam."" What the Bible actually teaches about the fall is that they sinned together at about the same time (Gen 3:6-7) and regardless of who ate first, it was through Adam, not Eve, that sin first entered the world (Romans 5). Adam openly rebelled - Eve was deceived (2 Cor 11:3, 1 Tim 2:14). Perhaps it was rebellion in his heart through the desire to eat the fruit that was the first sin (Mt 5:28). Finally, they were banished to prevent them from eating of the Tree of Life (Gen 3:22-24).In Kelley's world, husbands are blameless. If we women will just submit, God will bless us. There are hints of Job's friends here: Is your life not hunky-dory? Then it's because you're not a good enough Christian wife.Less important, but still annoying, there are occasional errors that are just sloppy research. For example, Kelley says that Jacob worked ""for seven more years"" after marrying Leah to marry Rachel. That's a common misconception, but actually he marries Rachel a week after marrying Leah and then works another seven years to pay off her bride-price. She says Eve had three sons and that all future generations came from them, but Genesis 5:4 says that Adam and Eve had other sons and daughters. In the lesson on Huldah, she incorrectly states that the Babylonian exile occurred in the first century BC rather than late in the sixth century. And she misstates Huldah's prophecy about King Josiah's death.Another problem is that she randomly assigns virtuous attributes to different women without any real biblical or historical basis. For example, she says that Elizabeth was the mentor of Mary, the mother of Christ, with no other evidence than the fact that Elizabeth is older and Mary spends some time with her during her pregnancy. She even says that Jesus praised Elizabeth's life when in fact Jesus never spoke of Elizabeth at all. This falsehood is unnecessary as the Bible does praise Elizabeth in Luke 1. Kelley creates an entire lesson around the ""integrity"" of the prophet, Huldah, who is never once described in that manner by the Bible. Kelley could have just have easily said Huldah was self-controlled, humble or faithful, or anything else from a grocery list of attributes one would expect to find in a prophet. The point is there is no biblical basis for pulling out this specific attribute and applying it to her.It gets worse with the servant girl Rhoda in Acts 12:12-17. Although the text is clear that Rhoda's joy is specifically and only related to Peter's escape, Kelley arbitrarily ascribes joy as Rhoda's permanent persona and attitude toward work and life in general. Again with no evidence, Kelley says that Lydia (Acts 16:12-15) ""successfully balanced the priorities in her life."" And she pulls from thin air the idea that Paul admired Priscilla's competence as a tentmaker. These things are never stated in the biblical text, meaning these attributes described by Kelley are pure fabrications. This kind of thing is simply inappropriate for any biblical study.Another problem is the failure to do the word studies necessary when using literature that is translated from a foreign language. For example, Kelley makes a comparison of Leah's and Isaac's eyesight by comparing two verses which both use the word ""weak."" However, the Hebrew word translated ""weak"" in Genesis 27:1 about Isaac is ""kahah"" which refers to poor eyesight while the word used in Genesis 29:17 for Leah is ""rak"" which means soft or delicate. (See Genesis 18:7 where Abraham selects a ""tender"" and choice calf.) Rather than the generally accepted nearsightedness that Kelley propagates, Genesis 29:17 appears to be complimenting Leah: ""Leah had beautiful eyes, but Rachel had the whole package."" Why does this matter? Because it changes the way one thinks about Leah, the mother of Judah, the ancestor of Christ. Oh yeah, and because it's simply inaccurate.Another example is how Kelley gives the word ""helper"" as it applies to Eve the usual American connotation of subservient assistant when the original language of Scripture carries no such implication and has been wrongly used to support wifely submission for centuries. The word means someone who comes to the rescue of another - it is most often used to refer to God himself as he comes to the ""help"" of Israel. It is used 11 different times in the Psalms, always as a reference to God, for example, Ps 33:20, God ""is my helper and my shield.""This failure to exegete also results in Kelley applying verses inappropriately. For example, while praising the Proverbs 31 woman's ""discipline,"" meaning diligence, she refers us to Hebrews 12:11, ""No discipline seems pleasant at the time."" However, ""discipline"" here is the Greek word, ""paideia,"" which has a completely different meaning than what Kelley intends. In telling us to be diligent and persevering, we are referred to a verse about instruction and chastisement. Compare its use in Ephesians 6:4 about children, ""bring them up in the training [paideia] and instruction of the Lord."" Not a big deal, but it's still Scripture applied incorrectly.My final complaint is her presentation of the Proverbs 31 woman as a ""role model"" for women. Proverbs is poetic literature. This is not a real woman, but the heroic ideal. Kelley misses the context of the passage. The Psalm says this is an acrostic (an alphabetical teaching) from a mother to her young son (prepared by Bathsheba for her son, King Solomon, the author of Proverbs, using the pseudonym of King Lemuel). Kelley misses that this passage is not directed to women; it is advice to young men on how to recognize a godly wife. Fortunately Scripture doesn't tell women to aspire to be this woman. It would be like trying to keep the Law. You can't. No one can be this perfect, so the Pro 31 woman points us to the grace of God (Gal 3:23-29, Rom 7:24-25). Trying to be all that is impossible for most women and neglect of husbands or children or home will be the fallout. However, studying the Proverbs 31 woman can lead us to humility, repentance, and the grace of Christ - the one person that the Bible does give us for our role model. God grant us to follow in his steps. (1 Peter 2:21, Heb 12:1-3, 1Cor 11:1, 1 Jn 2:6, 2 Cor 3:18)","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U7QG458JODCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0767335740#wasThisHelpful","R2U7QG458JODCZ","AYYY3PSX834LJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYYY3PSX834LJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When John Grisham was contemplating a sequel to his great novel, A Time to Kill, his wife warned against it with the prophetic wisdom, ""They rarely work, you know."" He should have listened. This story is so predictable, but it meanders toward the foreseeable climax like a lazy Mississippi backwater swamp. Halfway through the book, I wanted to scream out loud, ""Just get to it, would you?"" Other than that, it was a typical Grisham legal thriller, just not up to par with some of his other stories. The one thing I hated most and could not understand was was the completely different relationship that exists between Jake and Lucius. I don't want to give anything away, but this nearly ruined the book for me.

"I bought this book and waited a few days before I finally started reading it. Big mistake! Once started, I could hardly put it down. It's a gripping story that wraps up very nicely after more than a few twists and turns. Perhaps this is a spoiler, but I appreciate a book with an ending where justice is served. Those who were disappointed by the ending of Gone Girl will know what I mean. While some might not call it a completely ""happy"" ending, this ending does not disappoint.The book has an under-lying and barely noticeable sub-theme about whether God is active in the world and brings about justice. As a Christian, this made the book even more interesting. If you're not a Christian, don't misunderstand - this is by no means a novel from the ""Christian"" genre of barely disguised tracts hidden within a story; in fact, I don't think the author meant it to be a ""Christian"" novel at all. This sub-theme is not explicit. It is merely explored through the thoughts and dialogue of a few of the main characters and never gets in the way of the story itself.****SLIGHT SPOILER**** Some reviewers have complained about an important ""coincidental"" incident - yes, it may seem contrived - unless you are following that underlying sub-theme I mentioned of whether God plays a role in the world and brings about his justice in the end. As some like to say, ""There are no coincidences."" However, when you put this incident with the running sub-theme about whether God is active in the world and brings about justice, the ending may cause you to ponder whether perhaps God's hand was at work throughout...","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUQXBJB1KZAM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002E7ARUU#wasThisHelpful","RUQXBJB1KZAM1","AYYY3PSX834LJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYYY3PSX834LJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was part of the beta testing team for this product and, in my opinion, it was released way too soon. It has lots of bugs plus it has less features and a lot of differences from the Quicken Windows version which most people are used to and expect to find on the Mac version. I think Intuit released it early because so many people have asked for a product for Mac, but that's no excuse to release it before it's ready. Perhaps, some may say it's better than no Quicken for Mac as it's at least better than Essentials. That's like saying a three legged horse is better than a two legged one. My recommendation is that it's only going to get better, (because it can't get much worse). If you're already using Quicken on a Windows computer or have something else that works for you, I wouldn't purchase it. Wait about a year and I predict it will be much improved.What really stinks for the beta testers is that we set up our accounts on the beta version and was never told that the software would terminate at the end of the testing. (It was probably buried in some legal terms and condition doc that I agreed to.) So I assumed I would be allowed to keep the software since I was expected to use it for all my accounts. Not so. The software has now ""terminated"" and I am left with either buying this crappy version for my Mac Quicken file or going back to the Windows version and filling in all the missing months when I was using it on the Mac.Intuit's attitude towards its Mac customers is breathtaking in its level of arrogance and neglect.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IZKTKHNUWCPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M76N6MO#wasThisHelpful","R2IZKTKHNUWCPI","AYYY3PSX834LJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYYY3PSX834LJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book presents two parallel stories of women who lived in different centuries in Afghanistan. The young woman in the 21st century is inspired by stories she hears of the life of her ancestor. At times, I got tired of going back and forth between the two women, but that was because I was more interested in the modern woman, Rahima. The saddest part of the story is how the cycles of cultural, economic, and domestic abuse toward women continue to repeat themselves in outlying villages where modern technology and education is still relatively nonexistent for the majority of families.Although the novels are completely different, this book has a similar theme and feel as ""A Thousand Splendid Suns,"" a book written by Khaled Hosseini, author of ""The Kite Runner."" Both books are a revealing look at how the Islamic culture found in third world countries allows and even encourages abuse and oppression of women and the indomitable spirit that is found in some women who refuse to submit to the outrage and who struggle to escape and overcome their fate, even though it invites greater levels of torment by the oppressors.It also exposes how the practice of polygamy pits women against each other, the jealousy creating mistrust, thereby precluding women from joining together to fight for better treatment. Also, there is the heartbreaking irony of how these uneducated people - both men and women - blame and torment any woman who fails to bear sons when modern medicine shows that it is the man's sperm which determines the sex of a child.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7VZOFO8JO0SR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJ350AI#wasThisHelpful","R7VZOFO8JO0SR","AYYY3PSX834LJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYYY3PSX834LJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'd rather use my imagination and stick with the motives behind the characters' actions and the drama within the story. The time travel is an interesting element. If you like romantic fiction, it's worth reading, I guess. Frankly, I could do without the homoerotic masochism (or any masochism for that matter)  and probably won't bother with  the sequels.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12VX797M6K18X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC2L1O#wasThisHelpful","R12VX797M6K18X","AYYY3PSX834LJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYYY3PSX834LJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed the Native American perspective which was something unusual, but the story has a few unbelievable elements that distract from it and the conclusion is very rushed and ultimately left me wanting to know more details about what happened at the end. The story jumps from right at the climax of the story to three months later and neatly packages it in a too brief description. SPOILER ALERT! You don't even have a final scene with the main character and his love interest.I will probably skip the second book, but will definitely see this film. And could somebody please get an editor in here who understands that possessive pronouns don't contain apostrophes?

"I bought these so my phone and iPad would be hands-free. I often stream Netflix, etc. at night on my iPad and I need earbuds so I don't disturb my spouse. With these, I don't have to worry about getting tangled up in a cord if I fall asleep. When I first got these, I had many of the same complaints as you see in the other reviews. I didn't receive a small set of buds and they wouldn't stay in my ears. I contacted Jarv and they sent me a new pair for free with smaller buds that stay in my ears much better, especially when I took off the rubber stabilizers. Because the cord goes around the back of the neck, long hair can pull them out when you turn your head; using the hooks that come with it will prevent that. The range isn't very far on the blue-tooth, but that hasn't been an issue for me. If you get these and have any problem, check with Jarv as they will try their best to make you a happy customer. I am very satisfied with my buds and with the prompt service I received.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35EL6SVBASCXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2QUD9S#wasThisHelpful","R35EL6SVBASCXC","AYYY3PSX834LJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYYY3PSX834LJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband and father are both huge Vince Flynn fans. After his death, they have searched for a new author to fill the void. The Hawke series by Ted Bell has been the best so far.

"I was once a huge college football fan. I went to Penn State, marched in the band there, I named my cat Nittany. Over the past years, though, I've become disillusioned with the sport. It grew so big it was no long something I could root for.  I really had a hard time expressing what was the problem until I read this book.Point by point, but without casting judgement, this book illustrates just how big college football is, how much money it brings in, and what led to this.  And all of this really only happened in the last 10-15 years.  It's relatively new in its scope.The author does a great job of discussing stories and interviews, and even how it personally touched him with his family considering re upping their season tickets at Penn State.His writing style is smooth and polished and accessible.As I mentioned it really is a historical look at the big money in football. It does not really pass judgement, instead allowing the sheer volume of money to speak for itself.  He does go on to mention how college football is not only a cash cow for itself, but also has sparked a growth of non-revenue sports, and women's sports in particular.The closest that the book comes to really condemning the college football are in the final chapters, discussing how presidents of schools will not, and often cannot do things to make changes. A strong case is made for college football ruining higher education.Taking the good with the bad, this is an informative read for any college football fan, or detractor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35ILABKY25337/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=067001673X#wasThisHelpful","R35ILABKY25337","A3VZH0PWLQ9BB1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZH0PWLQ9BB1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"he Keurig 2.0 is a big step in quality over the older models, but comes with a few annoyances.First off, this gives you options. With this machine and an approved K cup you can choose 6,8, or 10 ounce coffee size. You can also choose between standard and strong. These choices do make a difference. The coffee tastes more properly extracted and less like brown water. It tastes closer to drip or press.Where older K cup machines were loud and brewed everything the same, this brews much quieter and adapts to your tastes. I like a 8 ounce strong cup, while my wife likes a 10 ounce regular cup.  Now you can have that. This machine will give it to you with easy to use touch screen controls.The reservoir is decent, though can be bigger. It also is removable for easy cleaning or filling.  It also has a built in water filter, great if you have treated water. It also comes with a bottle of descaling solution. Better than using vinegar.The part of the Keurig 2.0 I hate, and the reason it is getting a 2 star review is because of the feature on this machine that only allows you to use approved kcups, made by Keurig of Green Mountain Coffee. Even some older pods made by Keurig aren't good.  It gives you an annoying ""OOPS"" message. Not good when I need my morning coffee.You can work around that, but you shouldn't have to. Shame on Keurig for making this with the DRM features, but you can forgive them for the step up in quality that you get with this machine. The coffee is much much improved over earlier machines and the options for sizes and strength make it a winner.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MF0E9VJ6TSLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWEAXPY#wasThisHelpful","R3MF0E9VJ6TSLL","A3VZH0PWLQ9BB1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VZH0PWLQ9BB1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I didn't do my best at keeping the grass seeds watered, but I was seeing little shoots of green within about a week and all over coverage in about 3.

"This would be a good beginner set for someone, or a set for someone who doesn't use tools a whole lot, I would not recommend this for a professional. They are of only so-so quality. Seem a bit cheap.The ""Ratchet"" mechanism is basically a design that allows you to slip past on the bolt or not the opposite way you are either tightening or loosening.  It works fairly well, and is a fairly good time saver for working on bolts and nuts, though sometimes you end up slipping off what you are tightening. Kind of a pain.Another drawback is these are dark. I lost one already because I was working on my car and dropped it into the engine compartment, I shone a flashlight, looking for it but because they were blackish, I couldn't see them.

"Vega one shake gives you plenty of vitamins with a healthy dose of protein to boot.  One scoop, one very LARGE scoop goes in 12 ounces of water so you'll only get about  10 servings from this container. It makes for a thick, viscous liquid that is quite gritty. I chocked a bit on it, as it was very thick. I wasn't expecting it. I mixed one level scoop with about 12 ounces of ice cold water.  I think that people who maybe have trouble swallowing may want to avoid this.The flavor is fine, but there is sort of an acrid aftertaste that I didn't care for.

I have used cleansing oils before, and love how hydrated they leave my dry skin so I was really excited to see how this one works.That interest and excitement soon faded when I tried it the first time. The scent was immediately strong. It isn't a bad smell at all, but I'm not fond of that much fragrance on my face. In theory, it was easy enough to use. Rub the oil onto your face, then rinse. Simple right? No, not exactly.The oil absolutely refused to rinse off, and I was left with an oily, shiny looking face that even the water beaded off of. I have combination skin, so this was definitely not a good thing. I had to wash my face with soap three times to finally get the oil off. Then the next day, I had an odd combination of acne irritation from clogged pores, and dry skin patches. I will definitely not be using this again, and I surely don't recommend it to anyone.

"Nice vitamin c serum! I LOVE products with vitamin c in them, so I was really excited to test this one out. Vitamin c is great year round, but I really like it in the warmer months for sun damage. My skin is VERY sensitive to the sun, so this has been amazing for me. I have used a few vitamin c products this year, and noticed my sun damage is very minimal now.It came in a nicely sized bottle with a convenient dropper applicator top for easy application. I really like dropper applicator tops because they make measuring so much easier, and make so much less of a mess. The serum goes on smooth without becoming sticky.

"Sexy stuff! I am going to be 100% honest here and admit that I am allergic to cheap metal. I can only wear the purest kind, so I had no intention of actually utilizing the metal chains attached to this outfit. Regardless of how hot that may have been, for this reason I was not at all disappointed when the chain broke. No real loss there!I still use the black cuffs though. I just took the chain off of them so they don't touch my skin. The front of the outfit is extremely sheer with bands of solid black to cover certain parts and leave them up to the imagination. It gives me a very nice, curvy look with just the right amount of visualization. The back is all bands, giving a nice peek-a-boo surprise effect that I REALLY like!

Even in a household like mine where we have four frequent bath bomb users, this 50 pack is an extremely generous size especially at such an affordable price.Speaking of price, these are more than worth the cost. I frequent high end bath bomb sellers like LUSH, as well as lesser quality substitutes you can find at convenience stores, and these are definitely closer to higher end quality. They float and fizz perfectly, and let off an amazing array of unique aromas that satisfy the soul and relax the mind.They haven't caused us any irritation whatsoever as a result of use, and have actually really improved my son's eczema. They seem to let off a light oil that hydrates the skin very nicely. My favorite are the lavender and the coconut. My son prefers the blues and the greens, while my daughter adores all the pinks with their light rose and yummy cotton candy-like scents. My youngest just seems to like that they fizzle about and giggles at the show they make. I'm very pleased with the quality, and love the amazing assortment this bundle provides. I would absolutely buy again. Highly recommend them.

"Great set of decorative string lights! I got these string lights in preparation for Fall. Fall is my absolute favorite season, and with three little ones decorating is an absolute blast! I knew they would get a kick out of decorating with these next season.They are made with a really impressive attention to detail. The scarecrows are super cute, and the lights give off a nice, glowy ambiance. They let off more of a golden glow than a bright radiance, which is exactly what I was looking for.The battery compartment was a little trickier than most, but easy enough to figure out. I just used a Phillips head screwdriver to unscrew then screw it open and shut. It required 3 AA batteries to operate, so be sure to have those in advance so you can use it right away. Great set of lights. I would absolutely buy again.

"Fabulous set of bedsheets! One thing I can never have enough of is sheets. The thing is, I like my sheets to be perfect. My bed is my sanctuary after a long day of appointments, errands, and chasing three little ones all over the place. So, when I hop into bed I want complete luxury.I really feel that I have achieved that luxurious ambiance with this bedsheet set! I washed them in the washer before putting them on my bed and they didn't get damaged or shrink up at all. I ordered queen size and they fit my queen sized bed perfectly. The set came with a flat sheet, a fitted sheet, and two pillow cases. That is everything I needed to dress up my bed.The sage is very light in comparison to other sage sheets I've previously owned, and the subtle striped design is fabulous. They are very nice quality, and soft to the touch. This definitely makes my ""me time"" much more enjoyable. I am very satisfied, and would absolutely repurchase.

"Not bad at all! I'm not a frequent drinker of tea. If I ever do drink it, I usually lean towards chamomile with milk and honey to help me sleep.

They will definitely be getting lots of cups of tea. It steeped easily to perfection, with a nice light flavor and delicious aroma. I love good smells, so that was definitely a plus for me.

"Nice car air purifier! I ordered this for my best friend. She suffers from pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, so clean air is an absolute must for her. With the horrible fumes from trucks, buses, and poorly maintained vehicles on the road, I figured this air purifier would come in handy.It was packaged in a nice little box that made it perfect for gifting. All I had to do was hand it to her and it already looked nice! The blue is a very lovely ice blue shade that is visually appealing. No worries of having an eye sore of a device in her cute little car.The quality is very nice. I can tell it was designed with appearances definitely in mind. She said it makes it much easier to breath in her car, which is a really big deal on these humid, smog-filled summer days. I'm really glad I ordered. I would definitely buy again.

"This is a simple 10 second message recorder and it works exactly as described. Put the switch on the back in the REC position then press and hold the button on the side and speak for up to 10 seconds, then release the button. To play, move the switch to PLAY and press the side button to hear the recording.  The unit has no sharp edges and is comfortable to carry.  What's it good for?  When you park your car you can speak the location to help locate your car later or you could say a few items that you want to remember at the store. I bought it for a different reason.  I've been getting a lot of robocalls on my cellphone lately.  Playing a Special Information Tone (SIT) tells the robocall equipment that the line is not a working number and deletes your number from their list. Not foolproof but helpful.  I recorded the SIT to this device and hold it up to the phone when answering the call. Simple! You can search for SIT.WAV and find it easily.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23NTZ0WDT8ZD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P4NZL66#wasThisHelpful","R23NTZ0WDT8ZD7","A3639Z6O5JBLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3639Z6O5JBLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This looks and sounds better than it is. The clunky, industrial look of this nozzle may lead you to believe it's something special. It isn't. While it will produce a steady, narrow stream it does so with weaker pressure than others that cost a third the price. I compared this to a ten dollar Craftsman and this was not as good at cleaning a sidewalk and was not particularly comfortable or easy to adjust. In fact, you can get this same nozzle without the digital books and other stuff for a third the price at a popular auction site.

"First, the word ""free"" is a misnomer. I had been considering Ooma for awhile and then it came up at a great price as an Amazon Daily Deal so I pulled the trigger to try it.  I works well but you should understand the costs up front which are described on their website. The ""free"" service will cost $4.30/month for taxes and fees (may vary by state) and the premium service will add $10 a month to that. That's still a good price for phone service with all US calling included.  Call quality is as good as a landline as long as you have a good internet connection.

"I've been a fan of Brother's laser printers for over 20 years finding them to be very reliable and cost effective.  It was time for an upgrade and when I saw this on Amazon for two bills I grabbed it.  Unpacking and setup took about 20 minutes and after installing the software it found the printer on the network and set it up on the computer and printed a test page. We have two PC's and several Android phones and tablets using the printer. The printer has WiFi but I used a wired Ethernet connection that was convenient.  One feature that I really like is duplex printing - automatically printing on both sides of a page. It's really handy for printing out manuals and other lengthy documents. The colors are vibrant and the text is crisp. As with all printers, toner cartridges can get pricey but I've found some good aftermarket suppliers whose prices are about half and provide excellent quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FGU09TG0YXSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQU141C#wasThisHelpful","R3FGU09TG0YXSI","A3639Z6O5JBLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3639Z6O5JBLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are cheap - both in cost and in quality. The first thing I did was test each one with a cable pair tester and found that seven out of the ten were defective. The problem is that the conductors on one of the jacks on each of the defective ones are misaligned. Obviously no testing or quality control is is done at the factory before shipping these. The reason I bought these is to run both an Ethernet connection and a phone line on the same cable. A standard Ethernet connection uses conductors 1,2,3 & 6 and the phone line uses 4 & 5 so there's no conflict. Using one of these on each end of the cable does the job nicely - if they work. I've returned the whole lot. EDUCATIONAL NOTE: If you're looking to use these to split an Ethernet (internet) connection this is NOT the product you need unless one of the devices is turned off. To run two internet devices at the same time you either need an Ethernet switch (as little as under 10 bucks) or a PAIR of special splitters (Cables to Go 37133 is one brand) designed for that purpose that actually cost more than a switch.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22Y8VQINTTNB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008SNYI3G#wasThisHelpful","R22Y8VQINTTNB7","A3639Z6O5JBLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3639Z6O5JBLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My wife and I each have home offices out of Bluetooth range of each other so I bought two of these units, one for each of our offices so our cellphones are in range of our respective units. We also have a home phone system that can handle 4 incoming lines so we have our VOIP line on line one, her cell on line 2 and mine on line 3.  Now, wherever we are in the house we can answer any of the lines on any phone.  This device has decent BT range and outputs a strong enough ring current to activate ringing on the phone system and cordless phones.  Although a bit more expensive, this unit is FAR superior to the Cobra BT-15 which I found to be virtually worthless (very limited range and not enough ring current to ring even one standard phone (1 REN)).Now the BAD NEWS that cost this review 2 stars:  One of the units was not automatically connecting consistently so I updated the firmware. That did nothing to solve the problem but now all or parts of conversations are garbled to the point of being unintelligible even though the phone is only six feet away from the unit. I looked at the Info n the website and found nothing useful so I called.  Their phone is ALWAYS answered by an answering machine which invites you to leave a message or send an email. I did both - twice. It's been 6 days with no response so essentially, once you buy this product you're on your own - there is NO way to reach customer service if they even have such a thing.My configuration: Cell phones:  Samsung Galaxy S5 & Samsung Galaxy Note 4 VOIP line:  Nettalk Phone System: XBlue X16","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RBIJ8TZ85A7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018NWQPK#wasThisHelpful","R3RBIJ8TZ85A7N","A3639Z6O5JBLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3639Z6O5JBLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For a two speaker system, these sound very good. Bass is a little thin but what you'd expect without a subwoofer. Overall I was pleased enough with the ones I bought for my PC to order a second pair for my wife's PC. Her comment about the bass echoes mine. These speakers look good on the desk but are a bit deeper and heavier than most, as you'd expect with Bose, to create a detailed sound from a small system.  The included cable for connecting to the PC is only 40"" - not long enough if the PC is on the floor and you need to route the cable at all.  If you don't already have a longer cable, order one at the same time so you can get up and running when these arrive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GC9N0S6IRVXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CD1PTF0#wasThisHelpful","R1GC9N0S6IRVXX","A3639Z6O5JBLIZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3639Z6O5JBLIZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just did a 250 mile trip in what turned out to be a mostly windy and very rainy trip. Although only listed a water resistant (a more expensive water proof version is offered) it did a fairly good job of keeping things dry. We had 5 standard size carry-on roller bags and a few knapsacks and only two of the cloth sided pieces ended up with some damp cloths. So, if there's a possibility of rain on your trip either use hard sided luggage or wrap the items in plastic.  The height of the bag is perfect for standing carry on luggage on their sides rather than laying them flat. That way the bag will easily handle at least seven bags with room to spare.  The bag is well made and has a soft felt type bottom so as not to scratch the roof's surface although I opted to use a non-skid mat as well. The tie down straps seem adequate to the task but I also used a pair of additional tie downs I had on hand.

"This camera definitely delivers what it promises and is well made. First, be sure to download the manual from their website( tomtom.com/cam) because no real useful information is packaged with the camera(there is a quick start guide but don't rely on that). The manual is well written. Let me mention one important feature of this camera that is hardly mentioned in the specs: this does record sound. It has a built-in microphone. If you install the waterproof lens cover(it only comes with the splashproof lens cover which is good for most purposes and permits the built-in microphone to function) it will disable the built-in microphone(it covers it up). One great feature of this camera is it allows an external microphone to be connected(I wish all video recorders did that! You need good sound for professional work), but you will need to purchase the dedicated cable for that. The back end of this comes out for charging, inserting the micro SD card(you insert it with the electrical contacts face up), and for use as if it were a regular flash drive that you could just insert into a computer. So, you don't have to use the mobile app. But the mobile app does give you a lot of great features. One criticism I have(and so do many others) is that there is no desktop app. Obviously, you can't shake a desktop(or a laptop!) but it would be nice to be able to use most of the app features on a computer. You certainly can view the photos and videos on your computer without the app but some data may not be viewable without the app. The camera is amazingly light-weight and small. My only criticism of it is that it uses a fixed focus lens, but I guess that makes sense for an action camera. The image quality, including exposure and focus, seemed good to me nevertheless. I don't know how this camera compares to others on the market, such as the famous GoPro, but this one certainly impressed me. One more note: there is included in the box a strange item with a fuzzy little brush-like piece. There is no mention what this is. It is a windscreen. It has a little picture that shows the self-sticking piece goes over the microphone holes at the base of the lens assembly and then the fuzzy part is stuck onto that by Velcro. It prevents the wind whizzing past the microphone holes from distorting the sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NSLFM4F3K31E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WV69ZI4#wasThisHelpful","R1NSLFM4F3K31E","A3TIL1PC2ZE97B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TIL1PC2ZE97B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't know how you screw up a duster, but this one is pretty screwed up. A duster should be nice and fluffy. This is about as fluffy as a wet cat, and not a long-hared cat. So, it really is only good for dusting rather flat surfaces. For example, it is not at all good for dusting behind electrical equipment like your TV or computer. Also, whatever fluff it has is mostly on the sides so you really can't use the tip as you should for poking into crevices. If that isn't depressing enough, just try inserting the handle into the fluff part. On the package, it only show an inserting motion. On the web page, it further explains exactly where you should insert it: into the white portion and it is not easy to find, especially if you are not told what to look for. I did some dusting and tried to shake the dust off and the fluff part went flying. It was not easy to find the place to insert it especially since I didn't take notice before it flew off. So, you can't even shake this out as you would normally do with a duster. Also, is this washable? They don't say. I suppose they just want you to buy more refills. I gave this three stars because it does pick up dust, but it the world of dusters, this one is a sick puppy and a sick puppy is a very sad thing to behold.

"I asked to review these because I have always loved bamboo fabrics, and these have not disappointed me. They are super soft and silky. They are bright white and contain no dyes. Each cloth is 10 by 10 inches. These are so silky, they are too good just to use as washcloths! I might even use them as handkerchiefs! It doesn't mention it on the cloths or the packaging, but these most likely are made using the viscose rayon process, with bamboo as the cellulose source. The viscose process is noted for producing very silky soft fabrics. This would make a great baby shower gift or any other kind of gift! By the way, I don't think washing instructions are mentioned, but they should be washable as any cotton fabric. They should not shrink, but it might be a good idea not to dry them on high heat, since they most likely are a bamboo rayon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DL31VAZ5WRBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QM69P2#wasThisHelpful","R1DL31VAZ5WRBR","A3TIL1PC2ZE97B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TIL1PC2ZE97B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very high quality bath tissue. It consists of three ply(that is one more ply than I ever heard of for bath tissue) and each ply is very thin and the three plies pretty much ""dissolve"" together. The result is an extremely soft, somewhat thick bath tissue. It has just the right balance between strength and softness. It also has no center tube. I am not a fan of leaving out the center tube. I find it annoying and a waste of the time it takes to get the roll to work. I think it is overkill to think that is a good way to help the environment. But that is just my opinion. Unfortunately, after coming out of the bathroom there was no gorgeous British blond woman asking me if I wanted to go ""commando"" as in that TV commercial(Cherry Healey is the British woman in the Cottonelle TV commercial).

"The first thing you notice when you get this is the very sturdy, heavy duty case with great hardware. The case is also completely covered in decorative paper glued to what seems to be a wood shell. When you open it, it is dazzling! What a fantastic display of markers, pencils, and crayons! There is also a neat package of full sized sheets to color with Minion themes, each sheet being different. The sheets are on sturdy bright white bond paper, so you cannot reuse them. I suggest buying lots of drawing paper for your young artist. Of course, coloring is very popular among adults also these days and this would be good for artists of all ages. The crayons are genuine Crayola crayons and are made in the USA. The pencils are made in Brazil. The set is assembled in Vietnam. I am no longer a kid but I remember my Crayola crayons. In fact, I still have them!

"This set is very pretty and just the right size for a woman. Both the watch and bracelet are 8 inches long when open but can be shortened. Both the watch and the bracelet can be shortened a half inch by just unclasping one section, using no tools. To shorten it further, you need to push pins out with a tool. Only let someone with experience(like a jeweler) do that. If you needed to make it longer, links of one of them may be used to make the other longer. The watch back is a snap-back type so unless you are very experienced, I would not suggest you try to change the battery yourself but should take it to a jeweler who can assure you he will not mar the watch changing the battery(I have had many such bad experiences, including one jeweler who completely ruined my watch!). The crystals really shine brightly and are very tightly mounted so they should be secure. The gold tone also has great luster and looks like real gold. The clasps also work well and are secure.

"My initial experience with this DAW was not good. But after giving it another look(and finding some useful instruction which is scarce), I can see that it has some good features. It is not the easiest DAW to become comfortable with and setting up a midi keyboard was more difficult that any other DAW I have used, but once you learn how to do it, it works. For example, in Ableton, just one click on an icon gives you midi from the computer keyboard, which is nice for setting things up. If you connect a midi keyboard in Ableton, it will most likely work instantly by default. The same is true with Mixcraft and Magix. But here it is much more complicated. To get a keyboard to work, you must select it as in many other DAWs but then you must open the mixer, which is unusual just to set up a midi device. Anyway, after getting through this nonsense, it works. It is still not my first choice in DAWs, but some may like this. It costs more than double Mixcraft but a lot less than Ableton. To download all the supplemental files will take you many hours. I found that very frustrating. I think their server is very slow. I fault this for its lack of ease of use, but the features are there if you are willing to learn them. I would take off a star for excessive complications but it then gains a star for a wealth of supplemental material(more than 30 gigs worth! Have fun downloading that!). This would not be my first choice in DAWs. My first choice is Mixcraft Pro Studio 7 and Ableton Live. I prefer Mixcraft over Ableton not just because it costs so much less, but because it provides the best workflow for my purposes and has all the features I need as well as being very accommodating to plugins. The nearly free(it comes free with some midi keyboards and devices) version of Ableton Live Lite provides excellent features to compliment other full blown DAWs. I like Native Instruments products as well and their free demo version of Kontakt 5 is awesome(the time limit of a session can be easily overcome by simply using a different mapper to compose and then when ready to mix to audio, quickly set up Kontakt 5 and mix down; the same is true using other time limited free plugins)!By the way, unlike many other DAWs, you cannot use this on as many of your computers as you like. You may install it on as many computers as you like but only authorize use for a maximum of five at a time(which most likely will suit your needs). You can always un-authorize a computer so if you get a new computer, you will have no problems. Each time you authorize, your count out of five goes down, and each time you un-authorize, your count out of five goes up; this occurs in the account you set up with Presonus.I am also not very impressed with their Youtube channel. The videos offer some help but often seem more interested in advertising features than actually explaining their use. In fact, the speaker actually says that he doesn't understand some features! Welcome to the club. For example, he mentions setting up keyboards but says he rarely does so and really doesn't explain the entire process. In fact, in his presentation we see his keyboard shows ""port not found"". The PDF manual is pretty good, though.I should also point out that this is the most unfriendly to third party plugins of any DAW I have used. Supposedly, the 64 bit version will only accept 64 bit plugins. I tried and could not get it to accept one(most third party plugins are 32 bit). The 32 bit version is supposed to accept only 32 bit plugins. I tried a myriad of them and could not get it to accept a single one. Compare this to the 64 bit version fo Mixcraft Pro Studio 7 which will accept both 64 and 32 bit third party plugins. In fact, it is very rare for Mixcraft to refuse a plugin. Plugins are important and this is a serious drawback of the Presonus. Now you know one reason why I prefer Mixcraft. I would say that the Presonus does offer quite a selection of instruments, loops and sounds, so how much of a drawback that is I will leave up to you. I like the ability to use plugins. As far as Ableton goes, it will accept plugins of the bit type of the Ableton version, but I have never had Ableton refuse a normal plugin. Magix also has a very good plugin system. Even LMMS is good with plugins. To make matters worse, it will not accept video formats unless you have QuckTime player, which is a problem for most Windows users. I tried loading an MP4 video and it was rejected. How many obstacles does this program present? This DAW has some nice features that a professional would like, such as nice mastering in the Project view, but I can't see serious professionals going for this, except as an adjunct to their other DAWs(as I do). I am being kind keeping this at five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26P7EG6M0SWKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XOPKPMQ#wasThisHelpful","R26P7EG6M0SWKE","A3TIL1PC2ZE97B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TIL1PC2ZE97B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This scanner certainly works very well. The only problem with it is the instruction manual. There is no explanation at all. I didn't think it was worth taking a star off for that, though. Basically, you don't have to do anything to set this up. You just plug it into your computer. It will input a character string from a UPC symbol the same way your keyboard would if you typed the character string in. So, for example, if you are at Google.com and the prompt is in the search bar, just scan a UPC symbol(you have to pull the trigger while you point at it) and the character string represented by the UPC symbol will be placed in the search bar and Google will look up the product for you. I found that Google actually does a far better job that sites labelled, ""UPC Database"". Every time I tried a UPC database, it returned that the item was not in the database. Every time I used Google, it gave the correct result. So, all you probably need is the default settings. Also, when I plugged it in, there was no setup screen or anything like that. Just nothing. It just worked. I am using Windows 10 and the driver loaded instantly; there was no noticeable load period(I was looking out for that). If you are an expert with UPC scanners, I suppose you will have no problems. If you are a beginner, as I am, you will have to do some research(like reading this and other reviews!). So, now I know a little about UPC scanners. Of course, it would be so nice if a real instruction manual was supplied written in proper English, but I suppose that is too much to ask for. After all, after spending years to develop a fine product, why bother taking a few days to find someone who speaks proper English to write a complete manual? Seems pointless.I should also mention that this will only read linear(called 1-D) UPC symbols, it won't read 2-D symbols(those funny looking ones that look like strange postage stamps).I received a complimentary sample in exchange for a fair review.

Jan Vermeulen plays the fortepiano with great sensitivity and accuracy, giving us an equally great interpretaion, blending wonderfully with the singer. He plays on a reproduction by Chris Maene of Brussels built in 2000. It has an uncharacteristically light, charming quality, midway between a piano and harpsichord, very appropriate for this kind of chamber work.

"These are really gorgeous! They look real from both far and close up. The stones are very well cut and well set. The post is off center so you can wear them either high or low(low is the usual).

Many people think cubic zirconia is just cut glass. That is not correct. Cubic zirconia is actually a mineral very similar to sapphire. In fact, jewelers tell me it is extremely difficult to determine whether a stone is sapphire or cubic zirconia(diamond is also hard to tell apart but easier to distinguish from cubic zirconia than sapphire is). It just so happens that cubic zirconia is extremely inexpensive to produce(fortunately for us!). What is important is the cut. The cut decides the beauty.

"I received the yet to be released Series III version of this to review(without cost through the Amazon Vine Program, which requires that I review it), so I thought I would share this with you. One big improvement with the Series III is Bluetooth, so that gives you an additional option. Here is the review I wrote for the Series III which otherwise is functionally the same as the Series II:****************************************************************************First of all, the quality of the sound produced by this system is amazing! It is about as good as it gets. The only improvement would be to get better stereo separation, since the left and right speakers are only as far apart as this device is wide. There are very sparse instructions in the box, only a quick start sheet that tells you to plug it in, download the app(for any type of device including desktop or laptop computers), and that you can use auxiliary input. That is all. There is also a sheet of safety precautions. But once you download the software on your computing device, it will guide you through the setup and if you click on ""Help"", it will open your browser to the complete PDF manual(all instructions are available in a wide variety of languages) and you can download the manual to your computer if you wish. There are several ways to use this system. You can just use it as computer speakers(some call them monitors) by just connecting it to your computer with a 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable(not included). This device draws 150 watts so be sure to plug it in without overloading an outlet. Another way to use it is to connect it to a Bluetooth device. Finally, you can use it with WiFi. If you connect it with WiFi, it can work without turning on any other device as long as you just use one of the six presets. To use a stored library, you must turn on the device that stores the library. This device will NOT store music libraries as a stand-alone. That is one of my criticisms of this. Why couldn't they included some gigs of storage in the SoundTouch system? Of course, you could always load a little MP4 player with a playlist and plug it into the AUX IN port with an audio cable and play a playlist that way, just showing that Bose could have done this internally by including a circuit the size of your thumbnail.  At the moment, I have all six presets set to internet radio stations. For those, the Bose doesn't need any other device other than your WiFi. Another criticism I have is why only six presets? That is very inconvenient. There should be more like a hundred at the very least. This device is pretty heavy, over 25 pounds and it isn't easy to find a place to put your hands to pick it up safely. You must be careful not to place your hand on the cloth covered front when picking it up to avoid tearing the cloth or damaging the speakers. The best way is on the bottom of the sides. It would have been nice if they had handle inserts on the sides to make this easier to pick up. Another omission seems to be setup B. They only explain setup A. I believe setup B is for smaller controlling devices such as smartphones which don't have USB A ports. In that case, you reverse the cable as used in setup A by plugging the USB A end into the Bose and the USB micro end into your smartphone. This might be explained if you download a smartphone app but it certainly isn't in the PDF manual which can also be downloaded directly from Bose.com.In summary, this is a great system with superb sound and a big price tag. Make sure this has the features you want.*************************************************UPDATE(9/13/2015): The Series lll is now available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27DDMOY5GMSQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGK89FY#wasThisHelpful","R27DDMOY5GMSQU","A3TIL1PC2ZE97B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TIL1PC2ZE97B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Of course, you could always load a little MP4 player with a playlist and plug it into the AUX IN port with an audio cable and play a playlist that way, just showing that Bose could have done this internally by including a circuit the size of your thumbnail.  At the moment, I have all six presets set to internet radio stations. For those, the Bose doesn't need any other device other than your WiFi. Another criticism I have is why only six presets? That is very inconvenient. There should be more like a hundred at the very least. This device is pretty heavy, over 25 pounds and it isn't easy to find a place to put your hands to pick it up safely. You must be careful not to place your hand on the cloth covered front when picking it up to avoid tearing the cloth or damaging the speakers. The best way is on the bottom of the sides. It would have been nice if they had handle inserts on the sides to make this easier to pick up. Another omission seems to be setup B. They only explain setup A. I believe setup B is for smaller controlling devices such as smartphones which don't have USB A ports. In that case, you reverse the cable as used in setup A by plugging the USB A end into the Bose and the USB micro end into your smartphone. This might be explained if you download a smartphone app but it certainly isn't in the PDF manual which can also be downloaded directly from Bose.com.In summary, this is a great system with superb sound and a big price tag. Make sure this has the features you want.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ITC0ZRWMMZQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IKGT46#wasThisHelpful","R2ITC0ZRWMMZQF","A3TIL1PC2ZE97B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TIL1PC2ZE97B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are great, super soft, almost silky, lightweight blankets(they are lightweight as far as blankets go, but heavy as far as general fabrics go). They are also larger than the average baby blanket. These are made from 70% bamboo viscose rayon and 30% cotton. What is bamboo viscose rayon, you ask? It is a type of rayon where bamboo is treated so it dissolves in a chemical solution and then spun into fibers as it solidifies out of solution. That process produces very silky material and bamboo is noted for producing very silky cloth from this process.(Some have complained that it is deceiving to connect this to bamboo since it is so highly processed, but the truth is, it certainly can come from bamboo, so reach your own conclusions.) Is viscose rayon safe for babies? There are differing opinions on this, so I can't tell you it is completely safe. Personally, I would say it is safe ""enough"". Of course, you can use these for many things other than baby blankets. I am sure you can think of some uses. As far as swaddling babies goes, there are differing opinions on the safety of that process but I am firmly against it. Infants need to explore their limbs and the space they move through for their proper muscular and neurological development. You can use these as baby blankets but to use them as baby straight jackets(that is what swaddling is, in case you didn't know) is not advised. These are very well made in China(the bamboo should have been a clue!).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1739805VEA6JQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0100O7R1K#wasThisHelpful","R1739805VEA6JQ","A3TIL1PC2ZE97B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TIL1PC2ZE97B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reynolds Wrap has been the aluminum foil of choice in my house for decades. With that in mind I decided to give these new Grill and Oven Bags a try. After trying them I am a bit underwhelmed.In the ""olden days"" to cook in foil you laid out a sheet of Reynolds Wrap, arranged your food, folded up the sides, then folded over the edges to form a pouch. Sometimes you may have to spray the foil with Pam first, but that's not particularly hard to do. The pouch then went in the oven or onto the grill.Now we have these ready-made pouches. First of all, they are somewhat small (10"" x 15.5"") and are flat. Since they're not pleaded, and don't expand much when you open them, your limited as to the thickness of things that you can put in them. Since they are a bag you fill them (obviously) by sliding the food into the bag through a side opening. That means if you want your fish fillets to come out looking like the picture on the front of the package, with your veggies neatly arranged on the top, it probably won't happen, especially if you have to tip the bag up and add a quarter of a cup of liquid.The size of the bags limits the amount of food you can cook at a time. Another oddity is the instructions that advise you to add ""a tablespoon of flour to protect against bursting."" Huh?The foil seems thicker than even the heavy-duty Reynolds Wrap, but two layers of foil would accomplish the same thing using the ""old-fashioned"" method.As expected, using the bags is not as economical as using plain foil. At the time of this writing the cost about $1.20 apiece when purchased here on Amazon.The Bottom LineFor me, there's not enough new and different here to justify the extra expense of these bags over traditional aluminum foil. After trying these I'm convinced the old-fashioned way still works better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L6T9Y3LXZJRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K1GTH02#wasThisHelpful","R1L6T9Y3LXZJRN","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am always amazed by the reviewers who will evaluate snack items as though they were part of a ""healthy diet,"" and the snack is vilified because it contains ""unhealthy"" ingredients. These, along with other snack items, when enjoyed occasionally and in moderation aren't going to hurt you any.Now for the prerequisite ingredients check of these snack chips. Nothing strange or unusual or unpronounceable here. Other than the (expected) fairly high sodium levels these aren't all that bad for you.This is a two layered snack chip with a rice layer and a seaweed layer. As expected, the rice doesn't add any flavor. The predominant flavor is, as you might expect, seaweed. If you don't like seaweed you won't like these crackers. They have a nice crisp snap when you bite into them and are crunchy when you chew them. They taste like seaweed with a slightly salty flavor. Overall, I like to flavor and the texture. What's missing, however, is an indescribable ""crunch satisfaction"" that I get when I eat a more substantial snack such as a corn chip or snack cracker. My mother used to describe this sensation as, ""like eating the south wind.""Even though the sample I received was well past the ""Best By"" date of June 15, 2015, the crisps were still crispy, crunchy, and delicious.The Bottom LineThese are crispy, salty, if somewhat insubstantial snacks. If you like seaweed you probably like these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ6BLGDZBF9MW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBGKJV6#wasThisHelpful","RQ6BLGDZBF9MW","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like most of the reviewers here, the candy in this selection goes back to my childhood — Hershey's milk chocolate bars, Reese's peanut butter cups, Kit Kat bars, and Almond Joy (when they were made by Peter Paul). These miniature bars are the perfect size for a quick afternoon snack.Normally when I review a food item I carefully scrutinize the ingredients and comment on them. Not so with this assortment. It's candy. I don't expect any healthy ingredients and I really don't care what they're made of. And these are small enough that there is not much room for calories.While some reviewers had problems with the packaging, the bars in my selection were not squashed, melted, broken, or smooshed. The bars that I have opened so far have been perfect. I like the way the box opens up so you can all grab a couple of bars. This would be a good package to put on the receptionist's desk so your clients can enjoy a small treat while they're waiting their turn.I find it hilarious that the Hershey bar is actually divided into four parts. Nits to pick? Okay, there's no Hershey with almonds, and no Mounds bars. Other than that, what's not to like?The Bottom LineIt's hard to go wrong with this assortment of favorites, and the size of each bar is just right for a quick chocolate fix. If you like Hershey products, this is a good choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M8CFVFD31SCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CFGPQI#wasThisHelpful","R3M8CFVFD31SCP","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the reasons I like my Keurig so much is that I can avail myself to a wide variety of blends and have a different blend every day if I so choose. It also gives me the chance to try new blends such as this one offered by Vine.A quick check of Café Diario's website reveals that they are a Mexican brand that only recently began marketing in the Houston, Texas area, where they serve both the commercial and retail markets. This Classic Blend appears to be their primary product, and is available in several retail formats. Since the K cups don't appear on the website, I'm assuming this is a new format for them.The website advertises a ""Fair Trade"" logo, but there no further mention of Fair Trade compliance on their website. Normally when a company purchases their coffee to ""Fair Trade"" standards it is prominently mentioned and used as a selling point. Likewise, there is no mention of ""Fair Trade"" compliance on the packaging I received.The capsules are standard K cup design (as opposed to the open mesh style cups) which the company states are Keurig 2.0 compatible. I couldn't verify this, as I have a 1.0 machine. All the capsules pierced cleanly and brewed properly.We first tried this coffee using an 8 ounce cup. While brewing there was no discernible aroma, and very little aroma in the cup after brewing.With sugar and half-and-half, my cup was ""okay"" but it seemed to lack the body that I like in a cup of coffee. The flavor was okay but nothing exceptional. It's very mIuch like the coffee I get at a good diner. There were no harsh, off, or bitter flavors, and there was no unpleasant aftertaste either.Drunk black, as Mrs. Boilermate does, the assessment was similar. Her comment was, ""It's okay, nothing special."" She said this might be something she would drink at work.Brewed with 6 ounces of water the body was improved some, as was the flavor, but not by much.At the time this review is being written this product is being offered as an Amazon Add-On for about six bucks for a box of 12 cups. At $.50 a cup they are priced at the lower end of the scale, and about right in our opinion.The Bottom LineTo us this coffee tastes like just what it is — standard supermarket or diner coffee. That's not a bad thing, but it's nothing special either. We have gotten used to the richer blends that are regularly available, and while we were pleased to have had the opportunity to try this coffee, it's unlikely to be added to our rotation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS6FSEMOH6MLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WSEGZYG#wasThisHelpful","RS6FSEMOH6MLD","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These bags showed up in my Vine queue at just the right time. Less than an hour earlier, Mrs. Boilermate said to me, ""Put tall kitchen trash bags on the shopping list."" While neither of us is particularly keen on adding extra scents to our environment and our trash goes out often enough so odor is seldom an issue, we decided to give these a try. Besides, as Mrs. Boilermate said, ""We can always use them for the cat litter.""The Sniff TestI was expecting a fairly strong fragrance when we opened the box and from each bag. However, even held right up to my nose I could barely discern a fragrance, and Mrs. Boilermate said the same. In our opinion, this was a good thing.In UseAs expected, these fit our tall kitchen wastebasket perfectly. We really like the drawstring closure which makes it quick and easy to cinch up the bag for disposal in the outside trash bin. As I noted above, it's hard to tell how much ""odor blocking"" we get because we change the bag soon after we put something potentially stinky in it.As with their other bags, these Hefty bags are sufficiently strong to handle anything we can throw at them. I can't remember the last time we had a Hefty bag split or leak. That includes at least 20 pounds of ""used"" cat litter.ValueWhile they are slightly more expensive on a per bag basis then ""non-odor blocking"" bags, compared to other brands of odor blocking bags, the price is competitive in Prime Pantry, where these bags are listed.The Bottom LineHefty is one of our trusted names in trash bags, and these bags do nothing to sully that reputation. They will continue to be one of the two or three brands that we buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W0UKG6Y53XGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OBHEBM6#wasThisHelpful","R2W0UKG6Y53XGG","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using power strips for a variety of reasons for decades. Just like most medications, they are safe when used as directed. If you don't try to overload them they are perfectly safe.This particular power strip appears to be well made with a sturdy metal cover, built in 15 amp circuit breaker, and sliding covers over the outlets. However, it only has a 3 foot power cord that does not have a right angle plug. The back of the power strip is key-holed to allow for wall mounting with your flathead screws. (Most power strips I have ever purchased came with mounting holes but none came with mounting screws. This is not a complaint, but a comment to the reviewers who complained that mounting screws were not included.)When it comes to surge protection, bigger is always better. This power strip provides 1000 joules of protection which even the back of the box tells you isn't that much more than ""basic protection."" I'm not connecting anything too sensitive to this power strip.UsageThis power strip would be good in a workshop or garage (as depicted on the front of the packaging) where you could plug it into a bench height outlet to expand your available outlets. This would be particularly good for plugging in those countless battery chargers for all those handy battery-powered tools we have, none of which use the same battery.The Bottom LineThis is a sturdy power strip with a built-in circuit breaker and built-in surge protection. However, the surge protection rating is fairly low and the power cord is fairly short. I expect it to find a home on the workbench of my workshop.If I were buying a power strip today, however, this would not be my choice. While this power strip works as designed, in my opinion it is not a very good value for your money. Here on Amazon you can buy several models of power strips with a higher surge rating, more outlets, and varying combinations of the following: USB connections, telephone/fax connections, and coaxial cable connections. Most come with longer cords (some with right angle plugs) all for the same or less money. And even better protection is only a few dollars more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTJD7IOM77R5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHMN6U#wasThisHelpful","RTJD7IOM77R5R","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike most of my food reviews, I did not read either the ingredients nor the nutritional information before trying the product, or even after. It's candy. I don't really care what it's made of. I don't expect any wholesome ingredients or any redeeming social value whatsoever. So, let's eat!These were just what I expected from a chocolate covered caramel, perhaps even a bit better than expected. Make no mistake about it, these are not gourmet chocolates. They're just plain decent tasting supermarket/drugstore confectioneries. The chocolate tastes like the milk chocolate I have come to expect from Hershey's and the caramel interior is smooth and creamy. In fact it was a lot softer than I expected. I was expecting more of the hard caramel. Sometimes when I have milk chocolate or caramel there is a harsh aftertaste in the back of my mouth. Not so with these caramels. Overall this is a fine product.Unlike some of the reviewers, my chocolate covered caramels were fresh (exp. June 2016) and undamaged. Not a single squished candy in the bag.The only complaint I have is with the packaging. Not only did I have to cut the nuclear safe bag open with scissors, but I also needed scissors to cut the individual wrappers open. The thick plastic wrapping on each piece had no notches or anything on the ends to allow for easy opening. Maybe that's what is needed to ensure they arrive safely from Mexico. Preppers will appreciate the disaster proof packaging.The Bottom LineThese are delicious sweet treat I would indulge in on occasion. While I wouldn't buy them from Amazon (I don't need 15 bags of these to tempt me.)

"I'm a sucker for new razors and electric shavers. Over the years Vine has offered me Remington, Norelco, and Panasonic electric shavers. I've also been offered the original Gillette Fusion Proglide, King of Shaves, and the Gillette Fusion Proglide Flexballl razors. And I have grabbed them all. So when Vine offered these new BIC Flex 3 razors, how could I resist?I have also learned from these trials. When used for shaving cream, the Norelco shaves as close as a blade, and the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide really is the best razor on the market, price not withstanding.So, how do these new BIC razors stack up?Once I broke into the nuclear safe packaging and extracted one of the razors I was surprised by how lightweight it was. Compared to the Gillette and my Schick Quattro Pro razors, this one is not only lighter but the handle his about an inch shorter. The handle is smooth plastic with grippy over mold to make handling easier. The shaving head (the bit that holds the blades) is about the same size as other three blade razors.The GoodI like the little slide on cover that each razor has. This makes it easy to toss one of these into your shaving kit for an overnight stay away from home.For my first shave I lather up with my trusty badger brush and my favorite Musgo Real shaving cream. While lightweight, the handle is well shaped and the grippy over mold is in the right places. The shorter handle is not an issue. Maneuvering is easy and I can get into the tight places like under my nose. While not ""Gillette smooth"" the first shave is acceptable. My face definitely knew the difference, however, and a soothing after shave was a must.The BadThe very first thing I notice is, unlike other multi-blade razors, shaving cream does not pass through the spaces between the blades, but clogs them up. This razor is extremely hard to clean. While the back of the razor is fairly open it does not ""back flush"" when you try to flush it with water from behind.By the third shave I'm already noticing a lot of ""pull"" and ""drag"" with this razor.As with any disposable razor, there is considerably more waste from one of these as opposed to a single disposable cartridge for any razor of any brand. To me that's a big issue.The Wife TestIf you read my other razor/saver reviews, you will see that The Wife Test is an important part of any evaluation of a new shaving product. I shaved half my face with this BIC razor, and the other half with the Gillette razor with a cartridge that had been used about three times. When Mrs. Boilermate compared the two sides, the Gillette side was deemed smoother every time, and considered to be ""less scritchy"" two days later.ValueAs I write this, these razors cost about $1.25 each (in a package of eight) here on Amazon. By comparison, a Gillette Fusion Pro Glide cartridge will set you back between three and four dollars each, depending on the size of the package and how lucky you are to find a sale. So these are clearly a less expensive option.ConclusionCompared to the Pro Glide, these razors cost considerably less. The quality of the shave is acceptable but not up to the Gillette standard I have gotten used to. I don't expect to get more than 4 or 5 shaves out of each one, and then I have to toss the whole razor, which is a considerable waste. Also. it clogs easily and is difficult to clean. While I don't hate the BIC Flex 3, I don't like it enough to make it my everyday razor. But if I was away from home without a razor there is a good chance I would choose one of these to ""tide me over"" until I got home.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SZMREJ5JYJCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VBUYGAI#wasThisHelpful","R2SZMREJ5JYJCA","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I first purchased this peanut butter alternative because it was more reasonably priced than those made with sunflower seeds, almonds, cashews, etc.The label says, ""Tastes just like peanut butter"" and many of the reviewers here have agreed. Always the contrarian, I will respectfully disagree with that assessment. I did a side-by-side comparison between Wow Butter and Jif creamy peanut butter, and while I like Wow Butter, there are distinct differences. First of all Wow Butter has a slightly thicker and drier consistency, as well as a slightly grainy mouth feel. While the taste is somewhat reminiscent of peanut butter, there is a distinct roasted soybean flavor particularly at the front end. That is not a bad thing, however. While I like the flavor and consistency of Wow Butter, Mrs. Boilermate doesn't care for it.I also compared this product side-by-side with our other peanut butter alternative, SunButter. As I noted in my review of SunButter, compared to peanut butter, SunButter has a thinner, runnier consistency but has the same smooth mouth feel as peanut butter. This assessment applies to Wow Butter vs SunButter as well.The Bottom LineI like WowButter and will put it into my rotation.

All the bulbs I found prior to this had such a low light output that they were virtually worthless.These bulbs look like a conventional night light bulb and are just as bright.

"I am generally not in favor of unitaskers, but sometimes a dedicated gadget can make a potentially messy job faster and neater. This is one of those gadgets.We purchased this pitter to process 3 pounds of fresh cherries. Working as a team, Mrs. Boilermate removed the stem and placed the cherry, stem end up in the pitter that I held over a stainless steel bowl. I pushed out the pit into the bowl, and dumped the pitted cherry into another bowl. We had all 3 pounds of cherries pitted in about 20 minutes. There were no missed pits or mashed cherries and no fingers permanently stained red.This pitter was comfortable to hold and use, and the action was smooth. The little shield around the bottom of it contained what little juice squirted out during the pitting process and there was no mess on the surrounding counter.While you can put this in the dishwasher, I just went ahead and washed it by hand. The little shield twists off and cleans easily with a bottle brush. I like the fact that it has a lock to keep it closed for when we stash it in the junk drawer.If you do larger amounts or pit more often it may be worthwhile to spring for a higher volume pitter such as this one. But for the occasional job, this OXO pitter is fast, neat, and easy.If you only have a small amount of olives or cherries to pit this is the gadget to buy!

"I've been a fan of the Obus Forme back support for years, and have relied on it to give me rigid back support in my recliner. But I also need lumbar support, and the only thing I didn't like about the original version was that the lumbar support was a small separate pillow that stuck on the back with Velcro. I never could get that small pillow positioned correctly so it provided any support.The adjustable pneumatic inflatable lumbar support is the perfect addition to the original Obus Forme. The lumbar support adjusts easily and then stays in place once it's adjusted. It inflates with a small hand bulb that is then stored in a little pocket on the side of the back support. I've had this one for about two months and the lumbar support has not leaked out any air.This support is about 18 inches at its widest and narrows to about 12 inches at the top. That may not seem like much, but I'm one of those full figured guys and I have no problem getting comfortable using this.The Bottom LineIf you need a good solid portable back support you can't go wrong with this one. Yes, it's a bit pricey but, as they say, ""You get what you pay for."" The first one I bought lasted almost 20 years, and I expect a similar lifespan out of this one.

"About 20 years ago I decided to convert my kitties from run-of-the-mill store-bought dry cat food to a healthier brand. I tried them all: Iams, Science Diet, Eukanuba, Nutro, and Royal Canin. Of all the brands, Nutro was the only one that they would eat, and that's what I have fed my kitties ever since. I immediately noticed a reduction in the waste in the litter box, so at least some of the claims were accurate.In the intervening years more ""healthy"" brands have hit the market, but Nutro has kept 10 kitties healthy and happy in those years. At this time we have a 10-year-old male, a three-year-old female and a two-year-old female. Their normal kibble is NUTRO MAX CAT Indoor Adult Roasted Chicken Flavor nuggets, which is dispensed in an automatic feeder, so they can eat anytime of the day or night.With that in mind, I was pleased to have the opportunity to try this cereal free variety of Nutro. To test it, we placed a bowl full of this food next to their feeder and kept an eye on it. Given the choice, all three kitties eat from the bowl with this new variety first, and only ate their normal variety when this bowl was empty.This food is made in little rabbit turd sized pallets, as opposed to an extruded shape of their regular diet. This also seems to make a difference. With the regular food, when they crunch it about half that turns into crumbs that they leave in the bottom of the bowl, only eating it when there's nothing else left. With the small round shape of this test food they seem to be able to eat it all without making any crumbs.With three kitties, including an 18 pound male, cost has to be factored in when selecting a cat food brand or flavor. At the time of this writing, a large bag (16 pound) of the Indoor Adult Formula is about $25 here on Amazon. A large bag (only 14 pounds) of this cereal free variety cost $38. That's enough of a difference for us to keep using this as our regular variety.The Bottom LineThis is a first rate premium brand cat food that all three of my kitties like, to the point of choosing it over their regular brand. But at this time it cost almost a third more than what were feeding them now. If cost is not an issue for you, I highly recommend this variety.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YT2GNA847FII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZI3QEU#wasThisHelpful","R2YT2GNA847FII","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the 8 oz. sized bottles.These sounded like a good idea when I asked the Birthday Chicken to lay these on me: Refillable food safe spray bottles that didn't have to be pumped in order to spray. Well, the BC came through, and now that I have use of them for almost 6 months I must say am a bit underwhelmed.The GoodThe bottles themselves are nice design and a good size. The round shape means that they stay put and don't fall over like the Misto pump style sprayer that only lasted a little more than a year. The short height means the bottles fit well on the shelf near the stove and are comfortable to hold and use.The dip tube is long enough so it bends to the outer edge of the bottle. This means you can position it so that it will spray as the contents get low even with the bottle tilted. I have yet to have either sprayer clog, which is more than I can say about the Misto.The Not So GoodIts usefulness is a lot more limited than I anticipated. The sprayer does not spray a mist, only a course wide fan shaped spray. You can adjust it so the fan is vertical or horizontal, but it's still a wide fan shaped spray. To get that fan shaped spray you need a fairly strong pull on the trigger giving you a forceful spray. Pulling more gently does not get you a narrower fan shaped spray, but a stream.While the course wide spray is fine for spraying a grill or a large frying pan, it is really easy to over spray a smaller frying pan. Holding it closer to a smaller pan doesn't really work either. Because you have to pull so hard on the trigger to get the fan spray, the force of the spray will cause more of the oil to splash out of the pan. This really needs a softer spring.If you're used to using Pam or similar aerosol spray on a baking pan, this bottle is not for you. The spray is too course and too wide to be effective.The UglyAs for cleaning, their website [www (dot) evooilsprayers (dot) com (slash) about] says: ""Cleaning the Evo Oil Sprayer is quick and easy. The bottle section can either be rinsed with water or put into the dishwasher."" Well, technically they are correct. The bottle can be put in the dishwasher, but what they don't tell you is the bottle will shrink, even without heated dry. See the attached pictures. It's a good thing these come in packs of two. I sent a message to the company via their website but haven't heard back yet.The Bottom LineThis is a great idea that needs better execution. The wide fan shaped spray is useful for some things but a fine spray option would really be welcomed. Since it comes in a pack of two, why not one course and one fine? I also don't have a problem with handwashing the bottles, but don't advertise them is dishwasher safe when they obviously are not.I'll continue to use the one good bottle I have, but am still searching for spray bottle nirvana.Update 8/16/15Shortly after posting this review, I received an email from Seth at Evo/Delta Sprayers. After exchanging a couple of emails a replacement bottle was quickly mailed to me, and it arrived a couple of days ago.I also mentioned my concerns about the course spray and the spray pattern. He was receptive to my comments and indicated he would pass them on to the appropriate personnel.So 5*'s for Customer Service.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M21DAKYN6Z9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FMXG8XI#wasThisHelpful","R3M21DAKYN6Z9Q","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was my first experience with Boost, and I have to say I was not disappointed. The cocoa flavor is not bad, but it will never be mistaken for milk or dark chocolate. The consistency, as expected, was smooth and fairly thick but not unpleasant. It was neither chalky nor ""grainy."" Mrs. Boilermate said she detected a slightly metallic aftertaste, but I detected no aftertaste at all. Another reviewer said they detected a Sucralose aftertaste, which is odd, because there is none in Boost Compact.I didn't expect to feel any ""boost"" after drinking this (sorry, it was there… I had to use it) so I wasn't disappointed when I didn't get any. But there were no negative affects either. I do like the extra vitamins and minerals I get in a short shot.Overall, Mrs. Boilermate and I think Boost is a good way to get some extra nourishment in a reasonably good tasting format.A note about the packaging: I try to recycle my empties as much as possible. My county currently accepts plastic containers labeled ""1,"" ""2,"" and ""5."" These bottles are ""7"" (""Other"") and therefore must be tossed in the trash. I would prefer a product in packaging that I can recycle.A note about Customer Service: I called Customer Service with my concerns about bottles that could not be recycled. The lady I spoke with was professional and polite, said she understood my concerns, and would pass my concerns onto management. Though I wasn't looking for anything (scoring coupons, free samples, etc.) I was somewhat surprised that they weren't offered. Neither did she ask my name"" for their records.""(Neither of these affected my rating of the product.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JGRG2XMO7NQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5IYX0S#wasThisHelpful","R3JGRG2XMO7NQF","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used a FoodSaver in one form or another for the better part of 30 years. I prefer the horizontal (clamshell) style models as opposed to the vertical models with the slot you stick the bag into to seal it. I currently use a FoodSaver V2860 that I like so well that, even though it was working fine, when Bed Bath and beyond had a special deal on a V2860 I grabbed it to I would have a spare in the event this one died.With that in mind, I jumped at the chance to try this new top-of-the-line model. I like the idea of using wider (15 inch) rolls and having the ability to do multiple seals. I don't hunt or fish, but I use it often enough that I appreciate the added features.The first thing you discover about this FoodSaver Gamesaver Titanium is how huge it is. At 26 inches wide and 12 inches deep it takes up quite a bit of counter space. You also notice right away how heavy it is. I didn't weigh it, but it's got to be right around 20 pounds or so. Everything about it feels heavy duty. It has big rubberized vacuum and seal only buttons, as well as a big sturdy latch on the front. Though it doesn't show it in the pictures on the Amazon product page, there is also a smaller button to toggle between single seal and double seal mode. Unlike some of the new upright models, the accessory vacuum hose is not permanently attached. The lid is also large and heavy.As with many FoodSavers, it has a compartment to hold a roll of bag material. The bag cutter is built into the lid, as opposed to being on a separate piece under the lid like on my V2860. There are advantages to both arrangements. It's a little easier to gauge and cut the bags with the cutter underneath, but this definitely requires two hands. With the Gamesaver, the heavy lid with the built-in cutter makes for easy one handed cutting.As with all horizontal style FoodSavers, you can make bags with the bottom seal is close to the edge as you want.This unit is not only longer and wider than my V2860, it's also a huge step up from the counter to the sealing edge, approximately 3 inches. Unless you put something in front of the machine such as a thick book or a piece of scrap lumber you will need about 6 inches of extra material between what you're sealing and the end of the bag. If you do put something in front to elevate the bags you'll find you'll need about 2 1/8 inches between the end of the bag and the seal plus another inch or so between the seal and the product you are sealing. This compares favorably with my V2860, and considerably less ""tail"" on either end then you would get from some of the vertical models.It takes a fairly firm push on the latch to lock the machine for vacuuming, but the latch feels substantial. (It also has a ""store"" position to lightly latch the top so you can store the unit standing on its edge.) A touch of the big black ""vac and seal"" button and it quickly vacuums the bag. It also has a nifty little LED ""progress meter"" next to the buttons. I don't think it's any noisier than my current unit. This unit has an internal fan that runs continuously when the unit is plugged in. Like most FoodSavers, there is no on-off switch, so you have to unplug it between uses. The instructions warn you not to leave it plugged in all the time.By having two sealing strips the machine alternates between them, which allows you to do multiple seals without having to wait for the machine to cool down. Okay, waiting 20 seconds between seals isn't big deal, but it's still a nice touch. I also like the option of having the machine do a double seal, though the instructions advise against doing it continually. I did several consecutive seals just to try it out, and it worked as advertised.As with many of the current FoodSaver models, the tray inside the vacuum channel removes for easy washing. Unlike the Silver model, it does not have a 12 V power option.A quick (OT) note about the bags: While there are less expensive alternatives to using FoodSaver brand bags and bag material, it is been my experience that using FoodSaver brand is cheaper in the long run. I have never had a FoodSaver brand bag fail to vacuum properly. The same cannot be said for other brands. I have had particularly bad experiences with the WM brand rolls.The Bottom LineThis is a very good machine, and feels every bit like the top-of-the-line model that it is. It vacuums quickly, seals well, and accommodates wider bags than any other model. The limited lifetime warranty is an advantage.But at the time of this review, it is 2 ½ times the price of the ""Silver"" model. So, is it worth it? The answer is a definitive, ""It depends."" There is definitely added value to this model. Dual pumps, two heating strips, double seal capability, and wider bags all have advantages. These added features may make it a worthwhile investment if you do a lot of hunting and/or fishing, or butcher your own animals. But this unit is also considerably larger and heavier than any other FoodSaver model. For the average homeowner this could be an issue (counterspace during use and storage space). If I were spending my own money on a replacement for my V2860, I would probably opt for the Silver model over this one, which also has a limited lifetime warranty. That said, this is still a five-star machine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D3WYWE5UOBRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARW34TA#wasThisHelpful","R3D3WYWE5UOBRN","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mrs. Boilermate and I evaluated Cafejo's Signature Blend K cups.While the coffee was brewing there was a nice coffee aroma in the room, and there was a nice aroma from the finished cup. As this was listed as a ""medium roast"" we brewed 6 ounce and 8 ounce cups. Though the coffee is listed as a ""medium roast,"" we both thought it was more toward the ""light roast"" end of the ""medium roast"" scale.I like a fuller bodied cup of coffee, and when brewed with 6 ounces of water this blend met my expectations. Mrs. Boilermate also thought it made a fine cup of coffee with 6 ounces of water. When brewed with 8 ounces of water, however, we both felt it lost enough body and tasted a bit watered down — especially when I added half-and-half to mine. (Mrs. Boilermate drinks hers black.) Hence the four-star rating. (Actually 4.5.) My Keurig Brewer allows for a 10 ounce cup as well, but 10 ounces of water would be too much for this particular blend.Though not as economical, we often enjoy a medium roast blend by making two 6-ounce cups in one 12 ounce mug, using two capsules. While (for some reason) some blends don't translate well from one capsule per 6 ounces to two capsules per 12 ounces, this coffee is perfect for this method.Neither one of us detected any harsh, bitter, or off flavors, neither did we detect any nasty aftertastes.In general, I don't care for cold coffee. And cold coffee re-warmed is about as bad as it gets. As a testament to the smoothness of this blend, I accidentally let a cup get cold when I forgot to turn on my little mug warmer on my desk. Without realizing it had gotten cold I took a big swig and it was still palatable. I bet this would make a fine iced coffee.As the title says, this is a coffee we could enjoy every day. We are pleased to have had the opportunity to test this coffee through Vine, and I expect this blend to be added to our rotation. The packages we received are not Keurig 2.0 compatible, but that just means more for the rest of us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WEYTGUGT3CJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OXY1R10#wasThisHelpful","R1WEYTGUGT3CJT","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like the idea of using products that are ""natural"" and/or contain recycled content, but often times these products range from ""almost as good"" to downright awful. This is not one of those products. You don't have to sacrifice quality, as these sponges are every bit as good as their ""unnatural"" counterparts.Just like its ""unnatural"" counterparts, this two-sided sponge/scrubby cleans well and doesn't scratch. It absorbs well and easily rinses clean. It feels like it's a bit denser and stiffer than the conventional product but that is not a drawback in my opinion. Both products seem to have equal longevity.Another nice surprise was the price. Oftentimes natural products or those containing recycled content are sold at a premium compared to conventional products. Not so with these. They are priced competitively, and in some cases priced less than the equivalent ""conventional"" Scotch Bright products.So why only four stars? Out of the package the sponges have a decidedly ""industrial"" aroma to them, and that aroma hangs around for quite a while after the sponge has been in use.

"Our household has two vehicles, a 2011 Kia Soul and a 2005 Chevrolet Colorado. I selected a 20 inch blade and a 22 inch blade for evaluation, to put one on each vehicle for a side-by-side comparison with the wipers already installed.I've been using Bosch Icon wiper blades for about 10 years, so I'm already partial to the Bosch brand. These did not disappoint. Installation was super simple and super easy, and and the blades contact the windshield perfectly.The recent rainy weather provided an ample trial period. The new blades wipe well, but as they say, ""the new broom sweeps clean."" Longevity is always a question with wiper blades, but other Bosch blades I have used lasted well. The blades installed on both vehicles remained in contact with the windshield ""at speed.""Since other Bosch products I have used lasted well, I have the expectation that these will too, hence the five-star rating. If anything changes I will update this review and the rating accordingly.The Bottom LineBosch wiper blades are priced at the ""premium"" end of the market but as they say, ""You get what you pay for.""

"In my opinion, the purpose of a shower is to remove odors, not exchange one odor for another. As such,  I normally don't like personal care products with any kind of a lingering fragrance, but the description of the fragrance for this hair and body wash was intriguing, which is why I selected it from my Vine list. I was not disappointed.Though this product is described as a body wash and shampoo I only used it as a body wash. It dispenses from the bottle as a clear thick liquid, but not as thick as a gel. If you're used to lots of lather from your body wash or shower gel you might be disappointed, as it doesn't really lather. Despite the lack of a noticeable lather, however, it does clean well and doesn't dry out the skin.Though I'm not good at describing fragrances, I can say that this product has a nice masculine fragrance that is not overpowering. Some ""men's care products"" that I've used have a post-rinse fragrance that is so powerful it announces to the whole world, ""HE'S JUST AROUND THE CORNER!"" This is not one of those products. What remains after you've rinsed this off is pleasantly subtle. Mrs. Boilermate liked the fragrance as well.The Bottom LineDoes this ""high end"" shampoo/body wash work any better than ""ordinary"" products? Not really, but it has a sophisticated masculine fragrance that both Mrs. Boilermate and I like. I have tried other ""men's care products"" and promptly discarded them after one use due to their lingering fragrance/odor after they were rinsed off. This one is different.

"Some things are pretty basic, like body wash, shampoo, and deodorant. So how do you differentiate your products from everyone else's?The body wash: The marketing hype says, ""Dove Men+Care Extra Fresh Body and Face Wash with MICROMOISTURE technology is clinically proven to fight skin dryness better than regular men’s body wash. This ultra-light formula delivers extra refreshment with a cooling agent, then rinses off easily for total skin comfort."" I'm not sure what any of that means but for a body wash it was generally better than most I've used. I like the consistency, the way it lathered, and the way it completely rinsed. I didn't notice any difference in ""skin dryness"" after using this body wash. The fragrance in the body wash does tend to linger after you get out of the shower, a feature that I do not care for.The shampoo: Of all the products in this package, the shampoo would make the biggest difference. I don't particularly care for two in one haircare products because I really don't need the conditioner aspect. Having said that, I didn't deduct points for the combination. While it seemed to clean quite well, it did dry my scalp, which is not a good thing. Caffeine in my shampoo? It seems like more of a gimmick than anything else as it didn't seem to make any difference in the final outcome. When all was said and done, however, I did not see any difference between hair washed with this product versus my normal shampoo. Mrs. Boilermate didn't notice any difference either.The deodorant: This is the product that I'm least likely to use on a daily basis. I normally prefer a roll-on deodorant and normally don't care for a stick type deodorant. Having said that, consistency of this stick is better than many have tried and goes on smoothly. What I don't care for, however, is the fragrance. Based on how long the fragrance lingered, though, I would tend to believe that the ""48 hour protection"" claim.The Bottom Line: Neither the body wash or the deodorant seem to work any better (or worse) than the products that I use on a daily basis. What seems to differentiate these daily care products is there fragrance, and that fragrance, in the deodorant particularly, lingered far too long. The shampoo/conditioner didn't seem to make any difference on my hair but left my scalp dry.When I exit the bathroom following my morning routine I don't want to smell like anything. For me, the purpose of showering, shampooing, etc. is to remove dirt and odors, and not simply replace one odor with another. I don't mind a bit of fragrance while using the shampoo or body wash, but I want that fragrance to wash off when I rinse off. The lingering fragrance of these products is enough to cause me to pass them by, particularly the deodorant.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10B8VF2AQQUSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K58PKV6#wasThisHelpful","R10B8VF2AQQUSI","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fabric oven mitts, while fairly flexible, don't protect well against steam burns. Silicone mitts protect against steam burns but are often inflexible and slippery. Enter this new oven mitt from All Clad Textiles, which tries to take the benefits of each and eliminate the drawbacks of each.I have large hands, so when putting the glove on it is a tight squeeze at the glove/cuff line, but once on its fairly comfortable. But even with my large hands the ""mitt"" part still seems a bit big and uncontrollable The cuff protects my arm almost all the way to the elbow.While loop handles on pots were difficult to grasp, I was surprised at how easily I was able to grasp and control the thin, long handle on this Cuisinart Skillet. (But this handle normally stays cool and doesn't require a potholder or mitt.)  For me, this All Clad mitt better suited for taking a roasting pan or baking sheet out of the oven.While it won't be the first mitt I reach for when I need protection from a hot pot or pan, it will always have a place in my kitchen.Mrs. Boilermate's Comments:This is a good, sturdy, well-insulated oven mitt. It protects the hand and forearm quite well. The strips of silicone make it easy to grip and hold on to hot items.One disadvantage is that it comes in one size. This may fit many, but it was too small for Mr. Boilermate and a little too big for me. With the mitt being a little larger than my hand and the heavy padding, it is difficult to get a solid grip on smaller, more delicate items.

"The Smoky Applewood BBQ Chicken variety of McCormick Skillet Sauce is a fairly quick and easy way to make a barbecue flavored chicken dish.First of all, I reviewed the ingredients list and nutrition panel. While I am not a believer of the ""HFCS Will Be the Death of Us All"" fear mongering, I do note that it is second on the ingredients list, with water being the first. The rest of the ingredients are fairly typical for barbecue sauce, and indeed, tasted directly out of the pouch the sauce tastes like a thin sweet barbecue sauce. A standardized ""serving"" will give you 8 grams of sugar and 320 mg of sodium (13% RDA).Preparation couldn't be easier: a pound and a half of browned boneless chicken breasts or thighs, with or without onions as you desire, and simmered with a packet of the sauce until hot. There is also a slow cooker preparation method.I prepared it with a pound and a half of skinless boneless chicken breasts. After sautéing some diced onion and green pepper, I browned chicken breasts as directed, poured in the pouch of sauce, covered, and simmered until everything heated through. I served the chicken with rice and spooning some of the sauce over each.The resulting supper was judged to be ""just okay"" by both Mrs. Boilermate and me. There were no strange, unpleasant, or offputting flavors in the sauce before or after heating, and there were no unpleasant aftertastes.But how does it compare to a similar dish using regular bottled barbecue sauce instead of this product? First off, we both thought the sauce was a little too sweet and lacked the ""punch"" of our two favorite barbecue sauces, Bone Suckin BBQ Sauce and Dinosaur Bar-B-Que Original Sensuous Slathering BBQ Sauce. Despite a fairly high sodium content, we both thought it tasted a bit bland, and neither of us detected any bacon flavor.The first ingredient of the Bone Suckin and Dinosaur sauces are tomato paste and crushed tomatoes respectively. Neither sauce has any added water. It should also be noted that both of these alternatives have about one third of the sodium that this sauce has per serving.Bottom LineWhile the preparation was easy and the resulting dish was reasonably good, for us it was not enough new and different for us to use this product instead of our favorite barbecue sauce. Overall score: just short of 3.5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CMHP2P31XTZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLV5CCO#wasThisHelpful","R2CMHP2P31XTZM","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't impress easily, especially when it comes to ""every day"" products such as this, because more often than not, claims made by the manufacturer don't hold up in the real world. This cream is different. Its claim to ""instantly relieve dry, itchy skin"" is valid. I have recently developed a tendency to have spots of really dry, itchy, and flaky skin. I've tried several different brands of cream to relieve these flareups with limited success… up until now. This Curel Itch Defense cream really works. I applied the cream to a couple of itchy patches and the itching immediately stopped. I also applied the cream to a very dry but not itchy patch and noticed an immediate improvement.The consistency is just right so you can easily dispense a small dab or a large amount depending on your needs. And, as advertised, it is truly unscented.Mrs. Boilermate has also been impressed with the performance of this cream.The Bottom LineIf you have dry itchy skin you owe it to yourself to try this Curel Itch Defense. I know it will always have a place on the shelf in my household.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BP16DTRKN14H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BJJT7W#wasThisHelpful","R3BP16DTRKN14H","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Power toothbrushes have been shown to do a better job cleaning your teeth than manual brushing. When I switched from a manual brush to a power brush my dentist and hygienist both noticed the difference.For this evaluation I compared this Sonicare toothbrush with the battery-powered Oral-B 3d I've had for a while, and the Oral-B 5000 I received from Vine, evaluated previously, and has become my daily driver since.First the physical comparison. Both Oral-B units have a smaller diameter, but the Sonicare is still easy to hold and maneuver. The Sonicare has a flat bottom so you can stand it up, and also molded so you can lay it flat, bristles up, and it won't roll off the counter, a nice touch.The Oral-B 3d runs on one AA cell, and this Sonicare brush is powered by two AAA batteries (included, thank you).Unlike the other two battery-powered brushes, the head on this one is long and slender.Set up with stupid simple. Pull off the end insert the batteries put the end back on and you're good to go.When you turn on this Sonicare it makes a pleasant buzzing sound. If you have used in Oral-B powered toothbrush, the sensation from the Sonicare feels a bit different. The slender, narrow head means you can reach the back corners of your mouth better than with either Oral-B model.The Sonicare definitely feels gentler than either of the two powered brushes that I have used previously. The other sensation is a bit more disconcerting. Since the entire head vibrates (as opposed to the brushes rotating with the Oral-B models), when you move the brush in your mouth and touch the back of the brush head to your teeth, it will vibrate your teeth. The brush has a two-minute shutoff timer.The elephant in the corner for all power brushes is the cost of the replacement heads. If you have kids, replacing the heads as directed can add up pretty quick. Here on Amazon, a 3-pack of replacement heads is just under $10 at the time of this review. That's not too bad, in my opinion. In contrast, a three pack of Replacement Brush Head 3 pack for the Oral-B 5000 is almost $22 as I write this.Bottom OneIf you are in the market for a power toothbrush, and you should be, this Sonicare deserves your serious consideration. It is reasonably priced and the replacement heads are also reasonably priced. In my opinion there is no added value to buying the more expensive rechargeable models.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32K6GADFOMQ05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NL2AOPU#wasThisHelpful","R32K6GADFOMQ05","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mrs. Boilermate's Review:This is a really handy little gadget.With the cable included in the box, it is easy to charge up this battery pack from a USB port. It takes a while, but it does the job. If you happen to have an adapter to plug a USB cable into an outlet, the battery pack charges much faster. There are four indicator lights which make it clear how much of a charge is remaining in the battery pack.Once charged, it did an excellent job recharging my smart phone, Kindle, and Nook. It is very simple to operate. Just connect the USB cable, push the one button, and start charging. One charge of the battery pack can recharge my phone multiple times.This battery pack is small enough to easily stash in a tote bag or glove compartment. It could come in handy if my phone is low and I don’t want to sit in my car with the power on while the phone charges.It will also allow me to recharge my phone overnight, and leave the phone on top of my purse, so I won’t forget it in the morning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R109XON50R21OZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H36Y2M6#wasThisHelpful","R109XON50R21OZ","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't eat a lot of energy bars, but when I do I usually reach for one of the many flavors of Balance Bars. So this is the yardstick I used when evaluating these Vega One bars.The first thing you notice is how heavy the box is. Even the individual bars seems to feel ""heavy"" although it actually weighs just over 2  ounces. The bar measures approximately 1 ¼  wide by 3 ½ inches long and has a smooth dark chocolate coating.Reading the ingredients, I'm impressed at how many of them are organic. There is nothing artificial or unpronounceable here. Vegan and gluten-free are bonuses. I'm not going to waste space in this review rehashing the rest of the ingredients list or nutritional numbers. If you're interested in that information you can find it on Vega One's website, vegaone dot com.Considering how heavy the bar feels before you bite into it, the bar is not really dense. For me the density and texture are about the same as a Balance Bar. The dark chocolate and peanut butter flavors are prominent and the crispy rice bits provide a bit of a crunch. There are no unpleasant or off flavors. Overall this is a very nice bar.One comment on the packaging. I prefer the box with closable flaps as opposed to the perforated opening on the front of this box that doesn't stay closed. This means you can't stand box up in the cupboard without the remaining bars falling out. And guys, don't be put off by the pictures on the box. This isn't a ""girly bar."" If you like the Balance Bars I think you'll like these, too.Bottom LineI can see having one of these bars as part of my breakfast or my midmorning snack. If I saw these in the store and they were competitively priced with Balance Bars, there is a good chance these would end up in my shopping basket.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ62GIH704W5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGDOPEG#wasThisHelpful","RJ62GIH704W5X","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing you notice about this beverage is how thin they managed to make the can. When you pop the top, you also notice that the can has a widemouth opening for easy drinking.For me, the mildly carbonated beverage has a pleasant berry flavor, but no almonds. For me, this is not a bad thing because I like the flavor as it is. Since there are no artificial sweeteners there are none of those nasty ""artificial sweetener off flavors."" There are also no other off flavors and no unpleasant aftertaste.Overall, I like this beverage even though for me there was no boost.

"A bit of background. When I bought my house in 1989 it was over 100 years old, and as such was built without indoor facilities. The date stenciled on the bottom of the toilet tank top indicated the bathroom was installed around 1962. I also knew the septic tank was under the forsythia bush in the side yard and where the drain field was because the grass over it was always much taller and greener than the rest of the yard. From the size of the bush, I was pretty sure the septic tank had not been exposed (read ""pumped out"") in quite a while, if ever.Shortly thereafter, I was browsing the aisles in my local Grossman's when I came across Roebic K-37. After reading the bottle I decided to buy some and try it out. While the instructions said ""once a year"" I added to the system it twice a year, ""just to be sure."" I also did the ""common sense"" stuff associated with septic system. I chose the toilet tissue the dissolved well and never flushed anything ""inappropriate."" I never had any problems, except when the tall grass over the drain field choked my mower.Fast-forward 14 years. One day I said to my bride, ""That septic tank's been there since 1962. I don't think it would hurt if we put a new one in."" There is an ""old-timer"" in my neighborhood with a backhoe and a dump truck with an excellent reputation when it comes to installing septic systems, so I made arrangements with him to replace the system. On the appointed day, he scoops out the forsythia bush, and carefully scoops down until he reaches the metal top of the septic tank. To my surprise, it is not attached to the tank. After pumping the tank, the sides and the bottom each came out separately. It also turns out I only had a 10 foot long drain field. We then proceeded with the installation of a 1000 gallon (properly baffled) concrete tank and 70 feet of drain field.I give Roebic K-37 credit for keeping an ancient, poorly designed, and dilapidated system functioning long as it did. Therefore, I started using K-37 twice a year immediately upon putting the new system in service, and the first 11 years of use have been uneventful. I trust that it will continue to keep my septic system healthy as long as I own this property. If I am still alive when the house gets sold I will also recommend this regimen to the new owner.If your septic tank also receives laundry and kitchen drains, and in addition to the bathrooms, you need to be aware that laundry bleach and most automatic dishwasher detergents are lethal to the bugs in your septic tank, and the other soaps and detergents don't help it either. Therefore you should also check out Roebic's other products. (I put K-87 in the dry well that my kitchen drains to.)Bottom LineIf you have a septic system you owe it to yourself to keep it in good condition. My experience has been that Roebic K-37 will help do just that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KGLZDZMT82A7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H5T70C#wasThisHelpful","R1KGLZDZMT82A7","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It never ceases to amaze me how hard it must be to design a proper ""rubber"" spatula. While Rubbermaid's spatulas have been the gold standard for years, even those don't seem as good as the ones they made back in ""the good old days.""Over the years I've come to like OXO products. With few exceptions, they are well engineered well designed and well made.Enter this silicone spatula from OXO. Once again, OXO has gotten it right. The head is a good size, not too big, not too small, with just the right amount of flexibility. It's the perfect size and length scraping the last of the mayo out of the jar, and because it is rated for 600°F, it is perfect for getting the last of the sauce out of the pot or sauté pan.The rest of the spatula is all one piece plastic, so unlike those Rubbermaid spatulas with the wooden handles, this one can go right in the dishwasher.The other end of the spatula is a bit larger in diameter with grippy rubber surface. This is a bit of a two-edged sword. While it makes it easy to grab and maneuver, it also makes the spatula a bit difficult to store. I store my rubber spatulas, along with my other kitchen utensils, handle side down in a canister. This larger diameter handle takes up much more space, and the grippy surface makes it more difficult to insert and extract. When pulling it out of the canister, the grippy part usually drags at least one other thing with it. Though not a dealbreaker, it's still annoying nonetheless.Overall, the spatulas the keeper and I would recommend it to a friend without hesitation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CLYKKFH5P5Q9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CYDFLDW#wasThisHelpful","R1CLYKKFH5P5Q9","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most of the reviewers have compared this spray favorably with WD-40. For me, that's not saying much. I gave up on WD-40 years ago. The mainstays in my toolbox and workshop have been CRC products Power-Lube and 6-56, as well as PB Blaster. Those products blow WD-40 right out of the water. So, how does this new 3M spray compared to the heavyweight champs I'm used to?Quite well, I am pleased to say. I've only tried a few things so far, and I've been happy with the results. The only unknown here is how long the protection will last. Hence, the four-star rating. With any luck, it will last so long that I will forget that I applied it in the first place. In any case, I plan to report back on the spray's longevity.The only con, in my opinion, is the way the plastic straw is attached to the side of the can. It never ceases to amaze me that in the last 50 years nobody has come up with a way to hold the straw on the side of the can so you don't lose it. They taped the straw to the side of the can with scotch tape 1964, and they still tape the straw to the side of the can with scotch tape 2014. This virtually guarantees that the straw will be lost before the can is empty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EPH6NJVZTR02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E6YTY8#wasThisHelpful","R2EPH6NJVZTR02","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

(Showing Mrs. Boilermate ""101 Ready to Use Excel Formulas."")Mrs. Boilermate (Who uses Excel every day.): ""Why do you need something like that?  All that stuff is already built into Excel.""Well, it turns out all that stuff really is built into Excel... If you know where to find it. That's not easy, considering Microsoft's legendary ""not much help"" files. That's where the useful information in this book comes in.I have been using spreadsheets since the late 1980s, beginning with SuperCalc before migrating to Quattro Pro, and finally Excel. While my spreadsheet needs have been fairly modest, I know enough to build some basic formulas and set up some conditional formatting. However, I knew could do much more than what I used it for, and this book has helped me discover some of the things I can do with the program.Starting with a basic explanation of how formulas work in Excel, the book continues on with examples of various types of operations. With each formula there is a more detailed explanation about how the formula works. There is also a link where you can download samples of the formulas they use.While many of the formulas are beyond what I would normally use in Excel, one of the first formulas, in the chapter, ""Manipulating Text with Formulas,"" allowed me to combine several columns of text into one column by using the formula containing ""&'s."" By combining columns I was able to create a spreadsheet that I could actually print. As single columns, the sheet was too wide to print on a single page, even in landscape mode, unless I shrunk the font until it was virtually unreadable.While this book is not an in-depth ""everything you need to know about Excel"" book, and that is a good thing. Sometimes those books can be so overwhelming that your eyeballs ache as you try to sort through the information. On the other hand, with this book I was able to find the information that was pertinent to what I wanted to accomplish.Bottom LineWhile the dead tree version of this book was on the house courtesy of Vine, I thought this book was so useful that I actually purchased the Kindle version so I could load it into my Kindle app on my computer, and follow along on the screen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TKROFLK1SPL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118902688#wasThisHelpful","R2TKROFLK1SPL4","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mrs. Boilermate's ReviewThese are pretty little earrings. I was expecting them to be bigger, but I must concede that the actual size is in line with the small illustration showing the earrings against a silhouette. The pictures and the video give the impression that the earrings are larger, not to mention the information from Amazon's website: Product Dimensions: 4.5 x 4.1 x 0.4 inches; 0.3 ouncesAccording to my ruler, the dangle is about 5/8"" across and 5/8"" from top to bottom. The full length from the top to bottom is about 1 1/4"". From front to back, the depth of the dangle is about 1/4"" .Before you wear them for the first time, check to make sure the loop holding the dangle onto both earrings is completely closed. I had to fix one right out of the package. The dangle itself appears well constructed, and the stones all appear to be firmly set. However, these are very light.

"Reviewing this UPS has been somewhat of a dilemma for me and in fact it was not submitted until the very last day, as I tried to figure out a good way to review it. Then the lights went out.Almost 3 weeks earlier...Out-of-the-box, this is a nice looking device. It has clean lines, and the three top mounted switched outlets are widely spaced to accommodate power bricks. I noticed the outlets are only two prong, but as I read up on the device I can see the reason for this. It is designed for low-power devices, which tend to have power bricks. It is not designed to backup things like computers and monitors, which would normally be provided with a three-pronged cord. In fact, it will shut itself off if it detects a draw more than 75 W.At first I thought, ""What good is this? Sure the modem and the router stay on, but everything else that uses electricity goes out. How is this helpful?""I was brought to my senses last week by a power outage. There I discovered a very nice feature: When the power goes out, the unit beeps once and then stays silent. The other two UPS's I have beep constantly until I turn them off or they die of starvation.I am disabled, and therefore having communication to the outside world at all times is essential. I still have a traditional landline, and as such I normally still have phone service during a power outage unless the outage was caused by downed wires on my street. But the landline only works on the desk phone in my office, because the rest of the house phones are cordless, and therefore don't work when the power goes out. By plugging the base station into this unit I had working phones (for a while - see below) during the outage.My cell phone is my ""I've fallen and I can't get up"" device. When the lights went out I reached for my cell phone only to discover that I had left it on for an undetermined amount of time, and the battery was nearly dead. I was able to plug my cell phone into this UPS and recharge the battery.I have to confess I don't know how long it will really last. After I let my phone charge for about an hour I turned it off just in case we needed to recharge something else. In the end, the outage lasted for 12 hours, and the UPS wouldn't have powered the phones for the entire outage, but this device gave me the peace of mind I needed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WRESPMSZ5AJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KH07WRC#wasThisHelpful","R1WRESPMSZ5AJM","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When we Americans think of ""instant cereal"" we usually think of a pouch of instant oatmeal mixed with boiling water to to make a fairly thick porridge-like breakfast. That is kind of what I thought I was getting when I purchased this. However, this, according to the package, is ""nutritious, digestible and a delicious beverage suitable for everyone.""This product is finely milled grains (wheat, corn, soybean, and rice,) with nondairy creamer and sugar. Adding one pouch to 200 mL (approximately 6 ounces) of hot water produces a creamy, sweet, grain flavored beverage. If you're looking for something with the consistency of instant oatmeal you really need three packets per 6 ounces of water. When prepared this way you get a smooth, creamy, sweet cereal. Be aware, however, due to the added sugar and nondairy creamer you get a stiff dose of calories as well... about 400.Overall I like the flavor of this product. The corn flavor is most prominent for me.I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this product. While it wasn't what I expected, it was a delicious new experience for me.

"I am pleased to see that TENS unit finally gone OTC.This is a well designed portable TENS unit. It was easy to put together, and the Quick Start guide is excellent. It also comes with a comprehensive manual.The placement guide for two or four electrodes is clear. There is also a more detailed explanation of exactly where to place the electrodes in the manual (pages 18 – 21).Translating that guide into actual placement is a bit trickier in reality. I expect it will take a bit of trial and error to precisely locate the electrodes.This TENS unit has a total of twelve different programs. There are programs for the shoulder, hand/wrist, lower back/waist, joint – knee/elbow, leg – thigh/calf/ankle/foot, or neck. For each of these areas, there are two variations on the type of stimulation.It is easy to select the program and intensity. There is a comprehensive list on page 25 of the manual.Handle the electrode pads with care. While the pads are reusable, they should be replaced if you break one of the wires or they fail to stick. A replacement set of pads (at the time of this writing) will set you back almost 25 bucks here on Amazon.The unit itself is small and easy to handle. The backlit LCD display is easy to read, and the controls are easy to set.In use, it is just about what you would expect from a TENS unit. The only question is how many sessions we get out of one set of batteries.Bottom LineIf you're looking for an OTC TENS unit this one is worthy of your consideration.

"For me, this LaraBar Renola sounded like a good idea. The individual packages are just the right size for a quick snack. Gluten-free, dairy free, non-GMO, etc. sounded good. The result, however, falls somewhat short.First, the appearance. If you're used to seeing nice clusters of granola when you open the package you will be disappointed with this product. The product in these little bags looks like all the little crumbs left in the bottom of your granola after you've eaten all the big clusters. The best way to eat this is to snip off the top of the bag and pour it directly into your mouth.The taste a bit bland. The bag says ""Cinnamon Nut"" but I don't taste any cinnamon. Similarly, though almonds are the first ingredient I don't taste them either. I do taste the raisins, sunflower seeds, and the pumpkin seeds. This product really needs oat and nut clusters. Two stars.However, Mrs. Boilermate said:""I enjoyed this ""granola."" It was tasty, and the package was a good amount for a mid-afternoon snack.

"I think that LED light bulbs are the wave of the future. Previously I tested two bulbs courtesy of Vine, and purchased an LED floodlight, in addition to this floodlight that I am reviewing today. In all cases, I have been impressed with the brightness of the bulbs and how their light output mimics the light that I'm used to from an incandescent bulb. Most of my criticisms of these bulbs has been the aesthetics, and how they don't fit into current fixtures. This is not one of those bulbs.Though the buy-in price per bulb can seem a bit stiff, you soon forget that after you've installed one of these in a hard-to-reach area. Like all new technologies, over time the cost of the bulbs continues to drop. At the time of this writing these bulbs are only about 12 bucks apiece (when bought in a two pack) so the payback time is not that long. But don't expect to be able to take a Caribbean Vacation with the money you save by using these bulbs. I expect the decreased energy usage will soon be offset by higher electricity prices, as the electric utilities raise their prices to compensate.The instructions for this bulb say that it can be used indoors or in a sheltered area outdoors. I put this bulb in a holder that's under the eaves outside my back door. The light from this bulb is pretty impressive. The color is similar to what I get from an incandescent floodlight and the flood pattern is good. The shape of the bulb is virtually identical to an incandescent floodlight, and fits perfectly into the lamp holder. I did not test the dimming capabilities of this bulb because I do not have any places where I would need a dimmable floodlight.There are currently LED floodlights on the market that are designed for ""outdoor use"" and not ""sheltered outdoor location"" like this bulb is. That's the only reason this bulb gets a four-star rating.Bottom LineThis floodlight bulb has all the attributes I look for when buying a floodlight, but primarily that it can be used outdoors, albeit in a sheltered location. It looks just like an ordinary floodlight, and the light output is similar to that of a comparable incandescent floodlight. So unless you need a floodlight in a non-sheltered outdoor location, this bulb is a worthy choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROXNFRR82BPOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDZGFFQ#wasThisHelpful","ROXNFRR82BPOR","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've probably gone through a half dozen or so pairs of kitchen shears, trying to find a pair that worked right for me. I think I finally found it with these shears.First of all the shears have a good comfortable grip, the handles are big enough for my ham hands, and the angle of the handles is about perfect. They also take apart for easy cleaning and can go right in the dishwasher. But other shears I have had also had comfortable handles that have been correctly angled, came apart for easy cleaning, and go right in the dishwasher.What sets the shears apart is the micro-serrations on the blades. I often use kitchen shears to cut up something soft and slippery such as chicken or chicken gizzards. I also use them to snip garlic scapes, which are round, firm, and smooth. When I try to cut these items with smooth bladed shears the shears tend to squeeze the item and push them right out of the blades and across the room as I try to cut them. The micro serrations on these blades grip just enough for me and I get smooth cut every time. Since I put the shears into use I have not shot a chicken gizzard across the kitchen.I highly recommend that everybody purchase a pair of these shears. Not only that, I like them so much I bought a second pair. So save yourself the trouble of multiple orders and order two pairs at once.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9EVDJAW1DV6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003AQAYPM#wasThisHelpful","R9EVDJAW1DV6C","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of Bounty Paper Towels for going on 30 years. To me, they were worth the extra money because they absorb well and hold up to heavy use. And the Select-A-Size variety has been our style of choice.With that in mind I was pleased to have the opportunity to try these Viva Vantage paper towels. I particularly like the ""choose a size"" option when buying towels. With a good paper towel, you can do just as much with a smaller sheet then you can with more than one full-sized sheet of a ""value brand"" towel. The Amazon description seems to indicate these would have a performance similar to Bounty.The first thing I noticed when I open the package is how rough these towel are. While Bounty towels aren't exactly facial tissue soft, by comparison these feel downright industrial. These towels are also ""stretchy."" They almost feel like that stretchy material they make stretchy blue jeans out of.Because of the way the first sheet on the roll is glued down, more often than not the first sheet gets shredded, and therefore not usable. This is never the case with Bounty towels.Mrs. Boilermate commented that when she went to pull one sheet off of the roll from our Paper Towel Holder, more often than not the sheet tore and she was left holding with just a little tab of paper towel rather than an entire sheet that she gets when ripping off a sheet of Bounty in the same manner. I don't know if it's due to a weaker towel or stronger perforations, but it's annoying just the same. She said tearing off a sheet of these towels in a two-handed task. I have experienced this on occasion as well.When you get to the last sheet on the roll, it, too, is seriously glued down, so you are unable to use that sheet. Again, the last sheet of Bounty is always usable. It may not seem like two unusable sheets per roll is a big deal, but that's 3% of every 66 sheet roll, and 24 sheets out of this 12 pack that were unusable.I often use a paper towel (or two) to sop up leftover grease after browning hamburger or cooking bacon in a frying pan. I even use a towel sop up grease while the hamburger is browning (rather than trying to drain the grease from a frying pan full of ground beef) so less grease ends up in the finished product of whatever I am making. Compared side-by-side to Bounty,  these don't seem to absorb as much as Bounty. They also don't ""lock-in"" liquids as well either. That is, when you sop up a mess with Bounty there is virtually no dripping from the towel as you transfer from the pan to the trash can. These Viva Vantage towels tended to drip a lot more during the same operation.I put three slices of bacon on this microwave bacon plate, and covered it with a single sheet of these towels. The next batch I did the same with a Bounty towel. At the end of both three-minute cooking cycles I compared the two towels. The grease stain on the Viva Vantage towel was much larger, indicating it needed more of the towel to absorb approximately the same amount of grease.Mrs. Boilermate used these towels in conjunction with Mr. Clean Liquid Muscle to do some general cleanup around the kitchen, including some tough gunk on the stove. She reports the towels held up well, though she did say she didn't do any really hard scrubbing.Advertising vs. RealityThe advertising hype says, ""See for yourself why more people prefer new Viva Vantage towels. (vs. the leading national brand)"" Maybe we're just ""going against the flow"" but we don't prefer these over ""the leading national brand.""They also say, ""Viva Vantage offers the perfect combination of strength, stretch and softness."" Again I disagree. The towels have decided industrial feel to them which is definitely not soft, and when it comes to paper towels, ""stretchy"" is not a term I've ever used to describe my ideal towel.""Stretches to scrub."" I'm not sure what they mean by that, but neither I nor Mrs. Boilermate have ever said, ""These paper towels are nice, but I wish they stretched more.""Bottom LineThese paper towels perform reasonably well, though not as well is the Bounty towels we use every day. For us, we consider these a step up from ""value brand"" towels but not much more than that. We certainly wouldn't pay the premium price they are asking for this towel. We would use these over the Bounty Basic Paper Towels we tried a while back, but as a replacement for the Bounty towels we use now? Not so much. We'll continue using Bounty, thank you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FXMLF7HNETHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HJKOYSI#wasThisHelpful","R1FXMLF7HNETHC","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love oatmeal, and I'm always up to trying a new brand or variety. So when this Gluten Free Chex Oatmeal was offered on Vine I selected it right away. I'm glad I did. And in the process I learned something, which is always a good thing. First of all, when I saw the name of the product, ""Gluten Free Chex Oatmeal,"" I thought, ""Sound like marketing hype to me. Isn't all oatmeal gluten free?"" Well, instead of just writing up a snarky comment along those lines I went out and did some research. It turns out that, no, all oatmeal is not gluten free. Yes, oats themselves are gluten-free, but apparently most oatmeal contains oats that have been cross-contaminated with a tiny bit of wheat, barley and/or rye. (Thanks, Google.)So, let's try it out. This is a very good oatmeal without a lot of added nonsense. It doesn't even have added vitamins and minerals that most cereals have nowadays. There are three flavors in this variety pack: apple cinnamon, maple brown sugar, and original. The original tastes like, well, plain oatmeal. If you like plain oatmeal you'll love this. The nice oat flavor with no off flavors or strange aftertaste. The same goes for the flavored varieties. The apple cinnamon had discernible chunks of rehydrated apples as well as a nice aroma and flavor. Maple brown sugar was equally tasty.I prefer a thicker porridge, so the recommended amount of water per packet, two thirds of a cup, was about double what I would normally use. The instructions even say you can use an empty pouch to measure the COLD water for pouring it into a microwave-safe cup. For my preparations, I went a simpler route: I poured two packets into a Sistema Soup Mug and added 6 ounces of water from my Keurig machine. It came out perfect. I liked it so much I hogged it all to myself, and didn't even offer Mrs. Boilermate any.Bottom LineThis oatmeal is what the Nature Valley Oatmeal I recently tried should have been. It has simple ingredients, no artificial anything, is easy to prepare, and is delicious. I would definitely purchase this product. Even if you don't need to maintain a gluten-free diet, this oatmeal deserves a spot in your pantry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXLQOV3TZ979P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCJRVO2#wasThisHelpful","RXLQOV3TZ979P","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have used a variety PDF programs over the years including Adobe, Foxit, PDF-Xchange, and the predecessor to this program, PDF Create. Though each has its advantages and disadvantages, I preferred PDF-Xchange for my everyday use.Converting documents to PDF format is no big deal these days. I currently have four PDF programs on my computer, and each one sets itself up as a printer. To save to PDF I simply tell my document ""Print"" and the print menu will open up and I get to choose what program I print to PDF from. In that regard I haven't found any real difference in the resultant PDF when printing to PDF from Word, Excel, Publisher, WordPerfect, or any other program.InterfaceThere seems to be only one ""theme"" which is black on gray with purple highlights. I can find no other option to change the color scheme.Love it or hate it, it seems the ribbon interface is here to stay, but Nuance seems to done a reasonably decent job when populating the tabs. What they haven't done, however, is given you the ability to collapse the ribbon, which takes up a fair amount of screen space.Power PDF has a Quick Access Toolbar as well, but unlike Microsoft Office products (or their own PaperPort), the bar cannot be relocated below the ribbon. Since there is only one theme, the QAT is black and purple on dark gray with tiny little icons you can barely see.Following the Microsoft example, it also puts the document information on the same line as the Quick Access Toolbar. This means if you add a lot of items to the toolbar the document information will be pushed right off the screen. (At least with MS Office you can relocate the QAT so this doesn't happen.) Another interface quirk: If you use a ""Windows Classic"" theme this program will place the document information in the Classic Theme title bar on top of the QAT, rendering it useless.There is also a toolbar along the left side of the screen that cannot be turned off or collapsed, as well as a status bar on the bottom of the screen. And if you click on one of these sidebar icons, another sidebar opens next to it which gobbles up even more screen space. By default, these two alone occupy approximately a quarter of the screen width.All in all there is too much wasted screen space with this program.Many modern programs have a tab for each open document within the program window. Not so with Power PDF. It still has the same old-fashioned multiple icons clogging up the Taskbar. PDF-Xchange Editor has such a tabbed interface.The Program ItselfThis program seems to have all the features of other PDF Creator programs, along with most of the same bells and whistles. Since other reviewers have gone into detail about some of the features of this program I won't bore you with a rehash. For the parts of the program I have tried it accomplishes the tasks fairly well, but nothing really sets it apart from other products on the market at this time.Customer ServiceWhile I have not needed to contact Customer Service concerning this product, I have used Nuance products for many years. Buyer beware. Their lack of customer service is legendary. Their response times are slow (if they respond at all) and often times the answers are inadequate.Bottom LineThis program is like a Mitsubishi Outlander. The Outlander is a fairly competent vehicle with love it or hate it styling. But the fact is there better vehicles in its class for less money. The same is true For Power PDF. In my opinion, there is no compelling reason to purchase this program. It does the same things as every other PDF program I have tried, and while it does them competently, it doesn't do them better.The dealbreaker for me, however, is the interface, and since that's what I have to look at every time I use a program this is a real big deal. The black and purple on dark gray for the QAT, combined with the small icons and its inability to be relocated below the ribbon makes it unusable in my opinion. It is also intolerant if you use a ""Windows Classic"" theme as I described above.You can always go to Nuance's website and download a free trial this program. But while you're at it, Google PDF-Xchange Editor and download the free trial of that program. In my opinion, it's a better program for less money.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R246P3UNN4AXT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKM077A#wasThisHelpful","R246P3UNN4AXT1","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're the handy person in your house you know how nice it is to have things that will make your project go a little easier. You know, something you don't absolutely need, and wouldn't use every day, but when you do use it you appreciate how much easier can make your life. This is one of those things.If you're about to do a major project and you need a quick and easy way to calculate a room size so you know how much material to buy, this laser measuring device is perfect. Not only will it give you measurements, but also calculate square footage and, if necessary, volume. It's no replacement for the traditional tape measure, however, once the project begins. For instance, this would be perfect for calculating how much crown molding to buy to finish off that room renovation you just did. But once you have the crown molding you really need a tape measure to accurately measure each length of wall. (This is only accurate to about 1/16 of an inch, which is not sufficient, IMO, for trim work.)The unit itself small enough to fit easily into your hand and comes with a lanyard. It also comes with a belt holster that's basically useless. That's because the instrument has a grippy rubber surround which makes it comfortable to hold. But it also makes it difficult to insert and remove from the holster with two hands, let alone one.Overall, it's fairly easy to use and the operations are fairly easy to understand. The manual, while not extensive, clearly tells you what everything is and how to use it, with one exception. There is a small hinged tab on the bottom of the unit. Not sure what it's for, and the manual doesn't tell you, but I'm not confident it would last very long in the real world, whatever it's for. There's a threaded connector on the back so it can be attached to a standard tripod.If you have big hands you may find some of the buttons a bit small. To me the buttons have a fairly quality feel to them. The screen is easy to see, and the backlighting is handy. Repeatability of measurements has been spot on.Bottom LineI was very happy to be able to test this instrument, courtesy of Amazon's Vine program. Would I have bought one on my own? Probably not, but it's one of those ""nice to have"" things that I would have asked Santa for. You should ask Santa for one to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ2OVBWC0EIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWBYDTU#wasThisHelpful","RZ2OVBWC0EIA","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While reading the reviews for the Lindt Chili Dark Chocolate Bar, one reviewer suggested trying this bar as a better alternative, so I thought it would give it a try. Reading the description, it sounded like the right combination: dark chocolate with cinnamon and chili added. Sure, the nine bucks I paid for this is a lot of money for one candy bar, but one from a small chocolatier is a luxury I can afford occasionally... if it's a really good chocolate bar.What an expensive mistake! The bar I received had partially melted and re-solidified. The chocolate was more akin to milk chocolate rather than dark chocolate and the chili flavor was inconsistent throughout the bar. Some bites had a mild chili flavor at the end, while others had none at all. It really lacked any serious spiciness. I thought maybe I got an old one, but the ""Best By"" date is July 21, 2014, so that didn't explain the lack of flavor.Since I ate the whole thing, it's really not fair to ask for a refund from Amazon, but I certainly will not be buying this brand of chocolate bar again.Bottom LineAvoid this candy bar at all costs!

"I like a good dark chocolate and I like ""hot stuff."" I wasn't sure, however, about the combination of the two. I always heard that chocolate was a good way to counteract the spiciness of chili peppers so I didn't expect much heat. Much to my surprise (and delight) the chocolate didn't wipe out the chili pepper heat.Overall, I like this candy bar. The dark chocolate is smooth without being bitter, and it has a nice spicy finish without being overpowering. The best way to enjoy this bar is to let a square melted in your mouth. That way you get the nice dark chocolate flavor with a bit of spiciness in the back of your mouth. The spiciness is less pronounced if you just pop a square in your mouth, chew, and swallow.If you want a ""true chili-head experience"" that will melt your teeth this probably isn't the bar for you.

"While making rice on the stove is not that hard, and I usually get pretty good results, I  occasionally will burn a bit on the bottom because I'm not paying attention. I thought this rice cooker would have the advantage of turning off after the preset time and not overcooking the rice. I expected the results to be ""okay"" but not as good as when it was done properly on the stovetop. I was wrong. Not only the results as good but the rice was done in half the time.When I make basmati rice stove I normally put one cup of rice and 1 3/4 cups water in the pan, bring it to a boil, and simmer for 20 minutes. Using the same proportions in this rice steamer rice is done perfectly in 10 minutes.Cleanup was a breeze too. Everything can go on the top rack of the dishwasher.

"I've had a flow control aerator on my kitchen sink faucet for years but have never been able to find one with the smaller diameter to fit my bathroom sink until now. I'm not sure why, but I've never been able to find one locally in any hardware store.Installation was a snap. I simply unscrewed the aerator on my Peerless faucet, inserted the thin gasket into the top of this control valve, and screwed the valve into place. It functions properly with no leaks. Now I get to control the flow without having to change the temperature. The reduction in flow rate is only noticeable when you run the water to get it hot, as it will take longer. Other than that it is a nice soft aerated flow.Be aware, however, this valve may add up to 2 inches to the end of your faucet, so if you have a low flat faucet spout and a fairly shallow sink this may be an issue for you when you try to put something like a tall cup under it.Bottom lineHighly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPVSFR2233LJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032XZ5GQ#wasThisHelpful","RPVSFR2233LJB","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Again, there was no difference from the mac & cheese we've made with wheat-based pasta.Bottom lineThese gluten-free elbows are good enough to stand on their own and not something that is ""almost as good as the 'real thing'.""

"I made an amazing discovery after I attached this to the side of my Toto Drake elongated toilet… The toilet doesn't have holes around the entire circumference of the bowl rim. It only has holes about a third of the way around on the front and back. When you clip this to the side of the bowl it doesn't even get wet so it has absolutely no effect on the cleanliness of the toilet. If you clip it to the front it will get a bit wet but it's really ineffective keeping the sides of the bowl clean.If your toilet has holes around the entire circumference of the rim these might work for you, but it was totally ineffective on our toilet.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJVSY6ON9N4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM029TC#wasThisHelpful","R1PJVSY6ON9N4U","A2H2I5FY1PUHP1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H2I5FY1PUHP1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a unique, lovely flower silver bangle. It's about 8 1/4 inches around, which is great for medium and small wrists. It fits my wrist which is 6 1/4""It is stamped with a 925 which normally means it's entirely real sterling silver, but it doesn't look it, nor does it feel smooth to the touch like real silver. This page now says it's plated silver, which means it should not have that stamp.  At the 5 dollar price, you can't expect real silver, and plated is getting more popular these days as silver increases in price.Getting it on/off if you have larger hands can be an issue as it took some doing to bend it to fit the hole over the flower for me.

"These are large (11-12 mm) genuine, white freshwater pearls, with a beautiful glow; with cream and peach undertones. You know they are real as well because the back of the pearls are shaved to make a smooth surface for the posts.

"This tablecloth has a box, slight open weave that is so thin, it's practically see through (A reviewer named ""RLC"" shows how easily you can their hand through the fabric.) This looks cheap, but presentable on a solid very monochrome wood/color table, whether light or dark. But if the wood has more color fluctuations that is normal to the grain, or the leaves of the table aren't tight, you'll see the separation easily, making it more obvious and look like it's stained. On the plus side, it doesn't look or feel like the 100% polyester it is, but more like a cheap cotton or linen, and because it's polyester, stains would come out easier then if it was cotton or linen.Where the white meets the taupe/tan bottom had a more designed, even more open weave that already looks like the threads have been pulled & don't look like they will survive even a gentle cycle without the threads being pulled to the point of looking representable. Reviewer James Huff shows a great picture of how badly damaged his looks even before use.The stitching at the border looks fine and strong enough. It's a nice design, too bad the actual manufacturing of the weave is done so cheaply. The instructions say you can machine-wash cold separately using the gentle cycle, and tumble dry low, and use a low iron, but I'd be worried it wouldn't get past even a couple of washings with that. I'd maybe even hand wash it & line dry it.I don't think this is worth 30 or so it's selling now, this is more a outlet or liquidators, but not as bad as a dollar store product.

"This small size version at exactly 2"" wide diameter is a good size for smaller dogs, most balls are much bigger that I find. It's a very thick, heavy textured style with TWO squeaker holes. It has very deep channels for the change of color from blue to orange areas. The name brand is also stamped very deeply in it. Because of all this, I found bouncing it straight up to be very difficult without watching it to make sure it's not on any grooves or holes. I get about a 5-6' foot initial bounce, on the second bounce it drops off to only 3-4' feet tops.My two Shih Tzu/Poodle mixes are very picky. He (about 20 lbs) only likes to chase balls, she (25 lbs) on the other hand, only likes to catch balls in mid bounce and is very good at it. He likes the very soft ones, preferably ones with nubs to massage the gums. She likes the tiny ones, these toy tennis balls the size of ping pongs. Neither chews them for more then 5-10 seconds before getting bored, they only like to chew real food.Neither cared for it, and I can't get him to chase it. She is VERY skiddish, afraid of the squeaker & even on a good day is kinda scared to catch it possibly because it's much heavier then what she's used to.I think other dogs may like this ball though, it is made well, I just don't like all the grooves that get in the way of the bounce.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16C77DA2HG5AS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNLOTOE#wasThisHelpful","R16C77DA2HG5AS","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The tiny pictures & lack of amount of pictures doesn't help either.* Can be a pain to push around, not smooth.* Has many settings for higher pile of carpets, but as you go higher, the suction suffers greatly.* No headlights or lights of any kind.* Louder then other vacuums I've own (owned many)* Using only your foot to put weight on the vacuum to fold the main part down to get under furniture is cheap & seems like it would loosen over time.* There are 5 Philips screws to protect the bottom roller brush, cleaning that brush if it has long hair, etc. is  an unneeded pain.

There is a thin blue LED strip along the top indicating power. The cable to the USB Plug appears to be thick and sturdy.Performance:I tested the hub out on my Desktop PC which is an Asus motherbooard w/rear & front panel USB 3.0 ports. I used two USB 3.0 portable hard drives to test out the hub. One, a Seagate 500GB drive, and the second is a new Western Digital Metal 2TB Drive.

"Well-made 18"" X 12"" basketball backboard & hoop with included basketball for the price. Everything is metal, the door braces, the screws/bolts, the entire 9"" hoop including the breakaway part & it's large spring. The only thing that's not is the polycarbonate backboard (good choice to reduce weight & injury) & 1/2"" inch foam around the perimeter of the board & on the door braces to reduce noise & wear & tear on your door.  The about 5"" in width ball is a very mini version of a NBA, even has small nubs, but def on the cheaper side, but still thick enough to take some wear & tear & to do some damage if you're not careful. If the ball is too heavy duty, you can always buy a cheaper one or any foam ball under 8"".Setup:Almost all of it was already installed, even the over the door metal braces that the included instructions went over. All that was left was to slide in 3 bolts, tighten 3 nuts with included cheap wrench & put on net. Unfortunately, it didn't include a even a cheap hand-pump for the ball to inflate, so you'll have to ask a friend or buy one.Use:Depending on your doors, like mine, the newer ones can't close with it on, but the very old doors can.

"Our tap water used to be VERY hard, within months, large amounts of limescale, etc. I could never use tapwater on water fountains & I always hated the taste of the water.  I've been drinking distilled or if spring water, Poland for years. Dasani water gives me an instant headache due to either the substandard filtration of their tap water or the other ingredients they put in.We have a refrigerator with a water/ice dispenser on the door. It uses a $40 GE filter. The water from there tastes smoother then tap, but not quite as good as Poland or distilled. Family members use it, but I keep to distilled.Setup:The picture is somewhat stylish.  The lid is also cool, it has a spout cover that flaps open with water so you don't splash everywhere when pouring & a slider to open a hole on top to fill the pitcher with more water so you don't have to remove the lid to do so. Grabbing the plastic sealed filter, I noticed it has day/month on the back of the lid with a black slider so you know when to replace the filter. Great idea, except the slit for the slider was so ragged, the black slider was rubbing off plastic EVERYWHERE. I had to quickly clean off all the little bits of black plastic off the lid both on top & under the lid, it was everywhere. I cleaned out the pitcher & lid completely, soaked the filter & filled & rinsed the pitcher twice before actually drinking the water per instructions.Use:I was VERY surprised how quickly the water went from the top to filtered bottom. Seemed almost too fast, I didn't time it, but seemed like only take 30 min, maybe even less to filter the pitcher full.Taste Test:Two family members & I did a taste test of *tap, *Aqua Optima, *GE dispenser & *distilled. We all hated the tap immediately & could easily taste the chlorine & other things we couldn't identify. The Aqua Optima was only slightly better & we could still taste the chlorine & was nowhere near smooth like distilled. I knew it wouldn't be, but I was expecting halfway there. We tried the GE dispenser & surprisingly it tasted smoother then the Aqua Optima with little chlorine taste.I saw reviewers here question the filtration on the bacteria & if I can still taste chlorine, I seriously have doubts about the rest of the claims.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZLRMZ9Q2YBPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9WLKBY#wasThisHelpful","R1ZLRMZ9Q2YBPH","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Or you can also use the cheap wall hanger.Maintenance:Simple foam filter in vacuum has to be rinsed & air dry completely about once a month. You can also tap loose dirt from the foam filter between washes. Floor microfiber pad has to be cleaned with warm water in the washer or hand w/detergent & tumble dry low or line dry. Floor pad will have to be replaced every 3-4 months. If the rotating floor brush gets jammed, part of the bottom can be removed to get at the objects that are clogging it.Use:The ability to vacuum is about 80% as good as any upright or canister vacuum we have. We have a Mighty Mite 12 AMP canister & Hoover Windtunnel 3 Pro. But what the others don't have is this unit is so light & easy to use, easy to clean, and has a hand only use, or a hand & pole use to reach areas the other might not because it's so light. The only con/issue I had was to use the motorized floor brush, you put your foot on the floor brush itself to release it from the pole (held on by notch/tab only, so it angle forward like any other vacuum. But if you pull it too far back towards you, it will catch & lock back into the tab & be stuck to the pole again, and you have to put you foot on it again to release it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHVHZ3QZ4IJD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGVF0TQ#wasThisHelpful","RHVHZ3QZ4IJD8","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this in early 2009 & it still works, EXCEPT the LCD display. That started getting lines disappearing within about 6 months, first 1 line, then 3, 4... now only 5 lines barely work & only a few dashes of those lines. That means nothing can be programmed, no date, time or caller ID. This is not due to the AA batteries & the display never had backlight.  When it did work, it worked fine, though it did eat batteries. Now that the LCD isn't working, I barely ever replace the AA batteries that are needed for the speakerphone.The rest still works, all the buttons, etc. The speakerphone is very slightly distorted but very loud. The is one of the only phones I see with a HOLD button.

"Pros:Safety tip-over switch & overheat shut-off protectionVery smallStylish designKept cool to the touch after several hours useBuilt-in deep handle recess to easy carryLED light when on4 hour timer buttonVery quiet while in use.2 Heat Settings - low (450 watts) & high (900 watts) which is much lower electricity use most heatersFan only optionKeeps feet/legs nice & warm under a small, fully enclosed desk w/o burning the legs.5 year warranty- I have used Vornado's customer service (very nice people) before for an out of warranty heater. And if you're not happy with how they fixed it, they will repair it again w/o paying for shipping. They used to have amazingly great heaters even 5 years ago, but lately I haven't been happy with the quality of the units on the shelves or how they ""fixed"" it.Cons:No thermostatCould not keep a 9'X13' room warm that has 3 large, original pre-1930s windows w/winter curtains (room was already warmed to over 70* with a higher power electric heater {room is also heated with oil heat}, but within an hour it dropped almost 8*)Fan is a bit weak, only good enough right by your face when the weather is warm.Conclusion:Only good for tiny rooms, small bathrooms if it's over 50* out. Or else a small desk area that has enclosed sides right by your legs to keep your legs/feet warm w/o using a lot of electricity. That's why I even gave it 3 stars - low heat output, but at least low wattage usage.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRD3E2NM7P7GX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0WOOA6#wasThisHelpful","RRD3E2NM7P7GX","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Includes:Only the printer, 6 ink cartridges, and a power cable are provided. That's all, nothing else, not even a printed quick start manual. One of the ink cartridges is a large black container in addition to a smaller black one for photo prints. This helps reduce cost for printing.Main Features:All in one printer / scanner / copier. Capable of very high quality document and photo printing.Wireless Network And Mobile device Printing Support.Touch Screen display for ease of use with no computer required.Support for SD Cards and Sony Memory Stick.Duplex Printing for printing on both sides of the page.NFC Printing Support for Android devices.Airprint Support for iOS devices.How To/Troubleshooting:Instead of including a manual, on Canon's site, they have over 15 youtube videos about setup & troubleshooting which is new, and great, though using youtube is very unprofessional as google could take it down. There are also pdf basic manuals in several languages for both windows & macs. Two video on how to setup your wifi & several pdfs on airprint, google cloud & wifi printing.Initial Setup:First remove all of the packaging and orange tape on the printer.Initial Setup is simple and straight forward, especially help with the 3.5” touch screen LCD prompting each step you need to do. Plugging the printer in and opening the top cover reveals the carrier for the ink cartridges which simply and easily snap into place with a solid light on each cartridge confirming they're working and full.You have three different connection options to access the printer from a computer: 1) USB 2) Wired Ethernet or 3)Wireless Network. If you choose Wireless network connection to your main network which most people will likely do, you can do an automatic WPS connection, or manually connect by having the printer search for nearby wifi then manually entering the password.Paper Trays / Feeding options and CD Tray:There are two paper trays and a CD Tray. The bottom most paper tray without changing the default configuration will accommodate letter or A4 sized paper. If you take the paper tray out, press a button on the bottom you can extend the tray out for legal sized paper. Doing this will cause the paper tray to extend outside of the printer and no longer be flush. The paper Tray above that can be used for different sized paper in addition to traditional photograph sized glossy paper. Underneath this tray is the tray intended for CD Printing which you would front load in to the printer. When you pull out a tray and reinsert it, the printer will prompt you on the LCD display asking to confirm what paper type is in the tray, such as letter, legal, plain, glossy, etc. You can also disable this option if you never expect to change the paper types.Unfortunately there isn't a large manual paper feeder so all you get are the two relatively low capacity paper trays. This also means if you need to scan multi-page documents with the scanner you need to sit there and manually change each page at a time as opposed to it being an auto process if there was a paper feeder.Mobile Device Printing Support:Good news for iPhone / iOS / Mac users as this printer supports Apples Air Print. This printer is by fair the easiest to print from a mobile device if your device is an iPad, iPhone and so forth as with Airprint you can print directly from most apps on the device which makes life much easier, needless to say.You Can print from Android devices using the Pixima apps in the Google Play store called ""PIXMA/MAXIFY PrintingSolutions"". There are two main apps you will be using. One for Photo's and Documents and so forth. And another app for printing documents from web pages. For printing from a web page you can either copy and paste the URL from your browser of choice into the Canon Web Browser app, or you can do your web browsing directly within the Canon Web Browser app. Printing Photo's uses the other app which you can use to access photo's or documents on your device. You can also select the paper type and how many copies to print.If you have an Android Device with NFC built in, you can print by holding it up to the printers front right side. You still need the Pixima apps installed. I am not sure how well this feature works though beyond this as I did not have an NFC enabled Android device on hand to test this with.Some features available directly from the touch panel:You can do quite a few things on this printer without the need for a computer using the 3.5” color LCD touch screen display. Using the touch screen was easy and intuitive. There are menu options for each feature category you want to use. The first thing I ended up doing on start up was updating the firmware of the printer which is nice you can do this directly from the printer interface.The most common features people will be using is the copy function and the ability to print a photo directly from an inserted memory SD card or Memory stick. Unfortunately there is no USB memory support.Copying a document is incredibly easy, you lift the top cover over the flat bed scanner, place your document and choose copy and the number of copies. You will then see two new buttons appear on the black panel to the right of the LCD one for black one for color.If you insert a memory card into the printer you can browse through the pictures on the memory card and then directly print it from there.You can also scan a document without a computer, saving it instead to an inserted memory card, which eliminates the need for a PC.Using the *Advanced Print* You can print template forms, such as: lined paper, notebook paper, handwriting paper, graph paper, checklists, weekly & monthly calendars/schedules, etc. on A4, B5, or letter-sized plain paper.There are also various informational and diagnostic functions available through the LCD panel which include the ability to check printer ink levels and do print head alignment if necessary. There are also cloud printing services which I have not had a chance to try out.The Scanner:A big part of what makes this an all in one is the built in scanner which allows you to both copy and scan. As mentioned above you can scan directly to a memory card without a computer or you can scan a document from a connected PC. The top lid of the scanner can raise up to allow room for thick books, or removed completely if necessary. Scanning is very easy, you do a preview copy to outline what you want to scan and at what resolution, Then you do the final scan to save it.Photo and Document Print Quality:I have to say that photo's printed on this machine don't get much better than this. Printing some photo's directly from my phone directly to the printer looked exception with very clear vibrant colors and excellent detail. I couldn't ask for anything more and from using various different printers models in different brands, I have never seen anything better in terms of print quality. Documents also print out very nicely with good detail. The main downside of this printer is it's basic document printing speed is average to below average for printers of this type. And the small paper tray sizes mean printing large documents will mean having to change out the paper one or more times. On the plus side, you do have a duplexer, so you can do two sides printing which saves paper and will allow you to print a larger document while using less paper and the hassle of flipping pages manually. Also one other downside to this kind of printer is the cost per page tends to be higher than that of more business oriented printers. Although, on the flip side you will get better print quality. If you plan do do a lot of web page printouts you may want to consider using a generic ink for the large black ink canister which costs only a fraction of the price. Please note though that I've yet to try one of the generics personally, but I plan to at some point in the future to see how it works out.Summary and Conclusion:This Canon printer is a really nice overall package. From the touch screen color LCD which makes navigation and use without a PC a breeze. The photo printing quality is top quality and will not leave anyone wanting for more. Printing regular documents is average in terms of speed or maybe somewhat below average, so keep that in mind if you plan on printing many large documents. Also consider the somewhat small paper trays as very large documents may use up the paper quickly requiring you to do a refill before it is finished. The scanning and copying on the printer is excellent overall with the main downside being no manual page feeder so scanning large multi page documents will require you doing one page at a time. I am also not thrilled that there isn't a slot to use standard USB memory cards. Support for AirPrint has been a great addition though, and will allow Apple device users to easily print from most application without the need to install anything further.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W8OKSV7H4MY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOSGJHO#wasThisHelpful","R2W8OKSV7H4MY6","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Had this type of pen when I was a kid. Used to have a button on top to reset the ink choice. This new way of just sliding down the color you want works almost flawlessly. The black one for one of the pens would get stuck, letting the new color button go only halfway, and I'd just push the new color back up to reset the black.The ink flow is smooth enough, not the best, but so far no skipping, and much better then the really cheap pens.Made in France, the inks are refillable for 50 cents each plus shipping at Bic's website: WheresMyBic. com","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K8HWI2LW2TIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JFR8Q8#wasThisHelpful","R2K8HWI2LW2TIK","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Included:The unit comes in a sturdy, black, hard-shell, plastic case. It opens and closes nicely and doesn't feel flimsy. In the case you get your hand held meter, 4 AA batteries and multilingual instruction manual with registration card.Features:Checks Carbon Dioxide (NOT Monoxide or any pollutants) in PPM as well as Time Weighted Average, Air temperature, Dew point and humidity and Wet Bulb. Wet bulb temperature can be described as the lowest possible temperature you would feel if your skin was wet and wind was blowing against you.Optional PC support:There is a mini usb connector on the side of the unit as well as a DC jack to plug the unit into a wall plug (9V DC cable is NOT included). There is no software on the Amprobe website specific to this unit. The main purpose of the USB port is for downloading recorded log data of your readings off the device and onto your computer or spread sheet.Operations/use:At it's most basic, using this meter is easy to get it up and running inside a minute to find out your rooms C02 levels. You just insert the 4AA batteries and press the power button. There is a 30 second warm up time. After you see the warmup time the LCD displays the C02 and other readings. These reading will be high at first, so you need to let the unit settle for a minute or two after power on to show the accurate CO2 levels in PPM (Parts Per Million). If you're in a dark room or out doors you can turn on the LED backlight by pressing and holding the mode button until it activates.The LCD is split off into three sections with the largest section showing the CO2 PPM as well as the TWA and so forth. You can press the DP/WBT button to cycle between other displays and there is a min/max button to cycle between the lowest and highest readings you've gotten over the time the meter has been on.There are also built-in alarms if the CO2 levels rise over a given setting. Default is 1,000 PPM which the manual considers the minimal safe C02 levels without any reported problems. You can go into the settings by holding down the set button and reconfigure the settings. The manual describes a “enter” button of which there is none, you will be using the DP/WBT button for that function.Instruction and Calibration:The instruction manual is a bit lacking. It doesn't give very good descriptions of what the actual functions are and things like wet bulb temperature, so you're going to be finding yourself doing your own research to find out how to use the meters other functions more effectively. The manual also gives a basic idea on how to calibrate both the CO2 sensor, and a separate calibration for the humidity sensor, and using some kind of 20% salt bag which is not explained at all and most people will find themselves clueless as to how to do it. In all you really don't need to worry about calibration out of the box unless you see an obvious problem with the readings you're getting.It's a nice unit, but it's instructions are inadequate to say the least, the buttons/UI are not the most intuitive, and it could use a backlight on the buttons. It seems to work well enough and after checking my house readings, seeing it average 400-600ppm, I now have peace of mind as to the air quality in my home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15E6HHB933EN6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046HEFEU#wasThisHelpful","R15E6HHB933EN6","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Speck produces very well-made cases in different styles, textures for different phones for a while now, and this one is no different.I love the galaxy design, but my case had more a mauve pink & purple colors with NO blue. The galaxy image itself looked blown up and blurry compared to the pic shown here.The case has a snug fit that is a bit difficult to put on/off, but not too horrible. It feels very sturdy without adding too much size or weight to the phone, certainly smaller then the well known durable Otterboxes.The candy style has always had a very smooth finish that can be a little slippery in the hand, but not too much. It's still a lot less slippery then an iPhone without a case.It has a small lip edge on the front edge to protect against falls that would normally result in breakage of the glass display. It could be higher, but it's high enough for flat floors, or sidewalks with no pebbles.The only other con is the size of the headphone jack hole. It's too small for most jacks other then the included Apple headphones which have a very slim jack.Pros:Snug fit/slim case, good protectionCons:Small lip edge, Photo on case looks blurry/colors washed out, too small a hole for most headsets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A62RC2PMQFTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I862LEG#wasThisHelpful","R1A62RC2PMQFTR","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a basic black, stiff, vinyl pouch with TWO pockets with a velcro closure. It's tall & thin & barely fits an iPhone 5 w/it's case. But amazingly it does what it claims. I tested this by putting a phone in the back pocket where it would be covered on all sides by the gold mesh & did a test call. No ring or voice mail sounds. When I opened the pouch, I quickly looked & the network was just starting to find a signal, and then showed the voicemail indicator. While there's an airplane mode for that, what I liked was that the front pocket isn't lined on both sides & therefore can get a signal. This will protect a person from radiation being absorbed in their body as they wear it.Cons: Stiff vinyl, too small for bigger smartphones, no beltclip.Pros: actually works as claimed, small profile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BPISNWN7HLXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058FDCA2#wasThisHelpful","R1BPISNWN7HLXM","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Each pet towel is about 34"" long & 13"" wide. It has a cute dog print with bones design with a large pocket on each end to put your hand it to make drying much easier.They are much thinner then a hand towel, or any other cotton towel, but because they're microfiber, they are very absorbent.If you have dry hands or sensitive to synthetics, the fibers feel they ""catch"" on your skin, and cotton still feels smoother to the touch.When used on small/medium sized dogs, it did dry them faster then a regular bath towel, and it's much lighter in weight when wet. The pockets came in handy, and the dogs showed no preference over cotton over microfiber.These towels don't have to be used only on pets, they can be used on people or for cleaning, etc. At the price it is, for such a large size towel and a three pack as well, this is a great price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R5AHNGMDLS69/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002J7O9K4#wasThisHelpful","R3R5AHNGMDLS69","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Shiva Rea has many DVDs & even audio CDs & books. There are many youtube videos, etc. to look at if you don't know her. Her style is always a more fluid one movement goes to another style and in the past ones have incorporated freestyle dance. She's about listening to the body, but even her beginning yoga dvds are challenging to anyone who doesn't have strength, endurance & flexibility. If you don't have one of those, be prepared to pause the DVD for rest, or figure out how to modify the movements for yourself. Shiva's should not be for anyone new to yoga, as she doesn't explain how to do poses in depth that a person new to yoga needs to avoid injury. Don't get me wrong, her workouts are challenging, but she & her movement style really inspires you to listen to what your own body needs to stretch, and that is the most important.Production (music/lighting/camera/outfits, etc.) is professional as always, and Shiva sounds soothing in voiceover.

"If you were expecting basic ballet movements, there are other great DVDs to look for. This program is more about stretching, lengthening, toning & body awareness using smaller movements, in standing with or without a chair for balance, and some floor work on the second workout.The outdoor setting is beautiful with water in the background. The music is basic jazz that somewhat melts in the background, but has a good upbeat tempo that goes well with Sadie Lincoln's voice over to keep you going, not make you bored. The production, sound/lighting is high quality and professional. Sadie Lincoln has a very pleasant, encouraging voice without being overly perky & even mentions once in a while that some moves can be difficult.Burn & Firm - 34 minutesAll standing movements with some semi-fast back/forth leg movements to warm up at first, then toning of a lot of quadriceps with squats, hamstring & standing balances. You're mostly working just the legs, but the core & some arm movements are incorporated to get a full body workout & lengthen everything. For those with balance issues, Sadie shows modifications, but know this program is based on squats, and one legged balancing & body awareness.Lengthen & Strengthen - 33 minutesThis has some easier toning of the legs, but goes right into hands/knees, then side laying floor work with some additional twist sitting & side stretch poses. It starts with some easy standing back/forth leg movements, and then some easier basic standing toning/balances. You then go for the floorwork into balancing on hands/knees, the side laying leg diamond pose, very small bridge pose for a while. You use a towel under your hips for lifted leg movements, regular bridge pose, plank/slight pushups, side sitting stretches & standing forward bend to end.These programs won't make you sweat, they are more about toning, but they are deceptively difficult, and you'll feel the muscle aches the next day, especially in your quadriceps from the Burn & Firm workout.You can find three different clips on Youtube by: CollageVideo, TotalFitnessDVDs, AnchorBayFitness, or going to their respective websites.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IZ55OWHPASH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FEHCR1E#wasThisHelpful","R2IZ55OWHPASH4","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works well on the 360, Windows 7 was able to install drivers automatically when plugged in & able to play games on Steam.The 7 blue LEDs are VERY bright, you can have them on all the time, off all the time, or on only on vibration by pressing a small button on the back.The cord looks just like the wired MS controllers, in terms of looks/thickness/style, even has a breakaway portion near the usb plug, and has an added bonus of the cord being longer then the MS ones.The stylish, thick, sturdy, clear, simple plastic casing is very smooth, but not slippery. It seems very similar in overall size, buttons & sticks. I love that I'm able to see inside to the board/circuits of the controller, it makes you appreciate how it works.The button/stick layout are the same except the back & start buttons as you see are on a diagonal. The guide button is a picture of the logo, but the 4 outside quadrants light up green just like MS. The buttons are not all tall with no resistance, so those feel a little different, but work well. The sticks feel more snappy, yet loose compared to the slower/smoother MS ones, but they work just the same, just take getting used to.The vibration ability is strong/satisfying.The headset port works well just like MS ones, works well with 3rd party headsets as well.What's great about wired controllers is no alkaline or rechargeable batteries to worry about.I have been using this for a month on/off for several hours & have had no issues yet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM5RZ6LN9H1Z2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZKNT18#wasThisHelpful","RM5RZ6LN9H1Z2","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is instructed by Ashley Turner alone who does voice-over at a beautiful yard of a home or hotel by the water.There are two programs:Yoga for Strength - 33 minThis has a fast tempo piano music that doesn't quite fit with the session. I felt some poses she repeated too many times back/forth like a pilates program instead of holding them longer. I understand the back/forth to add flexibility, but felt she did it too much here, such as planks to low push-ups, or raising on your toes & down in chair pose. It can also be physically demanding with holding planks, push-ups & side planks all at once. This class is better for those who work out at least a little semi-regularly or more often.Yoga for Flexibility - 31 minI enjoyed this music more, it had some piano, but had a good tempo for the movements & had more Enigma feel to it then jazzy. Here, she really focuses on opening up your shoulders, spine, pelvis & hips in a more relaxing way, but not boring, nor so easy you don't feel anything. Her program is unique (I have viewed over 100 yoga dvds at minimum), and I really felt the difference in my joints after, the muscles felt more stretched out/looser.Meditation - 7 minI didn't care for this short meditation, though others might. The music was fast tempo jazzy & she repeated herself too often, saying the same thing over again, many times not even changing the wording.Overall, her style is a combination of the old, true style of yoga with saying the Sanskrit pose names, teaching Ujjayi breathing before each session, and a few spiritual ways of saying how to move your body, and words of encouragement to enjoy the moment and where you are. She also names muscles in their common Western way, and can be very descriptive on how to move your body, and where to feel the stretch, but also leave out some important information for those who are truly new to yoga. I'd say her style of teaching is 3/4 Western & 1/4 Eastern in .This DVD is best for experienced beginners or more of yoga, and those who workout semi-regularly or more.Collagevideo & Totalhealthdvds both have clips on their site, or you can also view them on Youtube.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPICNRH4LFZEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DLX766Y#wasThisHelpful","RPICNRH4LFZEN","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This unit is advertised as having a 4 amp charge rate, though I suspect that's spread between it's two ports, making it 2 amps each.

"Menu:The new navigation is totally revamped from the old, but once used to it, it's very easy to navigate (which you can do by controller as well.) It has a ""recommended"" song in the middle, the online multiplayer ""World Dance Party"" at the main top left, the Sweat mode at the main top right, the Shop on the main lower right & the Just Dance TV on the main bottom right. If you go to the right, you'll access the song list, which plays nearly the entire song if you stay on a selected song long enough.Uplay:Is located at the very top left which will take you out of the game & requires an internet connection. This Ubisoft interface isn't user friendly, but to unlock more songs on the disc as rewards for getting achievements you earned, you will be forced to deal with it. It's Ubisoft's way of forcing people to use their software/website for online multiplayer/content already on the disc that you paid for.Settings:You can change your avatar & check your progress at he the very top right where it says your name. You can also turn on/off Autodance (seeing your video clip of you dancing & can add special effects), Help, lyrics, pictos, share (your video dancing to the world), etc.Mojo points:You earn them as the same, but you can get extra for random songs the game selects, for singing while dancing, for dancing online (especially during daily ""Happy Hour."") Instead of randomly unlocking things, you can decide which song you want to unlock at your desecration in the ""shop"" area.Shop:You unlock content on the disc you earned w/mojo points & to buy DLC w/real $. Katy's ""Roar"" is free & waiting for you as soon as you pop in the disc.Sweat Mode:There are no long list of playlists, instead you decide the time (10, 20, 40 min.) which you can do the selected songs or just change one or all, or do ""Free Mode"" & just use the regular song list to choose your songs one by one.JTV:Just Dance TV wasn't working for about a month, but witht he new update, it is now. You can share with the world your video of you dancing & see everyone else who shared. It allows you to follow people, like a video, etc.Songs:The songs are listed left to right, when you click on a song, the song keeps playing (great addition), and you can choose the (1-6 different) modes you want, there are many new additions!Classic - the main choreography with more amazing backgrounds.Sweat - new choreography higher energy version which is great, more new choreography for these new songs.Mash-up - takes clips of old videos of dance moves of this game's & JD's 1-4 to make new choreography. I didn't like this as much as clips weren't always edited well enough to flow right & felt disjointed in the choreography to follow well at all. It's better then nothing though, but LOVE the other modes better as it's not clips smashed together.Sweat Mash-up - higher energy mash-upBattle - takes dance moves from 2 songs to battle against a friend or now allows you to battle the AI!Extreme - new choreography that has more complex dance moves then the rest, though you can still get a decent score if you're a beginner.On Stage - 3 person choreography to feel like you're the star with 2 backup dancers that has very easy choreography for the star & moderate choreography from the backup dancers, a great new addition! More new choreography for the star or follow the backup dancer.Mode w/a name of a month -  you have to unlock that mode in the shop during that month, if you miss it, you have to wait 'til next year.Party Master - DO NOT use any mojo points on this yet. This is to have a friend who doesn't want to dance be the DJ, etc. But so far it's not working on the xbox 360, wait until there's another update or Ubisoft says they have this working, it automatically is working on the Wii U which people have posted on youtube which shows, instead of the static pictograpms in this/past JD games, a moving smaller dancer previewing the next move. This was in Ubisoft's Hip Hop Dance experience & Black Eyed peas Dance experience, WHY is this not in ALL the dance modes?World Dance Party:Ubisoft finally added online multiplayer (even the Wii gets it). You will join in mid-way of a song when you start or be in a lobby voting for a song. You see your scores & those in your lobby on the left w/cartoon noises when someone enters the song. If you have ""share"" on & ""autodance"" on, clips of you dancing will be shown to everyone if you are #1 in scores for that lobby.Pros:* Still has VERY talented, ENERGETIC dancers (the most important thing in any dance game/fitness dvd)* Has online multiplayer!* New & MORE Modes - extreme, battle w/AI, on stage mode, sweat mash-up* Good menu system* Allows you to choose which song you want to unlock w/your mojo instead of being pre-chosen.* Sweat mode gives you more control over the song choices* Great background graphics, but rather choose more choreography content per song, over graphics* Songs in other languages, opens up more choices, good choices so far that are energetic & not too different from mainstream songs.* They added a song from an animated movie, very cute, opens up more possibilities.* They added a few great 60s/70s song classics.Cons:*Though I don't miss the boring music in sweat mode for the warm-up, cool-down, I do miss the choreography & wish they could have kept those from previous JD's in this one.* I had some issues with the game saying I was one dancer when it was actually tracking me as the other, especially in pre-timed sweat mode (where you can't decide which dancer you are once you start the timer/sequence.)* Possibly some tracking issues, I got perfects when I thought I didn't deserve it & Xs when I knew I should have gotten at least a good.* Some of the moves didn't flow like they always used to, I understand if they run out of basic moves, but I'm not against them redoing moves with the new dancers/songs so that the choreography flows.* They added a slow song like ""Careless whisper"" which wasn't fun, why add such a slow song??? There should never be any slow songs in a dance game.* Some jumping moves & others seemed WAY too advanced & was hit/miss if you can fake it enough to get a good score.* Loved the extreme choreography, but needs a tutorial or at least an ability to play at 1/2 speed to learn it. Having 1/2 speed on all songs to make it easier to learn wouldn't be a bad & easy to program option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KFVLUM0DUHO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8S4GNS#wasThisHelpful","R3KFVLUM0DUHO2","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Speck CandyShell Grip Case iPhone 5/5s - No slip w/great protectionThe design of this case in my opinion is really nice with great aesthetics. The case has a smooth glossy finish with grippy ribs in the back which creates kind of an hour glass look. The black and white color combo of my case offers a great look that will contrast perfectly with either a black or white iPhone.The case fits the iPhone 5 absolutely perfectly offering a seamless fit. Both the volume and power buttons are protected and function well through the case. The cut outs for the mute switch, headphone jack and lightning connector offer ample room. I have no trouble using the mute switch in the case and can use any of my headsets or power adapters with the phone.The Case offers a good lay on the table design with a small lip around the sides of the phone increasing to a larger sized lip as the screen ends which is nice as it doesn't hamper use of the touch screen. The texture to the black portions of the case have more of a rubbery grippy texture so no accidental slips while holding the phone.Drop protection is also fabulous, the iPhone in the case is like wrapping it in a rubber ball, providing a bit of a bounce if dropped even from a short distance.Edit 11/2014:Though the black silicon inside has held up, the outside white smooth plastic is so thin, it has cracked in pieces and fallen off on many of the edges and especially where there were any cutouts for the buttons or bottom. It also has hairline fractures alone the ribbing on the back as well. The silicon edge has even pulled away from the hard plastic rim of the camera hole. This has all happened within 8 months. An older version a friend has of the exact same model has held up perfectly for almost 2 years without any cracking.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XBTHGEOBOB5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0093IHXVE#wasThisHelpful","R2XBTHGEOBOB5X","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"NOCO Genius G7200 12V/24V 7.2 Amp Smart Battery Charger & Maintainer ReviewThe Noco Genius G7200 is a 12V/24V 7.2 amp smart charger. I got it mainly to use as a battery tender for my motorcycle battery, or to top the battery off if I accidentally let it die.Includes:Charger & two quick disconnect cables that use an eyelet style plug.The first cable has alligator style or jumper cable style clips. The second cable is meant for direct connection to your battery battery and includes metal connectors for the battery screws to mount through with a rubber base that shows + and - in case you're color blind.Both cables have in line fuse for additional protection.I had to cut off the included battery connectors from the wire and attach my own because I could not get the screw mounted to my battery, because they were too short and the rubber base with the + and - symbols made them too bulky.Charging modes & battery compatibilities:The Noco Genius is a very versatile unit in it's capabilities.* It supports both 12v and 24v batteries along with most battery chemistry types including Wet, Gel, MF & AGM batteries.* The Nico can be used as a basic battery tender or 13.6v power supply.* It also has a 16v burst mode for quicker charging.* Recovery pulse charging mode to recover deeply discharged and sulphated batteries.* Cold / AGM mode for cold weather or AGM batteries and more!* There's also a safety mode if you should reverse polarity but this only works when used in it's basic charging mode.Switching between modes is a simple matter of pressing and holding down the ""Mode"" button for a few seconds, then switching between what you want.For using as a basic charger to keep your battery topped off or charge your weak battery, you first plug the charger into one of the eyelet connector cables that's connected to your battery, followed by plugging in the unit. You then tap the mode button to toggle between 12v and 24v battery. There are labels on the top of the unit indicating all the different modes. My battery was already fully charged so all four indicators lit up indicating 100% charge.Overall this is a nice unit with nice many capabilities. I like that it comes out of the box using Eyelet connectors which are very easy and quick to use and can't be plugged in the wrong way by accident. The battery connectors could use a slight design change as I had to cut them off and use my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I3EWU96L1T29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LWTHP2#wasThisHelpful","R1I3EWU96L1T29","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Duracel Powermat Powersnap iPhone 5 Case/Detachable BatteryThis is an inductive charging case for iPhone 5 made to work with the Duracel Powemat or Travelmat products Duracell Powermat PM1PB1 TravelMat Travel Charger - Retail Packaging - Black.Included:Three part case - the main body, a small detachable bottom (added pic), and the battery.Case:The case itself is pretty poorly made, and designed. It's cheap plastic, it provides no lay on the table design (no protection to the screen if dropped on it), and with no texture, it's slippery in the hand, which is worse when the battery is attached. The cutout for the power button on top could be better as I feel it could allow for a little more space between the plastic cover and the button but it's okay.Bottom Piece:The bottom piece which inserts into Apple's lightning adapter wraps around it, leaving like a 1/4 inch gap at the bottom of the phone. I feel that there would be little shock protection in the event of a drop. The bottom piece also will give you problems using any other headphone jack then than something similar to the standard Apple Ear Pods.Battery/Charging:There is no way to charge the battery without a Duracel powermat accessory. You will need to remove the bottom piece to charge your phone without the power mat.  The cut outs for the side buttons are okay and give you decent access.  To use the inductive charging you simply place the phone while in the case onto your Duracel Powermat and you will hear a confirmation sound that it's charging. You can charge both your case and battery at the same time, or remove just the battery and to charge by itself on the power mat. With the battery installed it adds quite a bit of weight to the phone, easily near double. To charge you press the button on the back of the battery and you will hear a chirp indicating charge. To stop you press and hold down the button for a couple of seconds. I was able to fully charge my iPhone 5 and easily had around 20% left in the battery.Pros:Removable BatteryGive your iPhone full charge with power left to spareInductive charging is convenient/easyCons:Poor design of casePoor Shock and overall protection of your iPhone 5No way to charge battery or phone without buying a Duracel PowermatMust remove bottom piece of case to charge without powermat or when using certain headphones","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11OH3X9B9U3M6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIRLJPI#wasThisHelpful","R11OH3X9B9U3M6","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My grandmother had these when I was a kid & thought they were very cool. They are 2 1/4"" wide, but as a kid, I would cut them to make them narrower to fit & they still floated well. They last a long time just like a tea-lights, probably longer if you keep the oil filled. The length of a burn is more due to how much fuel (wax/oil) & how quick it burns down & if it's refilled, not how large the container is for say a wax candle.Also, most candles for the past couple of decades or more are made of paraffin (a sludge waste product from the petroleum industry), not animal fat or vegetable oil like 50+ years ago & therefore are toxic when burned.Paraffin is the major ingredient in most conventional candles and is a sludge waste product from the petroleum industry. It releases carcinogenic chemicals when burned. The soot/fumes are similar to that released from a diesel engine and can be as dangerous as second-hand cigarette smoke. This can contribute to serious respiratory issues like asthma.Other toxic chemicals, benzene and toluene, acetone, Trichlorofluoromethane, Carbon Disulfide, 2-Butanone, Trichloroethane, Trichloroethene, Carbon Tetrachloride, Tetrachloroethene, Chlorobenzene, Ethylbenzene, Styrene, Xylene, Phenol, Cresol, Cyclopentene are also found in the sooty residue from burning candles. Benzene is cancer-causing and toluene affects the central nervous system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U9MMECBKQXFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OFC6AM#wasThisHelpful","R3U9MMECBKQXFV","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great idea to reduce neck/shoulder pain & keep you from slouching which will also improve your posture. But the design could be much better.Size & Monitor use:This is 20"" wide total & 8.5"" deep.But since it slopes a lot upwards on the sides for style, that only leaves 12"" barely straight for your monitor stand.My monitor is 22"" w/a Y shape stand & it barely fits. The weight of my monitor also indents a bit the middle smoke gray piece making me worried if my monitor was slightly heavier, it would break the smoke gray piece away from the rest of the white frame.Also provides an extra storage area underneath:For your stapler, tape dispenser, etc.But the opening height is short at 2.5"" On the side where the legs are, it gives more clearance of 4"" from the desk which does not including the legs. So I can grab my office size stapler from the middle, but to get my heavy office tape dispenser, I can only reach it from the side.Great idea, but the design leaves much to be desired because the sloping restricts stand use & the plastic doesn't feel sturdy enough for larger monitors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R9SHGDUVM5VV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BZC41LG#wasThisHelpful","R2R9SHGDUVM5VV","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been looking for a stylus that responds well that has a smaller tip & though this works better then only one other stylus I tried, this is just a basic one.Size of Stylus/Abilities:About the width of a slightly fatter cheap pen, only a little bit shorter at 4"" including tip.It does NOT contain a cap for the tip (to keep it dust free), nor does it function as a pen at all or any other ability.Tip style/size:The tip is the usual rubber ball, wide large marker size & a bit squishy.Performance:I tested this back/forth with an ""iHome 2-In-1 Pen Stylus"" which has the same type of tip, but it's length is the size of an average pen, but very slim in width of both the shaft & tip compared to this Belkin stylus & has an ink pen on the other side.Using an iPhone w/protective screen film (film made the iphone less responsive since I installed it) & using the Sketchbook app, it was hard to see a difference in script or print handwriting. Both responded about the same (well) it terms of knowing you pressed down, though the iHome squished a noticeable amount more then the Belkin & squeaked across the screen sometimes. Both styli worked much better then my finger though.Overall, it's 6 on one hand, 1/2 a dozen on the other. The iHome felt better since it had a smaller tip, but the squishiness of the tip got in the way. The Belkin felt like it had more control with less squish, but it's tip felt way too wide like most stylus.Considering the price, there's no reason it couldn't have a cheap ink pen on the other side & a cap. But the stylus does respond well & doesn't have too much squish of the tip.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JY1L136Z5I1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00COTJXQC#wasThisHelpful","R2JY1L136Z5I1G","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Amprobe AM-570 industrial multimeter offers just about every feature imaginable in this type of product. It is truly geared to the seasoned pro but (with at least some basic knowledge) can be useful for the hobbyist as well (certainly in terms of some of the features). The applications for this meter are extensive (this is why it is primarily intended for advanced, professional use).It provides true RMS (can be considered essential) voltage readings, can detect stray voltages, can take accurate measurements on variable frequency motor drives (incorporating a low pass filter), and has a multitude of ranges (both automatic and manual).It can measure AC/DC voltage (up to 1000v), resistance, capacitance, frequency (Hz) and temperature (even differential temperature, since two temperature probes are included).It has a dual display (which, for example, can be used to monitor voltage and frequency simultaneously). This can be a very useful feature.Provided with the meter are:Test leads, temperature probes (with an included adapter which needs to be inserted into the meter prior to use), a Velcro strap (for the option of hanging the meter), a backpack material zippered carrying case, and even included, a 9v battery (already inserted). The user's manual (which, although somewhat concise, can be helpful to those unfamiliar with the extensive features provided) is written in six languages (including English) at 25 pages each.The meter has a retractable stand which has rubberized feet to prevent it from moving around as you manipulate the controls.The LCD display can be backlit (a very useful feature) and it even has an LED ""flashlight"" (for use in limited light situations). The LED bulb provides more light than I anticipated (a nice touch). Although it has no beam adjustment, it's still quite handy. It is accessed via the ""REL"" button.The safety ratings include: Cat IV-600v (for low voltage applications) and CAT III-1000v (for building related applications such as circuit breakers, distribution boards, outlets, etc.)My primary experience has been with Fluke meters (considered the standard against which other brands are measured). I was intrigued with this particular Amprobe meter, as it had so many useful/valuable features at a very reasonable price! Even though Amprobe is a reputable company, in all honesty, I was still skeptical (I tend to approach most products with a good deal of ""healthy"" skepticism).The AM-570 is about average in size (for a meter such as this) and weighs under a pound. It measures 7.2"" H x 3.5""W x 1.8"" D. The rotary switch has enough tension to prevent accidentally moving past a desired setting. The various buttons are ""rubberized"" and there is adequate spacing between them. The tension on the buttons is adequate. The overall layout of the controls is good.The LCD display was adequate in size, but wish it was a bit larger. It has a back-light feature (which is essential). You will need to hold down the ""HOLD"" button (no joke intended!) to turn it on, but it only stays lit for 10 seconds (even if you continue to hold down the button). However, I did find that the LCD display maintained good contrast at various angles to be able to read the screen. The plastic window covering the LCD display is capable of reflecting quite a bit of ambient light, so that can be an issue. The display will turn itself off after being idle for more then 15 minutes, and you can move the dial to ""OFF"" to reset it.The test leads are designed so that a minimal amount of the tip is exposed. This degree of insulation is very useful when testing tightly spaced circuit boards (and in various other scenarios). However, it would have been a nice feature to be able to remove the plastic insulators (so as to expose more of the tip) and then be able to re-insert them. This would come in handy for me, as I sometimes need to test AC at an outlet. These test leads make that option impossible. At least you can purchase accessory Amprobe test leads that will do the trick for this (or perhaps other) purposes.Pros:Extensive applications (includes true rms and temperature).Very accurate readings.Dual LCD display (which maintained very good contrast) and backlight.Sturdy, retractable stand with ""rubberized"" feet.Built in flashlight.Good control layout/controls have a positive feel.Durable construction.Includes (adequate) carrying case (which holds meter, test leads and temp. probes/adapter).Includes hanging strap.Test leads can be stored on rear of meter.Relatively lightweight.Cons:Would prefer larger LCD display.Backlight reduced contrast of display.Backlight remains on for merely 10 seconds (multiple button presses required for sustained backlight, which can be annoying).Rear cover would have to be removed (unscrewed) in order to change fuse.No individual covers for tips of test leads.Soft carrying case offers somewhat limited protection.Fortunately, these are relatively minor criticisms. Overall, I was impressed at the accuracy of this meter and the overall functionality. It appears to be well constructed and, hopefully, will withstand some bumps and bruises. It is encased in rubber (or a rubber like material) which should prevent it from damage upon dropping. The carrying case is of decent quality but is of the soft variety. I would have preferred a hard case but it will certainly suffice. Everything provided fits well inside the case and there's even a slot for the user's manual.In terms of ""bang for the buck"", this meter passes the test with flying colors! What it offers at the current price of $ 80 cannot be duplicated. I was reluctant at first, but eventually was very pleasantly surprised.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TS8XG4PZGOZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008E07LCS#wasThisHelpful","R2TS8XG4PZGOZW","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What's in the box:The Jot Touch pen, which includes an extra tip, the USB Megnatic charger, and in the back of the box you get the manual in the form of small cards (which is very strange).What it works with:This device WILL WORK with ANY capacitive touch screen as a BASIC stylus ONLY just like any other ""fat tip"" stylus, the buttons will not work, nor the pressure sensitivity ability. It won't require Bluetooth, nor use the stylus's battery, so you won't have to worry about that.BUT, to take advantage of the pressure sensitive function & buttons, you need to use with an iPad/iPad Mini that MUST have Bluetooth 4 support on/working. That means you can't use the 1st gen iPad with it.Design & Use:Feel:This is a nice looking stylus and mostly metal construction. It feels well made, sturdy, and has a nice feel in the hand. The Stylus has a cap which screws on or off both ends of it so you wont loose the cap. Because of the metal construction, if you're looking for a feather weight stylus you'll need to look elsewhere.Tip/Disc & Buttons:The difference with this stylus is the tip is very, very fine compared to almost all other stylus, and it also has a thin plastic disc around the tip so it can slide smoothly over your screen, and is attached via a spring loaded pin. It has two buttons on the bottom side of the pen, and a single status light which shines red, green or flashes to indicate what mode it is operating in.Charging:The end of the stylus magnetically attaches to the charger, and the LED turns on indicating charge & then plug the other into a USB port on a computer or USB power plug.Use with Bluetooth:I tested the Adonit Jot stylus on an iPad Retina using the Procreate app, making sure the Bluetooth 4 was on & linked to the stylus. You then go into the settings in the app to enable Jot support. You can then can define what function either of the side buttons will perform. By default it works as an Undo feature.Pressure Sensitivity:The pressure sensitivity is great when it works, allowing me to transition from thin to thick lines with slight changed in pressure as I write or draw. In addition to just drawing thin to thick lines I would draw patterns and increase pressure making the design get ever so much darker, adding a sense of depth. Even using this stylus in programs that don't support the pressure sensitivity had a boost in usability. I could much more precisely write, sign my name or draw far beyond what would be possible with a lesser quality stylus or your finger.Small Issues:From time to time, I had problems with the stylus not responding when I first started drawing/writing & would have to pick up the stylus & try again. I also had frequent problems with the side buttons not performing their pre-defined functions in Procreate. I wasn't able to test within other programs so I could not say if this is a problem with the Jot stylus or Procreate, but I'm more inclined to think it's a bug in the program itself.Conclusion:Overall this is a very good product, and it's fabulous to use. It's a serious disappointment that I can't use the pressure sensitivity with my iPhone 5 as there's no technical reason I can think of as to why it should not. I would give this unit 5 stars, but between the occasional glitches where the device wont work properly, and no iPhone, and only iPad support, as well as the price point, I take off a star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19HPWUMPJVSMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AO1L1RG#wasThisHelpful","R19HPWUMPJVSMT","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"OverviewThis web cam is intended to be run without the need for a computer, although you technically need either a computer, or a smart phone for initial setup, and access to a wired network jack. You can use this camera as a monitoring, or security device and it works in day or night time conditions. The software has motion sensing capability and notification. It's not weather proof so don't install it outside. The base of the camera is wall mountable and the camera can be positioned in any direction. There is also a built in microphone and speaker for two way conversation capability from the camera.Setup and Installation* The camera is powered by the included power to USB cable and USB to AC plug.* An Ethernet cable is included and needed for initial installation, although wifi can be used there after if you can get it to work. In my case the built in wifi would not connect to my Linksys 4200v2 router, but would work with a hotspot feature on my smart phone.I used the device on both my iPhone and my PC.To downlod the smart phone app search for ""eview"" in their respective app stores.If you will be using a computer to setup the camera, you need java (java. com), then login to www.Q-SeeEView.com to register an account. Make sure you say yet to the security prompts that come up for java or it won't work.Once I registered an account in the iPhone app I added my camera to the app by scanning in the bar code on the back of the web cam using my iPhone. Alternatively you can enter the serial.You can have multiple cameras added to your account.Camera Quality & General UsageVisual:The video quality is OK at best. It's only standard 480 VGA, doesn't have wide screen & doesn't have any focusing ability so nothing can ever get very sharp.At least the camera can auto selects between normal & night vision (b&w look) and that works well.Mic:It can turned on/off within the app so you can hear. You also have a mic button so you can speak to the person on the other end, though the speaker volume is not very loud & wouldn't be be heard in a noisy environment.Storage/Playback:If you buy/install a micro SD card, you can play back video from any specific time. The camera is supposed to work with up to a 32GB micro SD card. I installed a 4GB card into the camera but could not get the camera to record or get it's reply function to work.Pros and ConsPros:* Descent design, nice mount for easy positioning.* Does not require any port forward or configuring of your home router to work.* Good Night Vision* Motion Detection* Microphone so you can see and hear the video.Cons* Randomly goes off line on it's own* Wifi does not work reliably* Image quality is subpar* Recording playback did not workFinal ThoughtsGiven it's problems, glitches, the price & that there are better HD alternatives available from other company's that will work/setup more reliably than this camera I can not recommend this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDVZQUTLEHRB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B46A1VC#wasThisHelpful","RDVZQUTLEHRB8","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the boxYou get the car (12"" long X 8 1/4"" wide), remote, antenna pole & some extra clips.The car takes 6AA batteries and the controller 2 AAA batteries (uses a screw, not an easy tab to close the cover).You can control the car via 27 mhz frequency on 3 different selectable frequencies as A, B, or C.SetupAntenna -The antenna on the car is a long black wire, you unwrap the wire and push it through the clear pole and insert the pole in the middle of the car. You can also get away without using the antenna pole and instead use it with the antenna wrapped around the car but you'll get better range with the antenna wire propped up through the pole. The body of the car is attached to the car with 4 plastic clips, extras included.Batteries -are installed on the bottom of the car without having to remove the body where you also find the A/B/C/OFF switch. There is also a TRIM lever by the front of the car to adjust the steering of the car so it drives in a straight line. You can use up to three of these cars using each on a different channel.CONS* There is an off mode on the car but not on the controller which can eat up batteries.* Uses a VERY small steering wheel on handle design to turn left/right instead of the common 2 stick control. This is too small even for a short woman, much less an adult man.* The car is a bit slow by today's standards going maybe 3-4 mph tops which can be frustrating.* The turning radius going forward is terrible, requiring the full width of my driveway to do a full circle, though the car does turn more tightly in reverse.* Speed & steering is only on/off, no variation control at all, which makes it much less fun & almost tedious to control.PROS& Full suspension & 4-wheel drive.* Great Off-Roading ability - I can easily hop over 2"" curbs though slightly higher curbs will require me to enter at a slight angle to hop them. I can easily go on/off different forms of terrain and through thick grass.* The range is excellent even to the point where the car became too small to see & navigate well.* The car also drives straight and true with the trim set straight in the middle.Final ThoughtsThe car overall is okay, the off-road driving and radio range is the main reason I will give this car my 3 of 5 star recommendation. Otherwise the poor steering and slow speed may be a let down for many.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7L6VTV6PI789/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUM29XS#wasThisHelpful","R7L6VTV6PI789","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Spigen Slim Armor iPhone 5 case features a slim design, with a look intended to match that of the iPhone 5. It comes in two components, a plastic back & a rubber body. The plastic back can be switched out with different colors. The metal slate looks like a modest, understated almost black, similar to a black iPhone 5, though not exact. The gunmetal has more pop/style w/modern metal style.Installing the case onto my iPhone 5 is very easy. I simply start by putting the button side in first then pop the remaining portion in.The overall fit of the case is good & it offers a lay on the table design for flat surfaces. All of the buttons are protected and easy to use. There are cut outs over the ports, camera and speakers, though the cut outs are only just large enough to provide access & doesn't have much room for larger the very slim headset jacks or any docking stations, etc. This also can make getting to the  vibrate toggle as the cut out could stand to be a little bit wider.The feel of the case in the hand is okay, but the smooth plastic/rubber surface leaves me with a not very satisfying feel when handling the device in the case. The slimness & form fitting is good for those who don't like a bulky case, or have small hands.Overall this is a descent case, looks nice & offers you good drop protection if your phone lands on it's back or sides, though with the barely raised lip on the screen side, it offers minimal protection there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QU24UD93GCZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANALDWQ#wasThisHelpful","R1QU24UD93GCZ0","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Contains:30 Pin plug dongle heart monitor that connects to your iOS deviceEar sensor clip (w/shirt clip) cord w/2.5mm jack that plugs into the heart monitorA small cloth travel pouchGuide telling you what app to downloadCompatability:Works with 3rd & 4th Generation iPod Touch, iPhone 3GS/4/4S, all versions of the iPad. You can use this on your iPhone 5 if you buy an adapter from Apple that let's you use any iPhone 3/4 accessories. It's called a 30 pin to Lightning plug adapter (converts the old iPhone/iPad large plug to new iPhone/iPad small size plug).Setup:First thing you do is download the free ""Inner Balance"" program from the iOS App store.  Plug the 30 pin dongle to the bottom of your phone, then the ear sensor plugs into that via a headphone type jack.  The end of the cable then clips to your earlobe.  When you run the app for the first time it well ask you to allow the program to use the sensor.What it does:The purpose of the HeartMath sensor with Inner Balance software is to use controlled breathing techniques in conjunction with your heart rate to promote improved health, reduced stress, increased relaxation and well being, among other benefits associated with meditation.How the App works:You have no other choice in order to use this program but to do it in sessions.START a SessionTo start a session you single tap the screen, to swipe between the different screens you swipe left or right, to get a help screen you press and hold your finger on any screen, and to end the session you double tap.  When you first begin a session you are asked to start a journal entry for the session, beginning with your mood, represented by a smiley face icon.FINISH a Session:You can again select the mood, or optionally you can choose ""not now"" and skip creating any journal entry.Monitoring Screens:The main/(1) screen you will see consists of a Heart rate graph on top, a circle with a meter that lights up around it representing time, and how well you're doing, called ""coherence"" and inside is a breath pacer which looks kind of like a flower that grows larger and smaller and you pace your breathing accordingly.  You can also go into options changing how fast or slow the breath pacer works.Swipe to page (2) & you will see a different representation of the breath pacer.Page (3) is an ""inspirational photo"" (can be changed in the options), and the breath pacer is now a dot that goes left and right.Page (4) has your Coherence level, current length of time in the session, your achievement level in the session, heart rate and a graph of how your coherence has changed over time.The (5th)/last screen shows you your actual pulse rate, a computer graphical spectrum of what the sensor is reading, as well as your current coherence, length of time and current achievement level for your session which will continue to rise until you stop the session.Result Logs:You can review your prior sessions by clicking on the ""review"" tab on the bottom, it will show your sessions by date & give you the results page of each of those sessions when you select it. You also have the ""Journal"" tab on bottom to review or delete past journal entry's and see what your mood selections were.HeartMath Tab:It explains what Inner Balance is and how best to use it.  They recommend using it on a daily basis at least until you reach 300 achievement points or more for the day, increasing your difficulty level when your coherence goes above 80 to 90 percent.My impressions and final conclusion:Pros:The HeartMath sensor was easy to connect & use.You can see your heart rate change/your heart beat wave change as it happens.I can send the results screen to facebook, twitter, or email.I could see immediate results and feedback from the program in the form of audio and visual ques if my breathing was off or I become distracted.It's great it has 4 difficulty settings to further challenge myself and ability to breath and focus.As someone who's used meditation and focusing techniques most of my life I can attest to the effectiveness of this program and general advise it provides.Cons:There was some difficulty navigating around,  a bit clunky, but you'll get used to it.If all I want to do is quickly see my heart rate, I can't without starting a session.There is no multi-user support (no user login.You can't change the breathing rate without ending a session.All the prior result logs are bunched into one profile & the only way to differentiate is to note it in the journal entries when beginning a session.The results logs don't list time of day, only date & don't show the heart rate.Other that that it's a nice overall package, it could be a 5 if they did an update to address the cons. It's a good purchase for anyone looking a way to ease stress, relax, improve your overall health and ability to sleep.Youtube video showing the unboxing & use:""HeartMath Sensor For IOS with inner Balance Review and unboxing"" by Ben7Seven7youtu. be/ 7rmWcr3GXuU","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9GD8JOHJ2K85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLGDKF4#wasThisHelpful","R9GD8JOHJ2K85","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"IncludesThe packaging is very nice seems inspired by Apple inspired in it's simplicity and design.You'll find the cute little Wireless UnitA short USB Mini CableA USB Wall chargerA short RJ45 Ethernet cableA mini CD with the PDF documentationBasic Specs:Supports Wireless B/G/N up to 150 Megabits.on 2.4ghz only. As well as every security option currently available including WEP, WPA and MAC filtering. Acts as a wireless Access Point, Bridge, Repeater, Router or wireless adapter.This unit supports different operating modes as I will list below. By default the unit is in AP or wireless Access Point mode. Access Point mode is what I think most people are likely to use this device for. Access Point mode turns any wired network into a wireless capable network. This is also the easiest way to use the device as it requires no configuration or setup on your part. Lets say you visit someones home or hotel room and they only have a wired network. All you would need to do is plug the RJ45 cable from the wired connection into the unit. And the USB connector can plug either into the wall plug adapter or into a computers powered USB port. That's all you have to do, now connect to your wireless AP / hotspot with your laptop or tablet. The default IP address, SSID and Password are printed on the bottom of the device. Please note that the password is Case Sensitive.Additional operating modes are listed below. If you want to change the mode of the device you will need to login to the configuration page of the router. The default IP for the router is 192.168.0.254 the ID and Password by default is Admin and Admin. If you can't access the configuration page for the unit with it plugged directly into your home networks router, you will need to plug it into your computers wired port directly, and configure your TCIP network adapter from automatic to manual and set your IP address to192.168.0.120 (120 can be 2-253) and SUBNET mask of 255.255.255.0Performance of the unit in AP mode was very good. I tested it in conjunction with a TP link USB network adapter on my laptop and tested it throughout the house. I was able to get the full 150 megabit connection most everywhere I went and was able to make full use of my Verizon Fios Internet connections download speed of 43 megabit and upload of over 30Megabit.Overall this is a nice little device, multi-functional and very simple to use out of the box for the main function most people will be using it for. I give it 5 of 5 stars. You can read below for information on the additional modes of the device and how they work.The different wireless modes you can select and choose from and how they work.  AP - The wireless access point mode. You can set its parameters on the Wireless Basic Settings page and the Wireless Security page.  Router - The wireless Router Mode. The only wired port works as WAN.  Repeater - The Repeater Mode. It could extend the range of wireless network.  Bridge - The Bridge Mode. It could communicate with another wireless network.  Client - The Client Mode. The computer connected by Ethernet could get access to an AP by Client mode.AP mode is already explained above.Use ROUTER mode f you want to set up your own discrete wireless network with its own separate IP range. This is the only mode the devices built in DHCP server will be on.Use REPEATER mode if you want to rebroadcast the signal of an existing wireless network to extend it's range. In this mode you can use the default SSID of TPLINK or change it to the same SSID as the wireless network you're extending. You login using the same network security password as the network your extending. In repeater mode you can also access the internet by plugging your computer into the wired network.Use BRIDGE mode to turn an existing wireless network into a wired network. When you configure BRIDGE mode you will connect your computer to the wired network port. You can also connect wireless clients to the device while it's in BRIDGE mode, they will login using the same credentials they would with the device in Access Point mode.Use CLIENT mode if you want to use the unit only as a basic wireless adapter without it broadcasting or rebroadcasting it's own SSID for other people to connect to. Using the device in this mode requires you to manually set the TCPIP address of your computer to 192.168.0.0 the last 0 can be any number from 2 to 253. For example 192.168.0.110 And you would set the SUBNET mask to 255.255.255.0 You then login to the units configuration page via your web browser and using the ""site survey"" option select the wireless network you would like to connect to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWMSHDVNBKC0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PTCFFW#wasThisHelpful","RWMSHDVNBKC0Q","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Essentials 4 is a complete redesign from previous version and incorporates many features of their higher end Corel Painter X.Manual & Video TutorialsThis comes with an easy to read 120 page manual with full color photos. The program includes many videos showing you how to use the program AND step by step guides on many projects & other ideas on the many things you can do with the program.New/Photo LayoutsWhen you start the program you have a couple of layout choices. One simply brings up a blank canvas for you to paint on. The other allows you to use a source image to work with, or paint on top of as a layer.BrushesThere are many types including thin/think paint, water, pens/pencils, calligraphy, charcoal, chalk, pastels, crayons, and MANY more!You now have brush ""drawers"" that allow you to open different paint brushes in a tabbed interface. You see a sample of how the brush stroke will look for each given brush.

"These 34 AA mercury-free alkaline batteries came in the small, easy to open cardboard box you see, with 2 smaller thin cardboard trays wrapped in shrink wrap inside.I tested the batteries with a multimeter & they came out 1.61-1.63 each. To know if they last 10 years which is more then the usual 2-4 years, would take too long to test.Knowing it's mercury-free helps, as well as the packaging is a little more environmentally friendly/less expensive & much easier to open.The price listed is ($) 28, so they come out to be less then a dime each which is much cheaper then retail.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UIGN67GJUUOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AYE5EVC#wasThisHelpful","R2UIGN67GJUUOO","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Contains:A lightweight, plastic trimmer (size of an electric toothbrush) with the trimmer head attached, small, medium & long sized combs, and a brush. Also included is a second head that works as a conventional shaver & a single AA battery.Usage:Setup and usage is a breeze, you turn the shaver on by twisting the bottom piece that holds the battery into the ON position.Whomever said two heads are better than one got it right with this trimmer. The two heads easily twist then pull off.Trimmer:You get the trimmer head with which the 3 different combs attach. You trim your beard to varying lengths by stroking the comb up through your beard. It can take a little practice as holding the trimmer at different angles will alter the length of the trim so try to find the sweet spot and be consistent. Unfortunately, the size of the small and medium combs are virtually the same size, so it would have been nice to have a more significant difference between the two in terms of length options.Shaving:The unit has a conventional shaving head that will allow you to do a close, fine shave in areas surrounding your beard. The top of the mini head easily removes by pressing two side buttons together for easy cleaning.Battery:Using a AA is great as you can always find one around & using rechargeable are great. You can always toss a rechargeable AA once it can't hold a charge, unlike a lithium which would have made the unit unnecessarily expensive.Final ThoughtsBoth the trimmer and shaver heads work very well, it's inexpensive & it's a nice travel size.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38ER3YNWZ25J4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARF450E#wasThisHelpful","R38ER3YNWZ25J4","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used many Symantec / Norton Products for years. And in the last few years, Norton has rewritten and improved their anti-virus and security software from the ground up, removing the bloat and improving performance greatly. This latest rendition is no exception. Norton 360 multi device gives you a license to install on up to 5 different devices using your single license. Devices include: MS Windows or Apple Mac OS computers, or mobile devices (Android or Apple iOS).Installtion takes a minute or two depending on the speed of your computer. Once installed on my Windows PC and open Norton 360 you are greeted with a start screen featuring 4 different primary tasks: Securty, Identity, Backup and Tuneup. In addition, you have options on top to change the settings and preferences of the program.Security:This tab is where you will run your virus scans. Ranging from a quick scan of your computer checking virtal areas or a full system scan checking all of your files. It also has a facebook scan which checks your walls for potential virus infected links. You can slso have access to the Live update function which keeps your program up to date. Manage firewall if you're a power user and want to manually configure the firewall setting which blocks or allows specific types of internet traffic to and from your computer. And lastly, Norton insight which is feedback from other Notron users as to the safety of specific programs.Identity:This category allows you to configure Norton Safe Web, Antiphishing and Identity safe. Safe web checks the security level of web sites while anti-phishing can prevent you from surfing to known fraudulent web sites. Identity Safe is a password manager it can store your various passwords, and website login and other info including notes. Just be careful not to loose your password as there is no recovery option beyond a password hint. Identity safe is also available as a free standalone program.Backup:Allows you to backup files on your computer. When backing up you have the option of selecting where to backup to, dvd, external hdd, flash drive, cloud storage, etc. Once you've created your backups, in the event of a disaster, or simple accidental file deletion, you can easily restore any backed-up files or programs. An added bonus of Norton 360 Multi Device over the regular Norton 360, is it gives you 25GB of cloud storage versus 2GB on the regular version.Tuneup:This is where you go to defragment your hard drive, cleanup your registry, startup items and old temporary files.Mobile Apps:There are both some iOS and Android apps available, though the iOS apps have little value over what functionality is already built into the device. There is the identity Safe app, so you can use that to access you stored passwords and such.The Android apps on the other hand have far more value than the iOS apps. One being that the Android app has actual malware / antivirus scanning, which is more important for Android than iOS as iOS has fewer malware and vulnerabilities due to it's closed Apple ecosystem. The Android app also included the ability to remotely locate your device should it be lost, backup your contacts to the cloud, block unwanted texts and calls. If it's lost/stolen, it can also remotely lock and or wipe your device, as well as a sneak peek option which uses the front facing camera of your device to snap a picture of the person using your device.In conclusion Norton 360 Multi device is a really great product and a great value to those of you using more than just a couple of computers / devices. It is programmed well and not overly demanding of your computers resources. I've yet to get viruses on any computer running Norton. It's packed full of many features to keep your computer running it's best, and files backed up should disaster strike. I would give it five stars if not for more robust iOS products.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R145FPCUI48FEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ENDZ4C#wasThisHelpful","R145FPCUI48FEQ","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you need a high speed wireless adapter in your desktop pc look no further than the TP-Link TL-WDN4800.In the Box:Quick install guide.TP Link PC Card.3 screw on antennasMini Driver CDBasic Specifications & System Requirements:Runs on Windows XP, Vista, and 7. 32 or 62 bit.Dual band 2.4ghz and 5ghz Wifi up to 450mbps on either band.PCI Express interface (only needs smallest size PCIX slot (but will work in a larger slot).Supports Wireless 802.11 A,B,G and N so you've got all your bases covered.Supports all wireless encryption standards, WEP, WPA etc.Detachable RP-SMA Connector for the antennas.Setup & usage & performance:I used a custom PC with an Asus motherboard running an Intel Core2 Duo CPU and Windows XP SP3 with 4GB of memory. The PC (located in the basement) will be connected to my Linksys E4200v2 dual band access point located on the 2nd floor.1) The wireless card itself is very small and also includes a low profile bracket for installation in very small home theater style cases. I installed the card into an available PCI Express slot, then screwed in the 3 included antennas to the back of the card.2) I downloaded the drivers from the website versus using them from the CD (usually the software on a CD is out of date). The software installed smoothly and required a restart upon completion. After reboot I now see a signal bar icon on the lower right of my task bar.3) Clicking on the icon, I go to the middle tab and create a new profile by doing a ""scan"" of wireless networks and entering the security type. I created a profile for both my wireless 2.4ghz and my 5ghz bands.4) Overall performance was better on the 2.4ghz band as I had full signal strength and approximately 80% signal strength from the 5ghz band. I used a speed test site to measure my download speeds and on the 2.4ghz band I was getting my full 43mb download speeds while on the 5ghz band I topped out at 31mb. And in the status bar I would range between 160 and 250mb connection speed versus 54 to 108mb connection speed while on 5ghz. 5Ghz is only better when there is a lot of interference from 2.4ghz devices in the area. Usually 5ghz band is less congested and will offer a more reliable signal. Also if you're close enough to your router where you can get a full signal or if you get high gain antenna's that will also boost your reception making using the 5ghz band more viable.Conclusion:I really like this product overall. It works great, it's 3 antenna detachable design offer you the choice of using higher gain antennas for improved reception. The low profile design of the card and included bracket make this card an easy fit in any PC with an available PC express slot. Software install was smooth and painless. It will run on any version of Windows from XP on up. Just make sure you have the latest service packs installed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R354J0G8IMA488/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007GMPZ0A#wasThisHelpful","R354J0G8IMA488","AQF3D0KX5SFCM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQF3D0KX5SFCM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like these mitts.  I love the cheerful design of bright red apples against a dark blue background and the fact that the mitts are sold in pairs instead of the usual single one.  The mitts are made of 100% cotton; the color of the material lining the inside of the mitts is silver.  I have small hands, so these mitts feel roomy to me but sometimes, the large size makes picking up small hot items with them a little awkward. However, they are at least 2 inches longer than my old mitt.  They cover most of my forearms but don’t reach to my elbows.  Still, the extra length means more protection for my arms in case I accidentally bump into any hot surface while reaching into the oven.  Always exercise care when handling hot cookware. These mitts are thick, but they are not as heat resistant as mitts made with fancier materials like silicone.  For basic, standard quilted cotton mitts, The Kitchen Style oven mitts are nice to have around in the kitchen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EFEQ9FB1QKPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00975H390#wasThisHelpful","R1EFEQ9FB1QKPW","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book description of ""A Cup of Water Under My Bed"" caught my attention because of two reasons.  First, I thought that the author was too young to be writing a memoir.  For me, memoirs are autobiographies written by people over 70 years old.  The second reason I picked this book was its promise to be an insightful read on what it feels to grow up Latino in America.I won't grudge author Daisy Hernández for writing a memoir before she is 70 because after reading her book, I thought she had gone through life experiences worth telling no matter what age she is.  ""A Cup of Water Under My Bed"" is divided into three sections that cover Ms. Hernández's childhood, teen and college years and her employment with The New York Times as an intern and reporter. However, the book can be divided by themes too: language and religion, love and sexuality, money and class. Ms. Hernández's recollections do not follow a strict chronological order, but this should not be a concern to readers because the ""jumping around"" in time actually makes this memoir more poignant.The book doesn't disappoint in its insights, found through the author's thoughtfully described vignettes of family life in a house worth to be condemned, the memories of Ms. Hernández's mother, her tias (aunts) outspokenness, and her father's drunken outbursts.  If language is identity, then I can easily empathize with the author's feelings of displacement. By accepting English, she also internalized American values, but at the price of her own estrangement not only from the language of her parents, Spanish, but also, from their religion, values, cultural traditions, and beliefs. However, in spite of the cultural schism she experienced, her respect for--and sometimes awe at--the women in her family, her mother and her aunts, remained always strong.""A Cup of Water Under My Bed"" is Ms. Hernández's courageous confession about the multiple struggles she encountered in her quest for identity and belonging. This memoir is recommended to anybody who wants to understand what growing up in two worlds means.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW0EIURVZTZ0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807014486#wasThisHelpful","RW0EIURVZTZ0T","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't like listening to music really loud, but I was not happy with the sound quality of my laptop speakers.  Since I didn't want to deal with more wires, I decided to give Cyber Acoustics PS-2350 Wireless Mono Speaker a try.  The speaker is about 5 "" long.  You can stand it on one end and its footprint would be less than 3"" in diameter.  At the bottom, there is a plug that can be folded out and connected into a wall socket for charging the speaker. The other way to charge it is by using the provided USB cable. The speaker comes with instruction sheets in English, Spanish and French.Before pairing the speaker, it is recommended to charge it fully so I plugged it into a wall outlet, thinking it would take a couple of hours.  To my surprise, about 20 minutes later, the speaker's LED red light went off, indicating that it was ready for use.  When following the instructions for turning on the speaker and the Bluetooth pairing function, make sure you press and hold the button until you hear a melody.  I let go of the power button before the melody played and so I was not able to pair it on my first try.  The second time around, my laptop was able to find the speaker easily and they paired without a problem.  If you don't want to use the Bluetooth function or your device doesn't have one, but it comes with an AUX jack, you can then use the 3.5mm AUX cable (also included) to connect the speaker.For me, the Bluetooth connection worked well within 12 to 14 feet away from my laptop.  At 15 feet, the sound started to break down, so it is best to keep the speaker as close as you can to the source device.  The sound is surprisingly good for such a small speaker and it can fill a room, but it won't make the windows rattle. You can control the volume by pressing on the ""-"" and ""+"" buttons on the side of the speaker.I'm very happy with the Cyber Acoustics PS-2350 Speaker.  It is easy to pair (by the way, it pairs with only one device at a time).  It doesn't have to sit on my desk all the time. I can move it anywhere in the room as long as it's within 14 feet from my laptop.  It sounds good, and it can be plugged directly to a wall outlet for charging (no more cables, yes!).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G4VVKJOQ5XUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K4WAB30#wasThisHelpful","R2G4VVKJOQ5XUW","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found ""Rings"" by Rachel Church at my local B&N store and I had to have it.  This is a handsome, small book featuring rings from the jewelry collection of the Victoria & Albert Museum.  ""Rings"" offers a look at the evolution of ring styles and designs from 1200 to the present.  I felt in love with this book because of the old rings.  The contemporary ones were too artsy for me, but it was interesting to see how artists and designers can push the limits with innovative and unexpected ring creations.The sections on rings from the Middle Ages to the 1940s, each gorgeously illustrated with color photographs, were like candy to my eyes.  Among the types of rings pictured in the book are diamond rings, gem-set rings, mourning rings, commemorative ones, posy rings, memento mori rings, and signet rings.  Accompanying the beautiful photographs is a wealth of information on how rings were designed, created, worn, and their significance both as sentimental and practical objects throughout history.  I was particularly moved by the inscriptions etched on some of the rings. They were reminders of love, loss, mortality, or of hope, like the one made for a 17th century child that said, ""This spark will grow."" In addition to the rings, there are portrait paintings showing how rings were worn at a particular period of time.Rachel Church's ""Rings"" definitely belongs on the shelves of those who are interested in jewelry history and/or in collecting vintage jewelry.  This is a book I'll return to over and over again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M7E1OTT1TF4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1851776508#wasThisHelpful","R2M7E1OTT1TF4Q","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: 3.5 starsIn 1528, an expedition of about 600 men, headed by Panfilo de Narvaez, landed on what is now known as Tampa Bay in Florida.  Their goal was to claim the land for the Spanish crown and to find gold, lots of gold.  This ill-fated expedition is the subject of Laila Lalami's historical novel, ""The Moor's Account.""Ms. Lalami's story is told from the perspective of Estebanico, a Moor and slave to Andres Dorantes de Carranza.  Estebanico, along with his master, his master's friend, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, and the treasurer of the expedition, Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca were the only survivors of the Narvaez expedition.  In the novel, Estebanico sets up to write his account of the events in order to set the record straight since, in his opinion, the official account of Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca left out important details about the loss of the expedition, of their encounter and treatment of the Indians, and of their own adventures and misfortunes during the eight years they wandered through unfamiliar lands until they finally reached an Spanish outpost in Mexico.I have heard of Cabeza de Vaca, but his chronicle, the stories of the Narvaez expedition and of Estebanico were unknown to me until I read this book.  The survival story that Ms. Lalami presents through the eyes of the Moor is astounding. However, if I was not much surprised at the cruelties the conquistadores committed--and Estebanico witnessed--it was because I've read enough about them in the past.  But the ""Moor's Account"" is not only the story of a tragic expedition, but also about Estebanico himself.  He is a man who struggles with his fate as a slave, and yet, he still keeps, in a way, his faith in God and men.  And the book, of course, entertains the possibility that his final fate was not the one attributed by history at all.I found ""The Moor's Account"" interesting and even educational but, unfortunately, it did not captivate me.  Perhaps, if Estebanico's revelations were about the conquistadores' injustices, cruelties, greediness, selfishness, and inability to overlook class differences, then, as I said before, they were not news to me. However, the book is a well told story (though I don't understand why the author omitted enclosing dialogues within quotation marks), and it shows that the author has researched it well too since though she claims that the situations are fictional, they seem to fit closely with the historical events. Those who love historical fiction and this particular period in history will, no doubt, enjoy this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VUYBQG3BNG6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307911667#wasThisHelpful","R3VUYBQG3BNG6J","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Sometimes, they feel too tight and wearing them in hot weather, well, it makes you hot.  On the other hand, the Ace Knee Strap, which is 1 ¾"" wide, is adjustable, and I could tighten the strap to a level where I never felt like it could cut my blood circulation, and yet it would not slide out of place either.  Also, the inside of the strap is lined with a soft material so it doesn't chafe or irritate the skin.  However, if you wear it under clothing and you have sensitive skin, it may feel a bit itchy.  Pressure over the patellar tendon is applied through a small, firm gel pad attached to the inside of the strap and controlled by rotating a dial.  This strap is definitely far more comfortable than a sleeve.  And it seems to alleviate some of the pain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B6TVYKKD5D5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GR1TQJW#wasThisHelpful","R1B6TVYKKD5D5P","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's no doubt that reviews have become an influential and empowering tool for customers.  Business owners--big and small-cannot afford to ignore them.  Reviews may have a direct impact on their reputation, services and sales.  Today, it is not surprising that anybody with a business will seek them and fear them at the same time.Authors Gradiva Couzin and Jennifer Grappone have written ""Five Stars"" to help businesses harness the power of online reviews to their benefit.  Their book will help readers understand the importance of reviews as marketing tools and as sort of informal performance evaluations that will point them to areas where their businesses can make improvements. ""Five Stars"" also reveals the motivation behind those who tend to write and leave a review, and how potential customers and buyers are influenced by those reviews. The authors also have tips on how to get more reviews, on how to show them off, monitor them, and on how to deal with the negative ones.As a reviewer, I felt that Ms. Couzin and Ms. Grappone were accurate on what motivates people to review and on today's concerns over fake and unethical reviews.  If I were a business owner, I would certainly keep their book handy on my reference shelf.  If you have a brick-and-mortar business, this book will be especially helpful as it devotes a lot of attention on review venues such as Google+Local, Yelp, Angie's List, and TripAdvisor.  For online stores, there are suggestions on how to use ResellerRatings and Bazaarvoice.  And whether you're an online merchant or one with a physical presence, this book will introduce you to SEO (search engine optimization) to improve your business website's visibility to search engines.  ""Five Stars"" is a valuable guide that will help anybody navigate, understand, deal with, and use online reviews to grow their businesses and customer base.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5F4NDQQRCG8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118689445#wasThisHelpful","R5F4NDQQRCG8O","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first took the keyboard out of its box, I thought I had made a mistake because it didn't look like my Samsung tab 2 7.0 was going to fit in between the corner holders.  It was a good thing that I went to Belkin's website because I was able to find three pieces of information there that did not appear on the keyboard's box nor were included in the instructions card that came with it.The first piece of information was that the corner holders are attached to elastics that can be pulled out and stretched to the correct size of your tablet. The second one was that the keyboard needs about 2.5 hours to fully charge the first time you use it.  And the third one was the step-by-step instructions on how to pair the devices (this was my first time using Bluetooth).  I certainly would have appreciated it if all that information had come with the keyboard, but I guess it is common practice now to not include a manual or detailed instructions, and to expect the buyer to look for the necessary information on the Internet.  Once all the guessing was out and my tablet was paired, I'm happy to report that the keyboard works very well.  The keys are soft and responsive, and I like the fact that there are special keys to control functions such as volume, cut, paste and play/pause.  The arrow keys move the cursor around so that you don't have to use the touchscreen to select an app. The case is soft to the touch. When it is used as a stand, it is able to support the weight of my tablet with no problems.  The ""on"" switch, however, may be a little hard to reach if you have big hands.  I have small fingers, but I still have to use my fingernail to push the switch.Belkin's portable Bluetooth wireless keyboard is a nice device to have if you use your tablet to write a lot.  It has certainly made my typing long e-mails easier and more enjoyable.Note: the devices listed on the box as compatible with this keyboard are: Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7"", Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8"", Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7"", Google Nexus 7"" and Kindle Fire HD 7""","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11OLIQWJ65ESC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ETBHOIM#wasThisHelpful","R11OLIQWJ65ESC","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're a student of the English language or a writer, you should consider adding Orin Hargraves's ""It's Been Said Before"" to your reference shelf.  Hargraves makes it clear that his book is not a dictionary of clichés nor is it a comprehensive list of all clichés in the English language. But what his book does is to help you become more aware of the use and misuse of these common expressions.Mr. Hargraves organizes his selection of clichés according to how they are used in a sentence. The first four chapters are devoted to clichés that function as nouns, adjectives, adverbs, or predicates. In the last three chapters, clichés are divided into whether they introduce or follow a clause (framing devices), are used as modifiers, or appear in tandem.  He also rates each cliché on a scale of 1 to 5.  1 and 2 being a warning to the user to think whether the expression really says what he/she means. At the other extreme of the scale, clichés that rate 4 or 5 are considered ineffective and annoying by the author.As a writer, ""It's Been Said Before"" has helped me be more thoughtful about my writing.  Now I actually pause to ponder whether a phrase I've heard of or read in the newspapers and blogs is as effective as I think it is.  Many times, I tend to use them because they seem colorful and current.  ""It's Been Said Before"" may not be exciting reading, but if you're a writer, this book will help you become a more conscientious one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16E0U4TJE340S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199315736#wasThisHelpful","R16E0U4TJE340S","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading ""The Book of Unknown Americans"" left me with a lingering feeling of sadness because the stories in Cristina Henriquez's novel are not the success immigrant stories we all would like to hear about or would wish every one who comes to America could achieve.  And yet, the book is a testimony to every man and woman who has left their home country in pursuit of a better life.The main story in ""The Book of Unknown Americans"" is about two families, whose fates will be bound together by their teenaged children's Romeo-and-Juliet-like romance.  Mayor Toro has fallen head over heels in love with Maribel Rivera since the day he spotted her, shopping with her mother, at the Dollar Tree store.  The Riveras have recently moved into the same apartment building where the Toros live.  And it doesn't matter that the Riveras are from Mexico while the Toros hail from Panama, or that the other tenants are from Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Guatemala or Paraguay because what brings them together is their language, their dreams and their struggles to make it in America.As the Toros and the Riveras' story unfold, their neighbors, whom they occasionally meet on the street or in the hallway, are not just names for Ms. Henriquez.  They represent the ""invisible"" or the ""unknown"" Americans, the ones who have ""disappeared"" behind the American label of Latino. But Ms. Henriquez has structured the novel in such a way that every tenant in the apartment building has a chance to introduce himself or herself to the readers and tell their individual stories.  Some are illegal immigrants, others have already achieved U.S. citizenship. Some are earning their living by cleaning toilets while others are professionals.  Unfortunately, all are judged by their looks and subjected to discrimination.Though ""The Book of Unknown Americans"" focuses on the Latino everyman, it could speak for the immigrant experience in general too.  Many of those who have moved to the United States experience the ambivalence of missing the old country, whether it is Mexico or Vietnam, and the urge to fit in their new home.  They all must face ethnic stereotypes and deal with the limitations of their own cultures.  Ms. Henriquez's novel may end up on a tragic note but hopefully, readers will become more aware of the sacrifices made by those who leave their countries, families and pasts behind for the opportunity for a new start in America.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G9LFK7AK999L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385350848#wasThisHelpful","R2G9LFK7AK999L","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I found the Hogwarts Castle Snow Globe while I was shopping at B&N and I had to have it.  It is not really a ""globe"" because it is not spherical but it still looks great.  It is made of plastic not glass.  The snow globe is about 3"" tall.  Inside is the picture of Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, flying on his broom with Hogwarts Castle in the background. There is definitely a front and a back to this snow globe because only one side of the cutout figures is printed. What I like is that there is a lot of snow inside. A lot! So much that when you shake the snow globe, it looks like Harry Potter is flying through a blizzard. The little book has 8 stickers and all of them feature a view of the castle.  This is quite an affordable collectible that any HP fan will be happy to own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KL3E7MP8C4LQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0762449268#wasThisHelpful","R3KL3E7MP8C4LQ","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I rarely read biographies but I became interested in Paul Rosolie's ""Mother of God"" (Madre de Dios) because I just had happened to finish reading about a journey made by two Englishmen in 1834. They ventured into the Amazon forest to test the possibility of reaching the Atlantic Ocean by navigating the Pachitea, Ucayali and Amazon Rivers (""Narrative of a Journey from Lima to Para, Across the Andes and Down the Amazon"" by William Smyth and Frederick Lowe).  It is fortunate for us that what they encountered in the jungle and its rivers almost 180 years ago can still be seen today thanks to the interest, care, and concern of people like Paul Rosolie.""Mother of God"" is an account of Mr. Rosolie's experiences in navigating the Madre de Dios River as he searched for the Western Gate or the Garden of Eden of the Amazon jungle, a pristine area, untouched by men and modern civilization. He was only 21 years old when he undertook the trip and what an adventure it turned out to be!  But the book is not only about his amazing solo expedition but also about how he came to love and respect the Amazon jungle and all its inhabitants, human and otherwise, through his job at the Las Piedras Station.  But amid his vivid descriptions of wrestling down black caimans and of riding giant anacondas, there are chilling stories about the horrific effects that poaching, oil extraction, and human greediness and thoughtlessness have had on the delicate Amazonian ecosystem.  Because of the ongoing deforestation, he also emphasizes the importance of establishing national parks and of encouraging Eco-tourism in order to ensure the preservation and survival of the Amazon jungle.I'm glad that Mr. Rosolie decided to narrate this book not as a scholar but as a first-person account of an adventure. He brings to the readers both the breathtaking beauty and the rawness and violence of the Amazon forest and rivers.  You may be able to feel the adrenaline rush of his encounters with anacondas and jaguars or experience his surprise at the blue glow of the morpho butterfly wings.  But what remained in my mind when I finished the book was the thought of how fortunate the author had been that his thirst for adventure became united with a love for Nature in general and for the Amazon in particular in his teen years. At that age, his thrill-seeking needs could have turned him on to a very different path. Luckily for the forest and for us, he found the path that led to a cause and to a place of infinite wonder.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZHE81491Z7XK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062259512#wasThisHelpful","R2ZHE81491Z7XK","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This freshwater cultured pearl pendant turned out to be larger than I expected.  It measures about 1 3/4"" long from the sterling silver bead bale to the bottom pearl. The three baroque pearls are tightly threaded together with a wire and little silver beads are used as spacers in between the pearls.  The pendant is very stiff.  The 18-inch sterling silver chain is shiny but dainty. I think a thicker chain would have matched the pendant better. The pearls are very smooth but they look more like ""pearl beads"" than real pearls.  However, the necklace may appeal to those who like pearls and a look of classic elegance.  It is just that to me, the pearls appear to be a bit too costume-ish for a necklace advertised as fine jewelry because of the dye applied to them.Note: this necklace is made in China","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIGVF0F01PSV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GII0KJY#wasThisHelpful","RIGVF0F01PSV3","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It keeps all the control buttons accessible and there is a hole in the back for the camera.  The elastic strap keeps the cover closed safely.  The leather-like material feels smooth on the outside and soft on the inside.  The stitching is nice and even.  I like the tone of purple used for the cover. Not too light and not too dark.  The front flap can be folded into a stand to hold the tablet upright (in landscape position only) for hands-free viewing and reading.

"When I finished reading ""The Crane Wife"" I felt an urge to explain it to myself, which was kind of funny being that in the book, the mysterious Kumiko tells George that ""a story is not an explanation"" but a ""net through which the truth flows."" It is a net that ""catches some of the truth, but not all, never all."" I agreed with the latter but I gave myself permission to disagree with Kumiko about stories not being an explanation because if they bring to light a truth, however small it is, and we have an a-ha moment because of it, then hasn't something been explain to us through the story?  This is an instance, and if you allow it, an invitation to go beyond the surface and dig into Patrick Ness's new book for the deeper levels.On the surface, it is the story of George Duncan, Mr. Ordinary Nice Guy, divorced, father of a grown-up daughter, Amanda, who's also divorced herself.  One very cold night, George finds a beautiful but wounded white crane in his back garden. Putting aside his doubts as to whether he is dreaming or not, he frees the crane from the arrow that has pierced its wing.  The crane flies away. The next morning, a woman dressed all in white and wearing a little red hat walks into George's print shop and changes his and his daughter's life forever.  It is not hard to guess who this woman really is and if you love folktales as I do, it is easy to see how the plot follows the lines of those old tales where a deity in disguise stays on Earth to live with a mere mortal as long as a certain condition is met.  On a deeper level, for me, the ""fun"" of this book is in the uncovering of metaphors, themes and messages in the story Kumiko tells George, in the art they create together, and in their love relationship.  Yin and yang, Buddhism, Kwan Yin, as well as sacrifice, jealousy, creation, selflessness, and misericordia were a few of the words that came to my mind as I read this novel.For the first three quarters of the story, some readers may wonder where the book is going, especially in those parts where attention is shifted to Amanda's troubles, but the way Kumiko solves her dilemma makes up for the effort of staying with the book till the end.  ""The Crane Wife"" was inspired by a Japanese tale and it is in itself a tribute to folktales, those timeless stories that weave the fantastic with the human condition and to us, mere mortals who out of our imagination and dreams fashion them in the hopes to catch, as Kumiko says, some of the truth of who we are.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G0DUPNHFWPGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205477#wasThisHelpful","R2G0DUPNHFWPGX","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered OXO Good Grips Three-Ring Trivet Set because when it's time to put these three rings away, they only occupy the space of one.  They snap together easily and as one, they make a solid trivet that won't come apart unless you unsnap them first.  The rings measure 7 1/2"" in diameter; 6 1/4"" in diameter and 5"" in diameter. The tops of the rings are covered with silicone, which feels like smooth soft rubber and the underside is made of hard plastic with silicone ""feet"" that won't scratch your table or counter tops. One of the things I like a lot about this set is that as individual rings, they can be placed so that you can cool large cookie sheets and roasting pans on them. No more having to look for trivets that matches in height.  The surface of the rings do get warm after placing hot stuff on them so let them cool before handling them (though I have never experienced them to get hot enough to burn my fingers).

"Reading ""The Good Luck of Right Now"" is like reading a fairy tale. You know there's a happy ending waiting for you and the characters at the end of the book, but this is a modern fairy tale where actor Richard Gere is Bartholomew Neil's fairy godmother, I mean, fairy godfather who appears to him whispering advice and encouragement.  Bartholomew is 39 years old and has lived all his life with his mother. When she passes away, he's left with the challenge of building a normal life. He has never lived independently nor has he been in a relationship with a woman.  But he's not without friends.  He has Wendy, his grief counselor, Father McNamee, his pastor; Max who spits the ""F"" word in every other word, the Girlibrarian, Bartholomew's crush, and of course, Richard Gere, to whom Bartholomew writes long letters. In them, he confides his thoughts, secrets, experiences, fears, dreams and hopes to the actor.To the world, Bartholomew may be ""weird"" and perhaps mentally challenged, but he's a kind soul with a keen perception of the human condition and a believer in his mother's philosophy, the Good Luck of Right Now. The philosophy is simple: When something bad happens to you, something good is happening to someone else. The nice thing is that Mr. Quick interplays it with Father McNamee's belief that nothing is a coincidence, that everything is God's plan.  And as the plot unfolds, I couldn't help but wonder if the message might be that both beliefs are more alike than what we think.  But readers should not worry. This novel is not a heavy-duty philosophy lecture. It is about compassion, about realizing that even people who are ""damaged goods"" have a wisdom to share and that sometimes you have to pretend in order to get over the bad times or as the saying goes, to fake it until you make it.  Mr. Quick has added plenty humor (my favorite moment is when Bartholomew and foul-mouthed Max have their first group therapy together) to this tale to make it both thought provoking and funny.  By the time I finished this novel and for one second, I saw Richard Gere, smiling and giving me the thumbs up for having picked this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J0GVSQTLQMSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006228553X#wasThisHelpful","R2J0GVSQTLQMSA","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been awhile since a yoga workout has left me sore.  When my tighs, calves and butt started to ""complain"" just after I finished the first workout of Ashley Turner's Yoga for Strength and Flexibility, I felt that this was one that has really worked my muscles.Yoga for Strength targets the core muscles, upper body and will challenge your balance. This workout lasts about 33 minutes and just right about from the start you will find yourself moving through plank pose, side plank with one arm up, push-ups and about three variations of abdominal curls. All of that is included in the first 11 minutes of the workout. Next come the standing exercises with crescent pose variations that transition into warrior 3 pose and move to standing split pose. From there, you will do traditional chair pose and a variation that requires you to do it on the balls of your feet.  The final group of exercises involve warrior 2, extended warrior pose, bow, boat and wheel poses.The goal of Yoga for Flexibility is to stretch the shoulders, hips, hamstrings and back.  This 32-minute practice starts with head rolls, then to doing backstrokes and butterfly strokes with the arms, moving to a gentle standing back bend and then to squats.  Half sun salutations bring you to all fours where you do the thread the needle pose, cow pose and hip circles. From there, Ashley leads you through side and forward triangle poses, seated spinal twists with one leg extended and the other one bent, and horizontal splits where you bend forward with your legs as far apart as you can.The bonus feature is a 7-minute guided meditation, which you do in cross-legged position.  In this meditation, Ashley encourages you to focus on the breath and be witness to your thoughts. Her pleasant voice is very calming on all the practices in this DVD.  Ashley's cuing is also great and as she demonstrates the poses, she explains what muscles are working and where you should be feeling it as well as reminding you about breathing, practicing affirmations, and setting intentions.Thorough the workout, especially during the first practice, the instructor suggests alternatives for those who are less flexible or are not strong enough to do the more challenging poses. For example, she recommends staying in bridge pose instead of doing the full wheel pose. The Strength practice is doable but I feel it is geared toward ""experienced"" beginners to intermediate level.  It is assumed that you already know what cobra or downward-facing dog is.  There were no new poses for me, but it is how Ashley combined them that made this particular practice intense for me.  I like this DVD a lot and I'm very happy that it's now part of my yoga collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DDILCFFMWPCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DLX766Y#wasThisHelpful","R1DDILCFFMWPCM","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got the Harbinger Balance Trainer to strengthen my core muscles.  This soft plastic disc of about 13"" in diameter and 2"" high is ready for use right out of the box.  It is semi-inflated in order to provide a wobbly surface for you to work out. The first time I got on it, it felt like stepping on a couple of very, very fluffy cushions and that's why I like to refer to it as a my ""exercise cushion.""  If you have a pump, you can inflate it a bit more but the firmer the trainer disc is, the less challenge it will provide and you won't have to work as hard to keep your balance while sitting or standing on it.The exercises recommended by Harbinger in its online guide include squats, push ups, side and reverse lunges, walking, planks and core stabilizing progression.  This last one reminds me of boat pose, which is what I like to do on the trainer.  Some exercises require two trainers.  Harbinger warns against doing jumping or bouncing exercises with the disc.  Since the trainer provides an uneven and ever shifting surface, I would say to go carefully if you have weak joints or joint issues, especially when doing standing exercises.  After trying to do the walking, I felt it in my knees and ankles.  But using this trainer has certainly forced me to use my core muscles and my balance and posture are benefiting from that.  I don't even have to do an exercise move on it. Just sitting on it is a challenge and kind of fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYUZRIFDZQZCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00074H8D6#wasThisHelpful","RYUZRIFDZQZCQ","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was surprised by this movie that though it lacks sweeping views and pyrotechnics (I mean, battle scenes), it makes up by its touching feeling of intimacy. It is 1856 and in the forgotten town of Paita, an old, disabled woman earning her living by selling tobacco and sweets hardly wants to remember her former glory days, thirty years ago when her name, Manuela Saenz was called on either in disdain or in admiration.  However, prompted by a curious young Herman Melville and feeling that death is near since unfortunately, Melville's whaler ship has brought the plague to Paita, Manuela recalls her relationship with the Liberator, Simon Bolivar.The movie moves back and forth between the elder Manuela whose scenes are filmed in sepia tones and the younger Manuela, which are in color.  Viewers are witnesses to her first encounter with Bolivar, the tension that her infidelity and defiance provoked in her English husband, to her many separations from and reunions with Bolivar as he fought for the independence of South America, and to her courage on the infamous night of the murder attempt against the general.  But it is the elder Manuela, reading out Bolivar's old letters at times or dishing out her poignant comments at others, the one who brings all these flashbacks together and gives them meaning while at the same time, revealing that under her toughness and disappointment, her love for him still burns strong.Beatriz Valdez makes for a very convincing Manuela, both young and old.  Mariano Alvarez plays Bolivar well, especially during the scene when he's alone under the bridge.  I couldn't help but feel the sorrow that must have started to creep in Bolivar's heart as the reality of the murder attempt hit him and his dream of a united Gran Colombia started to fall apart. The few things I don't like about this DVD are that the English subtitles cannot be suppressed. They also don't make justice to the lyrical voice of Manuela and whoever decided to cut the elder Manuela scenes out of the Scene Selection deserves to be booed.  The R-rating is for some brief nudity; otherwise, this movie would be PG-13 appropriate.  This ""little"" movie is a commendable effort toward redeeming Manuela Saenz. Those who have never heard her name will discover this important historical figure, but I think viewers who are already familiar with Latin America history and Bolivar will be the ones to appreciate this movie better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK0C8462WRUON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008HC9M#wasThisHelpful","RK0C8462WRUON","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is rarely that I can play in my head the right song for the book I'm reading. Yet, with Andrew Sean Greer's ""The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells,"" it came easily: Barbara Streisand's voice reverberated in my mind, singing the line ""If we had the chance to do it all again, could we? Would we?""It is 1985 and Greta Wells is grieving the loss of her twin brother Felix to AIDS and the loss of her long-time boyfriend, Nathan to another woman. Alone and heartbroken, she longs to ""live in any time but this one.""  When pills do not lift up her depression, her doctor treats her to 25 sessions of electroconvulsive therapy. After each session, Greta wakes up to find that she has traded places with one of her other selves, one living in 1918 and another, in 1941.  Living in those years gives Greta the chance to experience not only different versions of herself (wife, mother, secret lover) but also of the people she loved the most in 1985: Felix and Nathan. In the past, she's married to Nathan; and best of all Felix is alive again.  Here is her chance to ""do it all again"" but with one difference: this is her opportunity to prevent mistakes and regrets, in other words, to  ""perfect their lives.""As I read Mr. Greer's novel, I decided not to be too concerned with the logic of how Greta was able to find herself in her other selves' bodies.  With that out of the way, I found Greta's challenge to face the social and cultural constraints of the times she found herself living in very interesting.  At times she irritated me, especially when with all her 1980s forward thinking and apparently insensitive to the social shunning his brother would suffer in 1918, she kept pushing him to acknowledge his sexuality.  I have to confess that I said ""Duh"" when it finally dawned on her that ""the time we live in affects the person we are.""  On the other hand, I also enjoyed slowing down and taking a moment to take in and ponder some of Greta's insights and questions she poses to herself and the readers.""The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells"" is a bittersweet story and a fascinating time traveling yarn with a twist. The novel is also a meditation on life, love, death, grief, relationships, marriage, authenticity to the self, and choices. For all of Greta's good intentions for a ""world in which nothing slips through her fingers,"" whether in the past or the present, she and all the other characters must face the consequences of their choices.  There is no such a thing as a perfect world except as Greta finds out, for the one that needs you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LW2OLCPW345Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062213784#wasThisHelpful","R1LW2OLCPW345Z","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As someone who grew up with the ""sanitized"" and bland school textbook version of the wars of independence in South America, I can say that reading the first volume of Lord Cochrane's ""Narrative of Services in the Liberation of Chili, Peru and Brazil"" was quite an eye opener.Published in 1858, the first volume of Lord Cochrane's ""Narrative of Services"" is centered on his service to the Chilean government and his involvement as Vice Admiral of the Chilean Navy in the liberation of Peru.  Lord Cochrane wrote his book to clear his name from misunderstandings, malicious rumors and accusations; to set the record straight for his actions during his years in Chile and Peru, and to address the outstanding monetary debt the governments of those two countries owed to him.Anybody interested in South American history will enjoy Lord Cochrane's  first-person account as witness and participant in the war of independence (even though he reminds readers that he's owed money for his services over and over again).  Through Lord Cochrane's detailed accounts of his exploits, I was able to glimpse the soul of a pirate--and I said it as a good thing--because he was a man who was quick to jump at any opportunity to capture an enemy ship, with or without the approval of his superiors.  But what I found most interesting about ""Narrative of Services"" was his feud with General Jose de San Martin.  Back when I was a school student, our textbooks painted General San Martin not only as a war hero, but also as a man of impeccable character. Lord Cochrane's portrayal of San Martin's behavior, actions (and inaction) in Peru punched some holes in my schoolgirl remembrance of San Martin's reputation. And yet, Lord Cochrane's descriptions of San Martin's failures have added a touch of human dimension to his image as a hero.Readers might feel that the ""Narrative of Services"" was an excuse for Lord Cochrane to toot his own horn, but they must forgive him because without memoirs like his, precious details of such an important time in the history of South America would have been lost to us and to future generations.Note: Lord Cochrane's spelling of Chile as ""Chili"" is neither a mistake nor a mark of disrespect.  He's using the old spelling of the country's name and one that was in use at that time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBETA5WMJAR22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084BBI5I#wasThisHelpful","RBETA5WMJAR22","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never worn a toe ring before so I was very excited to give this ring a try.  The ring is beautiful in its simplicity. The clear CZ heart is about 4/16"" at its widest and it is in a open-back bezel setting.  The sterling silver skinny band is shiny and smooth. The ring fits well on my middle toe. I didn't have to stretch the band open nor did I have to resort to the glass cleaner trick to slip the ring over the toe pad.  Although I was aware of it for the first two or three days I wore it, the ring never felt uncomfortable.  What I like the most about it is how nicely the little CZ heart catches and reflects light.  I thought the ring on my toe looked great, but I've decided to wear it closer to eye level because this ring on my pinkie finger just looks gorgeous.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VWXJXKF7CJNQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ABDS3I2#wasThisHelpful","R2VWXJXKF7CJNQ","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun app once I learned how to use it.  I needed a note app to jot down quick lists and random thoughts with my fingers. Handrite Lite fits the bill.  The first time I tried it, I had chicken scratches on the screen. It didn't work well with a stylus either so I went back to using my finger.  This time, it seemed to have ""learned"" or adapted to my finger pressure and though my finger writing was neither even nor perfect, it was readable. The more I use it, the better I get at it though.  It took me bit of a while to find my way around and figure out how to use the different toolbars. There are a couple of buttons I'm not sure what they are for yet. This is where I would have liked to see a help or tutorial section come with the app.  I would like to be able to look for what I need instead of waiting for the right tip to show up when I open a new note.

"""Get It Together: Organize Your Records So Your Family Won't Have To"" is specifically targeted to seniors, caretakers, and people facing deployment or serious illness, to help them organize their records so that important information and documents are available to their families should they pass away or become incapacitated.  However, I think this book would be useful for anybody who wants to keep his/her papers together.The necessity of having all vital documents (or at least copies of them) in one place and readily accessible became very evident to me after a tsunami threat that forced us to evacuate to higher ground in the middle of the night.  Only after we returned home did I realize that I had run out of the house not only without important documents such as passports but also without even the contact information for our insurance company.  Setting up the planner suggested by ""Get It Together"" before a disaster strikes can help readers in cases of emergencies too because when you're trying to outrun a tsunami or a hurricane, it is not the time to try to remember where you stashed away your insurance policy.""Get It Together"" is divided in two parts.  The first part is comprised of 28 chapters or topics. The second part provides the blank forms to the 28 topics.  The book assists readers in identifying and arranging personal documents (such as birth and marriage certificates) and then documents related to their children and other dependents and even their pets. Documents regarding to employment, business interests, memberships, bank and brokerage accounts, retirement and pension plans, social security, insurance, credit cards and debts, taxes, real estate, and vehicles also have a place in the planner.  Estate planning documents that should be included are health care directives, wills and trusts.  End-of-life documents are filed in the planner under these categories:  Durable Power of Attorneys for Finances, Secured Places and Passwords, Organ and Body Donation, Burial or Cremation, Funeral and Memorial Services, Obituary, and Letter to Loved Ones. Each chapter gives a brief overview and/or basic information on the topic. The book also makes suggestions from how to choose a health care agent to how to write your epitaph.  It also includes additional resources such as websites and books.  These additional resources are not necessarily related to Nolo.I found ""Get It Together"" to be a very comprehensive organizer and helpful as it keeps me focus since it takes the guessing out of what documents and/or information should or should not be included in the planner.  Instructions to fill out the forms are provided under the respective chapters.  Readers can use the forms that come with the book or download them from Nolo's website.  Forms are in Word and PDF formats and according to the website, are available to download until October 24, 2015.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MWOD8PO1K3M5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1413317537#wasThisHelpful","R3MWOD8PO1K3M5","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me say it straightaway:  This novel turned out to be way different from what I expected from the book's blurbs and description.  Let me be frank: Halfway through the book I felt nauseated.  Neither reaction had to do with ""The House of Impossible Loves"" being a ""bad"" book.  Technically, the storytelling is great. The writing is full of imagery that appeals to the senses, especially smell and taste.  What I could not stomach was how much the plot reeked of death and bitterness.Amber-eyed Clara Laguna is the latest girl in the Laguna family who must bear the family curse.  Laguna women are destined to be abandoned by their lovers and give birth to illegitimate daughters who will suffer the same fate as their mothers.  Unlike her own mother, Clara does not simply resign herself to her accursed destiny when her lover disappears, instead she exacts a revenge that will consume her and her descendants: her daughter Manuela, her granddaughter Olvido and her great-granddaughter Margarita.The first half of ""The House of Impossible Loves"" revolves around the dark side of the mother-daughter relationship.  For the women, each daughter is a bitter living reminder of the curse. As mothers, each of the women is brokenhearted and betrayed and as daughters, each is neglected and abused.  And so, mothers and daughters turn against each other, usually with deadly results. The garden of their mansion, Scarlet Manor, is a testament to the blood in their hands.  The second half of the novel is the story of Santiago Laguna, Margarita's son and the hope-for male who gives this family (and the story) and much needed break from their rancor.Author Cristina Lopez Barrios fills the book with abundant magic realism but what with incest and cannibalism and with people being shot, pushed out of windows, and poisoned, magic realism ceases to be ""magical"" pretty soon.  Except for a few instances, there is no sense of wonder to this novel.  Instead, magic realism serves to ""pretty up"" the dark bent of the characters' minds and makes their crimes the more gruesome.There is a lot of sexual desire but little love in ""The House of Impossible Loves."" For me, Olvido is the character that comes closest to gaining an understanding of what Love is.  They blamed the curse for their fates, but in reality they all had a hand in making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. As Clara haunted her descendants, I could not help but wonder if there is no worse curse than remaining a prisoner of one's own narrow mind.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JPYU1AU075KI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547661193#wasThisHelpful","R3JPYU1AU075KI","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like most readers who have picked up ""On Heaven and Earth,"" I did it because I was curious about the man whom the world now knows as Pope Francis. He has impressed millions with his humbleness, his approachability and down-to-earth personality. Basically, when I started reading his book-- co-authored with his friend, Rabbi Abraham Skorka, I was looking for an answer to the question lurking in the back of my mind, ""Is he the real thing?""In ""On Heaven and Earth,"" the then Monsignor Bergoglio and Rabbi Skorka enter in a lively conversation about issues that concerned their respective religious beliefs. Theirs is a friendly exchange of opinions on subjects such as God, the devil, atheism, religious leadership, prayer, guilt, death, euthanasia, the elderly, religious vocation, women, abortion, divorce, marriage, science, education, politics, communism, globalization, poverty, the Holocaust, and, of course, the future of religion. Together they find common ground and complementary views in all those areas and both emphasize the importance of sincere, respectful dialogue as the tool and the medium by which to bring about change at the individual and global levels.It is very encouraging to see how these two religious leaders validate religion as a personal, intimate experience with God and frown upon too rigid institutional structures and on those who claim to be the ""one and only"" true religion. Yet, they also see the mission of their institutions as passing on values, fighting inequality, bringing social justice, taking part in and being part of the culture.As for Pope Francis being the real thing?  After reading this book, I can say I'm impressed.  He and Rabbi Skorka agree that the main attribute of a religious leader is humility. He believes in opening dialogue with other religions.  He understands that pomp and rituals are not what religion is all about.  He is of the opinion that you must never turn a blind eye when sexual abuse occurs.  As for the expectation that women will be ordained as priests one day, from what I read in this book, I don't think it is going to happen yet.  Though religions adapt to the times, he believes that there is a legacy or patrimony that it is not subject to negotiation.  Having said that, however, I also feel that he is not going to leave women behind either.Although there are a couple of chapters that are specific to Argentina and the military government, most of the book is a must read for Catholics, Jews and for anybody who is interested in deepening one's understanding of our relationship with God and the role that religion may play in our lives today.Note: this review is based on the Kindle Spanish edition of the book that I purchased for my own enjoyment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JCMCXPVIFA5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770435068#wasThisHelpful","R1JCMCXPVIFA5H","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When art history student Menina Ann Walker ends up stranded in a dilapidated convent overlooking a village in Andalucia, little does she know that destiny is leading her towards the answers to not only her own mysterious past, but also to the story of five girls who had walked through the halls of the same convent almost 500 years ago.In ""The Sisterhood,"" author Helen Bryan deftly alternates Menina's modern-day adventures with the vicissitudes of a sixteenth-century order of nuns, who defy the conventions of their time to protect women and young girls from exploitation, social ostracism, and political and religious persecutions.  Through the Order of Las Sors Santas de Jesus' account recorded in their Chronicle, readers are taken from the Old World to the recently conquered New World.Reading ""The Sisterhood"" was like embarking on a grand adventure through time and history.  Pretty soon, I found myself drawing genealogical trees in my notepad to keep the characters straight.  The brisk-paced narration and the story of the nuns and their protégées held my attention to the end. Although the author does not name actual geographical places, by the historical hints she uses, I could imagine that part of the story could have taken place in Peru.  And so a few details made me squirm a bit like the characters seeing Chinamen at their arrival to an unnamed port and city in South America in 1552.  Even though there is evidence of Chinese contact in pre-Columbian times, it was hard for me to imagine a crowd of Chinamen in the City of Kings, seventeen years after its foundation.  However, such small details should not prevent anybody from enjoying Ms. Bryan's novel.  Beyond the mystery and adventure, the book is also a statement about the injustices women have suffered in the past and, unfortunately, still suffer today.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17MF5R6EHZXMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611099285#wasThisHelpful","R17MF5R6EHZXMB","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Como algunos de los lectores de ""Sobre el cielo y la tierra"" empecé a leer el libro con la curiosidad de llegar a conocer mejor al hombre que hoy el mundo llama el Papa Francisco.  El ha impresionado a miles de personas con su humildad y afable personalidad.En ""Sobre el cielo y la tierra,"" en aquel entonces Monseñor Bergoglio y el Rabino Abraham Skorka conversan sobre temas y aspectos que preocupan a ambas religiones.  El de ellos es una amigable charla acerca de Dios, del Diablo, del ateísmo, la oración, del liderazgo, de la muerte, los ancianos, la vocación religiosa, las mujeres, del matrimonio, del divorcio, la educacion, el aborto, la política, la ciencia, la pobreza, la globalisación, el Holocausto y por supuesto, del futuro de la religión.Ellos juntos encuentran opiniones en común y puntos de vista complementarios en todos estos temas y ambos enfatizan la importancia del diálogo sincero y respetuoso como un medio para iniciar el cambio a nivel individual y mundial.Es muy alentador ver como estos dos líderes dan validez a la religión como una experiencia íntima y personal con Dios y al mismo tiempo desaprueban la religión cuando sus estructuras son muy rígidas y también denuncian a los que afirman que sólo hay ""una verdadera"" religión.  Sin embargo, Monseñor Bergoglio y el Rabino Skorka también sostienen que la religión como una institución tiene la misión de pasar valores morales, de fomentar la justicia social y de ser parte de la cultura.Después de leer este libro debo confesar que mi respeto por el Papa Francisco aumentó.  Él y el Rabino Skorka estan de acuerdo que la más importante cualidad de un líder es la humildad.  Monseñor Bergoglio cree en diálogos inter-religiosos. Él comprende que la pompa y los rituales no son lo más crítico de una religión. Él opina que uno nunca debe hacer la vista gorda cuando hay abusos sexuales. Pero en cuanto a la expectativa de que algun día las mujeres van a ser ordenadas como sacerdotes, por lo que he leído en el libro, no creo que va a pasar.  Aunque las religiones se adaptan con los tiempos, Monseñor Bergoglio cree que cada religion posee una herencia que no se puede cambiar.  Aún así, yo siento que él va a dar un rol de importancia a las mujeres dentro de la Iglesia.El libro tiene unos cuantos capítulos que son específicos a Argentina y al gobierno militar.  Pero este libro merece ser leído por los católicos, judíos y cualquiera que este interesado en aprender más acerca de su relación con Dios y acerca de la importancia que tiene la religión hoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LLIPXGXG7OSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KD7D4Q#wasThisHelpful","R2LLIPXGXG7OSY","A32HAMICRE52M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32HAMICRE52M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For many years, I did not want to make the investment in this eye lighter.  I used instead a piece of sheet metal on a posing table, and I'd just push it up to my client and joke about it being sheet metal but tell them it would give them a bright glamour look.  Sometimes I'd have an assistant hold the sheet metal underneath the client in a curve to try to replicate the eye lighter.  And it worked well enough.

"LOVE Leonie's creative and beautiful planning books that inspire you and coax you into dreaming big and planning how to fulfill those dreams.  I mean, how do you not love a book that calls to-do lists ""A book of Magnificent Possibilities""?  I'm visual-- I love the water color splashes on the edges of the pages, the swirly scrolls, the lovely lettering and bright happy images -- it all motivates me.  I was also concerned the paper might be cheap and thin like a coloring book, and it is not -- it is perfectly acceptable paper.My one little beef is that the book is not spiral bound.

"I hemmed and hawed over the price of this bag (even 20% off on Ebay) but I am so glad I got it.  No buyer's remorse here, and I am known for my buyers remorse!!!I've owned a photography business for 3.5 years, and have gone through a LOT of camera bags.  Most of my working camera bags were too small, even though they look attractive, by the time I piled my second camera on top of the extra lenses the bags would look like a giant, overstuffed sac and I might as well be carrying an LLBean canvas bag or something.  I tried backpacks, but the access to my gear wasn't quick enough.  I tried a Jill-E rolling bag, but I couldn't always drag it (for example through a field of horse or geese droppings), and it was bigger and heavier than this bag.This bag is perfection!  Holds my stuff, protects and organizes it, and it's easy to carry (well, it can be heavy with a lot of stuff, so I wouldn't haul my gear through an airport with this, but for short walks between portrait locations it is great).  I can fit a ton of stuff in it (two flashes, two cameras with lenses, 2 extra lenses (four if I use the two buckle pockets on the front, but I try to limit myself to 3-4 lenses in total if I am on a senior portrait shoot) as well as my ipad, wallet, memory cards, photovision target, hoodman, and more.  The quality is excellent too, gear is protected by water proof canvas, it is well padded, and has double protection from the top -- the zipper and the flap.  The size -- it is just a little longer (maybe an inch) than my Kelly Moore bag, twice as wide, and a little taller, and has a boxy shape, maximizing the capacity of this bag to carry stuff without looking like you are hauling around a piece of carry-on luggage.Also, that flap over the top of the bag is really important when you are working from your bag!  I was at the beach once, and my client's foot ended up in my camera bag which was on my shoulder (no idea how that happened -- she was a lively tween dancing around) and the bag didn't have a flap and it cost me very close to the cost of this bag to repair the lenses (fortunately no sand got in my camera).Anyway, I don't actually know many people who own this bag -- probably because of the price tag!  But I think it is a really good investment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y59YNZ562PH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000BZLD4#wasThisHelpful","R1Y59YNZ562PH5","A2Z60PVKWFO3SW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z60PVKWFO3SW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had this bag for almost three years, so it has really stood the test of time.  It isn't leather, it is some sort of vinyl, and in the first month, I got rub marks in the vinyl around the top edges of the bag which was annoying, but they never got worse.Like most camera bags, you can move the two dividers around to change the size of the three pockets.  It has a zipper pocket in the back, two side slip in pouches, and two pockets with flaps in the front.  It holds a lot of stuff, especially if you overstuff it like I tend to do.My main beef with this bag is that it has three snaps to close it, rather than a zipper. I know this was a conscious design decision by Kelly Moore so a photographer could have ease of access, but I can never get the snaps to stay closed -- I guess I overstuff my bag -- and when walking about town I feel like a pick pocket would have easy access too!  Although, knock on wood, I've never been robbed.The other thing is if you want a camera bag to actually protect your gear rather than just cart it around, I highly highly recommend a camera bag with a flap.  The bag feels very open if you are, say, eating at a restaurant and don't want anyone to accidentally spill a soda in your bag.  Plus, I took this bag to the beach once, and one of my daughter's friends was playing around and ended up putting her sandy foot on top of my camera bag which was on my shoulder.  The sand got in my lenses and it cost over $300 to repair them.  I thought I was being careful by making sure it was not a windy day, not setting my bag down or on the sand, and yet, I somehow ended up with a tween foot in my camera bag.I am finally replacing my Kelly Moore bag with a Billingham camera bag, but it has a flap, it has a record of excellent quality, and it isn't that much more expensive than this camera bag, actually.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39TGI7OKZHR2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038UBI1O#wasThisHelpful","R39TGI7OKZHR2B","A2Z60PVKWFO3SW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z60PVKWFO3SW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"~ There is something here for everyone.~ For people who are new to the music of RHH, the first disc offers a career spanning 22 ""best of"" tracks.  Longtime RHH fans may quibble with the selection of tunes included here, but overall the disc gives a great synopsis of 25 years of RHH music.  Considering that the tracks were recorded in different studios over a long period of time, the sound quality is good and consistent.~ For those already have a collection of RHH music, the second disc offers his first ever live recording with 20 tracks.  As with the other disc in this collection, the sound quality is good. Considering that RHH's reputation is built more on live performances than recordings, it is interesting that this is the first live RHH recording.~ The third disc is a DVD offering a ""Live at Fillmore"" concert with interviews injected at various points. The interviews provide the viewer with some insight into the personalities of the band members and background on some of the songs.~ Highly recommended for longtime RHH fans as well as those who are new to the psychobilly experience.

"~ This book, published in 2012, is an updated version of a book by the same title that was published in 2001.~ The layout of the book is designed to present a roughly chronological development of guitars made in the USA.  The book is well researched and well written as the author discusses the innovative designers and manufacturers who have developed guitars in America since 1833.  It is nice to see credit given to these innovators and see how these innovations fit into the timeline that has led to today's guitars.  It is also interesting to see how many guitar manufacturers have come and gone over the years.~ It should be noted that the book does not go into the technical details of guitar design and manufacturing.  So if you are interested in those details, you need to look elsewhere.  This book is for someone who wants to have a historical perspective on guitars.~ Perhaps the feature of this book that will attract most guitarists is the multitude of photographs documenting guitars going all the way back to the 1830's.  Amazing to see these instruments.  Indeed, reading through the book is like taking a stroll through a guitar museum.  That aspect of the book is what makes this an excellent coffee table book and an excellent gift for guitarists.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GF87K6BPO800/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617130338#wasThisHelpful","R1GF87K6BPO800","A2FJCITRT7GQ0N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJCITRT7GQ0N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"~ Originally released in 1949, Gibson's ES-175 reached its full potential in the 1959 model that included PAF humbucking pickups and a rounded neck profile.  At that time and since then, the ES-175 has gained a reputation as the working artists jazz guitar.  Since 2012, Gibson's Memphis plant has been recreating this vintage classic as a Vintage Original Spec (VOS) instrument that is period-perfect in every detail: tonewoods, electronic components, and constructional details.~  The body is made from three-ply plain maple finished in either Vintage Sunburst or Vintage Natural, both with Gibson's nitrocellulose lacquer finish that has been processed for a gently aged look.  The set neck is made from solid mahogany with a bound rosewood fingerboard inlaid with characteristic split-parallelogram position markers.  For me the neck has a comfortably rounded profile, but some players may find it ""chunky"".  All I can suggest is that you try the guitar before buying.  The headstock has a mother-of-pearl Gibson logo and crown inlay along with a set of vintage-style, single-line TonePros(tm) tuners with amber tulip buttons, which add to the nostalgic appeal of the guitar.  The ""zig-zag"" trapeze tailpiece also adds to the nostalgic look of the guitar, as does the ""aged"" finish of the ""PAF"" humbuckers.  These re-created PAF humbuckers deliver a warm sound as close as you are going to get to the originals without spending a small fortune.  To add to the warm sound, the guitar uses a floating rosewood bridge, just as it did in 1959.~ The guitar comes with one or two humbuckers, depending your preference.  I tried both versions of the guitar before opting for the single pickup, which delivers the sound I want through my small limited edition amp with a hemp cone.  I bought my ES-175 at a store that had 10 of these beauties in stock, which allowed me to examine wood grain details before selecting the one just right for me.  I strongly urge any buyer to try before you buy.~ The guitar comes with a plush-lined hardshell case with silkscreen tan exterior and pink interior.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1385PIC4F1KSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BSA706#wasThisHelpful","R1385PIC4F1KSZ","A2FJCITRT7GQ0N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJCITRT7GQ0N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"~ It is hard to believe that the Four Tops did not record a Christmas album back in the late sixties or early seventies when their Motown contemporaries were doing so, but this 1995 Christmas album is a gem worth waiting for.

The arrangements are unique and refreshing, never overly sentimental, often fun, sometimes funky.  A lot of credit for the success of this CD has to go to the arrangers and producer.~ One of the things that is special about this collection of songs is that the great Levi Stubbs shares the spotlight with the other members of the group who get their chance to sing lead.  Of course, there is also some fine vocal harmonizing that is reminiscent of The Temptations at their best.~ On three tracks, the Four Tops are joined by Aretha Franklin.  Her style clearly contrasts with that of the Four Tops, and whether you view that as adding to or detracting from the overall impact of this CD will depend on your taste.~ Note: this CD has been released as ""The Best of the Four Tops: 20th Century Masters - The Christmas Collection"", ""Merry Christmas"" and ""Christmas Here With You"", but the are in fact the same tracks.~ Highly recommended as an addition to any collection of Christmas music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F9AC7WAF0SG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AMJDWO#wasThisHelpful","R3F9AC7WAF0SG2","A2FJCITRT7GQ0N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJCITRT7GQ0N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"~ It is hard to believe that the Four Tops did not record a Christmas album back in the late sixties or early seventies when their Motown contemporaries were doing so, but this 1995 Christmas album is a gem worth waiting for.  This 12-track, 57-minute CD consists of a nice blend of traditional, contemporary, and original tunes presented in a modern setting of strings, brass, and percussion.  The arrangements are unique and refreshing, never overly sentimental, often fun, sometimes funky.

"~ This 2012 book is an updated version of Tony Bacon's excellent ""Six Decades of the Fender Telecaster"".  Like all of his books, this one blends historical and current pictures with detailed, well-written, well-researched text to cover the history of the Esquire / Broadcaster / Nocaster / Telecaster guitars.  Of course, any discussion of the history of the Telecaster has to be closely related to the history of the Fender company and it's ups and downs.~ Interesting choice of three Telecaster models shown on the cover - the most prominent model shown on the cover is not the traditional Telecaster.~ There is a useful detailed collector's guide at the back of the book detailing every Tele made up to the time of publication.  The book contains is enough technical details to satisfy most readers, but for those who need more details about wiring etc there are other books available ,,, Telemaster A Wiring Guide For The Fender Telecaster.~ The book discusses several of the artists who have used the guitar.  One could quibble over which artists are covered in the book and which ones are omitted (notably, jazz guitarist Ed Bickert who extracted beautiful mellow sounds from his Telecaster).  One could quibble of the choice of images.  However, overall this is a highly recommended, entertaining and informative book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28UVXXYNZPV4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617131059#wasThisHelpful","R28UVXXYNZPV4G","A2FJCITRT7GQ0N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJCITRT7GQ0N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"~ This 60-minute documentary is part of the excellent PBS American Experience series.  It documents the life and times of Roberto Clemente from his birth in Puerto Rico to his untimely death on a flight to Nicaragua. While his baseball career is of course discussed, that is not the main main purpose of the documentary.  The main focus is on his experience coming to America as one of the first Latin American baseball players to appear in the major leagues.  The documentary deals sensitively with the prejudice he endured and how he rose above that prejudice to become not only an excellent athlete but a role model and hero to people throughout Latin America.  Indeed, most of the documentary deals with how Roberto channeled his energies into serving his community and his family.  Even today, decades after he died on a flight taking supplies to earthquake victims, he continues to inspire others.~ If Roberto Clemente had played out his career and retired, he would be remembered by a few as a great baseball player.  Instead, because of his pride and social conscience he is remembered by many as a great man.~ Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDZ7Q8ALNNL1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017DQF94#wasThisHelpful","RDZ7Q8ALNNL1M","A2FJCITRT7GQ0N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJCITRT7GQ0N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"~ This elaborately packaged 3-CD set documents two historical events - a pair of concerts at Carnegie Hall - and a seven-track studio recording that was used to supplement the original release of this material.  In total you get 2 hours and 51 minutes of historical performances by many of the luminaries of jazz, blues, and gospel music in the late 1930's.  Where else can you hear the only recorded encounter of Lester Young and Charlie Christian? Where else can you hear gospel singers and blues singers backed by the elite of jazz?~ The discs are accompanied by an extensive booklet commenting on the historical significance of the concerts and giving brief commentary on the individual tracks and artists.  A second booklet is an actual reproduction of the program that accompanied the original 1938 concert.~ If you are looking for modern recording quality, you will be disappointed, but if you want to be transferred back to 1938 - 1939 and get some sense of what was happening at that time in the world of jazz, blues, and spiritual music you will be pleased with this box set.~ If you are looking for a less expensive version of these concerts (with less music reproduced in inferior sound) try Spirituals to Swing: Carnegie Concerts 38-39.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R286UUM35U055Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000JT6C#wasThisHelpful","R286UUM35U055Z","A2FJCITRT7GQ0N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJCITRT7GQ0N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"~ For the low price of this book (less than $7 at the time of this review), this book is a bargain.  There are other more-comprehensive books covering the first 50 years of Fender history, but at a significantly higher price.~ If you want a book that covers the history of Fender guitars / amps / etc with a balance of photographs and text this is a good book.  The author covers the plethora of models that were developed, introduced, and in many cases discontinued.  He does a reasonable job of discussing the behind-the-scenes management changes and shifting cast of characters who contributed to the rise, fall, and rebirth of Fender - all without getting into the nitty gritty details that might disrupt the flow of the narrative.~ The last eight pages of the book provide a reasonable chronology and index.  There are more detailed chronologies available in the more expensive books, but for most people the information provided here is probably sufficient.~ The books does discuss several key Fender-using musicians, and yes it is possible to quibble about the amount of ink given to some musicians and the lack of ink given to others (or omission of others) but for the price the author has touched on the majority of key players and Fender guitar models.~ Recommended as an introduction to the history of the Fender company - 1950 through 2000.  Perhaps it is time that the author consider ""65 Years of Fender"" as a follow-up book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12SC9EP8O8WFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0879306211#wasThisHelpful","R12SC9EP8O8WFO","A2FJCITRT7GQ0N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJCITRT7GQ0N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"~ This book, published in 2013, is reminiscent of Leonard Feather's classic ""Encyclopedia of Jazz"" series of books from the 1960's and 1970's in terms of layout, subject matter, and attention to detail.  As such, Scott Yanow's book in time may very well take on classic status.  Especially if it is frequently updated, as Feather did with his encyclopedias.  In this day of digital publishing, frequent updating should be easy.~ The book starts with a 9-page introduction covering the history of guitar in jazz.  This section helps put the rest of the book in proper historical perspective.  The section also references several influential non-jazz guitarists.~ The next 210 pages covers ""342 Great Jazz Guitarists"".  Each guitarist is given a detailed write-up discussing style, influences, and impact.  The description of each guitarist includes a section ""recommended CDs"", ""LPs to search for"", and website (where appropriate).  Fortunately, the author has not limited the recommendations to sessions led by the guitarist, but has included recordings in which the guitarist appeared in a supporting role.~ The next 15 pages covers ""175 Other Jazz Guitarists on the Scene Today"".  The write-ups here are briefer than the previous section, but each description is informative.~ There is a four page section listing guitarists who were known for their contributions in other genres of music, but did record at least on foray into the world of jazz.  The books ends with some recommended videos and books that deal with the great jazz guitarists.~ So in this age of instant information on the internet, why should one purchase this book?  For me the advantage of the book is that it introduced me to guitarists that I may have never encountered otherwise.  I can read the brief description, be intrigued, and decide to explore this artists further.~ Yes, it is possible to quibble with the author about which guitarists were included, which guitarists were overlooked, the section of the book in which any given guitarist is included, or the recommended listening CD or vinyl LP selections.  However, these complaints or of minor consequence when viewed in the grand scope of this well-researched book.~ This book should not be confused with similarly titled Great Jazz Guitarists Part 1; Great Jazz Guitarists Part 2 (Great Jazz Guitarists 2); Fancy Fretwork: The Great Jazz Guitarists (Art of Jazz).~ A highly recommended reference book for jazz guitar fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27L5WUMFHQFL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617130230#wasThisHelpful","R27L5WUMFHQFL4","A2FJCITRT7GQ0N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJCITRT7GQ0N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"~ This book covers the first 70 years of Gibson electric guitar history; through 2007.~ The author has based the book on Gibson production, shipping and accounting records, old sales literature, and interviews with former employees, so the book is well researched - or at least as well researched as possible for a company that has changed ownership several times and a company that is notorious for poor record keeping.  Wisely, the author does not try to make sense of Gibson's method of assigning serial numbers to it's guitars.~ The initial 127 pages of the book is evenly split between text and photographs.  While the photo is extensive, it is not all-inclusive - that would require a much bigger and more expensive book.  This section of the book is informative with regards to the many changes in management, ownership, and philosophy as well as the introduction, elimination, and reissuing of the plethora of Gibson electric guitar models of the years.  The author does not hold any punches and is not afraid to point out Gibson's several failures in design and marketing.~ Following the 127 page history is a 30 page ""reference"" section organized be model name.  This section is useful for looking up specific models and trying to make sense of the changes that were imposed on that model over the years.  There may be a few models missing in this section (perhaps models that had limited production runs) but overall this reference section is useful and informative.~ The author, Walter Carter, has published several other guitar history books that are worth reading: Martin Guitar Book (Softcover), The Epiphone Guitar Book: A Complete History of Epiphone Guitars, Classic Electrics A Visual History Of Great Guitars, and others.~ Recommended, but I only gave it 4-stars because like any ""history"" book it is out-of-date by the time you buy it, or at least by the time I read it in 2013.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GPNEGJ6BXRC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0879308958#wasThisHelpful","R3GPNEGJ6BXRC8","A2FJCITRT7GQ0N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJCITRT7GQ0N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"~ Norman Granz: impresario, producer, manager, Civil Rights leader.~ Granz first made his mark on the jazz world by booking and promoting live jazz concerts, most notably his ""Jazz at the Philharmonic"" concerts from the early 1940's through the mid-1950's.  A key component of the JATP concerts was the ""jam session"" featuring several of the best known artists of the day.  Many of the JATP concerts and jam sessions were recorded and are currently available on CD.~ Granz carried the jam session idea from the stage into the studio on four occasions, resulting in the release of nine 12-inch LP's, all of which are collected in this 5-CD package.  While the live JATP recordings are exciting and a great historical document, they sometimes suffer from less-than-perfect sound, crowd noise, and histrionics by some of the participants.  The studio session do not suffer from any of these faults, but retain the excitement and historical significance.  The sessions that comprise this collection are often designated by the names of the most significant contributors to the sessions, and are discussed below.  Musicians vary from session to session, and an extensive 72-page booklet included in the package provides detailed accounts of each session as well as a brief biography of each participant.  The booklet also puts the studio session within the proper historical perspective relative to the JATP concerts.  For fans of artist David Stone Martin, the original cover art of all nine LP's are included in the package.~ Each of the sessions follows a format that had worked well with the JATP jams: A mid-to-up tempo blues, a ballad medley, and an up-tempo burner.  Granz always dictated the song selection and solo order, which always yielded good results in terms of featuring the strengths of each musician.~ ""The Charlie Parker Session"" was recorded on 17 June 1952 and originally released as ""Jam Session #1"" and ""Jam Session #2"".  This session, like the ""Eldridge-Gillespie"" session two years later, clearly demonstrates the penchant of Norman Granz to mix artists from the swing era with artists from the bebop era as Charlie Parker encounters fellow saxmen Benny Carter, Johnny Hodges, Flip Philips, and Ben Webster.  The combination works well because of the high caliber of the musicians and their willingness to listen.~ 18 August 1953 produced ""The Count Basie Session"" was recorded on 18 August 1953 and originally released as ""Jam Session #3"" and ""Jam Session #4"".  For this session the rhythm section of the Oscar Peterson Trio plus drums is replaced by Count Basie, Freddy Green, John Simmons, and Buddy Rich anchoring an all-star swing session.  The change in rhythm sections for this session adds a subtle change in the tone of the session.~ 2 September 1953 produced ""The Lionel Hampton Session"" was recorded on 2 September 1953 and originally released as ""Jam Session #5"", ""Jam Session #7"" and ""Jam Session #8"".  The presence of Lionel Hampton elevates the excitement of this session to a notch above the level of the other three sessions.  Indeed, this session is closer to the ""cutting contests"" that often emerged on the JATP stage.~ 30 October 1954 produced ""The Roy Eldridge - Dizzy Gillespie Session"" was recorded on 30 October 1954 and originally released as ""Jam Session #6"" and ""Jam Session #9"".  Like the ""Charlie Parker"" session, the meeting of swing and bebop styles on this session works exceptionally well.~ Highly recommended.  Having said that, I doubt that anyone is willing to pay the price currently listed on Amazon ... almost $800 as of August 2013.  Let's hope Verve re-issues the box set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTLH6QE4LYCUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00030EJSG#wasThisHelpful","RTLH6QE4LYCUW","A2FJCITRT7GQ0N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJCITRT7GQ0N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"~ ""Hello Herbie"" reunites Herb Ellis with his old mate Oscar Peterson - two thirds of the famous OP Trio of the 1950's.  In this case, Ellis and Peterson are accompanied by Sam Jones on bass and Boby Durham on drums.  The program is straight-ahead jazz with a strong taste of the blues.  Tempos range from mellow to rapid-fire but the music is always joyful as Ellis and Peterson are obviously enjoying this reunion after more than a decade apart.  Accordingly, Herb Ellis is given sufficient solo space, and the interaction between Ellis and Peterson retains all the magic and spark of old.

"~ Recorded in March 1962, this Count Basie septet session easily ranks at or near his best.  The front line of Thad Jones on trumpet, Frank Foster (tracks 1, 3, 5, 7), Frank Wess (tracks 2, 4, 6, 8), and Eric Dixon on various saxophones, flutes, and clarinet, and Count Basie on piano and organ is perfectly matched with the support of Freddie Green on guitar, Sonny Payne on drums and Eddie Jones on bass.  The septet is in superlative form on a variety of blues, standards, and originals.  The variety of voicings and textures provided by the multiple reed instruments provides an ever-changing quality to the music.  The drumming by Sonny Payne is outstanding throughout.* This recording is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.~ Oh, Lady, Be Good (Ira Gershwin) 4:40 ~ Basie's 1938 version of this tune is famous for being the recording debut of Lester Young.  In this 1962 version, Basie sets a bouncing dance tempo over which Dixon, Jones, and Foster provide sparkling solos.~ Secrets (Frank Wess) 4:08 ~ This jaunty track features Wess on alto flute, Jones on muted trumpet, Dixon on C flute, and some great brush work by Payne.~ I Want a Little Girl (Murray Mencher / Billy Moll) 4:16 ~ With Jones on wa-wa trumpet, Foster on tenor, Dixon on clarinet, and Basie on organ, this track is tune is taken at a slow melancholy pace.~ Shoe Shine Boy (Sammy Cahn / Saul Chaplin) 4:07 ~  This is an updated version of a 1936 Basie clasic with great ensemble playing by everybody.~ Count's Place (Count Basie) 5:28 ~ Typical Basie ... a catchy riff-based tune featuring some fine Basie piano and Payne drumming.~ Senator Whitehead (Frank Wess) 4:12 ~ With the same instrumentation as ""Secrets"" this piece dances along at a swinging fast pace.~ Tally-Ho, Mr. Basie! (Count Basie) 4:28 ~ Another great riff-based Basie tune with more great playing from Basie and his band.~ What'Cha Talkin'?

Slim also covers a few classics in his own style: Conway Twitty's ""Tight Fittin' Jeans"" gets a bluesy makeover; Moe Bandy's classic ""Soft Lights and Hard Country Music"" has a hint of swing; and Jimmy Buffet's ""He Went to Paris"" is given a melancholy reading.~ Highly recommended for people who like their country music shaded with the blues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KR0UVVYMQQBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EUEW2A#wasThisHelpful","R2KR0UVVYMQQBV","A2FJCITRT7GQ0N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJCITRT7GQ0N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"~ Following on the heals of their multiple award winning ""Watermelon Slim and the Workers"" CD of 2006, the band returns in 2007 with and equally engaging ""The Wheel Man"", which was nominated for another six Blues Music Awards.  ""The Wheel Man"" went on to with the award for Best Blues CD of 2007 while the band won the award for Best Blues Band of 2007.  On the basis of this CD and the band's spectacular stage show, Slim won the Maple Blues Award for B.B. King International Entertainer of the year in 2007.  ""The Wheel Man"" also was No. 1 Blues Album in England's Mojo Magazine blues CD poll.  With that many awards, it is obvious that this CD and this band are something special.~ Watermelon Slim has found a way to bring something fresh to the blues genre in the 21st century by looking backward all the way to the field holler and looking over sideways to country music, rolling it all up into a smart synthesis that sounds fresh and sharp even though it is only a half-step removed from the sounds of Charley Patton or Jimmie Rodgers.  Slim's compositions are autobiographical and intelligent as evidenced by tracks like ""Sawmill Holler"".  ""Jimmy Bell"" is old-fashioned storytelling.  In addition to Slim's compositions, there are a pair of impressive blues covers: excellent renditions of Slim Harpo's ""Got Love If You Want It"" and Furry Lewis' ""Judge Harsh Blues.""  Slim's Oklahoma twang that binds everything together and gives all of the blues a slight country feel.~ ""The Wheel Man"" is on par with his previous outing in every respect.  Highly recommended for anyone looking for a slightly-country flavor to their contemporary blues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GGQ9MHPEWDW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NJKYUE#wasThisHelpful","R3GGQ9MHPEWDW1","A2FJCITRT7GQ0N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJCITRT7GQ0N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"~ Following his sparse and arresting ""Up Close & Personal"", Watermelon Slim formed a new band of excellent musician, recorded this CD, and hit the road as ""Watermelon Slim and the Workers"".  The music on this CD reveals Slim to be a contemporary bluesman with a scholar's understanding of the various genres we call ""the blues"".  The sound on this CD is spectacular, and it presents Slim's insightful songs and passionate delivery in an intimate setting, making this release one of the best contemporary blues albums you will ever hear.  Drawing on his service time in Vietnam, his years as a cross-country truck driver, and an academic career (he is a member of MENSA with several university degrees), his lyrics are always interesting and his music is delivered in a way that shows his passion for the blues.~ The music ranges from the shuffling and stomping ""Hard Times"", through a laid-back""Dumpster Blues"" to a spooky ""Devil's Cadillac"" to the rollicking ""Juke Joint Woman.""  Not everything is written by Slim, as he takes time to pay homage to Fred McDowell with ""Frisco Line"".~ On the basis of this CD and the stage show by this band, Watermelon Slim and the Workers were nominated in 2006 for six Handy Awards in 2006 in a variety of categories, and for a Maple Blues Award from the Toronto Blues Society.  In early 2007, this album won in The 6th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Blues Album.~ Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ61SB3CU5FJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E0LMBC#wasThisHelpful","RZ61SB3CU5FJE","A2FJCITRT7GQ0N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJCITRT7GQ0N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"~ ""White Trash Girl"" by Candye Kane (released in 2005) is all out fun.  Nine of the fourteen songs come from Candye's pen; as such they are autobiographical and reflect her ""live life to the fullest"" attitude.  The remaining five songs are well selected to fit comfortably into the flow and attitude of the CD.  All of the songs are fun, insightful, and sometimes shocking.~ The musicianship is very good and Candye's voice is strong throughout the 14 songs.  Like all of Candye's CDs there is a broad variety of styles of music ranging from straight ahead blues, to a touch of country swing, to pop covers.  Compared to her earlier releases, this CD is perhaps a little more in the vain of straight ahead blues, but overall there is a little something for everyone here.~ As strong as the CD is, it just cannot live up to her dynamic stage show - especially with the wonderful Laura Chavez on guitar in her current band.~ Recommended 42 minutes of good rockin' fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AYLUSVUXZKQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00076QGIW#wasThisHelpful","R3AYLUSVUXZKQ3","A2FJCITRT7GQ0N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJCITRT7GQ0N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a product by Belkin, which is a trusted brand of mine. This particular item has more than 2,500 reviews already on Amazon, so you have it all, from 5 stars (the simple majority as I write these words) to many 1 star reviews.The truth is that I could have given this an easy 1 or 2 stars review, but it would have not been completely fair. The problem -major problem though- with this dock is that depending on what phone case you have, it will not have the phone sitting and charging. This is, of course, a major concern, because the main function of this dock is for your phone to be charging while it sits. The current case I have in my iPhone case (both iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus) is such to prevent this dock to accept my phone completely in, so it won't charge. So for me it is useless.I have an old case that did work, so I changed it and it works fine. You can also take your phone out of the case and have it charged without a case, and when finished, put it back. But this is a big pain in the b.This is a very beautiful dock, and when it works, it works very well, but be aware of my comments above, because chances are you have a case that will prevent your phone to sit properly in.

"Paul Hanson is a great instructor, and this book is a proof of it. Paul Hanson was the writer of the Guitar World magazine section ""BOSS The Pedals that Make the Tone,"" which was among the BEST content I've ever read in this magazine (unfortunately, GW does not have this section any more, they just give you TABS but with no tips on playing, tips, etc which is too bad ... I'd hope they would read this review and reconsider!).I like Hanson way of teaching the examples, and the overall layout of the book. I feel I am improving, although this is shredding guitar, so don't expect gains overnight. The companion CD is a must, I'd say.

"Some of the reviews I read are negative, which is surprising but, at the same time, something I do respect. IMHO, when it comes to sound there is nothing set on stone; it all comes down to personal taste. My very fist guitar pedal was a BOSS (actually it was a distortion pedal, but not this one), and I still have it and use it. BOSS builds quality lasting products. This company is owned now by Roland, which is mainly known for their keyboard line. I don't see any compromise in quality, though, and the tone (which is the most important aspect of getting a guitar pedal), is top notch. Again, this is for my personal taste. If you like other pedals, it's great, but trashing this product just because you don't like it, it's kind of not fair.I specifically wanted to add this particular DS-1 pedal to my pedal board because Joe Satriani and Tom Morello, two players I am into a lot lately, use them (or have used them in the past), and I am getting exactly what I was looking for.If there is one downside to pedals is the price. Once you buy 5 or 6 different pedals, you are looking at hundreds of dollars, and that kind of sucks, but as far as my taste goes, I like stompboxes better than other systems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TGT8UNKY4SNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002CZV82#wasThisHelpful","R1TGT8UNKY4SNE","AH1KJ45IQTM4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH1KJ45IQTM4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an exciting gadget, pretty much indeed. I'd even say it's more exciting than 3D printing technology. However, as the 3D technology, there is still a long way ahead for these printers to work great and be consumer friendly.You may have read other reviewers giving up after so many hours of frustration with just the setting up. The frustration is real. I didn't want to give it up and, after 2 long days of fighting with it, I finally got this Curio think to do something for me. I printed letters some cool letters (big though) and was happy with it. The problem is, when I tried to do more sophisticated cutting, every time the paper was messed up by the cutter.So the setting up is very frustrating, and the results inconsistent, thus my 3 stars rating. The machine is not bad; I could not give it 2 or 1 stars and be fair with it, however, there is, as I said above, a long way for these companies to get this right. I was wondering if the company should have waited a little bit longer for the prototype to be released, so it gets more consumer acceptance. We will be definitely using this cutter, but we would only hope for all the things it says it can do, that would actually be possible to be done.

"How can a watch be priced at $650, but be sold for 87% off? Because it is not worth $650. Is it worth $87 (current price while writing this review)? Maybe.The things I like about this watch are the leather strap (genuine leather strap, usually a $20 value at the mall if you want to have a new strap in any of your watches), and the dial color. It is a kind of black, grey, bluish ... hard to describe but definitely very beautiful. The size of the watch is perfect for my wrist (I have small wrist because I am kind of skinny). The watch looks classy once worn, really nice.The things I don't like much, thus my 4 stars rating. The clasp system is a little bit confusing. It takes some time to figure it out (no instructions provided for that), although once you get it, it is fine. Basically you lock the clasp in one position, and it stays in that position unless you change your wrist size. But why would you need a clasp system on a leather strap? The other thing I really don't like about this watch is the operation and function of the date, chronograph, etc. To begin with, the numbers and letters are so very hard to read because of the tiny size, and because of the color chosen in designing them. Also, because they distract you from the real beauty of the watch, which would be its simplicity. Bottomline, a watch that is worth something between $50 and $75, but that it is not among the watches I am planning on wearing the most.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BV9TTX7E4YSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QYCJDC#wasThisHelpful","R1BV9TTX7E4YSD","AH1KJ45IQTM4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH1KJ45IQTM4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using CoQ10 for a while now, every since a neurologist recommend it to me. It's kind of expensive (being expensive a really very subjective adjective), but the benefits of CoQ10 are many. ""CoQ10 has been studied for use as an antioxidant to protect cells from damage. CoQ10 has been used in combination with other antioxidants. Early study suggests that it may have antioxidant benefits in people with heart disease."" I noticed CoQ10 helping me with my cardiovascular function and my levels of energy and stamina. I am a very active person, by the way, and I find this to be in accordance with that level of activity and in resulting a more energetic me after a very long day at work and at home. This bottle is 150 pills of 100 mg each, which is the daily dose I take. It comes with Bioperine, which helps CoQ10 work better. It basically increases the bioavailability of nutritional compounds such as the one found in CoQ10.

"I don't know when the BRITA company came into business, but I've used BRITA filters for a very very long time. Every once in a while (about 2, 3 years), I replace my BRITA pitchers, so they are in prime shape. I have always been extremely satisfied with the water quality I obtain out of them, and I can't stress enough how strongly I recommend them. Bear in mind, though, that the quality of the water you obtain from these products depends in large part of the quality of your local water. Nevertheless, a BRITA filter will greatly help you obtain the best quality water you can get in your area, that is for sure.What I like about this particular pitcher:1. Its small size, only 6 cups. This is a positive aspect of this pitcher because I bought it for my office. I have a small refrigerator there, and this fits perfectly. Moreover, it assures me I get 6 cups while at work, where I spend about 8 hours or more every day. (I drink about 10 cups of water a day, so this is 60% of it, already. Before I go home every day I want to make sure this is empty. Then I refill it and it is ready for the next day).2. The colors. This is a black pitcher, but the combination of black with the transparent pitcher makes it look like a beautiful grey. A really nice touch in the design department!3. Locking lid for spill-free pouring. A nice improvement over old models.4. This comes with a filter change indicator that has also been improved over old models. However, I will admit I don't care much for this feature, because I always change the filter every 8 weeks, regardless of the use I give them. (I actually know that I could use them a little bit longer, but I rather change them more often than not). By the way, this is a new BRITA pitcher model, so it comes with the newly designed filters. I recently bought another BRITA pitcher, the Brita UltraMax Filtered Water Dispenser (which is absolutely AWESOME-A-MA-ZING!), and it also comes with the new filters, so I can buy a box of filters and change them every other month.I hope you found this review helpful. I you don't own a BRITA pitcher, I highly recommend you getting one. You may start with this one, or with any other of the other products available. You will sure find the one that fits your needs. I strongly recommend BRITA products, no hesitations, extremely long time satisfied customer!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O1FE4JUJ6GTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAG8ME4#wasThisHelpful","R3O1FE4JUJ6GTU","AH1KJ45IQTM4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH1KJ45IQTM4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an outstanding trimmer, which I mainly use for body hair. I used other products in the past, but this one is dedicated to all men's hair, including body, and I must say it exceeded my expectations. Legs and chest were a breeze with this Panasonic trimmer. I did buy the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Nose Ear Hair Trimmer in the past, as the number one hair trimmer for men. Obviously, that is for ear and nose, but this one is a beast for the whole body. You could probably use it to shave your head even!Panasonic has proven me they know what they are doing when it comes to trimming. Do not waste your money with the junk they sell at the cashier lines at you know where. Get a solid and durable machine like this Panasonic, and you are set to go. This product comes with a nice travel case, and power outlet for charging (it works without it, so perfect for traveling), and different size trimmers.I highly recommend this product to all men looking for the one trimmer to get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I9IS6PB0VQSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TO54PAI#wasThisHelpful","R2I9IS6PB0VQSX","AH1KJ45IQTM4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH1KJ45IQTM4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"No nursery is complete without this heater. At least, no nursery in cold weather cities like mine! This is an exceptionally well-built heater that is all about safety and convenience. But safety first, that's for sure. This is finger-friendly, with no pinch points. It's got a curiosity-proof child lock switch, and the cord is hidden and covered. There is an automatic shutoff system by which the unit shuts off let's say if there is a blanket on top of it, or whenever excessive heat is detected. Also, it shuts off when tipped over for the protection of your child. The case is cool-touch, it's got 2 heat settings, auto or continuous fan, and the device heats up the air 3.5 times each hour in a gentle way so the air is heating around your baby, not on your baby. This unit is a superior model than others in the same line because it comes with an automatic control system. The system comes with a cribside (TM) temperature sensor that continuously monitors the crib temperature and automatically adjust the temperature as set. Therefore, the unit comes with a programmable timer that is technologically very sophisticated and that, in my humble opinion, totally justifies the price tag.The unit is guaranteed for 5 years, and it even looks super pretty, which again, makes this an absolutely in any nursery that needs extra heating. 5 stars without hesitation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OVT4JNRB7YSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXH6PFY#wasThisHelpful","R3OVT4JNRB7YSQ","AH1KJ45IQTM4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH1KJ45IQTM4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Swiss Legend is a company from Hollywood, Florida. As far as I can tell (nowhere in the box, instruction manual, or watch there is an indication where this is made), this watch is not made in Switzerland, although it uses Swiss quartz movement. I would describe this as a sports watch, a very bold, very heavy, very thick sports watch. This is 11.05 oz, which is very very heavy. The case diameter is 52 mm, and 19 mm thick, which is also large, so you probably get the idea considering these measurements. The picture available on Amazon makes justice to the watch. I find the orange dial very beautiful. It is also bold, the whole watch idea is bold I'd say, but the red dial is 'tricky' because it is a red going to orange, hard to describe. I like that ambiguity. The watch is also water resistant, 330 feet, which is triple of the average. This is good because as a sports watch, you want to make sure it can take anything. It is stainless steel, and the bezel is actually very elegant. The watch has the date at four o'clock, and it comes with a very nice and sturdy case, same red color as the watch. All in all it is a watch I can comfortably give 4 stars (not 5 because of its very large size and weight).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LXE5FENJ2ZNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012N16RY6#wasThisHelpful","R2LXE5FENJ2ZNU","AH1KJ45IQTM4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH1KJ45IQTM4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Umberto Eco is one of the best writers of contemporary literature today (he does not have a Nobel prize, but who cares, Murano does and good luck finding someone in the U.S. who knows who Murano is...). He is Italian, and as such, writes in Italian. I am saying this because, unfortunately for the English reader, books in English translation do not abound (actually a meager 3% of books published in English are translation, and not even half of that number are fiction). I will not write about the reasons why this happens, but the consequence is a poor dialogue between English/American literatura and word literatura, some sort of isolationism that can't be good for the English letters.Among the actual books that are translated, though, there are plenty of them with outstanding quality. And Eco is among those. This book is really outstanding. It did make it to the best books of 2015 by the prestigious cultural supplement 'Babelia' in Spain. When I read that, I went ""Oh, wait ... not available yet in the English market!"" Not surprised, but certainly disappointed. Now, finally!, this is available for the English reader. It is a short novel, actually, especially considering how Eco books are usually long (The name of the rose, etc.). But don't confuse quality with quantity. This is an excellent satire, some sort of parable, of the poor shape in which journalism lives today. You have to read it, from beginning to end, to grasp what Eco is proposing. Quite an accomplishment!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJE56O2XIWK2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544635086#wasThisHelpful","RJE56O2XIWK2M","AH1KJ45IQTM4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH1KJ45IQTM4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am not going to rewrite what's available here on the site, which is all true to the best of my knowledge. I will just comment on how I feel this product deserves 5 stars, and why you should consider buying it.This is a professional muscle conditioner, NOT a pain reliever device. This is the first consideration you should have, because unless you are an active person, you should not be considering this device (IMHO). If you are active, as I am, then you may want to  give this a chance, because most likely you are already spending money in massage therapy someplace else. I do strength training (for maintenance, not to build up), and cardio training (long distance running). This is where I need my massages, and when I do, it's never less than $60. If you do the math, two visits to the massage therapist is what this device will cost you. Of course, once you buy the device, you can use it everyday, and the only maintenance you have to perform is changing the battery (Amazon brand are about $1 each, other brands may be around $2), and changing the gel pads ($14.99 for a pair).So moneywise this is a no brainer. But what a bout the performance? I went for a 6 mile run this morning, so my quads and calfs are tired. I used program 2 (30 minute active recovery) for my calfs and then for my quads, and I feel like new. This device has a total of 6 programs, 3 for post-exercise recovery (#2 is 30 minutes, and #2 and #3 are 20 minutes each) and three exercise programs (#1 is 12 minutes, a basic program to prepare your muscles for activity; #5 is endurance, 20 minutes; and #6 is muscle strengthening 20 minutes). One of the things I like the most about the device is that you have two gel pads (or course) but each one is controlled independently from the other, so let's say one leg is more tired than the other one, you may chose to have an intensity of 50 in one leg, and intensity 35 in the other leg. Intensity goes from 1 to 100.This device is totally portable, and it comes with a nice carrying bag (so I can take it with me to my running races and have a pre and a post massage!), quick start guide, the control unit, 2 adhesive gel pads and a replacement, the battery is included (9V, I know the expensive one, but it's worth it!), the cables, and the instruction manual. Please read the instructions carefully, and follow them verbatim. They are all in English, French, and Spanish.To summarize, I believe I can improve my overall muscle performance using this muscle conditioner with EMS technology. This technology stimulates the nerves surrounding the muscles by gently and effectively contracting and relaxing them. By doing so, it increases blood flow and reduces lactic acid to improve and to promote muscle recovery and rejuvenation. I feel I have my personal massage therapist anytime, anywhere, thus the 5 stars with absolutely no hesitations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CEM2VVHUVYAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EDYF3O#wasThisHelpful","R3CEM2VVHUVYAQ","AH1KJ45IQTM4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH1KJ45IQTM4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Tot i que el lector mínimanent informat ja sap com acaba la història (amb la descripció detallada dels crims), el narrador és capaç de mantenir el lector en vil fins al final.La novel·la aconsegueix no només de narrar uns crims, sinó de presentar el context de la guerra civil i postguerra en una manera altament suggerent, que fan de la lectura d'aquesta novel·la de Pep Coll un veritable plaer i que recomano a tothom.p.s. Els catalans que vivim a l'estranger agraïm molt la publicció d'aquestes obres de la literatura catalana en format kindle. Dono gràcies a l'editor i els animo a continuar publicant més!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12F7GVT6608AW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYM9DOE#wasThisHelpful","R12F7GVT6608AW","AH1KJ45IQTM4T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH1KJ45IQTM4T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Usually, I give a rating of fewer than four stars for incompetent writing, simple inability to put words on the page. Karen McQuestion's book is getting three stars for a more complex reason.Books planned to be the first in a series create a terrible problem for the writer. Every book needs a strong ending, series or not, but with a series the writer can't resolve all the issues that have created the plot in the first novel.I could see that McQuestion was hitting the necessary plot milestones, and became really curious to see how she would resolve the problems placed in front of the likeable protagonist: moreso as we got to the point where the chase scene ought to be, and there was no identifiable chase scene.That was because this book ended with a cliffhanger to buy the next in the series, a common marketing strategy among self-publishers. However, because she used it, I don't know whether McQuestion can, in fact, manage the powerful ending which every book needs.Also, reading the sample attached to the end of this book, I realized that the next book in the series asks me to invest emotionally in a totally different character, one marginal within the first story.Between that and the possibility that McQuestion cannot, in fact, write a strong ending, I'm not willing to buy any more books in the series, and I probably won't buy anything else of hers unless reviews indicate that the item is a stand-alone. Too bad; McQuestion's characters are well-rounded, interesting people, and she herself a pretty good wordsmith.Lesson for self-publishers: EVERY book in a series needs to stand on its own.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25DF57DQ1HT6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0092PPWKC#wasThisHelpful","R25DF57DQ1HT6Q","A1C92SAQFUBJSZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C92SAQFUBJSZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really don't understand the high ratings this novel has gathered. It's a mess.I gave it a yank because the sample read well. The writing style, however, swiftly showed up the author's shortcomings.The writing is single-paced, if frenetic, the characters a collection of cardboard tics, the plot overly simple for the weight it is asked to bear. The ""hero"" is someone who does not earn that standing, just a schlub with a gift. The romantic subplot is a fourteen-year-old's vision of love. To top it all off, there are several errors throughout the book, including a large chunk of formatting code left in, and a few sentences are incomprehensible. The overall flavor is rushed and slipshod, and it's really too bad I couldn't rate the plot that way.Because he can't be bothered to catch his own careless errors (how hard is it these days to run a grammar check?), I won't be trying any of Barnes' other work.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JS1Y0JNHPGD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AABHSXG#wasThisHelpful","R3JS1Y0JNHPGD4","A1C92SAQFUBJSZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C92SAQFUBJSZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We needed sealed containers for my son's work lunches. The Rubbermaid jobs we started with weren't lasting well, and have proven tempery over time: their lid gaskets remove, and become more and more inelastic, therefore more difficult to re-insert properly even when washed by hand. They also have a vent covered by a little detachable plastic thingy that has a tendency to follow the missing socks wherever they get off to. The gasket itself is partially responsible for keeping the lid in place.These, on the other hand, have two pieces: a heavy glass dish and a sturdy lid with an attached gasket. The lid literally clamps to the bottom, so the gasket is asked only to seal the container. Muuuuch better.How much do we like them? We have two, and will invest in another three.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH4IJ7P3AQ2LZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008O8I44O#wasThisHelpful","RH4IJ7P3AQ2LZ","A1C92SAQFUBJSZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C92SAQFUBJSZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very fond of the work done by Dorothy Sayers and Jill Paton Walsh. JPW completed Sayers' unfinished Lord Peter Wimsey novel, ""Thrones, Dominations,"" to general huzzahs: well-deserved, in my opinion. Then she got permission from the Sayers estate to write three more, all original works using Sayers' characters, of which this is the first.When these books first swam into my ken, I was greatly suspicious. How could these books be any good? Sayers is a very tough act to follow, let alone share a stage with. But I find JPW more than adequate to this daunting task. Like Sayers a graduate of Cambridge, she absorbed Sayers' work in her own early teens, which seem to be the formative years for writers. So the pairing is not as disparate as one might fear.I find this novel the most satisfying of JPW's Wimsey-Vane continuations so far. The plot is just as complex, and the characters equally so: this is not true only of Harriet Vane and Peter Wimsey, offstage through most of the novel, but of the minor characters as well. JPW's hand with them seems surer than did Sayers', who must not have liked many people very much. She had something tart to say about everyone, at least in her novels. JPW, being of a later generation, does not use the racial perjoratives that Sayers threw around so freely, but also, she is a kinder writer in general than Sayers. Kinder to her minor characters by streets, which makes for some very satisfying reading.The situation in ""Presumption"" is fraught, as the Battle of Britain is being fought as the book opens. This may be the major reason that I find this book better than the rest of the Wimsey-Vane catalog; Paton-Walsh can likely remember at least the latter part of the war. The details she brings to this book ring true for having lived them.The plot revolves upon the fog of war. More than that I won't say; reviews are not a place to spout spoilers. If you are a fan of inter-war British mysteries, you will very much like this outlier, which of course happens just a little too late to be included in that genre. Read the Kindle sample and see if it cranks your scooter. It's that good all the way through.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OD2N6RO1H4TJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FA66TO#wasThisHelpful","R1OD2N6RO1H4TJ","A1C92SAQFUBJSZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C92SAQFUBJSZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Late-middle age me does not seem as fond of Roger Zelazny's work as teenage me was; however, this book was written with Jane Lindskold. Zelazny was, and remains, an excellent writer in my eyes, though I'd recommend both ""The Doors of His Face, the Lamps of His Mouth,"" a short-story collection, and the novel ""A Night in the Lonesome October"" over this (and ""The Dead Man's Brother,"" a wacko murder mystery which proves conclusively that Zelazny could write anything but juvenile lit - that genre didn't work for him).His plots are satisfyingly complex. Science-fiction characters are usually not as well-developed as Lindskold's and Zelazny's are here, but they still could not be called ""complex."" This was also written in first person, which is kinda variable with Roger: either laugh-out-loud funny, or too fast and not deep enough. This book is light on the former, though it doesn't go too far in the latter direction.Zelazny obviously developed as a writer over the years, and this book, the culmination of his writing career, is much better than most of the Amber series for which he is best-known.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GR7V73PHTX9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0380770237#wasThisHelpful","R2GR7V73PHTX9G","A1C92SAQFUBJSZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C92SAQFUBJSZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Functions pretty well for what it is, though its USB adapter needed an adapter. I was fortunate in that my tablet, a Dragon 7, came with such.Docked three stars for deceptive advertising: this is not made of leather.

"Jill Patton Walsh has pulled off the near-impossible - taken another author's work and made it her own, and arguably better. That the author in question is Dorothy Sayers makes her accomplishment all the more noteworthy; Sayers' trust has given their blessing to four such books.I've been a Sayers fan for a while. Like most of us, I hope, I was somewhat offended by her free use of the then-current derogatory names for persons not British and not upper-class. Walsh does not use those terms, and indeed my only criticism of her four Wimsey/Vane novels is that the characters have become a little too modern in their outlook. Such people did and always have existed, but Sayers gave no hint that Wimsey was one such. Still, that's a very small quibble.This book is roughly of the same quality as Sayer's own ""Five Red Herrings"" or Walsh's ""The Attenbury Emeralds."" That is, for my taste the plot is overly complex. The two stars of the Sayer-Walsh collaboration, ""Thrones, Dominations"" and ""A Presumption of Death,"" are both equally complex, but somehow I find myself returning to those two. This one and ""Emeralds"" are one-off reads, though I imagine that with some time passing between reads, both would again become enjoyable.The difference may be that the characters in both ""Thrones"" and ""Presumption"" are better-realized, or perhaps simply more likeable. But if you are thinking of diving into the Sayers-Walsh partnership, begin with ""Thrones,"" by all means. And don't feel shy about this book, either. I vastly enjoyed it, and as you see I gave it five stars. But in my opinion ""Thrones"" and ""Presumption"" both deserve six.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLIGUQRUNYI4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H6EOJ1Y#wasThisHelpful","RLIGUQRUNYI4Z","A1C92SAQFUBJSZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C92SAQFUBJSZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Books written before the late 1960s have some disadvantages today. Their language is very stilted to modern ears (though this example suffers much less than many from pompousness), and slang has of course moved on. Don't get me started on sexual mores: this was a time when women were not expected so much as DEMANDED to delay loss of their virginity until their wedding night.Which, as you may well be thinking, is not a review of this book at all. I'd agree with you, but these are the social mores it does not contravene. Potential lovers remain potential until the knot is tied. They don't neck, tease, or even talk about the possibilities. Period. The fact that the Bad Guy propositions the Good Girl to be his mistress doesn't even rank as ""sexual content"" today, but it would have been extremely shocking in 1922, when the book was published.This is very likely the first romantic suspense novel, beating out Mary Stewart by a good twenty years. Not that much suspense attends it; everyone except the female lead can see the happy ending coming eight furlongs (a mile) off. It is set in the pre-war world of British horse-racing, and readers of Dick Francis may recognize something here which Francis later used in his own work.It's nowhere near as horsey as Francis, however. And it's clear to everyone except the utterly clueless female lead what's going on. Edgar Wallace was thought of as a thriller writer while a working writer, and was immensely popular - the Lee Child of his day.Your reaction to it may depend on your reaction to all the above. Try out Wallace's ""The Green Rust,"" which is free on Kindle, and see what you think of his work.

"Very poorly proofread. The book was at one point obviously in first-person, but not all the pronouns were changed.So far as I am concerned, this novel has a terrible flaw in the writing: EVERY adult male the female narrator must deal with is presented as a possible sex parther, including the ones who, if they knew her history, would not give her the time of day. It's not merely unconvincing, it means that all these characters, including the narrator herself, are cardboad.Also, the central character is not presented as a very admirable person, though she lacks sufficient spine to be an anti-heroine.What passes for ""romance"" in this book is the usual obsessive wibbling.

This is a story where the stakes are raised wrenchingly high again, and again, and again. Lives are stake, a crown is at stake, and not one but three sanities are at stake. One is almost lost; I can see this book appealing to adolescents because that's exactly how I remember puberty.I had no problem with the multiple POVs - they are all in third person, and each one of those persons is worth investing in.

"Disclaimer: I am a member a writing group to which the author belongs, and critiqued this book in its early stages. I loved it then, and I love it now.M. L. John's sure hand with the story, a companion to ""Lady of the Veils,"" shows in her tale of Beri Quintiniar's slow trek toward the throne he didn't expect to inherit. The characters and action are as well-drawn as they are in ""Lady of the Veils,"" which tells a matching half of the story. I could smell the rain of the forest which won't allow you to settle where it doesn't want you, and I grieved the deaths of characters who had been made real to me. That's true again here, though the body count is lower. To make up for it, however, the dialog and narrative of the Summer Court's treachery sparkles and flashes.You don't need to have read ""Lady of the Veils"" to get this. I hadn't, when I critiqued it.

"Disclaimer: I was given a copy of this book by the author in thanks for proofing of her other book. (Don't miss that one, either.)When I opened this book, I divided the number of pages by four, thinking I could read ninety pages a night (yes, I am a pretty fast reader) and be disciplined about the whole thing. First night, no problem, though it was so engrossing I went over by a few pages. The next night I read HALF THE BOOK before I knew it. I got up this morning and read the rest.Depending on the number and kind of demands in your own life, it's pretty likely you'll find yourself doing the same. M. L. John's compelling tale of one Karen McGregor, ordinary kid, wanders through strange worlds, in which she meets all-too-human allies. Well, human: most are half-human, and a few are not human at all. The vampire, for instance, who becomes her playmate; the High King of Faerie, with whom she has been in love since she was a very small child.As rich in mythology as this tale is, it is also engrossingly human. In a war, there is loss, and John's Karen faces it squarely.This tale is not one of those deeply flawed self-pubbed files that may engross you until you get past page fifty.

"I'm struggling with this rating (a little, but not really), so I'll put my thought process out there for others to determine if the product is actually worth 4 or 5 stars. Here's why:  at the current price of over $30 for two 11.5 ounce bottles, it's just plain expensive. It's so expensive that you could probably convince people that being in possession of it would be a misdemeanor.So that skewed my perception. At first taste, I liked the flavor but I couldn't get the dollar signs out of my head. But the more I tried it (and in different scenarios), the more I fell in love with this sauce.  Now that I'm basically down to the last remnants of the first bottle, I'm hoarding away that second bottle like Golem in the dark recesses of the back of the kitchen pantry, hoping that my wife won't find it and start slopping it all over everything as if it's going to last forever... my preciousssss....Oh yeah. Back to it. This stuff is pretty great. I'm not one of those people that can pick out all of the separate ingredients of a sauce, but it definitely has a distinct Korean flavor, whatever that means. It starts out with a mild sweetness which slowly progresses into a pretty solid burn that lingers for quite a while. It's somehow not a ""punch-in-the-face"" sort of heat that you get from some hot sauce.  It's slow, simmering, and it builds in intensity over time.We've used the sauce for a few different things, including as part of a marinade with a soy sauce base, as part of a dipping sauce for hors d'oeuvres mixed with a yogurt-based ranch dressing, and mixed up with a light mayo for use on roast beef sandwiches. The transformation is incredible, even small amounts make a huge difference.I have to say, I think this is now one of my favorite sauces of all time.  People in other reviews have said that this can easily be made at home for much cheaper; I'm going to try my best.  But if I can't get it right (it's likely I won't), then I'm definitely okay with spending the money to have continued access to this sauce.  And THAT is why I couldn't take off a star for the high price -- because I would pay that much to have more of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ED9ZJXLI2JHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWNKWKQ#wasThisHelpful","R2ED9ZJXLI2JHN","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not going to get much into the marketing terminology, parroting the wording from B+W's website about the type of glass they use or the number of coatings they apply.  I only care about whether the product works, how well it works, and if it's worth the money. So let's get into that.To be clear right off the bat, I don't think the increased exposure hits a full stop as is implied by B+W.  At least, not compared to the other two circular polarizers I tested it against.  However, it is better. I tested against two other circular polarizers: The B+W MRC Circular Polarizer and the Promaster Circular Polarizer. At the current prices as of this review, the standard B+W is $10 cheaper than the Kaesemann model, and the Promaster is half the price.THE B+W's have the nicest mounts. While there's nothing wrong with the Promaster mount, the B+W's just feel better. They screw on smoothly and the front ring rotates with a nice damped feel.I did two tests to compare the light transmission. One was indoors in a consistently lit room, and the other was outdoors on a sunny day.  Both tests utilized the same incident light meter, which remained stationary throughout the tests.  A base reading (with no filter) was taken just before each filter test to ensure that the light had not changed between tests. The results were pretty consistent. The following is the number of stops that the polarizer increases the exposure in each test:Promaster CPOL: +1.9 stops (inside test), +2.0 stops (outside test)B+W (standard) CPOL: +1.6 stops (inside test), +1.7 stops (outside test)B+W Kaesemann CPOL: +1.3 stops (inside test), +1.2 stops (outside test)The B+W Kaesemann obviously had the best light transmission of the three, but the difference never quite reached that full stop compared to the Promaster (the actual difference was 0.6 to 0.8 stops), and it only reached 0.3 to 0.5 stops compared to the ""standard"" B+W.  I suppose that's close enough for most purposes, and it's enough to make a difference when you're losing light and you want to keep shooting.I also want to do some side-by-side tests for color accuracy and overall performance. However, the weather has not been cooperating for the last few days.  When I complete these tests, I'll put the results here and link to the images.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31XM124DOEM7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPZGRDA#wasThisHelpful","R31XM124DOEM7V","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as my (admittedly untrained) ear can tell, the KA-SEM sounds exactly like the far cheaper Kala KA-15S that I was able to compare it with.  My neighbor has the KA-15S, and after switching them back and forth a bit, we came to the conclusion that the KA-SEM's improvements over the KA-15S are purely aesthetic.Does that mean it's 100% true?  No, of course not.  Neither of us are musicians.  Just learning the instrument for fun.However, those aesthetic differences are pretty significant.  The KA-SEM is beautiful, but a bit different than what you see in the product description. It looks much more like the picture on the Kala website (click the Products menu, select Kala Ukulele, then click on the link for ""Exotic Mahogany Series), and I've added my own photos as well for reference.  The wood is a little darker, and the binding has a stripe down the middle of the back. The tuning pegs are sort of a pearlescent white, not black as in the product description.The finish seems a little nicer than the satin finish on the KA-15S, although the Kala website calls this ""satin"" as well.  It has a nice sheen on it that just slightly reflects light, while still allowing you to feel the wood grain on the surface.  It's really nice.  The black binding adds a nice touch around the edges, and the frets are nickel (on the KA-15S, they are brass).Both models come with the same Aquila Nylagut strings, which suit me just fine. As far as whether or not the KA-SEM is worth the extra money, that really depends on what you're looking for.  If you don't care about aesthetics at all, I'd say definitely get the KA-15S.  But if you want it to look as nice as it sounds, spend the extra on the KA-SEM.PS: I actually bought this great little ukulele from a different listing which includes a soft case for only an extra $2, with free (but not Prime) shipping.

"If you're used to the slim cases (like one of my previous cases, a Spigen Hard Case) that provide minimal shock protection in exchange for a case that hardly increases the phone size at all, then this case will feel bulky until you get used to it.  On the other hand, if you're coming from a more protective case like the Speck Mightyshell, this feels about the same in terms of overall size.I feel like in most comparisons, this case would sit right in between those other two.  The Spigen was small, but a dirt magnet. No dirt ever got into the Speck and it was a real powerhouse from a protection point of view, but once you put it on it was nearly impossible to remove.  This OtterBox case is about the same size as the Speck, but provides not-quite-as-good protection.  And it's $15 cheaper, and it's way easier to remove.The major difference in the protection stems from the fact that the Speck case has an opaque soft interior for the back of the phone as well as the edges. For most people I doubt that this is really meaningful.The one down side that I've seen so far is the edges. Where the beveled face protection part of the case meets the sides is a pretty harsh transition, not soft and rounded like the Speck.  So gripping it is a little less comfortable.

I didn't want a piece of crap, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money on it either.  I landed on the KA-SEM, and although it was a little more than I wanted to spend (considering the KA-15S is significantly cheaper even when it comes in the kit with the tuner and other goodies, and I'd have to buy the tuner myself), I pulled the trigger.So far, I'm incredibly happy with the purchase.  The build quality is really nice, and the wood grain is beautiful to look at.  The satin finish has a sheen about it that looks great, and the black binding really ties it together. It's loud when you want it to be, and soft when you want it to be. The strings included are Aquila Nylagut. At the start, I needed to tune the strings every time I played, but after a few days they stayed in tune.  Apparently you can stretch them to speed up the process, but I didn't bother; I didn't mind tuning them while they were breaking in.I was surprised at the quality of the case that's included with it for this listing (at the time of this review, you can get the KA-SEM without a case for only about $2 cheaper, which seems like a terrible idea). It's thickly padded, inspiring confidence in its ability to protect the instrument. For reference, the bag is the Kaces KUKS-3 model, which is about $25 on its own (mine has a slightly different patch design on the front, but the case manufacturer and model number is the same).So is it worth the money over the KA-15S? Well, that depends on what you're looking for.  The frets on the KA-SEM are nickel, while the KA-15S frets are brass. The KA-SEM overall looks way better than the KA-15S.  But they sound exactly the same to me, and they come with the same strings.  I brought mine over to a friend's house (he has a KA-15S) and we couldn't tell any difference in sound.  So purely from a price/performance standpoint, the KA-15S looks to be a better buy.  To me, it was worth that little extra money because aesthetically the KA-SEM is much nicer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KEY6QZWN9HMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AN8R0M0#wasThisHelpful","R2KEY6QZWN9HMY","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this tuner for my ukulele. I like having the modes that are specific to each instrument, so it displays the note and the string number that you're plucking.  Then there's the chromatic mode, which will tell you what note you're playing, any string any fret.Of course, that just annoyed me by showing me how my uke gets slightly more out of tune the farther I move up the fret. But I digress.In ""Clip"" mode, where the tuner reads the vibration through the clip to determine the frequency, you don't need to worry about the possibility of ambient noise messing up the reading. ""Mic"" mode uses a microphone instead.  I think the Mic mode is primarily for the tuning of brass and woodwind instruments, although it can also be used for strings if you don't want the tuner clipped to the instrument.Dialing in the correct frequency is pretty simple, just keep plucking and adjusting while you watch the meter on the display.  When it hits the green center mark, the string is in tune. It can sometimes be difficult to get exactly in the center, but (at least to my ears) I can't hear the difference between dead on and one mark to the left or right.There are two things that annoy me a little.  First and foremost, this thing has the feel of a toy that came in a Cracker Jack box.  The clip and neck are okay, but the buttons feel extremely cheap. I'm concerned about its longevity because of this. Secondly (and this is much more minor) the display bleeds a lot into neighboring segments.  You can see the difference in my photos, where every segment in the display is easily visible even when it's not actively being lit.  It makes it a little less readable. But as I said, that's more of a minor annoyance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VVKPI5WIL7JM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDGW532#wasThisHelpful","R3VVKPI5WIL7JM","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are some strange design decisions here (at least, strange to me), but overall this is a worthy system.The look of the unit is minimalist and clean, obviously the intended effect since it has no buttons -- only a display and a CD slot. There's a sensor on the top of the unit directly above the display so that when you touch it, it acts as a power switch.  When powering on, it resumes the last action. So if you're listening to a specific Pandora station for example, it will go back to that station and start playing.The sound is definitely impressive, more so than the various iPod docks and Bluetooth speakers that I've had over the years. It can sometimes get a little bogged down in the low end though, mainly at lower volumes. And there is no way that I've found to adjust the EQ to suit my tastes.  In fact, the user manual suggests listening to the demo CD at ""80-85 volume"" for best results.  But what if I don't want to listen to it that loud?  I'd say most of the time I listen at around 50-60.The phone app is pretty full-featured (I'm using it on the iPhone 6) and not very difficult to use.  You have access to various streaming services, CD, radio, any NAS drives that you might have on the network, and any computer on the network where you've installed the app to point to your music collection.I like the idea of being able to sync the music to play out of several systems simultaneously.  In the past, I've used this feature in iTunes to play the computer speakers in one room and the entertainment center speakers in the living room through the AppleTV, and it's great.  Of course, in this case I can't test it because it requires multiple SoundTouch units... and I'm not made of money, so I doubt that will be happening any time soon.Any wireless connectivity requires the lower dock piece. The setup for that is pretty easy.  There's a light on the back of it that changes color depending on the current connection status. On the back is an ethernet port, as well as a USB and micro USB port (both labeled ""Setup"").  These ports will charge any devices plugged into them, but even the manual is tight-lipped about what actual function they serve, if any. The manual claims that you can use the micro USB for ""network setup using a computer"" (but says nothing beyond that), and actually states that the USB port currently has no purpose.I have to admit, I'm curious as to why the wireless connectivity had to be added as a (quite large) separate component. The base piece increases the height by a good two inches, and there's a wired connection between the two in the back using some proprietary connector.  Couldn't the connection be built into the top of the base, so that the act of placing the system on the dock establishes a connection?  Or more importantly, why isn't this functionality built into the main unit? Why does it need to be a separate dock? That makes no sense to me. And why not allow the USB ports act as a way to plug in an iPod or other music device?Finally, there's the (admittedly minor) matter of the display.  Aren't we, as a society, now beyond the old 12-segment LCD display? Especially at the $600 price point.  I've got a streaming music box for my component system with a full-color display that shows all of the information I need, plus album art.  iPods have had full color screens for a decade. If you catch it at the very beginning of a song, at least you'll see the full song name scroll by if it's longer than 14 characters.  After that first scroll through, it stops and just cuts it off to the first 14 characters.So yeah, it's a good unit. Sounds great most of the time.  Some design decisions have me scratching my head, but overall I'm happy with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C36RYHAH790Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH6M50#wasThisHelpful","R3C36RYHAH790Q","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cable seems to be the equal of the Apple branded cable in just about every way, except it's longer (great!) and the rim around the lightning connector is ever so slightly thicker than the Apple variety.  That may be not-so-great if your case has an extremely small opening for the charge port.  However, with the three cases that I have, this cable works fine.  It also works fine for my wife's case.In fact, it may work with every case in existence, I just don't know.

"There is clearly some misunderstanding out there about what you're getting.  Have you ever had a drink like Perrier? It's like that.  First and foremost, it's a sparkling water. Think club soda. There is a small amount of flavor added to it, but it's very subtle. If you don't like Perrier (or if you prefer your water heavily flavored), you should pass on this because it almost definitely won't suit your tastes.You shouldn't rate a drink poorly because you don't understand what you ordered, or because you wanted it to be a different type of drink altogether. It's like buying coffee and then rating it poorly because it doesn't taste like tea.  On the other hand, for those that ordered from Amazon I can see the misunderstanding -- multiple uses in the product description of the term ""bold flavor"" are somewhat misleading.As a fan of citrusy flavors, the Mandarin Lime is easily my favorite of the three, but I like them all. The glass bottles were well packaged and arrived safely. I have no complaints whatsoever.  If the manufacturer were to consider revisiting the product description to ensure the correct expectations, I imagine the overall product rating would improve.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OG90EN692X99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YSW3AQW#wasThisHelpful","R3OG90EN692X99","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't know why I waited this long to find a legitimate meat slicer.  I've been using the wrong tool for the job for a long time (although admittedly, I didn't know that until I got this knife).  Smoked brisket slices would be necessarily thick to avoid tearing, as well as uneven and a bit awkward because the blade wasn't long enough to cut through in one slice. Buckboard bacon would be a similarly difficult, coming out more often like a thick ham slice than bacon, or maybe thicker on one end than the other. American-style (pork belly) bacon was even more difficult.Then I decided to look up meat slicing knives, and this one won me over due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews and the reasonable price. The day it arrived, my latest batch of bacon had finished curing and was in the smoker, so the timing was perfect. I'm attaching a photo (which I hope isn't removed because I forgot to put the knife in the picture) that shows how well the knife slices, even considering my questionable knife skills and the fact that this was my first time ever using it.I've since used it on those really thin chicken breasts that come in the 10-lb food service bags at big box stores, cutting them into clean slices along their thinnest dimension for jerky. I can't wait to pull another brisket off the smoker and get cutting!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y4TIZ7VXME8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000CFDB9#wasThisHelpful","R1Y4TIZ7VXME8J","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The majority of my trips (business or pleasure) are for 5 days or less, and if flying, are within the US or Canada. And yet all I have is a small, inexpensive duffle bag and a backpack or camera bag, depending on the purpose of the trip. If I can't make my stuff fit, I have to resort to a checked bag. This is quite the carry-on upgrade for me.Without going into incredibly boring detail about every little thing, I'll stick to the most important stuff, as I see them.  Structurally, it's a very sturdy bag, orders of magnitude better than the cheap luggage I had previously bought from places like Target.  The fabric is designed to take a real beating without showing it, the zippers are heavy duty, the wheels and external structural detail look like they're going to last forever, and the internal components are far better than that flimsy plastic lining in cheap luggage that can flex or crack over time.It's a well-thought-out bag too, with an incorporated garment bag in the lid, big enough for a suit, or several dress shirts. In addition to the other standard interior and exterior pockets, it includes a mesh pocket on the outside that can be rolled up and zipped away into its own little pocket, useful for holding a jacket or other random bits while you're sitting in the airport. Then when it's time to board, roll it into its pocket so it doesn't get caught on anything as you're stuffing it into the bin.  There's even a long, narrow zippered pouch between the two rails of the extending handle on the back.  Although I'm not entirely sure what you'd put in there.The exterior bag dimensions are 21"" x 14"" x 8"" (the wheels stick out a little, bringing overall depth to 9""), and if you zip out the extension, it will allow the depth to grow to 12"". This puts it within the carry-on size restrictions of most airlines (22"" x 14"" x 9"") unless you have it extended.Now, it is expensive.  For very frequent travelers, I'd say it's certainly worth the money.  Otherwise it may not be.  Of course, you do have the lifetime warranty which guarantees that they'll repair any functional problems with the bag regardless of how it happened or how bad the damage is. That's great news.  But for an infrequent traveler, how often are you replacing cheap luggage due to damage?  Especially considering that this is, first and foremost, a carry-on bag that won't often experience the higher levels of abuse of a checked bag. It's something to keep in mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A0F7MYQGBPEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWWQ364#wasThisHelpful","R2A0F7MYQGBPEG","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's not a whole lot I can say about this drive, but I'll start with this:  I've been using it for about a month and haven't yet had any failures as mentioned in some of the top reviews for the product.  Looking at the dates, those reviews are all several years old.  Could it be that the design has improved since then? Hard to say.I like the aluminum case on it, it has been operating without issue, and it's pretty cheap.  As with any review I post, if something changes I'll update the review to account for that, but here's one last thing to consider:  At the time of this review, you can get a 32GB USB drive like the HP x702w for one dollar more than this drive, and it supports USB 3.0.  Even if you're not currently using it on USB 3.0-capable devices, it's backward compatible to USB 2.0, so why not just spend the extra dollar and get that one instead?

"For the price, you really can't go wrong here.  As long as you have a reasonably competent machine, you'll find this to be a pretty simple, full-featured video editor that works with you rather than struggling against you.Previously, I had been using an earlier version of this software (VideoStudio Pro X4) which I found to be crash-prone and frustrating.  I had to save my projects after every single change I made, because I knew that crash was coming any second and I had learned my lesson many times before.  This new version, in addition to streamlining the interface, improving the workflow, and adding some new options, I've found to be far more stable and responsive.  It did crash on me once in the middle of rendering a 4.5 minute long video, but I had left the application running for about 24 straight hours before starting the render.  When I brought it back up after the crash, it rendered the whole video just fine.There are a number of premade templates available for video openings, endings, middle bits, etc. as well as scores of transition effects and video effects, and a couple dozen different styles of text overlay. Functionality also exists for some things that I have no use for personally, such as stop-motion video [actually... see update].There are two other applications included in the package. FastFlicks lets you pick a template, and then dump a bunch of photos and videos on it, and it will automatically create a video for you. The ScreenCap application lets you record video of your desktop for presentations, etc.  I have not had a need for these yet though.== Update 4/18/2015 ==When I thought about the stop motion functionality, it reminded me of a New Year 2012 party I went to, where as part of the party's theme I had a small video camera attached to my hat, set to take still images once every three seconds for the entire night.  I completely forgot about it and never did anything with the 4500 images, so I found them on my computer and used the stop motion capability to put them together into a video.  For the most part, this functionality (which also includes the ability to capture straight from a webcam or other device, if desired) made it easier to put the images together into a video, setting the time per frame and other things.  The only thing I didn't care for was that this feature opens a smaller window over the main application window, which cannot be resized.  Then there's only a single row of images at the bottom that you have to scroll through so you can toss the ones you don't want.  When you're doing them 1000 at a time, this can be quite tedious.  Overall a pretty minor complaint, though, considering how little I plan on doing that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZN6TJSEV4A8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0I6J9E#wasThisHelpful","R2ZN6TJSEV4A8D","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Weye Feye looks to be a solid competitor for wireless control of a dSLR through a phone or tablet. For reference, I shoot primarily with a Canon EOS 5D Mk III and use my iPhone 6 or 3rd generation iPad for remote shooting.  I also purchased a CamRanger Wireless Controller a couple of years ago, which is a direct competitor to the Weye Feye, and which I'll be using as a point of comparison throughout the review.  So if you're wondering if you should plunk down the extra cash on the CamRanger, hopefully I'll be able to help you decide. If you already know you're not in the market for the CamRanger, you can skip that part of the review and save yourself some time.Side note: This review is specific to the information I have available to me at the time of the review.  These devices are firmware upgradeable, and obviously the apps can also be updated with new features and functionality. I will try to update my review as new features are added and bugs are squashed, but right now my review is current as of 04/13/2015.== On Its Own ==Physically, the Weye Feye seems to be pretty well made.  The black plastic unit comes surrounded by a flexible orange case that serves as protection from drops and as a connection point for the velcro straps that allow you to mount the unit to a tripod leg. There's a small button on the front that serves as the power button, as well as a battery check button.  It's slightly difficult to find in the dark but that's not a big deal.There are two LEDs on the front, one showing the charge state (green/blue/orange/red to show an approximate battery level, flashing while charging), and the other showing power state. A micro USB port on the side is used for charging (a cable is included for this purpose) and a full-size USB port is on the end for connecting to your camera (cable not included).Setup is straightforward. After charging the device, turn it on and wait for the lights to settle to a solid green state. Your phone/tablet will see it as a Wi-Fi hotspot. Connect to it.  Then connect the Weye Feye to the camera (order is not important here; you can connect to the camera at any time) and turn the camera on.  The phone/tablet app will show the name of the camera when the connection is set up correctly.  If there is a disconnect, it will tell you where (i.e., if your phone/tablet is not connected to the Weye Feye, or if the Weye Feye is not connected to the camera).Once the connection is made, you can control the camera or view the contents of the memory card.  Controlling the camera from the phone allows you to do the following:- View a live representation of the camera's viewfinder on your phone or tablet (similar to Live View mode on the camera, but the camera's display is blacked out and the phone/tablet used instead). You won't be getting a perfect 30fps instantaneous display, obviously, since there's going to be some latency involved, but the Weye Feye is surprisingly fast.  I'd venture to say that in the vast majority of cases, you'd hardly even notice the delay. It's really quite good in that respect.- Click on any part of the screen (in AF mode) to focus on that point. The speed with which this happens depends on the lens used and the light level, but will operate at the same speed as using Live View directly from the camera.- Control many of the camera's exposure features via button overlays on the screen. This includes: drive mode (i.e., single shot, continuous, high speed continuous, quiet mode), exposure compensation, white balance, ISO, and auto or manual focus.- If manual focus is selected, up and down arrows allow you to incrementally change the focus in small or large steps.- Set an intervalometer: Set the number of desired exposures and the desired interval between them (in whole seconds). Then tell it whether it should attempt to reacquire focus after every shot, or leave it where it was for the first shot.- Set a self-timer with any desired delay (in whole seconds)- Set custom aperture bracketing. You can choose any number of supported aperture values and it will take a photo for each value.  They need not be consecutive, so you can for example select f/1.4, f/4, f/10, and f/16 and it will take all four in succession.- Exposure compensation bracketing, this operates similar to aperture bracketing.  They don't need to be consecutive like they would be in-camera. You could set compensation values of -5, +0.6, +4, and +5.- ISO bracketing, as above.- White balance bracketing, as above.- Basic focus bracketing, select 3, 5, 7, or 9 photos with ""small"", ""medium"", or ""large"" focus steps between them.In the photo view mode, you can look at the images on the camera's memory card, zoom in on them, and share them with various social sites like Facebook or Flickr. I don't really see much of a use for this particular feature though, since I never upload anything without first running it through Photoshop for adjustments.  If you don't care to do this, then you may find the sharing functionality to be useful and convenient.I've had a couple of small problems so far with the use of the Weye Feye.- the +/- step buttons used for time (such as for the time interval in the intervalometer mode or the self-timer delay) are tedious for large values.  For example, if you wanted to set the interval to 30 minutes, you'd be holding down the ""+"" button for quite some time. This may be specific to iOS, I'm not sure since I have no Android device to test with.- On a handful of occasions, the connection to the Weye Feye never worked correctly. After connecting to it on the phone, it would still say I wasn't connected to it.  This would be resolved by restarting the Weye Feye.- There's a problem in certain circumstances where the Live View display on the phone/tablet goes black even though the camera still ""sees"" correctly (ie, it can still focus on an area when you tap the screen, it's just that your screen is black so you don't know what you're focusing on).- I tried to use the web server functionality, which is supposed to allow you to see the images on the camera's memory card without using the app.  I was able to view the gallery page on my laptop, but it didn't have any images on it even though the camera's memory card had several.  I haven't yet figured out how to get this feature to work. (Update: it occurred to me recently that maybe the web server functionality doesn't work for RAW files because a browser wouldn't support viewing them.  I will retest with JPGs shortly and update the review, but if this is the case, that's going to be a problem for RAW shooters such as myself)- Documentation is sparse, to say the least.  Aside from the most basic connection information, the rest is up to you to figure out on your own.  The website offered no additional help, offering only the same skimpy quick start manual as was included in the box. I could find nothing more in-depth than that.== CamRanger Comparison ==Okay, so the CamRanger currently weighs in at double the price of the Weye Feye.  At first glance, that makes it a no-brainer decision. However, the CamRanger does have some additional features that the Weye Feye currently does not have. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, especially since the software and firmware updates frequently add new functionality, but some of these features include (keeping in mind my particular setup, your functionality may differ based on your camera model):- The CamRanger has a replaceable battery.- Supports real-time viewing by multiple client apps simultaneously (meaning, people can download a view-only client app, and you can allow those people to see, on their own devices, the photos coming off of your camera as you shoot them). Other users CAN connect to the Weye Feye as a basic web server, but it just lets you view the gallery, and at any rate, I could never get the gallery images to show up even though the web server was working.- Multiple camera support from a single laptop- Change image mode (i.e., JPG, RAW, JPG+RAW, and the camera-supported size options) is available on the CamRanger, but not on the Weye Feye.- Same goes for changing the metering mode (i.e., average, spot, center-weighted, etc)- Live histogram: a continuously updating histogram representation of the live view is a (defeatable, if desired) option on the CamRanger as well as the Weye Feye, but the Weye Feye only has a brightness histogram, while the CamRanger supports a more informative RGB histogram.- Grid lines can be turned on as an overlay if desired, and the color can be changed to suit taste.- Highlight and Shadow Clipping: when highlights or shadows are clipped in an image, you have the option to turn on a blinking display that shows you where those clipped areas are in the image.- Aspect Ratio: another screen overlay that shows you whatever aspect ratio boundaries you set (just an overlay for reference - does not crop the image).- Focus Peaking: another overlay that shows you, based on your aperture, a red outline around all of the portions of the image that will be in focus when you trip the shutter.- Supports the use of a motorized tripod head to allow for remote rotation and tilt. This can be incorporated into the intervalometer functionality as well (i.e., automated move-shoot-move-shoot-move-shoot for time-lapse panning).- Camera Mode thumbnails: As you shoot, thumbnails of the most recent shots are displayed in a filmstrip across the top of the screen while in camera view. The Weye Feye requires that you exit camera mode, enter gallery mode, and click on the folder to see your most recent shots.- Documentation.  It exists for the CamRanger. You can download a PDF file with all the information you need to become an expert on its operation.  The Weye Feye has a tiny book with about three paragraphs of useful information on it. I could find nothing more online.On the other hand, some things that might give Weye Feye the edge:- Better build. The Weye Feye looks the part, and the protective case is a nice touch. It's easier to mount to the tripod with the velcro, as opposed the the carabiner clip supplied for the CamRanger.- The CamRanger is slightly larger and heavier, and looks exactly like the TP-Link mobile router that it's based off of.- Security (entering a password for the Wifi connection) is required for the CamRanger, but can be disabled on the Weye Feye. It's good to have the security to ensure that no one can take control of your camera mid-shoot, but it's also good to be able to turn it off if desired.- The Weye Feye firmware update process can be completed from your phone by just clicking a button, and then restarting the Weye Feye. The CamRanger requires a software download to a computer connected to the device via Ethernet or Wifi.- It's half the price.- The phone screen real estate taken up by the live view is larger for the Weye Feye on my iPhone 6, because for some reason the CamRanger software doesn't let me switch to landscape view when I rotate my phone.  This is only a problem with my phone though, because on the iPad I can view the CamRanger software in landscape and portrait mode, and there's a button to expand the live view window to take up the entire iPad screen.=== Conclusion ===So I hate to finish up a comparison review with ""it depends"" because it seems like such a cop-out. However, in this case it really does depend.  I could totally see some people not caring about an RGB histogram, real-time client displays, and highlight clipping alerts.  Personally, I love the focus peaking feature of the CamRanger, but if I didn't have it, it wouldn't be the end of the world.Maybe you just need an intervalometer and a few other basic features sported by both units.  In that case, by all means save yourself 50% and buy the Weye Feye.  But if you think you might want those features, or you're itching to try out the remote control pan/tilt tripod head, you might be better off with the CamRanger.For me, if I had it to do all over again and I could use both of them before buying... I don't know. From a cost/benefit standpoint I'd probably lean toward the cheaper Weye Feye, only because all of the CamRanger's additional functionality is ""nice"" for me but not ""necessary"" since as a hobby photographer I don't have much need for things like client mirroring and on-the-fly display watermarking, and the $150 I save could go toward something I'd get more use out of.  On the other hand, I've never had a connection issue with the CamRanger and it does occasionally happen with the Weye Feye where it briefly loses/regains its connection to the phone, even when they're only two feet apart. So the dependability of the CamRanger might be worth some extra cash.So! Sorry about the (very) wordy review, but I like to be thorough with things like this because there's a lot for prospective buyers to consider. PLEASE feel free to comment on the review if you have any questions that I might be able to answer for you, or if you think I've said anything incorrectly that you'd like me to correct.  I promise to try to keep this review updated as new versions of the software and firmware are released.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQA0BS1E23FST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKYYSZK#wasThisHelpful","RQA0BS1E23FST","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think the pictures that the manufacturer has put up for this speaker are a good representation of its uses on a bike -- namely, low speed cruising or something similar.  It seems perfectly suited to a standard bike or a beach cruiser, especially when not on the road.  If you're on the road and you can hear it well over the traffic, then you're potentially blocking audio cues from your environment, and that could put your safety at risk.I use this mainly as a tabletop speaker. In that regard it performs extremely well, better than the Cyber Acoustics PS-2370 that is my sole point of comparison for Bluetooth portable speakers. I appreciate this model's buttons for the most common functions (Volume +/-, play/pause, prev/next track, answer call) which means going to the phone less often.There's a mini USB port for charging the unit, a 1/8"" headphone jack for non-Bluetooth devices, and if needed, a USB port in the back allows you to charge your phone off of the speaker's battery. I haven't seen any stats on the size of the battery so I don't know how much of a charge you'll get before you drain it, but it's a nice feature to have in case you need it.The speaker also comes with a water resistant form-fitting neoprene case that can be used to protect the speaker if it starts to rain (although if you have it on a bike, you need to remove it from the mount first).  The case has the buttons imprinted on it so that the speaker can still be used while inside it.The audio quality is great, for a portable speaker of this size.  The volume is good (though having not tested it on a bike while riding, I can't speak to how it performs in that regard) and the sound is clear. Build quality is excellent, and they make heavy use of that soft touch plastic that seems to be all the rage right now. All things considered, I haven't yet found anything to complain about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYJCR4GJS1CML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9ICXFA#wasThisHelpful","RYJCR4GJS1CML","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The CSG-800 has all of the basic functionality that you'd expect from any grilling thermometer, including:- Choice of meat type and doneness level. Thermometer alerts you when the meat reaches the correct temperature.- Countdown timer, alerts you when time expires.- Monitoring of current temperatureThis isn't your best choice if you're looking for something to use with a smoker, because there's only one port for a probe. For a smoker, look for something with 2 ports -- one for the meat, and one to monitor the interior temperature of the smoker.  The build quality is pretty decent and most of the exterior consists of soft touch plastic.  Overall, it's solidly in the middle of the other two I probe thermometers I own in terms of build quality.  It is the only one to offer a way to store the probe though, providing an area to wrap the cord around it and lock the probe into place.Unfortunately, we've already reached the end of ""Things I Like About the CSG-800"".The display quality is not very good (see the photos). Under most lighting conditions, the contrast is extremely low and it can be hard to read. Almost like the battery is nearly dead, but it works fine and the battery gauge shows they're fully charged. Contrast is higher at certain angles under direct outdoor light, but it produces a shadow on the LCD that also affects readability. There is no backlight either, so it's not great in low light conditions.  The display stand doesn't put the unit at a particularly good viewing angle unless it's sitting at about the height of your chin. The magnet mount works fine on painted metal grills, but it might not be strong enough if you're using an enamel coated grill.I was initially impressed with the accuracy, but that quickly changed.  While it looks accurate at lower temperatures (like when reading ambient air temp), as soon as I started using it for real, I was disappointed and annoyed.  My first trial came when grilling some nice steaks. I should have been more wary of an untested unit, but foolishly I relied entirely on the probe to determine when the steaks were done.  Once the temperature read 140F (rare), I took them off the grill, expecting them to be closer to medium rare after resting a couple of minutes.  They ended up being on the high side of medium well, and the probed one was the most overcooked.  There's no way that steak was 140º when it came off the grill.The second (and officially the last, I think) time I used the unit, I was slow smoking some pastrami that had been several weeks in the making. I was aiming for a final temperature around 190ºF. When the temperature read 163º, I started thinking back to those poor, ruined steaks and got a little nervous.  So I grabbed one of my other grilling thermometers and stuck the probe in near the other one so I could verify the reading.  It read 180º.I can't trust it, so I can't use it. The quest for the perfect grilling thermometer continues.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2739XM7UCCM4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0GX6B0#wasThisHelpful","R2739XM7UCCM4T","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The images associated with the product all show the same flat, perfectly square surface to set it on.  That doesn't really help those of us with less than ideal sink shapes. My sink, in addition to not having a perfectly square shape, also hangs on top of the counter with rounded, raised edges.  I didn't really hold out much hope for the colander being as stable as they claim.  But I was wrong.  It sits on the sink like a champ.  I can press down on the basket area to simulate more weight than I would ever need it to hold, and it's solid.  I've included a picture of the imperfect sink shape as well as one with the colander in place, for reference.Any part that touches a surface (the feet that touch the side of the sink, as well as the underside of the ""shelf"" part) are soft, grippy rubber.

"At the time of this review, the Sentry 6-pack is a little more than 25% cheaper than the Frontline Plus 6-pack, with the same active ingredients. That alone makes it the better option of the two, because otherwise they're identical.As far as how it compares to other competing products, that's a bit harder to determine.  I have always had more luck with this than with SimpleGuard (the product my vet started carrying after Frontline Plus went OTC) and Advantix.  Some may claim that this is due to the effectiveness of a given medication on the type of fleas and ticks in a given area.  So, the ticks that are most common here in Central Florida might be more resistant to a given brand than ticks found in North Carolina.  I'm not sure if this is true as I've seen no studies on the matter, but it would make sense.  It's for that reason that it would be extremely difficult to blindly recommend this product over any others.  All I can say is that it works for me, and the fact that it's cheaper than the lower-performing, higher cost brand prescribed by the vet is an added bonus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TBM80MLWTHXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QO2CN8A#wasThisHelpful","R2TBM80MLWTHXD","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a couple of weeks with this case, I'm pretty convinced that it's one of the best you can buy for your phone.  I had previously owned this slim case for my phone, made by one of those questionable companies that keeps changing its name and puts the entire product description in the title, which drives me nuts.  That case is good, and far less expensive, but had some flaws.This one has only two flaws that I can see -- the price and phone removal.  $50 is a lot for a phone case.  I guess one could argue that you probably won't ever need another one until you get a new phone... but still, it seems expensive.  Phone removal is a problem too.  It can be done. but it's not easy and it involves putting quite a bit of pressure on the device.  If I were one to remove the case often, I would be more annoyed with this, so keep that in mind if you remove the case frequently to use with various docks, etc.It adds to the thickness of the phone, but it's not too bad, and it's worth it for the protection. The rubberized rim around the screen means you can place the phone face down on a table without worrying about your screen. Other than that beveled edge and the button covers, the rest of the case exterior is a harder plastic that so far has shown no signs of use in the time I've owned it.The volume buttons and lock button are fully covered by the same soft rubber that makes up the interior of the case, and the ringer switch and various ports on the bottom are open but surrounded by that same rubber, creating a sort of seal that keeps any dust from entering the interior of the case and causing potential problems with wear marks and scratches.  I still remove the phone every couple of weeks (with aforementioned difficulty) to clean it and the case off just in case, but I never see anything in there when I do. That is a definite improvement over my last case, which required cleaning out every few days because dust and dirt got in there so easily.The company makes a big deal about the raised ridge pattern in the soft rubber of the case interior, claiming it makes a difference in shock/drop protection.  I can't confirm that claim, but I suppose it can't hurt, and even without it this case would still feel like the most protective case I've ever owned for any phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QI4J8EISJJQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ON39CQ8#wasThisHelpful","R2QI4J8EISJJQW","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So anxious was I to get my new mobile transceiver and antenna dialed in (a few days after getting my license) that I went straight to the SWR meter sitting in the garage to start testing.  That is, the SWR meter that I had bought for the *ahem* CB install, not knowing that it wasn't compatible.What's that smell?Anyway, lesson learned. I ordered this one minutes later.  It seems to work fine, although I don't have any way of actually verifying the readings. I used it to dial in the mounted antenna on the Jeep, and then set up a smaller glass-mount antenna in the other car that I can hook up to my HT.  If you're looking for more precision than one decimal place, this may not be the meter for you, but if you're okay with a reading like ""1.3-ish"" then this is a solid and reasonably affordable option. It seems to be built like a tank, too -- it's heavy for its size.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPTG9OQELL7S3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GNVJ8IU#wasThisHelpful","RPTG9OQELL7S3","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simple and inexpensive.  It's exactly what I needed.  I'm using this to connect the antenna on my Jeep to my Baofeng UV-5Rv2+.

"This antenna works beautifully on my Baofeng UV-5RV2+.  It's a significant upgrade from the antenna that came with the radio, and I've been surprised by the range so far.  I tested it recently from inside my house, logging in to an Echolink repeater (21 miles away) and recording my own radio check, it came back with a small amount of white noise but otherwise perfectly audible. With the original rubber duck, I could receive from that repeater, but I could never get out to it.I don't know if it's the best antenna available, but it's definitely the best of the three I've tried (this, the included rubber duck, and the Nagoya NA-701).For reference, I tested the SWR on a Nissei RS-40 and came up with 1.2:1 @ 144MHz and 1.4:1 @ 446 MHz.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V13JJNUTYRJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9LPHBA#wasThisHelpful","R1V13JJNUTYRJ1","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this pad (attached to a Griot's Garage 6"" Random Orbital Polisher ) but I do wonder if I'm doing something wrong. After applying the wax using the Red 6.5"" Foam Waxing Pad, I switched over to this pad and started removing it.  However, while it did remove some of the wax, there was still a haze on the paint in most areas. I didn't want to apply TOO much pressure, so after going over the whole body with this pad, I grabbed a dry microfiber towel and easily removed what remained of the wax.  This was clearly an easier process than removing ALL of the wax by hand with the towel, but it does have me wondering if I'm either applying it wrong or taking it off wrong, because I expected this pad to finish the job, not just start it.However, I'm not going to deduct any stars for something that is surely due to my own inexperience with orbit buffers. The pad itself is well-made, and after using it on a couple of cars, it shows no signs of separation or damage.  It looks like it's going to last quite a while.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FFET2G2X64PR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LJ3BLQY#wasThisHelpful","R1FFET2G2X64PR","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, I really like this spray. I feel like some of the bad reviews might be missing the point a bit, so I'll do my best to explain why I'm happy with it.First, let's get the scent out of the way. Yes, as so many have stated, it does smell like you're spraying piña colada all over your car.  An oft-overlooked point is that (at least for me) the next time I get into the car I can't smell it at all. It dissipates quickly, so the only time I'm really smelling it is when I'm applying it. Even if I HATED the smell (which I don't) it would be tough for me to complain about it since it's gone almost immediately.As far as the cleaning is concerned, it seems to do a very good job.  On a black interior, you may not see much of a difference (other than having removed the dust). What you won't see (I suspect this is the basis of some poor reviews) is ANY added gloss or shine, no matter how minor. None. I have often used Turtle Wax ICE Interior Care, and while one of the benefits of ICE is a significantly reduced ""oily sheen"" as is common with the much-maligned Armor All spray, there still is just a tiny bit -- enough to make the interior have that ""just-cleaned"" look for a couple of days. You won't get that with InnerClean.I'll admit it was a little disconcerting at first, and I thought maybe it wasn't working. That is, until I looked at the cloth and saw the gray from the dirt that it had picked up. Dirt embedded in the steering wheel from daily contact, dirt hiding in those tiny texture crevices in the vinyl and plastic, all that stuff. When you're done, the dash will look like it's supposed to look -- not any shinier than that.My only concern is the protection, and that's only because I only have the word of the product description (""...coating the surface with their patented solar fighter UV protection"") to go by. Hopefully it protects surfaces at least as well as the competition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJX9STDLWV7AC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LPEZ6Q#wasThisHelpful","RJX9STDLWV7AC","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have several paste and liquid waxes in the garage right now, and I'd say that of all of them, this one may be the easiest to apply and remove by hand. It's certainly easier than any of the paste waxes.  If you're using an orbital buffer, you need to take slightly more care when pouring on to the pad, just because there's no real control like there would be with a squeeze bottle.  Otherwise, the process is the same and pretty simple. Generally speaking, my orbital didn't fully remove the wax once applied. It did most of the hard work, but I still had to go over it lightly with a dry cloth to finish the job. For reference, I'm using a Griot's Garage 6"" Random Orbital Polisher with a 6.5"" Finishing Pad to remove the wax.It looks great once applied, but honestly I've never been very good at actually being able to tell the difference between one wax and another visually, so I can't really compare it there.From a ""feel"" perspective, the Glanz Wax does score pretty highly on the slickness scale. I'd put it very close, but not quite as high, as Maguiar's Tech Wax 2.0. It definitely feels smoother to me than the Griot's Garage Premium Carnauba Paste Wax that I also use.The one test that I'm most interested in is how long it lasts -- currently the wax I own that wins the longevity race is the Maguiar's Tech Wax 2.0, which maintains that slickness for a good six months on my garaged vehicle.  Once I get an idea of the longevity of the Glanz Wax, I'll be able to update the review with a comparison.Until then, I can say that this is a worthwhile product with a good price point.  At the current price, it's about the same price per ounce as the Tech Wax mentioned above. Without knowing anything about the longevity of the Glanz Wax yet... I'd say these two waxes are otherwise equally good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HS7WGTT42C3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000V0DYUW#wasThisHelpful","R2HS7WGTT42C3Y","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, so the book to study for the exam costs more than the exam. It's worth it to feel well-prepared.  Before buying the book, I had started by looking around online for websites that would do the same job for free. Problem is, it doesn't exist.  You either pay to use the site (in that case I'd rather just buy the book) or you get free sites that aren't particularly well-suited to learning the material.After struggling with a couple of these sites, I bought the book.  It's just better.  Everything is laid out according to topic, and after reading each section you're presented with the related questions on the exam. Even while you're reading, if a sentence answers an exam question, that question's identifier is added in brackets at the end of the sentence.Once you get through all of the material, the entire question pool is available at the end of the book. They're the exact questions used in the exam (35 are selected out of the question pool). Basically, if you can test your way through the entire question pool at the end of the book and miss 9 questions or less, you're guaranteed to pass the exam.This is probably more due to my personality and learning style than anything else, but I did occasionally have a problem with some of the material because it would be glossed over a bit too quickly for my liking.  I don't have a lot of electrical knowledge so this wasn't a review for me, I was actually learning it. I had to keep reminding myself that the purpose of the book isn't to teach me the inner workings of everything from the ground up -- it's to prepare me for the exam. So after reading the entire book, I had to be okay with the fact that I'm not going to clearly understand the ""why and how"" to every concept presented.  I'll need to continue learning through other means for that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZEIFNZXROBCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625950136#wasThisHelpful","R2ZEIFNZXROBCF","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second SteelSeries headset, the first being the far less expensive and smaller SteelSeries 5Hv3. The differences are significant, as you'd expect considering the price difference. It's not ALL in favor of the higher end one, though.This headset has a ton of features, largely due to the included USB sound card. While the sound card is optional (and at any rate not compatible with phones, tablets, etc.), it's recommended because you need to be using the sound card in order to enable Dolby emulation, ear cup illumination, the EQ, microphone sound options, etc.  When using the headset with standard 1/8"" jacks, none of these things are available and it works like any other headset.The build is pretty spectacular, feeling much nicer in the hands than the 5Hv3. The headband is great -- rather than the usual click-stop size adjustments, it uses a spring-loaded retractable system that automatically sizes itself when you put it on and retracts when you take it off. It works perfectly. The ear cups are thick and incredibly soft. I haven't had any problems wearing them for over an hour, although I haven't worn them longer than that. Some noise bleeds through, about the same as the 5Hv3, which is surprising considering the difference in the size of the earcups. It's not bad though, by any stretch. And if there's any sound coming through the speakers, the outside noise pretty much disappears.I started off using just the 1/8"" headphone jack attachment, to test it out.  For music, I actually preferred the 5Hv3, which sounded a little more natural, while the Siberia was a bit ""echoey"" (can you tell I'm not an audiophile?). The vocals felt a bit more distant, with the background music more prevalent.  It still sounds good, but the 5Hv3 sounded better.Plugging the headset into the sound card changes everything. First of all, the configuration. Set the EQ using presets or customize each band. Set the microphone noise canceling, the ""talkback"" level (hearing yourself in the speakers when you talk into the mic), turn Dolby emulation on/off, and set the earcup illumination.For the illumination, you get the standard color swatch and slider to choose your color from, or if you really have a specific color in mind, you can enter an RGB triplet or hex value. And no, you won't be able to tell the difference between values that are near each other.  The actual output colors are an approximation at best.  Once you choose your color, you can select to have it steady on, ""breathe"" (fading/pulsating at a user-defined rate), or have it change the brightness based on the sound coming through the speakers (an odd choice, since you're either the person hearing or the person seeing, but never both).  Finally, there are a handful of multi-color fade options if you want your skull to look like the bar in some sort of ultra-lounge.Honestly, I don't see the point in the illumination. Sure, I picked a color and I leave it on, but I can't see it. My wife and dog don't care. Does anyone care? I doubt it. But that's just my thoughts on it.  If that's the reason you're looking at these, maybe ask yourself how much you really want that illumination since the only time you'll see it is when you take them off but leave them plugged in.Anyway, the sound card allows you to plug the headphones in using the special jack (required for illumination), or a standard 1/8"" phone/mic combo. The sound when plugged in to the sound card is fantastic, both for music and games. Even the system sounds are better through the headphones because they sound ""placed"" on the screen.Now, these are pretty big.  Fine for playing at home but a bit unwieldy if you're planning on traveling with them. However, I do like the extra 1/8"" jack at the base of the headset that allows another pair to be connected for a second listener. It seems like if you could cram these into your carry-on, it would be a good way to allow two people to watch videos on a tablet or listen to the same music. Of course, I suppose you could just get a splitter for that too.Both the Siberia and the 5Hv3 have good, clear microphones. The Siberia's microphone has a white LED that remains lit while muted so you can always determine your mic status out of the corner of your eye without taking your eyes off the screen. In very dark environments, if you're often on mute, the glare can be a little distracting. The mute/unmute is switched via a rubberized wheel on the outside of the earcup (on the non-mic side, the same rotating wheel controls the volume).Overall, I really enjoy these. I only wish that the sound when using the headphone jack was a little better.  It would be cool if they offered this exact headset, without the illumination, for a discounted price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q7J8KSCRQ6JM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MSOEWQY#wasThisHelpful","R3Q7J8KSCRQ6JM","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is solid!  I have a stand whose purpose it is to elevate the rear tire for maintenance work, and it's FAR less stable than this stand is. Finish and craftsmanship is top notch, it's heavy duty all around. Its ability to fold means that I'm more likely to pack it when we take a weekend trip, rather than relying on the hotel room wall to support the bike.The only thing I would change about it is that while the bike is well-protected by the rubber coating on the fork, there is no such coating to protect your floor from the metal.  While it's not a problem for my application, I could see someone with wood floors looking to find something to put under it to prevent scratches.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JK1NJS1RMMMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MV0TXJ6#wasThisHelpful","R1JK1NJS1RMMMC","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second bike storage rack, the first being the significantly cheaper but less interesting Stoneman Sports DBR-820.The build is simple, just a matter of putting the pieces together and locking them down with a few nuts. It took a few minutes and it was done. The instructions were fine for the build, although a little vague at the end when they showed a level being used to ensure that the unit is straight, and adjusting the feet accordingly. That's fine, but the rack never actually sits perfectly vertical -- it leans slightly back, I'm assuming to shift the center of gravity under load so that it's less likely to topple forward.The upper arms can be installed in one of two heights, and the lower arms can be installed at one of three different heights. Other than the wood panel, the rubber cups, and the plastic feet, everything is metal and feels solid.  That's another advantage over the Stoneman, which has plastic arms. They have been fine for over a year now, but they just don't feel as trustworthy as the arms on the Saris.So, I currently have the two city bikes on the Stoneman and the two road bikes on the Saris. It seemed like the natural choice, the lightweight, sleek road bikes looking perfectly at home on the modern, attractive rack.Here's a warning though, about the way the arms are spaced.  This is a non-issue on most road bikes and hybrids with a straight top tube (actually, the stance makes them feel very stable on the rack), but other bike styles like women's cruisers or possibly men's mountain bikes without a straight top tube *may* have some problems fitting on the rack. I can't verify because I don't have a men's mountain bike, but just by eyeballing it, it looks like it would be a problem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R82S3N6LZ8KC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MV0TZ2G#wasThisHelpful","R82S3N6LZ8KC5","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As others have said, it is more expensive than other competing solar panels. But there seems to be a couple of pretty good reasons why it costs more, so let's get that out of the way first.1) Some solar panels don't come with a rechargeable battery. This one does (with integrated flashlight). Without a battery, the instant you lose the sun, you lose your charge. With a battery, you can store charge for use later on, when the weather may not be cooperating.  There are options to buy the panel without a battery pack, such as this one.2) Some solar panels don't come with a quality interchangeable regulator. Some may be designed for charging devices, some may be design for charging car batteries.  This one supports the use of several different regulators, so you can charge just about anything.3) Some solar panels mention nothing about water resistance or ruggedization.4) This unit allows you connect multiple panels together to improve your charging capability.So, here's what I love about this panel:- Everything I mentioned above.- There are four points for anchoring the panel with clips, carabiners, etc.  They are heavily reinforced so you don't need to worry about accidentally ripping through the fabric.- With multiple panels, they can all be linked together in any configuration: lined up side by side, grid, etc. The heavy-duty velcro will hold them together as if they were one big panel.- The included 5V USB regulator has an integrated LED that tells you when there's enough sunlight available to charge.- You can either charge your device directly, or you can charge the battery pack and have backup power whenever you need it.- You can connect a device to the battery while it's being charged by the panel.- On an otherwise nice day, the regulator LED still shows available charging power even under the shade of a tree or building.- The flashlight is a nice touch on the battery pack.  While I wouldn't ever use it in favor of something like the Fenix LD22 (I usually have a couple of these on hand), this light is great for emergency use because it's easy to charge when no other power source is available.- It's a solar panel, and therefore awesome.The things I would change:- The cable for the regulator is only a couple of inches long. Look through the photos (ignore the ones with the really long red/black cable, that's not included here) and you'll see that with the panels facing up and the regulator is plugged in to the port, the regulator is hidden completely underneath because it's too short.  A few more inches would have been perfect to allow the regulator to be visible regardless of the position of the panels - that way you can more easily see the LED to determine if you're getting a good charge.- The user manual could probably use some work, although to be honest, it's not all that hard to figure out.- When the panels are folded up and held shut with the four velcro tabs, the tabs aren't quite long enough in the ""fold"" area, so they don't extend far enough to seal flat against the other side. It stays closed just fine, but it's kind of an OCD thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R332U4WV1TSZ7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H36XXE4#wasThisHelpful","R332U4WV1TSZ7I","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No issues so far!  As has been mentioned already in other reviews, avoid fakes by going through known sellers.  I've had the cable for a couple of weeks now.  It feels slightly thicker at the neck (and therefore less split-prone) than the Apple equivalent. Of course, I haven't yet had it long enough to tell for sure, but I'll update the review as time marches on.  At this point though, I actually prefer this cable to the one that came with my phone.=== Update 12/08/2014 ===This cable is still great. No changes to my rating, absolutely nothing has gone wrong.  Just got another one for my wife, because her Apple cable started fraying just like mine did.It's really unfortunate that some idiot selling fake cables can get lumped in under Belkin's legitimate product and completely destroy their ratings. At the time of this update, other sellers seem to have been removed, so hopefully the problem has been solved. Still, when ordering, make sure you're getting a cable from the Belkin seller (you should still have the option for Prime shipping).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGZ486ZIQXY9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LETJFNE#wasThisHelpful","RGZ486ZIQXY9Y","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are several sizes available for this charcoal storage bucket, this is the 8-gallon size.  It's big enough to hold about 24 pounds of charcoal, more than big enough for the big 20-lb bags.  You can empty the charcoal bags into the bucket for maximum storage capacity, or simply drop a bag in.  If you choose the latter, there's an extended lip inside the lid that is designed to hold the bag open.  In practice, this may be more trouble than it's worth because it involves carefully cutting the bag down to the same height as the bin, which sounds less annoying than it is.Other than that, it's a good looking bin that seals up nicely to keep the rain out for storage outdoors.

"Let's cut right to the chase. The sound quality is acceptable given the price point, but nothing that's going to blow your socks off. There is some help in the form of a basic bass/treble adjustment, but that will only take you so far -- and any adjustments there are exclusive of the X-BASS option, meaning you can either have your equalizer settings OR you can have the X-BASS turned on, but not both.I'm using this system in a small bedroom, not out in the middle of the house, so it doesn't really need a significant amount of power since it just needs to cover about 120 sq ft.  Well, I say that, but the bedroom has a small (~6 foot long) hallway in front of it that leads to the bathroom, and the room/bathroom/hallway are separated by a door to the rest of the house. We have visitors often, and I wanted the Sharp to be in the guest room since there's no TV. It does a pretty decent job of getting the sound out into the hallway, but the Bluetooth is spotty at best.  We're talking 2 paces from the bedroom door, phone in hand, and it's already starting to cut out - about 13 or 14 feet from the unit.I don't know too much about the various Bluetooth specs, and I'm sure that the bandwidth required for music is significant and particularly difficult due to its low tolerance for errors, but I'm sure they could have done better.  Hell, my phone can still communicate with the Bluetooth temperature probe on my smoker 100 feet away through several walls, one of which is exterior (of course, low bandwidth and high tolerance for errors, but still...).Anyway, back to it. The remote has too many buttons, and they are positioned awkwardly. For example, if you have an iPod docked physically on the unit, there's a play/pause button you can use. It's different than the play/pause button for Bluetooth connected devices. Which is different than the play/pause button for ""CD/USB"" mode (why CD and USB modes could share a play/pause button but the other modes could not is beyond me). It's simple. Whatever mode its currently in, the play/pause button should work on that mode, then you only need one of them!  These 3 play/pause buttons are located all in the same area at the bottom of the remote, and yet the prev/next buttons, which logically should be grouped with play/pause, are up in the top third. But wait, somehow the prev/next buttons ARE shared between modes - there's only one set of those.  Then you've got the one single line of mode buttons, for selecting CD, USB, tuner, and aux-in.  Ahh, but the buttons for iPod and Bluetooth are elsewhere.On the plus side, I definitely like the auto-on option in Bluetooth mode. The unit continues to broadcast itself as ready to pair even when it's in standby mode. So if you connect to it with your phone, it will power itself on and be ready to play music without any intervention from you.I guess the remote problem is pretty minor, it's just a usability issue. But this is Sharp, and you'd think that they have enough time in the game to how to design a remote. And other than the Bluetooth range, there really isn't anything particularly bad about this model if you're just trying to get music into a small space.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UIOIQVPFGGJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEU3ZGS#wasThisHelpful","R3UIOIQVPFGGJB","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm docking a star for now, based on the info I've provided in the updates at the bottom of my review. Obviously I'm still using it, and I'll continue to update as I come across new issues or solve existing ones.It's not perfect and I briefly considered a 3-star rating, but in the end I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and the reader can feel free to form their own opinions based on my reasoning below. I will also try to mention the main points of the two reviews prior to mine, as they relate to my own experience.First, let's get this compatibility issue out in the open.  Yes, this device requires Bluetooth v4.0 compatibility in order to work with your phone. No, the item description doesn't clearly state as much. It does say ""... via Bluetooth Smart connectivity"", which implies the BT 4.0 requirement, but I suppose that could easily be misunderstood. If you're not sure about your device, you can check the list of supported devices here: http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Bluetooth-Smart-Devices-List.aspxAs of today, there is no iPad version of the remote viewing software.  If you want to use your (supported) iPad, as of right now you have to download the iPhone app, which of course means that the resolution will be all wrong (and is very likely the reason a previous reviewer complained about the temperature not being displayed right on the iPad).  Hopefully they'll release an iPad version soon, but I don't know if they plan on that or not.The unit itself looks pretty nice and feels sturdy. It comes with the required AA batteries and a temperature probe. Right there, I was a bit disappointed -- one probe?  When I bought the Maverick ET-7 Remote Thermometer some time ago, it came with two probes. This is part of the reason I docked a star from the rating.  If you're using this on a smoker, you'll want to get an extra probe with it, one for the meat and one for the surrounding air inside the smoker. Luckily, the Maverick probes are compatible with this unit, so I was able to use one of those instead of buying a new one.The temperature seems to be accurate, within about two degrees of known calibrated sources. You can choose pre-selected meat types and a doneness level, and it will set the target temp for you, or you can set the target temp manually in 1-degree increments.  You also have the option of setting a timer, in case you want to monitor the temperature independently of the time required to cook.  All of these things can be done on the main unit or on your phone (or other BT 4.0 device, I'll default to phone here).  I'm using the AW133 with an iPhone 5, and the app looks and functions beautifully. It continuously updates the display with all of the pertinent information, from percentage complete (along with a graphical representation of completeness) to time elapsed, time remaining, etc.  The main unit's orange backlight changes to reddish-orange when the cooking is nearly done (5 degrees before target temp, if you're using a temp-based mode), and you get a notification on your phone. Then when the target temp is reached, the unit backlight turns red and it beeps several times.  You'll get another alert on your phone, but unfortunately there seems to be a bug that causes the ""finished"" alert to pop up several times in a row.The app also has an internal link to Allrecipes.com, if you're looking for ideas.  You can even take pictures of your cooking progress with a current temperature overlay (several different styles) for making people jealous.I've found the communication range to be exceptional. There's a transparent protective layer of some sort on the sliding glass door out to our back patio -- it was a major problem for the Maverick unit, because that film ruined communication between the base and the remote. Even 2 feet away from each other on opposite sides of the glass, there was no communication whatsoever.  With the AW133, not only can it communicate through that film, it even goes further, through several walls to the far opposite corner of the house. When I did finally find an end to the range (with the base at the far front of the house, inside by the front door, and me with my phone, outside in the back corner of the back yard), it was able to reconnect almost instantly when I got back in range.There are a couple of slight usability issues, and one of the previous reviewers touched on them. I do find myself occasionally touching buttons by accident because of how far out toward the edges the touch sensitivity extends. That's not a big deal.  The other reviewer also mentioned how turning it off (press and hold the Set button) only worked about 50% of the time.  This happened for me too, and it drove me crazy until I figured out what was happening: when you don't press a button for a few seconds, the backlight turns off and the buttons on the face go into a sort of standby mode. Touching any of the buttons turns the backlight back on, and puts the buttons in ""ready"" mode.  So when you haven't touched it in a few seconds, you need to tap it once to make it ready for input. THEN press and hold the Set button and it turns off.That's not in the manual anywhere, and yeah it's frustrating until you figure it out.  But now you don't have to, because I just told you about it.  Once you know about it, it's a non-issue.So overall, the AW133 works great.  One star reduction for: only one probe, alert bug on phone app when ""done"" (hopefully will be fixed in a software update), and I guess it would be nice on the main unit to have both probe temps visible without having to press a button to switch between them. Still, I can recommend the AW133 as a significant step up from the Maverick.=== UPDATE 08/19/2014 ===I'm sitting here right now, about 5.5 hours into smoking a brisket. The AW133 has been connected since I got started, with one probe in the brisket and another into the probe port on the smoker to measure the interior ambient temperature. Everything was working exactly as expected until just before the 5 hour mark, when all of a sudden my phone lost its connection to the main unit.  I don't know what caused it, but none of my numerous attempts to reconnect it were successful, including restarting the phone app. Finally, after every conceivable combination of pairing modes on the main unit and the phone, I was able to reconnect after a full reset of my phone. Unfortunately at that point I lost the elapsed time, since I guess if you're in ""Temperature"" or ""Meat Profile"" mode, the timer only exists on the phone and not on the main unit. Of course, the timer doesn't matter as much when you're in one of these modes, but it's still nice to have.  It's worth losing another star over if this connection problem happens again, but I'll wait until I can repeat it to make sure it wasn't a fluke.=== UPDATE 09/17/2014 ===I think I've figured out the connection problem mentioned in my previous update.  It seems that there's a bug in the iPhone app that causes the connection to go bad when you're constantly monitoring the temperature.  At least, that's what it looks like.  What I mean is that if I turn off the auto-lock on my phone, forcing the screen to stay on with the app active, eventually (after maybe 1-2 hours) the connection is lost and the only way to fix it is to reboot the phone.  However, if I check the temperature and then background the app (or lock the phone), then the connection is maintained. It would be nice if this bug was resolved in an update, but I don't honestly know how well-supported this app is going to be since I've seen no updates since I downloaded it.Also, I've noticed a pretty significant temperature differential when using the included probe versus the compatible ones that came with my Maverick.  At room temperature there seems to be about a 5-degree difference. I'm not sure yet about hotter temps, I'll be testing that soon. I can tell you this (keeping in mind that it *could* have been my fault as well): the first time I smoked a chicken (using a Maverick probe on the AW133), I took it off when the temp reached 170F and it was absolutely perfect. The second time, I used the included probe instead. I took the chicken off at 170F and cut into it only to find it was still pink in many areas.  Again, this could have been something I did, but now that I noticed the probe temp inconsistencies, I wonder if that had something to do with it.  I'll update again when I know better.=== UPDATE 09/30/2014 ===No resolutions so far to the existing issues, although the workaround for the connection problem that I mentioned in the previous update still works for me.  This morning, however, I've noticed a new problem that didn't exist previously. The probe connection has always been a little finicky, and occasionally the probe would stop giving readings, but I always assumed it was water entry into the probes or some similar issue. Maybe not. The new behavior is that when I try to use two probes, neither of them will read. If I take out either one, the remaining one will immediately start working again. Put them both back in, they stop working. I really hope it's not broken for good. At any rate, until I come up with a resolution I'm taking a star off.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUKS305DNR4NA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFSW0AQ#wasThisHelpful","RUKS305DNR4NA","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say I'm pretty impressed.  I didn't have particularly high hopes for the speaker, and although it's by no means perfect, it's better than I expected it to be.To start, this thing is lighter than it looks. I expected it to be denser feeling, but the weight is nice for something intended to be portable.  It's a pretty good size, too. Maybe a little too big to comfortably fit into a pocket, but easily stored in a bag or something without taking up much space. The build quality feels solid, and rubber feet are positioned for both setting on a table or attached to an outlet on the wall.The manual suggested allowing it to fully charge before use, so I plugged it in, and it was done charging in about two hours.  You're not getting top quality audio out of these 2W speakers, but you really can't expect that for something this size.  It is acceptable though, and the volume range seems quite good.  The box suggests that you can get ""up to 8 hours"" of listening time in on one charge, but surprisingly my experience suggests quite a bit more than that. The last several days, I've been pairing the speaker first thing in the morning and using it for music while working.  After 9 hours at medium volume, the speaker show no signs of quitting -- in fact, I haven't run it all the way down yet, so I don't know how long it will last.One nice feature is the built-in microphone, which allows you to use it as a speakerphone if someone calls while you're connected. There's an auxiliary input if you are using a non-BT device, and a USB port for a secondary method of charging.  Both of those cables are included. The pairing is easy. Hold the BT button for a couple of seconds and then select it on your device.  On subsequent uses, the speaker will reconnect to the previous device, if it's available. I'm not a huge fan of the voice status notifications though -- when you turn on or off the speaker or connect or disconnect a Bluetooth device, a loud obnoxious voice says, ""POWER ON!"" or ""YOU ARE NOW PAIRED! ENJOY!"". It's annoying because it's at a high volume (it doesn't seem to be affected by your selected volume) and its kind of jarring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FXCEF5C8NICQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K4WAB8A#wasThisHelpful","R2FXCEF5C8NICQ","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So up until now, our filtered water came from our two-pronged attack -- a Brita pitcher that we keep in the fridge, and a PUR Faucet Water Filter that attaches to the end of our kitchen faucet.  The pitcher has always worked fine, but refilling can be annoying since both of us drink a lot of water.  The PUR faucet attachment did the trick, as long as it wasn't too busy leaking through the threads or popping off the faucet into the sink.  But then our aging faucet developed a leak, and I decided to replace it with a much nicer Moen 7185CSL Brantford One-Handle High Arc Pull-down Kitchen Faucet. The PUR faucet attachment would no longer be compatible, but the new faucet's integrated sprayer meant there would be an extra port in the sink where the old sprayer used to reside. So I decided to splurge a little and buy this filtered water faucet.Boy, am I glad I did.  It's easily the most convenient option for filtered water delivery.  The filter (one is included) is good for 6 months, and a light will flash at the base of the faucet when it's time to replace it. In a perfect world, a green/yellow/red transitioning light (like the PUR had) would have been nice, rather than just the red ""change it now"" light, but that's not a big deal.The faucet is all metal, and the handle turns with ease while being nicely damped in a way that feels quality. The head pivots to any direction.  Installation was pretty simple, and a tool was included to aid in the tightening of the nut that locks it into place against the sink -- this tool was a huge time saver, because getting up in there with a wrench is an absolute nightmare.  Everything I needed was included in the package, so it was nice not to have to run out to get something at the hardware store.I was able remove the old faucet and install both the main faucet and this one in about 2.5 hours, not bad for someone that has never done any of that before! Although much credit goes to Moen's design for making it as easy as possible.*** Update 12/18/2014 ***Nothing new to add for the faucet itself. Still working great.

"I bought this to replace the kitchen faucet that predates our ownership of the house, which had started to leak all over the counter every time it was used. Purchased on a Monday morning, the 2-day shipping estimate (Amazon Prime) was for Friday because of a possible ""1 to 2 days for processing"".  The faucet arrived on Tuesday, beating Amazon's own best-case scenario!Removal of the old faucet was the real nightmare, but once done, the install of this faucet was surprisingly simple. They even include a tool that allows you to easily tighten the nut that holds it down without struggling with a wrench in that really cramped space.  Much of the time savings was probably due to that tool. I don't care much for the fact that the nut is plastic though - I would have preferred something metal. The faucet is reasonably solid on the sink after tightening the nut down, but it's also not that difficult to grab the base and forcibly move it. I'll probably have to go back under the sink and try to tighten the nut a little more.Other than the plastic nut, the only other thing that bothers me a little is that the removable faucet head is plastic while everything else is metal. I suppose this may be for weight purposes - a heavier faucet head may not return back as easily.At any rate, I liked it enough to splurge a little more and purchase the Moen 77200CSL AquaSuite Filtering Kitchen Faucet for the port left open by the old faucet's sprayer.

"Maybe my shaker is just a non-standard size (for reference, I have a 30-oz Winco shaker) but when I place this strainer over the top, there's still about a quarter-inch gap between the spring and the shaker lip.  This isn't a major issue because I just put a little bit of forward pressure on the strainer with my finger while holding it, and this keeps the spring in contact with the ""correct"" part of the shaker lip when straining.Other than that, I can find no fault at all with the strainer.  It's well built, sturdy, and the rubberized grip provides a good slip-proof surface for your finger.Even with the minor sizing issue, I'd happily purchase this strainer again before switching to another brand.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12WOO8IBUDS1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DAQ93#wasThisHelpful","R12WOO8IBUDS1N","A2N75ADJSRW0AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N75ADJSRW0AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using an old blue denim apron for years (it's a keepsake from a late relative) but figured this one might be a fun addition for my girlfriend to use alongside me for grilling out. It's a nice apron, boasting several 'updates' over the really old one I've been using:- the neck strap is connected to the waist strap, so you can actually adjust the neck strap length by pulling on the waist straps- a pocket in the front is a place to stash a kitchen towel, or the salt / pepper, or tongs... whatever you likeWell, that exhausts my list of the technological improvements made to the Apron in the decade or so since my relative's death and my inheritance of that old apron.

"I received this as a sample item for review right after I'd cooked a multi-day supply of spicy Indian eggplant / lentil curry. You'll agree when I say that, with a serving or two of the curry every day, I have put this product through its paces in the bathroom. I have to say -- it works. That lady in the commercial isn't lying.The Juniper Woods scent is a very pleasing scent redolent of, well, Juniper Woods I suppose. Woodsy-sweet, sort of cedary. Not musky, but not floral either. Clean without being chemical or overly sweet. I have a reduced water consumption toilet so the initial surface area is pretty small. Three sprays and I am effectively shielded from any atmospheric effects during / after my daily bombing run.This really is a pretty ingenious product. If you didn't believe the claims they made on TV, take it from me -- this product works.At ten bucks for the 2 oz and fifteen bucks for the 4 oz bottles, this stuff isn't cheap. I doubt I'd pay those prices, so I'm docking these a star for being significantly more expensive than the tried-and-true method of lighting a match. I know lighting a match leaves a conspicuous scent and lets the next person know you've been dropping a deuce, but let's be honest -- the burst of Juniper Woods scent is just as conspicuous.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CTB7LXMSSVYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RW6S6VK#wasThisHelpful","R2CTB7LXMSSVYJ","AQM0K7MBBT4AY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQM0K7MBBT4AY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These little cans are all about CONVENIENCE -- with a 6-8 oz flask of tequila and a 4-pack of these cans, you can make 4 average-strength margaritas. Decent for tailgating or beach camping, but they're not as attractive if you're just making margaritas at home.FLAVOR-wise, these are on par with other margarita mixes. They taste decent but are very sweet -- after water, High Fructose Corn Syrup is second on the ingredients list. I'm not one of those people who's afraid of corn syrup, but would caution y'all that the flavor is sweet, almost syrupy, and needs to be cut with something (unless you like very sweet margaritas). Some soda water, a slice of lime, and salt are really needed with this mix to make the flavors pop and not become too syrupy.These are 130 calories per can -- not bad, except for the fact the cans are less than half the size of a soda can. So, really, these are packing a lot of sugar calories. Anyone who knows anything about margaritas shouldn't be surprised here. However, I again have to comment that they could have cut just a tiny bit of the corn syrup out (and I know Agave Nectar 'perfects' this margarita mix, but personally doubt there's much in there) and put a little more citrus in there.PRICE-wise, this is another one of those Amazon listings for a product that is sold at significantly cheaper per-unit prices at retail stores right by you. My local Wally World sells this same product in 24-packs for only a little more than double the price of this 4-pack here on Amazon. Per unit, that means Amazon charges nearly 3 times what this product costs in a normal retail store. I understand it's convenient having these mailed to you but -- if you already have to go out to buy a bottle of tequila, you might as well just pick up a 24-pack (or one of those quart bottles, which will also be cheaper) while you're out. You'll need more than 4 of these tiny cans to make enough margarita to go through a single bottle of tequila anyway.This is a decent product, convenient, tastes okay... but the flavor doesn't blow me away, and Amazon's current pricing is just flat-out uncompetitive at current rates. Currently these are over 2 bucks a can -- they should be in the neighborhood of a dollar per can (or less) in order to be worth getting vs. just buying some margarita mix at the liquor store where I have to go anyway to pick up tequila. 2 stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31FKMXD0661R2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYR51NA#wasThisHelpful","R31FKMXD0661R2","AQM0K7MBBT4AY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQM0K7MBBT4AY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As soon as this arrived, I fired it up and setup Windows 10 with minimal issues. After going through the setup, subsequent boot-ups are amazingly fast thanks to the 128GB SSD. I've spent a good deal of time with Windows 8 / 8.1, and have to say 10 is a definite improvement. It improves functionality and really makes the most of the rise in touchscreens without trying to make itself in to an app-y cell phone screen. Speaking of touchscreen laptops -- if you're only used to touchscreen phones / tablets, but still have an old-style laptop, know this: the touchscreen vastly improves productivity and turns web browsing into a very fluid experience.As for the display itself, the screen color, contrast, and resolution are crisp with the only drawback being the finger smudges you’ll leave all over it. As we move into a market where touchscreen is common in laptops, I expect we'll see a lot more alcohol wipes being sold...Physically, the construction is solid with glossy brushed aluminum / plastic throughout. The keyboard is backlit with subtly rounded key surfaces improving the tactile feel. My only complaint with the physical design is the incongruous green indicators on the Caps and Num Lock buttons; I'd  prefer to leave Num Lock on, but the indicator is light is a distraction from the otherwise sleek aesthetics. The touchpad left and right buttons are part of the flexible touchpad with the left being redundant (the whole pad is a 'left' button) and the right I frequently find having to hit twice. I've experienced this issue before and am not sure how to get around it, outside of just using a normal mouse.Battery life is good, easily making it through streaming a few movies to the TV. It's sufficient for a movie night, doing work on an airplane ride (more about that later), etc. The ports are in the technical specs, but in short, there's plenty of connectivity with this laptop. If you find the connection ports lacking there are probably other reasons for you not to get this computer.Apart from the touchscreen, the defining feature of the unit is the rotatable screen. The flexibly and balance of the unit takes it from being a laptop to an anywheretop. It’s light enough and generates little enough heat that its comfortable using long term in any position.  Time will tell how the hardware holds up and if bloatware drags down the performance of the system but my desktop will be very lonely until that day happens. It's really nice being able to have a laptop at my desk or a large-screen, high-performance tablet on my couch or on an airplane -- without needing two different devices. The tablet orientation of this laptop is GREAT for plane rides, since you can lie it flat on your tray table and don't have to fiddle with balancing between tray space and the monitor viewing angle.Overall, this gets 5 stars. Tons of performance and convenience and a truly revolutionary experience with the rotable touchscreen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXLXXLVPBQEBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010SBB27U#wasThisHelpful","RXLXXLVPBQEBV","AQM0K7MBBT4AY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQM0K7MBBT4AY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had a fabric Samsonite carry-on for a decade or more and it's served me very well, but I jumped at the opportunity to try and review this Tumi one. The polycarbonate shell and prestige of the Tumi name really had me excited. Now that I've had time to play around with it I have to admit I'm a little underwhelmed. It's a good bag -- don't get me wrong -- but this thing is priced in the ultra-premium range. It's easily double or even triple the price for comparable polycarbonate luggage from other great brands like Samsonite, so I'd expect double or triple the performance...First, the positives:+ the 21"" height is legit. For some reason, Tumi's actual website lists this as 22"" high. Maybe they're factoring in the height of the handle... hmm+ dimensions are compliant with international carry-on dimensions. Key here is the 9"" depth. Some airlines are very strict indeed about that, and it's common for even international carry-on sizes to be 9.5"" depth, which would be an issue with those rigid bag checker boxes+ the polycarbonate shell looks stylish indeed+ integrated combination lock is maybe redundant since you won't typically be checking this bag, but it's pretty cool nonetheless+ the four double-roller wheels are free swiveling for a very smooth experience rolling this bag. It's also very stable+ compression straps are handy for keeping your clothes from shifting (on that one side of the bag, at least)Now, some negatives...- the polycarbonate finish, while slick looking, easily shows fingerprints and smudges. Over time the glossy finish will show scratches and scuffs as well. I'm a little confused as to why they went with glossy finishes rather than the brushed finish on other polycarbonate luggage, designed to conceal scuffs and scratches- there are no carry handles on the side or bottom of this bag. You can only lift it from the top. Because of the way the bag is made, the non-handle half isn't supported by anything other than the zipper, which I suspect could be an issue over time as the zipper wears with use AND with repeatedly bearing the load of the contents inside- the wheels, while smooth, protrude and are more prominent than my Samsonite bag. Since volume is such a key issue with a bag that fits within the strictest international carry-on limits, I'm surprised they didn't have the wheels a little closer to the bag body. I'd say there is a solid half-inch of extra height they could have squeezed in there -- and this does matter!- the 'compression strap' side is the only one with open storage -- that is, storage you can access without having to unzip something. My Samsonite has a mesh storage pocket in the opening hatch portion which is handy for books, toiletries, etc. With the Tumi, any small, loose stuff has to be stashed in an opaque zippered compartment- the label is bolted to the luggage. I guess that makes it solid, but it also means the backside of four bolts protrude from the inside wall. They stuck a piece of foam tape over them, but it still just seems a little weird. Why not rivet it so it's more flush to the bag? Again, this is something that eats a tiny bit of volume. It's slight, but it counts. And it'll also be an eventual source of wear for the liner material.- this might be the biggest con -- for all the touted strength / lightness of the polycarbonate material, this luggage is not noticeably lighter than my Samsonite luggage! The Samsonite is slightly wider and taller, plus it can be expanded, AND it has rigid sides (the only non-rigid part is the lid)... but it's no heavier than the Tumi, which is entirely flexible. I understand the polycarbonate is designed to flex, but I'm surprised at just how flexible it is, especially with the fact that the zipper actually has to support the two halves of the luggage wobbling around- the liner is attached with velcro to the polycarbonate. You can unzip that final layer of liner to stash stuff, but the zippers on BOTH sides were missing the pull tabs. Seriously... why have a zipper without a pull tab? It's just inconvenient to deal with.BOTTOM LINE: this is a stylish bag, that's for sure. However, there are a number of small design 'quirks' that don't make a lot of sense to me. No side handles? A shiny finish that shows scuffs and fingerprints? Wheels that protrude a good half-inch more than they have to? No easily accessed / viewed mesh storage pocket for small items? No expansion? Stuff like this makes me question the Tumi brand -- you're paying for the NAME (baggage handlers target Tumi bags for rough handling, supposedly), and you're paying dearly. For eighty bucks I'd be more forgiving... but this bag retails for nearly FIVE HUNDRED. Five hundred! That's practically a surfboard, or a road bike. If I'm dropping that much on a bag I expect a little more efficiency and a little more practicality with the design. Two stars is a really harsh rating but I honestly can't knock the earlier reviewer who gave it that. I'm saying 3 stars because I'm a little more forgiving, but would give 2.5 if I could.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B0XBF7OMC5JO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCIQX38#wasThisHelpful","R1B0XBF7OMC5JO","AQM0K7MBBT4AY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQM0K7MBBT4AY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two roommates, and we're all engineers -- there can never be too many surge protectors / power strips in my house.This surge protector is very nice for its price point. The dark gray metal is sleek looking but also unobtrusive, and won't stick out like the white plastic ones do. The outlets are oriented so that large plugs will hang off the side, instead of blocking the neighboring outlets -- it's key for when you have a bunch of bulky adapter bricks plugged into the same strip. The last two outlets are actually spaced out further apart, specifically to make room for those adapter bricks.Each outlet has a sliding safety to block off the ports when it's not being used.Mounting brackets in the back are standard and will work with any flat-head screws -- I'm not mounting mine though as it's just sitting on the ground behind my desk.The 3' cord is pretty standard, nothing to write home about, but is ample for my needs. The power switch (and a red LED above it) light up to let you know when the strip is 'ON'.All in all, this is a very nice power strip.

"My dog, a 6 month old Newfoundland, is really enjoying this toy. I have numerous treat dispensers and give him about 1/3 of his food in them every day.

I expect it to get broken as he drops it on the tile floor, but in the mean time it is a big hit. The holes are very small and can't be adjusted.

"These are decent baking cups suitable for what used to be normal-sized muffins and cupcakes. It seems like the giant ones are more common now. These are quite a bit smaller, so check your pan size before using them. Most recipes make 12 normal cupcakes/muffins or 6 giant. If your pan is normal sized but your recipe makes the larger size, you can use these and cook for less time.  I find that spraying all liners, including these, with a non-stick spray (like Pam) really helps prevent the paper sticking to the food.

"I did a fair amount of research on flea and tick control for my dog. What I learned is that the normal stuff, like the regular Pet Armor or Frontgard kill ticks and also fleas that bite the dog. The ""plus"" also kill flea eggs. In areas where fleas aren't an issue, the regular is fine, but if you live in a flea area, the ""plus"" is the way to go.

"I have invested quite a lot in Sonos. I have 5 speakers (2 - 3's and 3 - 5's) plus the boost and connect. I love the way they can be connected or separate, but have never been that happy with the sound. I am a huge Bose fan and was thrilled to see they came out with something that competes with Sonos.My first impressions:It is slightly smaller than the Sonos Play 5. About 1"" narrower and shorter.The power cord is pretty short - about 5'. This is similar to Sonos'.  Prepare to use a extension cord (or power strip w/ surge protector).Set up was very easy. Well, it would have been easier if I had remembered my Pandora password, but it still only took a few minutes.The sound is much better than Sonos.It allows for 6 memories to be set. So, I can hit a button on the SoundTouch or my app and have it go right to a certain Pandora station (I just have to remember which station it is). The display on the app tells me what the presets are and the unit itself has a display showing the current song. Sonos has no display.It comes with a remote, which Sonos doesn't. The app also works as a remote, but this is great for guests who want to listen to music without having the app loaded or dealing with set-up.I had no trouble loading the app on my ipad mini, iphone 6, or MacBook. I have not tried it with android or Windows. Bose says: ""The app is compatible with Windows XP, 7, 8; 64-bit Macs running OSX 10.6.8 and later; any iPhone, iPad or iPod touch running iOS5 and later; Android devices running Android 3.0 and later.""This allows bluetooth streaming. Cool.According to the Bose site: ""You can stream music from an iPhone®, iPad® or iPod touch® to SoundTouch™ Wi-Fi music systems via AirPlay®. You cannot stream music stored on an Android™ phone or from apps on an Android phone.""There are some complaints on Bose's web site about trouble using it with AirPlay. From my Sonos use I expect to mainly us it with Pandora, but I tried connecting it with AirPlay.  I couldn't even find AirPlay on my iPhone 6, so I just used Bluetooth. I had no problem listening to anything (music and podcasts) using Bluetooth.You can only have one music library linked.I tried linking my computer's iTunes library after it was already linked to a NAS drive. It didn't work. Again, I found Bluetooth the easiest way to go.All in all I like this a lot better than Sonos. The big decider for me is that the sound is just a lot better. Bose quality. I will buy more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSZC7CRNII220/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH6E26#wasThisHelpful","RSZC7CRNII220","A3UKWQS8SRW6IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UKWQS8SRW6IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a large breed puppy and my vet recommends that I feed him glucosamine for his entire life. I had been using Myristin, which comes in really big tablets.

"This has some things I really like and some I don't.  First, the small size makes it easy to grab and use for taking notes at meetings. It has a fabric cover over the metal spiral, so I don't have to worry about it getting snagged on anything and a pen loop so I can grab it all on my way out the door and not have to dig for a pen later.The downsides: The expandable pocket really isn't very expandable.  It can hold about 1/4"" of stuff. The movable pocket divider has tabs that I don't think will make it past a couple of moves. I think I will cut them off. The biggest downside for me is that, because of the fabric spiral cover, it doesn't lie flat. When you open it and try fold the front cover to the back the fabric gets in the way. Even laying it flat, there is still a bump from the cover. This makes it hard to use.

"Sarah Manning and her clone-sisters find themselves caught in the crossfire between their very uneasy allies, the Dyad Institute, and a clandestine military experiment involving a batch of male clones. At the same time, Sarah is closing in on finding the origin of the cloning experiments, a mission that will take her far from home, to London and the deserts of Mexico.The third season of Orphan Black opens and expands the world revealed in the opening two seasons, a world where secret experiments in the 1980s have resulted in the creation of two batches of clones. Now adults, the clones are finding one another and trying to discover the reasons for their existence, and those answers are not happy ones.The first season of Orphan Black was unmitigated brilliance, a tour-de-force of acting ability as Tatiana Maslanay moved between playing multiple but very different characters with convincing ease. The second season stumbled a little by introducing too many new players, new characters and new factions. Sorting out the Proletheans from Dyad from mercenaries from military groups from Topside could be a little confusing at times.The third season opens with these elements very much still in play, now expanded with the introduction of a group of new clones played by Ari Millen. What feels like it could become a confusing morass is abruptly reversed by some very, very smart writing decisions. The number of factions and storylines is abruptly slimmed down, some relatively convincing retcons are used to keep the same characters in play without having to bring in too many new faces and, whenever things could get too out of control, the show reels the story back in and refocuses on the core triumvirate of Sarah, Cosima and Alison. Indeed, the show knocks it out of the park with an episode that focuses on Alison's attempts to get elected as school trustee and mixes up the clones pretending to be one another, old-school style. It's extremely unusual to see a series self-aware enough to realise it's running into a problem, and then decisively fix it with both verve and intelligence.There are a small number of new characters, most notably Ferdinand, an eccentric (but lethal) enforcer for topside played with relish by the always-brilliant James Frain, whilst British acting legend Alison Steadman joins the cast in the last couple of episodes in a pivotal role. Otherwise the focus remains on Tatiana Maslany's typically compelling multiple performances. This time around Ari Millen also has to play multiple characters and does a good job at it, even if the show backpedals a little from giving them the same time and variations that the female clones have.By the end of the third season, the show has done away with a number of long-running storylines and potential long-term threats, although the finale does open things up by hinting at new dangers. With two seasons remaining in the showrunners' plan, it will be interesting to see where the story goes from here.The third season of Orphan Black (*****) restores the show to the heights reached in the first season and is compelling viewing, not to mention being genuinely impressive in how it handles a few structural and writing issues that other shows would have simply let fester.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9F0YS1DXFH4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMDF01Y#wasThisHelpful","R9F0YS1DXFH4H","A1CQGAPQMN41LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CQGAPQMN41LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For centuries the nations of Nasheen and Chenja have fought a gruelling, deadlocked war. Millions on both sides have been killed by airbursts, poison gas and hostile swarms of insects. Now peace has come. Hundreds of thousands of young men and boys have returned home to the cities of Nasheen to find that their female rulers don't know what to do with them, but still expect them to obey. A movement for equality and representation is building, spearheaded by a mysterious figure. Retired bel dame Nyx is ""persuaded"" out of retirement to deal with the problem. Her mission will involve crossing a vast desert to unknown lands, a chance meeting with old friends and the final hope that she might find some peace at last.The Bel Dame Apocrypha series has done increasingly interesting and original things with each volume. Overall, the series is a curious mix of fantasy and science fiction, set so far in the future that technology and magic have become indistinguishable and a ""fallen"" race of humans, divided internally by religion and ideology, must make use of them to survive on a hostile, only partially-terraformed planet. The SF elements work because they are subtle and kept in the background, and overall the ""bugpunk"" theme is sold because the author commits to it, making her weird concepts convincing due to how the characters treat them as ordinary.God's War was an accomplished debut, benefiting from a razor-sharp sense of story but being a bit rough around the edges. Infidel was superior, a brutal (even traumatising) novel that was incredibly powerful but made you wonder if the author should be hauled before an international tribunal for the mistreatment of fictional characters. Rapture retreats a little from being that hardcore - although it's certainly not a happy novel - and instead shifts to being a more detailed and in-depth exploration of the world and history of Umayma and how it will develop going forwards.It's a remarkable book, driven by anger and fury and burning intelligence. A lengthy crossing of a hostile desert made me draw comparisons with Mad Max: Fury Road (although Rapture predates that film by three years), not for the plot but for its sense of purpose. We learn more about the world and what's going on in remote areas, but the book remains focused on the characters and how they relate to one another. The final collapse of relationships long tottering on the edge is sad, but also inevitable and then horribly liberating, in a way that's true to life.The book is mainly concerned with its own storyline, but finds time to wrap up long-standing plot threads from earlier volumes. Indeed, characters and arcs established in earlier volumes which felt a little disconnected from Nyx and her team are here tied into the main storyline with great skill. It's not a neat ending to the series - and there is at least one large dangling plot thread that potential sequels could pick up on - but it does bring about enough satisfying resolution to work if there is never another Bel Dame novel.If the novel does have some weaknesses it might be that some of the desert sequences in the middle do drag on a long time when the book's finale (which involves crossing the entire continent) is squeezed into a few too few pages, feeling rushed to the edges of incoherence. But the author just about manages to carry it off, producing an ending that's epic, spectacular and wonderfully messy.Rapture (****) is a readable, finely-characterised and highly imaginative novel, brimming with wit and attitude. It is available now in the UK and USA.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX64PRQ1Q3JRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1597804312#wasThisHelpful","RX64PRQ1Q3JRG","A1CQGAPQMN41LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CQGAPQMN41LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Elias rules as the High King of Osten Ard, but his policies have triggered war between the provinces and civil war within some of them. The continent is slipping into chaos and the only hope may be the mad king's younger brother, Josua Lackhand. Escaping a devastating siege, Josua travels eastwards to find a new stronghold, gathering allies as he goes. Meanwhile, it is said that only three great swords of legend can defeat the machinations of Elias's puppet-master, Ineluki the Storm King. Simon Snowlock has recovered Thorn from a remote mountain, but two of his friends have been sentenced to death by the Qanuc, his own erstwhile allies.Stone of Farewell continues the story begun in The Dragonbone Chair, and is less the sequel than the simple continuation of that story. Memory, Sorrow and Thorn is really one titanic, 1.2 million-word novel split into three (or four, depending on edition) for ease of publication.Williams expands and deepens the story in this book, with a more thorough exploration of the various cultures of Osten Ard. In particular, the Qanuc, Sithi and Norns all get more screentime and we learn more about the meadow-people of the Thrithings, the political and religious intrigue in Nabban and how the Hernystiri are surviving in exile.These elements are fascinating, but also come at the expense of critical plot development and incident. The Dragonbone Chair was itself a relaxed novel, but Stone of Farewell is even more chilled out. Simon spends a long time kicking back amongst first the Qanuc and later the Sithi, Josua's apparently desperate flight to safety has more of the feel of a holiday outing and Miriamele spends altogether too much time hanging out on a boat. It's more the stories inbetween that resonate, with Isgrimnur's increasingly fed-up journey into the south being enjoyable for its brevity and our glimpses into life in the Hayholt (effectively under occupation by Elias's troops) via characters like Rachel and the redoubtable Guthwulf.There are moments of real horror when the story kicks into a higher gear, such as Pyrates's confrontation with the Lector or the Red Hand's assault on Jao e-Tinukai'i, but these are relatively few and far between. Instead, the novel expands itself on helping the characters (particularly Simon and Miriamele) grow into more interesting people.Stone of Farewell (****) is well-written, richly characterised and features moments of real tension and horror. It arguably takes its hands off the throttle at the wrong moment, however, allowing momentum to dissipate a little rather than ramping up for the grand finale. But if you can forgive the slower pace, a fascinating, enjoyable and deeper fantasy novel than most awaits.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29O7IVISW3M71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0886774802#wasThisHelpful","R29O7IVISW3M71","A1CQGAPQMN41LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CQGAPQMN41LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prester John is the unchallenged High King of Osten Ard, the ruler of all the lands from the Nornfells to the southern deserts. He has ruled wisely and well - but not without bloodshed - for seven decades. Now his health is failing and his son Elias prepares to inherit the throne. Elias is strong and a canny general, but is also mistrusted for his close relationship with the sinister priest Pyrates. There is also a growing rift between Elias and his younger brother Josua Lackhand that threatens the peace.Simon, a simple kitchen boy in the High King's castle, the Hayholt, is drawn into events beyond his understanding. A cold winter is coming, things are stirring in the far north that have not been seen for centuries and the fate of the world will turn on three lost swords: Memory, Sorrow and Thorn.The Dragonbone Chair is the opening novel of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn, a massive trilogy written by American author Tad Williams. First published in 1988, the novel was an important milestone in the development of epic fantasy. Previous fantasy novels had been split between easy reading versions of Tolkien (Brooks, Eddings) or insanely dark reactions to it (Donaldson, Cook), but Williams's novel was arguably the first to really engage with Tolkien on the same kind of playing field. It's a huge book (over 900 pages in most paperback editions, and only the first part of the story) filled with a complex backstory, numerous ethnic cultures and different races, lots of made-up names and maps. Lots of maps. And an appendix, just to show you that this author means business.Of course, epic fantasy is a very different field in 2015 to what it was like in 1988, so does the novel hold up?The answer is a qualified yes. This is a big, epic story which Williams tells well, with some colourful prose, some solid characterisation and development and a bit more depth to the story than it just being another Tolkien clone. The (relatively few) action sequences are well-handled and there are some evocative descriptions, particularly of the vast Hayholt and its Green Angel Tower, as well as the forbidding Aldheorte forest. The characters are a fairly diverse and interesting bunch, although Simon himself, at this early stage, is a bit too much of a wet blanket with a tendency to pass out (either from injury or magically-induced visions) every time something important happens. His companions, particularly the ""troll"" Binabik, are altogether more compelling in this first novel.The book also constantly develops and restructures the stakes and the scope of the story as it goes on, bringing in more history, factions and people as it develops. This works in both the Tolkien-esque sense of starting small and branching out later on, and also in forcing a constant reappraisal of the world and the situation. It's telling to see how Prester John is viewed by his own people as a mostly just and benevolent ruler but people from other lands remember him as a conqueror.There are some structural issues. The book can switch POVs several times in a conversation, which is a bit bewildering for those readers used to the modern convention of staying with one POV for a whole chapter, or for POV switches to be marked by at least a paragraph break. This is also not exactly the fastest-paced novel in the world. Compared to Lord of the Rings, The Eye of the World or A Game of Thrones, The Dragonbone Chair (which is only marginally shorter than the latter two) drags its feet a little. Williams is a good enough writer to make lengthy travelogues or conversations between two minor characters hold the attention, but you do realise from time to time that not actually a lot has happened in the previous hundred pages. Finally, the POV structure can be a bit jarring: much of the first half of the book is shown from Simon's POV, but the latter half introduces a ton of other ones, including some who have an important role to play but we only get a few pages with them because so much time is being spent elsewhere.But these are both standard (for the genre) and forgivable problems, especially given that this was only the author's second novel. The Dragonbone Chair (****) may be slow to get off the mark and occasionally low-key given the scale of the events, but it's a well-written novel that is rather smarter than it first appears (this becomes more apparent in the sequels). It's well worth checking out ahead of the publication of the sequel series, The Last King of Osten Ard, due to start in 2017.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXJWL2S9WFEJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0886773849#wasThisHelpful","RXJWL2S9WFEJA","A1CQGAPQMN41LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CQGAPQMN41LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2036. Earth is under the control of the Observers, time-travelling, genetically-engineered and cybernetically-enhanced humans from a distant future in which the planet has become uninhabitable. During their previous observations of the Fringe team and their investigations, they have confirmed that it is possible to rewrite the timeline and create a new reality, so now they plan to create a new world for their benefit...but not for that of the humans who are already there.Frozen in amber for twenty-one years, the Fringe team awaken with one goal: to stop the Observers from fulfilling their mission. But with a vastly superior foe tracking them remorselessly, the team need every ally and every resource they can call upon in order to succeed.For its final season, Fringe changes things up a lot. What had once been a procedural, investigative drama about the paranormal and pseudoscience has become a full-on nightmare dystopia, throwing in some elements of post-apocalyptic drama for good measure. These thirteen episodes form a tightly serialised drama (the writers deciding the sops to the casual viewer are no longer necessary) taking in questions about what it means to be human and how far you will be prepared to go to save your existence.There are a few problems with the situation. First off, a fair bit of important stuff happens off-screen: four years pass between the end of Season 4 and the moment the Observers actually invade, including some important character development and also further developments involving William Bell. Bell's character arc simply disappears and we don't find out the fate of his character or what happened since the last time we saw him to explain his changed relationship with Walter and the rest of the team. Some hasty exposition from other characters doesn't really help. It's a problem that can be ignored for the most part, but the lack of resolution for this key character at a moment when pretty much everyone else gets wrapped up nicely feels a bit of an oversight.More of an issue is that the compressed storytelling and the near-omnipotence of the Observers results in what feels like plot holes. The ability of the Observers to foretell the future and how far they can do their teleporting trick shifts episode from episode based on the requirements of the plot. It's not quite as bad as the tricks some shows go to in order to nerf overpowered villains (the Borg, anyone?) but it again feels a little too inconsistent even given Fringe's elastic standards of plausibility.Fortunately, most of that can be ignored. The final season of Fringe is a bold, experimental one that throws out the standard format, changes dynamics all over the place and tries to be the biggest, most epic season on a reduced budget. Thanks to some excellent CGI (the paved-over Central Park is an impressive achievement), some very strong writing and some brilliant performances from the regulars and newcomers alike, the season is pretty gripping. By now it's gotten redundant to say that John Noble is fantastic in every scene he does (although a scene at the end of the first episode involving early 1980s electronica is particularly outstanding), but it's good to see Joshua Jackson stepping up to the mark. Jackson has pinballed between Plot Device and Exposition Giver for most of the previous four seasons (although always played gamely), but in Season 5 he gets a bit more material to play with and handles it well. Blair Brown also gets a terrific story arc as Nina this season, possibly by way of apology from the writers for giving her some pretty bad material in the Season 4 finale to work with. Georgina Haig also does some great work, stepping into the established cast as Henrietta.The biggest success of the season, though, is giving a definite sense of closure to the series. Coming from some of the same creators as Lost and being heavily influenced by The X-Files, the fear was that Fringe would, like those shows, have a muddled and unsatisfactory resolution to a long-running and confusing story arc. It doesn't. Instead Fringe nails the landing more than satisfactorily, giving a good sense of closure as well as explaining most (but not all) of the show's long-running mysteries.The final season of Fringe (****) concludes the series with style, giving a satisfying resolution to the show, its mysteries and, most importantly, to the characters. Fringe, tragically, is one of the more obscure SFF shows of recent years which is a shame, as it is also one of the best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8O4DU54B0IYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B5AP7PC#wasThisHelpful","R8O4DU54B0IYL","A1CQGAPQMN41LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CQGAPQMN41LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Fringe team has saved two parallel universes from destruction but have paid a heavy price they are no longer even aware of. Peter Bishop, who as a young boy was saved from death, irrevocably altering the timeline, has been removed from existence. His Fringe team-mates have no memory of his existence and his removal has led to numerous changes, such as the continued existence of a very old enemy. But - somehow - Peter returns to find a world which he is no longer part of. Can he find a way ""home""?Fringe's penultimate season starts off in a difficult place. The timeline of both universes has been reset and although things are broadly similar, a whole host of details have changed. These include Olivia and her sister being raised by Nina Sharp and Walter, never having been brought out of his shell by Peter, still being a crazy recluse. It is fascinating to map these changes, and the way the writers cleverly use them to resurrect previously-slain foes and revisit past plot points, but it does cause some problems with the viewer not being sure how much to invest in this new universe. Is Fringe going to hit the reset button at some point and revert things back to the way they used to be?If you can get over that issue, there is much to enjoy with this season. The notion that parallel universes can exist but time can also be rewritten within those universes is one that hard SF has played around with a few times, but this is the first time that an SF TV series has treated the concept with some seriousness and not gotten bogged down in technobabble. The timeline reset also allows the writers to drop a few storylines they developed earlier on which clearly they didn't know how to follow up on (particularly Fauxlivia's pregnancy). However, a late-season development allows them to revisit some of these plot threads and give them a more elegant form of closure.Once the season sorts itself out, there is much fun to be had from having our characters (in both universes) pitted against a returning old enemy (who later turns out to be a front for another returning antagonist) who is a step ahead of them at every turn. The season does a good job of balancing out its share of characters, with Peter dominating mid-season but Seth Gabel's Lincoln Lee rising to the fore later on. Lincoln has always been an interesting character, but his early placement this season as Peter's effective replacement feels a little off. That said, the writers use the oddness of his position to inform the storyline and eventually his character achieves a destiny that is fitting.A key subplot through the season revolves around the ongoing mystery of the Observers. Some fans thought we wouldn't get much, or any, explanation for these mysterious beings and their objectives, so it's a huge shock when we do get a detailed explanation for their origins and their ultimate goals. These ramp up in the nineteenth episode, Letters of Transit, which fast-forwards to the year 2036 and a nightmarish, dystopian possible future that awaits our heroes. Given that Fringe was going to be cancelled after the fourth season (the ratings were utterly diabolical) and was saved almost solely by the goodwill of fans at the network, this was an incredibly bold decision that could have left the series on a massive downer. As it stands, Fringe was reprieved at the last minute and given a final season to wrap up its storylines.Unfortunately, Season 4 does run out of steam a little before its end. There's some wheel-spinning episodes and even Fringe's generously elastic notions of plausibility take a serious beating with some plot developments. The actual season finale is also extremely weak, with some bitty plotting and Blair Brown being given some hideous exposition to relate to the other characters (the writers seemingly later apologised by giving her an incredibly poignant and well-played storyline in the final season).The fourth season of Fringe (****) is probably the show's weakest, although it's still eminently watchable, highly entertaining and, as usual, excellently played by a tight, capable cast.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPL8H6C6GIJTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053O8A50#wasThisHelpful","RPL8H6C6GIJTV","A1CQGAPQMN41LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CQGAPQMN41LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two years have passed since the ferocious battle for Hinzerhaus Fortress on Jago. The Tanith First and Only won a famous victory, but only at a horrendous cost in lives. Battered and bleeding, the Tanith First finally won a respite, being rotated back to sector HQ on Balhaut for a well-earned rest after ten years on the front lines.However, two years of inaction has led to problems with discipline, training and morale. In the midst of these problems, Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt is summoned to a clandestine meeting. An agent of the archenemy has been taken prisoner and wants to give up valuable intelligence...but the Blood Pact have been sent to silence him by any means necessary.Blood Pact is the twelfth novel in the Gaunt's Ghosts series and marks the beginning of the fourth distinct story arc in the series, ""The Victory"". The opening of the book feels like Dan Abnett is taking a deep breath after the mayhem of the previous novels, which featured some of the bloodiest and most frenzied battles in the series to date, but it's not too long before the action kicks in again. Blood Pact is a short novel taking place over one single night and morning of carnage as the Blood Pact - the Ghosts' sworn rivals - arrive to carry out a suicide assassination task, succeed in splitting up the Ghosts and also take advantage of internal divisions as the Ghosts find themselves still under suspicion from the Inquisition about their mission to the Chaos-tainted world of Gereon years earlier.As usual with a Gaunt's Ghosts novel, the pace is blistering, the action is superbly-handled and the characterisation shines. Gaunt's return to the world where he lost his former command but gained a new one adds new shades to his character. Background Ghosts nicely come to the fore, such as Maggs, whilst we touch base with a few key Ghosts who've been lower in profile in the preceding books. However, Blood Pact does feel like a lesser entry in the series. Perhaps it's due to the increasing frequency between novels (Blood Pact was released in 2009 and one more book, Salvation's Reach, in 2011 with nothing since), but Blood Pact feels a little like too much set-up at a moment in the series when it feels like it should be perhaps more decisively moving towards a conclusion. This can be seen in the fact that while a few key characters get a lot of time in the sun, numerous other Ghosts (including many who played key roles in the preceding few books) suddenly drop into the background. If Gaunt's Ghosts was a TV series (and we can but hope), this is the relatively low-key opening to a new season which is reacquainting you with all the characters before the big storylines kick in.On that basis, Blood Pact (***½) does a good job of setting up its immediate sequel, Salvation Reach, and tells a rollicking good action story. Not one of the best books in the series, but still an effortlessly enjoyable slice of military SF from the best author in the subgenre. If you want to read the book, Blood Pact is currently only available as an ebook from the Black Library direct. However, the entire series is being rolled out in new editions, so it should be back in paperback in a few months.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCKEQNYT2ENJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1844166929#wasThisHelpful","RCKEQNYT2ENJQ","A1CQGAPQMN41LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CQGAPQMN41LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unfortunately, events are complicated by the complicated love life of Miles's clone-brother Mark, two landmark legal disputes in the Barrayaran Court...and a whole ton of butter-producing bugs.A Civil Campaign (subtitled A Comedy of Biology and Manners) was originally conceived by Lois McMaster Bujold as the second half of Komarr. However, she separated the two books out for reasons of length (A Civil Campaign is the longest novel in the series by itself) and also for tone. Komarr is a serious book but A Civil Campaign is a romantic comedy that at times descends into flat-out farce.It's hard enough to carry off romance or comedy or science fiction by themselves, so for Bujold to tackle all three genres in the same novel suggests either cast-iron confidence or outright insanity. After completing the book, the key to its success seems to be a bit of both. A Civil Campaign is flat-out crazy, a dramatic change in tone from the rest of the series to date. For starters, the novel has five POV characters, which is unusual given that most books in the series have just one, Miles himself. This novel adds Mark, Ivan, Kareen Koudelka (Mark's own romantic interest) and Ekaterin to the mix. This makes for a busier and more tonally varied novel than any of the preceding ones. Even more interesting is how Bujold mixes up the POV storylines: the normally frivolous Ivan gets the serious, political stuff to deal with whilst the emotionally-scarred, PTSD-suffering Mark gets the farcical butter-bug storyline to handle. Expectations are subverted throughout with great skill.Most intriguingly, this is a novel about adults, relationships and how damaged people can help (or hurt, if they are not careful) one another or choose their own paths through life. Through comedy, tragedy, horror and humour, Bujold builds up each of her POV characters (and numerous supporting ones) and deconstructs them in a manner that is impressive and enjoyable to read.That said, a key subplot revolves around a disputed succession between a dead lord's daughter and nephew, with Barrayar's laws of male inheritance favouring his nephew...until his daughter gets a sex-change. The resulting legal maelstrom is the result of a collision between fantasy cliche and common sense (and Barrayar has always felt it had more in common with Westeros than an SF setting) and signals an impending transformation in the planet's social order. It's also - arguably - the novel's sole misstep, with Bujold uncharacteristically more interested in the legal and political ramifications rather than the character-based ones. That isn't to say that Donna/Dono isn't a fascinating character, but it feels like Bujold did not engage with the issues raised by the gender reassignment with as much as depth as she might have done.There is some action in the book (a single shoot-out, which feels a bit incongruous given the tone of the novel, and a more farcical, Bugsy Malone-esque battle sequence involving tubs of bug-butter) but primarily A Civil Campaign (****½) is a comedy of manners, a grown-up romance and a great big coming-together of almost every major subplot and character in The Vorkosigan Saga to date. It's a terrific read and is available now as part of the Miles in Love omnibus (UK, USA).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GRAZUDC18ZDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671578855#wasThisHelpful","R2GRAZUDC18ZDW","A1CQGAPQMN41LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CQGAPQMN41LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Father Yarvi has brokered an unlikely peace between the formerly warring kingdoms of Gettland and Vansterland, bringing them together to stand against the forces of the High King. Still tremendously outnumbered, Yarvi is forced to rely on an untested young queen to help lead the way to victory and a last stand at the fortress of Bail's Point.Half a War concludes the Shattered Sea trilogy by Joe Abercrombie, an experiment by the British author to write shorter novels aimed at a more general audience. How successful that experiment has been is quite debatable - the tone and feeling of the trilogy is really not far removed from his First Law universe novels - but it's certainly resulted in the impressive delivering of three very decent novels in less than eighteen months.As with the previous book, Half a War revolves around three main POV characters: Skara, the young and untested queen of Throvenland; Raith, the bloodthirsty Vansterland warrior made into Skara's reluctant bodyguard; and Koll, the woodcarver turned minister-in-training who finds himself increasingly serving as Yarvi's conscience as Yarvi is forced into more and more desperate acts to try to save his people. Previous POV characters become secondary characters in this novel, which is both clever (showing how others see them) and frustrating, particularly when they don't all survive.This is a war story, with the great fortress of Bail's Point changing hands as the fortunes of the conflict ebb and flow. Abercrombie has done big war stories and battle narratives before and does a good job of depicting the conflict here, helped by a map of Bail's Point. However, the limited POV structure means that a great deal of the details of the conflict are missing. This is effective in giving us a feel of the fog of war, with confusion and misinformation lurking everywhere, but it does occasionally make the conflict feel murkier than it should.Abercrombie's razor-sharp characterisation is on top form here, with Skara developing believably into a ruler from humble beginnings and secondary characters like Blue Jenner and King Uthil getting outstanding and memorable moments. However, it's Father Yarvi who develops most fascinatingly in this novel. Yarvi's ruthlessness was on display in the second book, but in this one it pushes him into more and more dangerous decisions that even shock his allies. The development of Koll as his moral weathervane is nicely done; without Koll, it may be that Yarvi would have become another version of Bayaz from the First Law books (i.e. Unrepentant Amoral Bastard Gandalf). As it stands he comes pretty damn close, and it's likely any future Shattered Sea books will have to deal with the fallout from his actions.Half a War (****) closes the Shattered Sea trilogy in style, with a war story that prioritises the characters over the action and ends well by not pulling a single punch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZF4E0IPRXQIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178453#wasThisHelpful","R1ZF4E0IPRXQIN","A1CQGAPQMN41LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CQGAPQMN41LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Laia is a Scholar, a member of the underclass subjugated by the Martial Empire in the city of Sarra. When her brother is abducted by the Martials and her grandparents murdered, Laia is reluctantly forced to ally herself with the Resistance. In return for their help in finding and rescuing her brother, Laia has to infiltrate Blackcliff Academy, where the Empire's most elite soldiers are trained.At the same time, Elias is a Mask-in-training at Blackcliff. Sickened by the Empire's callousness, he contemplates running away but is instead compelled to remain when he is prophesied to become the next Emperor and could lead the Empire into a new golden age. However, first he must pass the Trials and win the crown for himself...and must defeat his best friend in the process.An Ember in the Ashes made a bit of a stir when it was acquired by Penguin last year, winning a large advance and resulting in the film rights being sold for seven figures before it even hit the shelves. The novel also piqued my interest because it was apparently a stand-alone, with more books in the same world possible but apparently not necessary.Well, that, it turns out, was not true. An Ember in the Ashes is the first volume of a multi-part story and ends on a series of cliffhangers, so those looking for a stand-alone book are directed elsewhere. The book also feels a bit overly familiar at times: the Trials that define Elias's storyline are more than a little reminiscent of The Hunger Games while the brutal regime brought down through a reluctant female double agent reminded me more than a bit of the Mistborn trilogy. Tahir mixes up the standard tropes enough that the book never feels like a rip-off, most notably by taking the standard YA central romance and turning it into more of a tragic story of betrayal and the promise of later all-out vengeance, which is at least something a bit different.Elsewhere the book attempts a few interesting things: the novel is written in the present tense, which normally would have me hurling it out the window. However, Tahir's prose is good enough to overcome this stylistic quirk (one which a lot of readers don't have). The prose is readable but occasionally feels a bit more flavoured and distinct than the norm before settling back into something more generic. If Tahir could hold the quality of the prose at her best for longer, the sequels could be a lot better. The setting, which is more inspired by Rome than most medieval fantasy settings, also holds some promise.The most disappointing thing about An Ember in the Ashes is how standard it is. It's reasonably well-written, the setting is interesting and the characters enjoyable enough to hold the reader's attention, but the book doesn't really bring anything new to the table. It's a solid story told in a solid way which is good but not outstanding. The story and setting are a little more brutal than is normal in a YA novel, including the frown-inducing appearance of almost-rape for no apparent reason, but it's not exactly going all A Song of Ice and Fire. Some of the ideas are also rather implausible: the training for the Masks is so insanely brutal that it's likely that the Masks simply wouldn't exist due to the rate of attrition among applicants.That said, An Ember in the Ashes (***½) does hold enough promise to warrant a second look when the sequel appears.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32JRY69Y2J0B1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595148035#wasThisHelpful","R32JRY69Y2J0B1","A1CQGAPQMN41LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CQGAPQMN41LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Evelyn Marrington had the life she lived with her loud and over the top family who wanted nothing more than to see her married and settled in a husband’s home.  But the existence Evie wanted was independence to be a writer of adventure novels that spoke of places she had not seen and experiences she prayed she could have.  So when her cousin brought Bennett Haile, the Earl of Somersby a member of England’s elite security agency to Evie’s home to offer up a mission she saw a way out and gave no thought to the danger she could be walking in to both physically or emotionally with Bennett.In her heart Evie knows that temporarily standing in for the Queen is a tad mis-guided as she may look like her majesty but act is another part indeed she does not possess.  Bennett believes Evie capable and will train her but the distraction of having her beauty so close and her fiery temperament stir him up is becoming an issue every moment they are together.  Always thinking he would never love again after his disastrous break up, especially to a woman with such a pushy demeanor surprises Bennett in every positive way.  But should he act on these feelings or push them aside as he is wont to do.When the adventurous mission turns dangerous Evie steps up to the challenge and will not allow anyone, especially Bennett to take her home and continue in a sheltered life.  Evie continues to amaze everyone with her ability to pick herself up and move on to the next part of this assignment all the while trying to control the burning desire that she feels for Bennett.  She knows the time with him is more dangerous than any assassin but whatever stolen moments she can have wrapped in his arms, lips locked in a loving kiss, and bodies entangled in unreserved love is worth the hurt that will come in the near future.Every book Robyn DeHart writes is an experience readers delight in from page one and UNDERCOVER WITH THE EARL is another such success.  Ms. DeHart weaves a story so amazing that you feel yourself standing in the room experiencing the adventure, watching love blossom, and ready to join whatever chaos ensues.  Thank you is never enough of a phrase to say to Robyn for writing such great works of art.My favorite line….[she] could close her eyes and imagine the sound of the paper turning, the bold print of the words beckoning her into their adventure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MK1L8J5EMZOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105VZKPI#wasThisHelpful","R2MK1L8J5EMZOZ","A1RZ3Y7ZT95KW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZ3Y7ZT95KW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lorie Kauffmann felt she lost everything when her father died and was shocked to find her strict Amish father died in a car accident when the Amish did not own cars.  This turn of events rocked everything she believed in and made her want to know who her father really was and where he came from.  Lorie had a good life with her step mother and blended family but something was not right about the past her father kept hidden and the present life he led in secret that violated so many of their religious beliefs.As Lorie started her deep dive into the father she thought she knew it brought up a life prior to his becoming Amish in an English world with relatives and discoveries she could never have imagined.  While her father’s family was interesting the discovery of a grandmother was mind boggling and something in Lorie made he keep pushing past the point where she knew she should stop.The wonder of everything in the English world is mesmerizing to her including Zach Calhoun the man who is introducing her to all the life she could never have touched without pushing outside of her Amish life.  The other magic that was created with all the stress of her discoveries was the wonderful art work Lorie created from her deepest internal passions.  Lorie felt trapped in her Amish world and drawn to the English one where she could have Zach and the ability to create works of art.  What would she do with all this intense push and pull because Lorie knows she cannot be in both worlds and choosing one over the other seems an impossibility.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26K7LYLEY1GCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1420134574#wasThisHelpful","R26K7LYLEY1GCS","A1RZ3Y7ZT95KW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RZ3Y7ZT95KW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is well and carefully written.The content itself was exactly what it was told to be - a dictionary that gives quality ideas of what your dreams could mean from A to Z.

"I was delighted when I saw that Mike Riley had published a new book. and I am happy to say that this is another Mike Riley's book that I enjoyed reading. This one goes beyond the typical serial killers and presents 5 cases of couples/partners in crime committing terrible crimes. Each case is well detailed and we get the whole picture including the timeline of the murders and crimes committed, the backstory, the detailed accounts of the crimes, the investigation, the trial and the current status. I like the way Riley presents each case, it makes it clear to imagine exactly what happened and how these horrific events took place. The best is that these 5 cases are very different from one another, making it seems like you are reading 5 different books at the same time. The Bonnie and Clyde story gave a reality check to the ""romantic"" vision I had of those two partners in crime. The other 4 cases, I had not heard about and was fascinated by the spy story of the Rosenberg and the unthinkable actions of Fred and Rose West. How could they have gotten away with decades of crimes and murders without being uncovered is beyond belief. The viscious nature of the human being is revealed in the case of Baguss and Lahane, how can someone be so hateful and enjoy torturing another human being is beyond words. Great choices of cases to read.If you like true crime and enjoy reading about extreme cases, you will enjoy this new book from Mike Riley. The book is wel written and researched.  Highly recommended. I look forward reading more books from this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T5DRH1061XDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CT11CS#wasThisHelpful","R2T5DRH1061XDV","A3AL49CFO2EHZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AL49CFO2EHZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an interesting reading. I knew nothing about self-myofascial release techniques to manage muscular pain. The author does a good job describing what the technique is. You have it for shoulder pain, hip pain, buttock pain, and general massage. There is also a section about other variation of myofascial release and for other muscle groups. There is also a list of pros and cons of self-healing myofascial release as well as tips. If you have pain, this an interesting reading. It’s short and to the point.

I was able to follow on my computer at the same time I was reading the book which made it more visual.

"As a huge fan of the Blue Plague series I was certainly looking forward to the next book in that series.  Instead, I see Mr. Watson has decided to once again expand into a new genre and try his hand at fantasy.  Well, he definitely scored on this one.The story started off a little slow as the author set up the cast of characters and I was pleasantly pleased with Mr. Watson's world building efforts.  Though we see a world with some resemblance to the Tolkien stories, this is way different and is not by any stretch a ""Lord of the Rings"" tale here.  These characters are written as living, dynamic personalities, with their own strengths and weaknesses.  The good guys are heroic but also capable of being casual, funny, petty and spiteful, just like real people.  Mr. Watson is also a past master at creating believable supporting characters and his work in this book is no exception.  More Michi!  Just saying.The fight scenes are fast paced and filled with crazy action as weapons of both steel and magic get equal use here.  This is a book where you get to the end and realize, oh no, now I've got to wait months for the next installment!  If you enjoy Mr. Watson's quirky sense of humor and like hard edged, well written action with a heart, then this one is will hit the spot.

This little story is like a mission statement for more books hopefully to come.  Plus, I gotta give a loud hoot of enjoyment for the ""Smith scene"" at the beginning of the story.  I could actually see folks jaded by the conflict, even good people, doing just that with a dumba$$ that won't listen.  Fans of the first book and the continuing series will enjoy.  Well, except complain that it is too short, but then we want all our favorite authors to write 400+ pages of fun.

It was already formatted out of the package and has about 59GB of free space on it.Write Speed: On my Windows 10 laptop it copied a 750MB file in about 10 seconds and averaged about 48MB per second.Read Speed: When copying from the card back to my hard drive it averaged over 100MB per second and sometimes as high as 750MB per second when filing the temporary memory (I assume).Overall, it is a Class 10 card that performs as expected.

"If you are a caramel lover, these Lancaster caramels will have you eating dozens in no time. They are very good, truly soft and will honestly melt in your mouth.

"First, this watch is absolutely beautiful. It does have a fairly big watch face so if you are not into those, you may want a different model. The photo on Amazon showing the watch face on the wrist is quite accurate. This must be a newer model because the original instructions don't show how to set all the options on this watch (the new options on this watch are the date and 2nd time feature). However they have included a 1 page instruction sheet specifically for this model. Even with that, it may take yo a few minutes to figure out how to get all 3 set correctly. The watch comes in a fancy looking box so if you are buying this for a gift, it can easily be presented in the box it comes in. It truly does look like a watch that should cost over $500 if that kind of thing is important to you. It is water resistant so no worries about washing hands with this watch, but don't go swimming with it or have it on in the shower!

If you find that you don't like the weight or other aspects of this case for daily carrying, it is still a good investment to protect your phone when you go out running, hiking, or anything else that might be a ""danger"" to your phone. While it may seem expensive, with the price of smartphones these days, it is good insurance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R196R1T7F9USIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5G9I8G#wasThisHelpful","R196R1T7F9USIV","A1143YEAZYMYHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1143YEAZYMYHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have anyone in your family with heart disease, you will be interested in this book. The history of cardiovascular surgery is absolutely stunning in regards to the flat out ""trial and error"" without any oversight era. It may sound hard to believe and gruesome today, but in those days doctors and hospitals didn't need FDA approval to try something new. This was probably a good thing at the time as now it takes a long time to actually get permission to try something ""crazy"" that could potentially save many lives. Forrester covers a lot of the history of heart surgery. The chapters on war time surgery were very interesting as doctors were put in an almost impossible situation and forced to do whatever they could. Some of the names in the book you will recognize if you have read any other books on the same subject. It is a truly fascinated read and some of the characters were quite colorful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R390PMCQH55NUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250058392#wasThisHelpful","R390PMCQH55NUL","A1143YEAZYMYHJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1143YEAZYMYHJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always loved Otterbox for the protection they give. This series is lacking screen protection of any kind, and while the back and side protection is what I expect from Otterbox, I think the price is too high when compared to other products. They should have thrown in some type of a screen protector at this price, even if it was a minimal one.

"I think I must have a big head because whenever I buy headbands, they always feel really tight to me.  That was the very first thing I noticed about these headbands - they are not tight at all! Don't get me wrong - it isn't because they were too big.  They are just a really nice stretchy material - but not an elastic ""tight"" stretchy if you know what I mean.  The material itself is extremely nice.  They are super soft - and are very light so if you use these while working out, running, walking, whatever it might be, they still breathe and don't cause your head to get all sweaty.There are so many different uses for these as well.  My husband and I recently splurged and bought a pair of 4 wheelers.  Needless to say I am quickly learning about dirt and dust in the face.  These double as a really nice face guard as well. Again, the material is thin enough to still be able to comfortably breathe through - but keeps all that dirt and dust out of my mouth and nose.  that being said - the fact that I could put them on my face - I did not have a bad chemical smell with mine when they arrived.  I did wash them right away just because I tend to do that with new clothes or anything that I am going to have touching my face - but they didn't need it due to smell.

"This scarf is absolutely adorable.  It was even more cute when it arrived than I expected it to be! A lot of the scarves I own are rather thick and not really something you can wear in the summer.  This has a rather thin, almost sheer quality to it which is really nice.  It is really light and not bulky at all. I couldn't get over how soft it was either.  The material really is nice and not itchy like many other scarves I own.The infinity loop style is one of my favorites. There are so many different ways you can wear them and use them.  It makes this scarf really versatile!  I had a really hard time deciding on a color and may need to come back and re-order because I am still struggling with it.

"I don't know if maybe I am just not built for something like this or what - but it doesn't exactly look the best on me.  However, that doesn't really mean it is the maker's fault - just not really my cup of tea I guess. I ordered this in the coffee/wheat color.  The colors themselves are very pretty.  It does seem to be made from a really durable material even though it is see through. I have dogs and cats (the cats especially love trying to chase after me when I have this thing on) I have had plenty of sheer things in the past be ruined because of the dogs or the cats, but this is holding up well even around them.  It is really nice to have to wear around the yard in the summer when laying outside relaxing, or even when going to the beach as a coverup.One of the other reviewers is absolutely right - it is just material with a hole in the middle. That being said - look at all the different options that brings.  This can easily be worn as a scarf as well - it doesn't just have to be a coverup - which is most likely what I will use this for in the long run.

"I was pretty darn excited to receive this Quadcopter.  My husband and I have wanted to get a drone for a long while - but honestly we didn't NEED one which is why we never put our money into one.  Of course everyone is going to want the biggest and best, but these bad boys can get pretty pricey.  It was nice of one to come along in a very do-able price range.  Definitely a great one for the beginner!It is extremely easy to operate. I was too excited about this to even bother reading the directions before taking it out.  I know it's is a totally different ballgame - but we have had RC helicopters in the past and those things were not only pricey, but hard to operate. I really did question whether or not I would be able to control this and operate it.  I had nothing to worry about.  From the very first use, it is extremely user friendly and pretty much self explanatory in how to run!We have a large, open back yard with a hay field behind it so I didn't have to worry about maneuvering around trees or anything like that.  Once the batteries start to drain down, it slowly becomes less and less responsive, so there were a few crashes.  However, it is built really well and was able to withstand those crashes.My only complaint - THE BATTERY LIFE. It sucks.  Let's just be honest. that is the only thing holding me back from the 5 stars.  I will definitely be looking into getting some additional batteries for this.  I didn't actually time it - and I know this listing says it lasts for 7-9 minutes - but it seemed shorter to me than that.  I would have guessed 5 minutes - maybe. BUT - you get what you pay for too. For the price range this is in - it is definitely better than I expected it to be!

There is plenty of information in this book on both the Model T and the Ford corporation in general.This book really has everything from the humble beginnings of the automobile to where they may be going in the future.

I am interested in pretty much anything having to do with space - and with so much action on Mars lately, I think this book came along at just the right time for me!This book may be small - but it is full of SO much information on Mars.  Everything is in here from what the planet's atmosphere is like, to what a person might expect to encounter being on the planet without a space suit, to the concept of building a colony on Mars.  It even discusses the possibilities that farming on Mars could bring.  How cool is that?

Insane!I love that this book really spells out all of the history of how the interest in a mission to Mars came about.

"Being that I had never worked with vinyl before, I was a little bit nervous about trying this for the first time.  Honestly - I really had no reason to be. This vinyl is a great quality vinyl that is extremely easy to work with! While I think the majority if people would be looking at this for their car, I decided that it would be great for my ATV to break up some of the overwhelming blue color.When it arrived, it was packaged nicely and each sheet was wrapped with a clear plastic to keep it wrinkle free during transport.  Prepping the surface is pretty simple to do.  Make sure you clean the surface down really well as that contributes to how the vinyl adheres to the surface.  If you leave dirt or wax behind, this vinyl will not stick nearly as good as with a clean, dry surface. surface prep is definitely one of the most important steps in my opinion.  Also - USE A HEAT GUN.  Don't waste your time with a hair dryer.  buy a good quality heat gun with different temperature settings.  This vinyl responds well to heat, but I don't think a blow dryer would be enough heat. Most often I used the higher of the 2 settings on my heat gun when applying.  The vinyl responded well without burning holes in the vinyl or stretching it too thin.I originally wanted to wrap the entire surface but quickly learned that the curves and edges are pretty tricky.  Perhaps for someone who has more experience with vinyl it would be possible, but it was way out of my abilities being this was a first time use.  I decided to do it in pieces rather one full wrap. Working in the smaller sections was much easier to do! Overall I think I like the look the way I did it over a full wrap.  A car, of course, I would want the full wrap.Once the surface was clean and I had the vinyl cut to the general shape I wanted it, it was time to apply the vinyl.  There is a paper backing on the vinyl.  Tear that off, and for me I found it easiest to start from the middle and work my way out.  Make sure you are working in the proper environment too, away from dust and debris and the right temperature.  If it is too cold, this isn't going to stick as well.  While working my way outward I would heat the vinyl with the heat gun, stretch the material, and use my hand as well as a squeegee to work out any air bubbles and make sure the vinyl sticks firmly to the surface.  If there happened to be a difficult spot or a mistake, it was very easy to pull the vinyl back up, reheat it and re-stretch it, placing it back where I wanted it to be.  I would then come back to trim and cut out the more detailed shape that I wanted once I had the vinyl stuck down where I wanted it. There was absolutely no damage to the surface underneath, and even though it was applied to a plastic ATV body, I would be 100% confident applying it to the surface of a car and not worry about doing damage to the existing paint.I think having this vinyl applied to an ATV really tests the quality.  It is constantly being beat on by rocks and dust, water, and mud.  I have had no chipping or peeling whatsoever.  I don't have to do anything different to clean the surface with this vinyl wrap on it - I simply use soap and water to wash it.  It is holding up really well through everything I have put it through so far. It really is quite impressive! I would highly recommend this for any projects you may be working on.  I could see this being great for covering laptops, cars, video game consoles, pretty much anything your mind can think up!!  I absolutely LOVE it and would HIGHLY recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBK36NYWWNUZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJW98YC#wasThisHelpful","RBK36NYWWNUZE","A1G1U0K2W8HA61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G1U0K2W8HA61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Fill them with some water, let them sit for a little bit and you have adorable little Lego men or brick ice cubes!  What a fun idea for a child's birthday party!

The ice popped out super easy!I also have done candies and crayons with these, and so far they have worked great!

"This has quickly become my go to ""toy"".  Let's be honest - most women will use it as a vibrator at one point in time or another.  For that - it works freakin' AWESOME!! The 10 different settings really do give you a lot of options depending  on your mood at the time of use. The vibration options range from light to very intense - and holy cow is it ever intense at the highest setting. I love it.I was expecting it to be smaller.  It isn't a bad thing - just bigger than I expected it to be.  It took me a bit to get used to that because it is just - well - big.  That being said - this is the toy that stays in my nightstand drawer right next to my bed.As far as use for tense muscles - it works great for those too. It isn't just a toy.  I have definitely used this on my tense shoulder muscles after a long day at work.  I guess that would be where the power  and size comes in with this - it is powerful enough to even work the tense muscles back to being relaxed.Really great product and I would DEFINITELY recommend.

"I don't know why - but I have a thing for the glass toys.  I think they are pretty! Yeah, yeah - I'm a girl. I like pretty things.  Anyway - I really like this little guy! One of the perks of the glass toys is how easy they are to clean and disinfect.  I feel they are a lot more sanitary than their silicone or plastic counterparts.  They can be heated or cooled depending on what you are into - as well as be used as an anal toy if that is what you are into.  The thought of glass might scare some away - but honestly they are not fragile at all.  That being said - you should keep an eye on it for chips or cracks just incase.  I have dropped mine a few times and it held up nicely, so they definitely are strong and not fragile at all.Overall - pretty great toy! Honestly for the price point - it is one of the best.

"One of the better toys I have tried - which kind of says a lot.  I have a lot of them. *blush*Anyway - the style is very realistic.  The size is nice , and the varying speeds for the vibrations definitely adds to the pleasure from it.You can have it as low or as intense as you prefer.It is very easy to clean and store - something that can easily fit in the nightstand next to your bed.I also like the material.  While it is a silicone type material - it isn't a sticky silicone.  If you have spent any time around toys I think you will know what I mean by sticky.

"It was a bit bigger than I was expecting it to be - not necessarily a bad thing since more often than not the reverse is true.  It seems to be well made - there was no overpowering odor to it which I find with a lot of silicone made toys.  The different speeds are a nice addition - and on the highest setting is definitely very powerful.Very easy to clean up afterwards.  One of the downfalls for me is the fact that it is the material it is - because it likes to collect every little hair or piece of fuzz.  I have two dogs and two cats so I definitely need to clean this before use!

"I actually really like this waist trimmer belt.  I have been using it during my workouts, and it really helps to support my back while working out, or even just in going about everyday activities while wearing. It helps to improve my posture as well as working at losing some of that stubborn extra weight.The design is great. It is soft on the skin, and fits really well! It is definitely adjustable for all kinds of body shapes and sizes.  I am fairly small, while my husband is more husky - and we can both use this. It is well made with strong stitching so you don't have to worry about it falling apart with heavy use. It will definitely hold up for a long, long time.Overall, really good product!

"We have two dogs - a sheltie and a cairn terrier.  The cairn is a barking machine! Every little noise she hears or THINKS she hears, she goes nuts.  We have had her for 5 years now and I have yet to find anything to help calm her down and stop the barking. So when I was able to get this dog training collar to review, I was willing to try it!It is well made and strong. I could see how this would work great even on big dogs with how strong the collar itself is.  There are different sized electrodes for use with different types of animals.  My sheltie would require a longer one to work through all that hair, where the cairn can use the smaller ones.  You can change the strength of the ""shock"" as well. I would recommend starting out with the smallest strength and working up from there.  There really isn't any pain with it, more of a surprise to the dog to let them know HEY, this behavior isn't ok.  I put hand on them just to see how it felt for myself - it isn't more than a little tiny buzz.If you haven't had any success with other training options for whatever behavior you want to train your dog not to do, I would definitely recommend giving this a shot!Sample provided at a discount for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SRPF8EFIUK4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIB2ILM#wasThisHelpful","R2SRPF8EFIUK4F","A1G1U0K2W8HA61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G1U0K2W8HA61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am completely in love with this essential oil!  I love using essential oils for various reasons around the home. Lavender oil is especially great for relaxation, so one of my favorite uses for it is adding it to my homemade sugar scrubs.  There is nothing better than soaking in the tub to the relaxing scent of Lavender!Since I suffer fro migraines, it is also very helpful with those. The scent alone helps to calm my nerves and relax me, but taking a small amount and rubbing it on my temples during a migraine helps kick it in overdrive and really helps to relieve that pain and pressure even more.The bottle is huge.  Even though you don't need to use a lot of essential oils, most of them come in in a tiny little bottle.  This big 4oz bottle will last a person for an extremely long time!I would definitely recommend this oil!Sample provided for review purposes","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SUPP3STBK18O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TSTZQEY#wasThisHelpful","R1SUPP3STBK18O","A1G1U0K2W8HA61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G1U0K2W8HA61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main reason I wanted to get these massage balls is for my feet. I have no idea what is going on, but in the mornings when I wake up, my feet hurt just horrible. It feels like there is all kinds of built up pressure in them, and it takes a while in the mornings for me to walk it off.When they arrived, I loved that the felt nice and heavy. There are 2 red balls and 1 black.  I have animals so seem to think everything is their's, so the carrying bag that it came with is a big plus to have! I can keep track of them and not have them stolen and hid from me by the naughty dogs.  Anyway - the weight of them definitely helps the balls sink into the muscles and joints to really provide lasting relief!Since I was using it on my feet, I have found that in the mornings they are becoming less and less sore the more I use these balls regularly.  Before even getting out of bed I will sit on the edge of the bed and roll them around under my feet. Within just a few minutes they have my feet completely loosened up and no longer in pain.My husband has horrible back problems, so he loves having me roll these around on his lower back. They really dig in and help loosen up all those tight muscles for him!  We both absolutely love them and would recommend them to anyone looking for some relief from muscle and joint pain! They really can be used anywhere on the body!Sample provided for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29DX2Y1PWE4HE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y1BIP24#wasThisHelpful","R29DX2Y1PWE4HE","A1G1U0K2W8HA61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G1U0K2W8HA61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WOW! I was extremely impressed with this little diffuser! I absolutely love using essential oils, and this diffuser works great for using them!It is small an compact, so it works well for pretty much anywhere you want to use it.  In the office, on your nightstand in the bedroom, in the bathroom, really anywhere! Although it is small, the aroma it puts out from those essential oils is BIG BIG BIG!  It is lightweight so it definitely isn't a hassle to move from room to room, although I love to have multiple diffusers throughout the house so I don't have to keep moving them.I love the design options on these diffusers.  It just gives them a little bit of your own personal touch to them.  They are cool to the touch as well so if you have small children or animals, you have no need to worry about them getting hurt with these if they happen to knock them over while playing or just being curious.One tip I love is using it not only for the aromatherapy purposes of essential oils, but also for a humidifier when you are sick. You can keep it on your desk at work or on the nightstand when you sleep, and it works double - providing the aromatherapy as well as moisture. When my allergies start to act up, I will throw some peppermint oil into the diffuser, and use it on my night stand before bed. (it has automatic shut off as well which is a big plus). By morning I am feeling good as new! Overall I really do love this diffuser.  I would definitely recommend!Sample provided for review purposes","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GGOBFVT0FXV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VFI244G#wasThisHelpful","R1GGOBFVT0FXV2","A1G1U0K2W8HA61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G1U0K2W8HA61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love using essential oils.  This Ultrasonic essential Oil diffuser offers yet another great way to use the oils I love so much.It is small yet packs a big punch. It only takes a very small amount to make the whole room fill with the scent of whichever oil I happen to be using. It doesn't take up a whole lot of room, which is a much better alternative to having a bulky humidifier sitting around.  Since it also works at adding humidity to the air, the diffuser definitely helps with those cold symptoms as well! Nothing is worse than a summer time cold, and unfortunately my husband has been struck by 2 this year so far.  This is a great little diffuser to have sitting on his night stand to help sooth him to sleep.I love that it is cool touch. I don't have small children in the house anymore, but I do have pets, and they love to knock things over, especially the cats.  While they do pretty much leave the diffuser alone, I do have that peace of mind knowing they won't be hurt or burnt if they do happen to knock it over.Whether wanting to add some humidity to the air, or use it as the oil diffuser to take advantage of all the excellent essential oils out there, this diffuser is definitely the best!

"I work in customer service and have for several years.  I will be completely honest here - customer service is getting harder and harder to provide.  A lot of people these days just don't know how to provide it, and a lot of companies don't know how to teach it to their employees.  While I do think customer service isn't necessarily something you can learn - if you don't have those skills you just don't - but tips to make yourself better is always helpful!This book has some really great tips for everyone in customer service, from beginners to those who have been in customer service for a long time.  I think this book is a must for businesses who are just starting out.  You always want to start off on the right foot, and customer service is perhaps the most important part of businesses.Customers are more likely to share their negative experiences with a company so you want to make sure they have the absolute best experience they possibly can!

"I live in an extremely small town. While we do have Chinese restaurants, I do not feel they are up to par with authentic Chinese cooking. There are so many meals I would love to try, but didn't really know the first thing about cooking Chinese.  Once I bought a Wok, I needed a good cookbook to go along with it to teach me!This cookbook is absolutely awesome! Not only does it include a huge amount of recipes - it contains recipes that I would actually love to try! So many of them sounded so good that it was hard to choose between which ones to try first! All of the recipes included are healthy alternatives to store bought, premade Chinese dishes, and contain no preservatives and junk like the store bought foods.  The instructions are all really easy to follow to makes it super easy - even a newbie to Chinese cooking, like me.I have tried 6 recipes from the book already and have loved each one of them!

"When it comes to cookware - you really do get what you pay for.  It's so important to use good cookware when cooking.  This Cooks Standard Wok is definitely high quality!I was impressed with the size when it arrived.  It can make a nice, large meal which is a definite plus for me since we have a rather large household. The measurements are 13 1/2 by 23 by 5 - so you really can make a lot of food in one batch.  I was really impressed with the weight as well.  It is nice and heavy and sturdy.  It is made from quality materials - stainless steel with an aluminum core.  That being said though, it is still dishwasher safe.One of my favorite things about this wok is the handles.  The riveted handles never get hot - so you can handle the wok with ease while cooking.  Also, the lit fits nice and tight to keep all the heat and steam inside where you want it to be!  All in all this wok is simply amazing and is getting tons of use in our family!!

I have tried shower heads in the past that say they have different settings but when you try to change it, the shower head starts leaking, or the difference in the setting is so minor that you can't even tell that you changed it.

No more going with the normal scent that fabric softeners come in when you buy them from the store! They really do help reduce the dry time too. I coudln't believe it.

You can change the strength of the shock that the dog receives, which I do recommend starting on the lowest setting first so it doesn't scare the bejesus out of your dog.

It makes a lot more sense to be a chalk finish. I had actually thought to myself ""why would I need an entire item to be painted with chalkboard paint and not just a little part of it?"". This paint is really nice. The finish it leaves is beautiful. It is really easy to use - it goes on smooth and is nice and thick so dripping is kept at a minimum.

I dye my hair with Darkest Intense Auburn hair color and then go over it with purple from either Manic Panic or Pravana. The first thing I did with these is color over them with the purple - and it took the color really well.  It didn't damage the hair, and it took the color beautifully.I blow dried them and curled them - again - no damage to the hair and it worked beautifully.I can't say enough good about these extensions.

"I am constantly on the hunt for a good lotion, and this has definitely delivered! Living in Wisconsin always seems to be dry - even in the summer time.  That is when we actually get a summer. Anyway - this lotion really does what it claims and has been great for healing my poor dry skin!Especially in the winter my hands can get so dry that they crack.  Then it hurts like crazy to put any kind of lotion on it.  I recently took a trip to Las Vegas and, silly me, I did not bring this stuff with me. My hands were so dry and cracked by the time I got home my hands just hurt.  After just one application of this lotion my hands felt worlds better! It didn't sting and by morning my hands no longer hurt. You could see the difference in my hands from just the one application.  Repeating with this lotion, the dry, cracked skin had cleared up in no time!It absorbs into the skin completely and doesn't leave behind any sticky or greasy residue. It is fragrance free so there really is no scent to it, which is either good nor bad.

It isn't overpowering though.It is gentle on the skin and does not leave my skin feeling dried out and doesn't leave behind any gross film or residue on the my skin or the tub.  It rinses out of the tub completely after each use. As far as using it as a body wash it is also nice - although I did not use it on my hair so I cannot comment on that. Overall though this is a really nice bubble bath!Sample received for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROF7ECNQBNX9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HGAC1M#wasThisHelpful","ROF7ECNQBNX9T","A1G1U0K2W8HA61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G1U0K2W8HA61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Where have these been all my life?!?! Such a simple idea yet I would have never thought of it in a million years!These work so much better than your standard push pins and tacks that pull out of things so easily. I can't even count the number of times I would try to pin something and two seconds later the pin is on the ground or in my foot - especially on things like furniture. We have dogs so we do try to keep slip covers on the couches and recliners - but they never stay put.  So far after adding these instead of a standard push pin, I am not putting the slip covers back on every day. They hold really well and can take a lot of use!Another great use for them is keeping the bedskirt on the bed! Ever go and put a bedskirt on and then try to put the mattress back on top of that - especially when you are alone? They end up slipping off, losing their position, and never looking straight. It is very frustrating. I added these to hold the bedskirt in place and now it actually looks like a bedskirt should look!Absolutely love these!! Really great product!

"HMM. A lot of people seem to be disappointed in this mp3 player, but I couldn't be happier with it, especially at the price point it is at!When it arrived I was able to take it out of the package and immediately start using it.  I ran the battery down to nothing and then plugeed it in to charge. Ever since then it has been working just fine for me. It holds a charge quite well in my opinion, and has continued to charge properly and completely every time I have needed to charge it. The sound is pretty decent coming out of it, and I love how compact it is. Normally I would listen to music on my phone, but I have the Note 3 so clunking that thing around while walking or working out is a major pain. I can just slip this in my pocket and use it instead of my phone.

"This is a really comfortable sleep mask! I have owned several in the past and most of them are uncomfortable to wear, but this one definitely is not. It is super soft and feels really nice on the head and skin.  It really does a good job of blocking out light which is awesome for me.  I like to sleep with the TV on at night for the sound but can't stand the light it creates.

"I can't get enough essential oils and lavender is one of my favorite scents.  I absolutely love it. However, it is very discouraging when you are shopping for essential oils because so many out there come in these tiny little bottles. I know you don't need a whole of the oil depending on what you are doing with it, but I want a nice sized bottle.This āVō Lavender Essential Oil comes in a big 4oz bottle which will last me a very long time before needing to buy more! I do actually use it quite a bit though.  I will use it in my sugar scrubs to help relax with a nice hot bath before bed, as well as using it in my diffuser at night for added relaxation. There is just something about that lavender scent that knocks me right out.I also suffer from frequent migraines. While I am on a preventative for them, they still happen here and there, and this lavender essential oil is almost a necessity when I do get one.  The aroma offers great relief from that horrible migraine pain and even just regular headaches.  One thing I did not know until I purchased this though is that it is also a natural insect repellant! BONUS! Who likes the smell of bug spray? NO ONE! Now I can smell good AND repel those nasty mosquitoes when we are outside in the summer!Definitely a great purchase!

"I have been able to try a few hair loss shampoos recently, and I have to say that out of all of them, this is my favorite.  I recently seem to be losing more hair than normal, and right around Christmas I discovered a big bald spot in the front of my head. Definitely not just average hair shedding.This shampoo does something many other hair loss shampoos don't seem to do - CLEAN THE HAIR. Seriously - I have tried so many that leave my hair almost feeling worse than before I ""washed"" it.  They just don't seem to wash the hair.  I found that I would have to wash my hair with another shampoo first, and then come behind with a hair loss shampoo if I wanted my hair to be clean.  Not so much with this shampoo. It has been great for use all on it's own and actually does clean the hair!Is it helping with hair growth? I'm not sure. My bald spot is growing back in but is that the result of this shampoo or a result of the steroids that my doctor gave me? I'm not really sure. The way I see it though, it certainly can't hurt. I have noticed an overall lessening of the shedding, which I think I can contribute to the shampoo since I have only been using the steroid on the bald spot itself.Sample was provided for review purposes","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS3ATOTYNAE80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004N1EQNO#wasThisHelpful","RS3ATOTYNAE80","A1G1U0K2W8HA61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G1U0K2W8HA61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm pretty happy with this purchase.  This particular ""style"" is one of my favorites. I had two very similar which had both broke (uh oh - is that a sign of too much use?) so I jumped on the chance to receive this one.I will say when you first look at it it might appear to be cheap or poorly made. I honestly did not have high hopes for this based on it's looks. I couldn't be more wrong though. It has held up really well and is actually quite sturdy and strong.The varying speeds go from pretty light to quite intense just depending on what you personally prefer. It does not ""eat"" batteries like I have found with several other toys.  It will get a lot of use out of the same two batteries without needing to replace them.Honestly, this is a really great toy!Sample provided at a discount for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KLP4PWQ264C5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKEXI7I#wasThisHelpful","R2KLP4PWQ264C5","A1G1U0K2W8HA61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G1U0K2W8HA61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was actually really surprised that these actually work.  I have found that the older I get, the worse I feel after a night of drinking. It doesn't even take much. I have had times where I have one or two glasses of wine and wake up in the morning feeling awful. One of my biggest complaints associated with a hangover is the dizziness. I don't know why but hangovers always seem to come with varying degrees of dizziness and I absolutely hate it. Just changing positions will cause me to be dizzy and nauseous.Taking before going out or even before just having a few cocktails at home, this has worked quite well with keeping those hangovers at bay.  Of course this isn't to say if you drink to the point of puking it will save you from every bit of a hangover. If you drink that much I think you will have a hangover no matter what. But for light or even average drinking I think it works great. Summer time is here so having a few drinks at the races or while having a fire in the back yard I will definitely be keeping these on hand!Sample provided at a discount for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N892I5RR2MP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UW3FBJK#wasThisHelpful","R1N892I5RR2MP2","A1G1U0K2W8HA61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G1U0K2W8HA61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coconut oil is so great for many different uses.  This fractionated coconut oil is one of the better ones out there.I love that it comes with the pump. I will often use it at night on my scalp to help relieve itching and dry patches on my scalp.  the pump makes it super easy to just squirt a little bit on my hands to massage into my scalp.I do also use this as a base for my sugar scrubs.  It is a great carrier oil for other essential oils out there. Peppermint essential oil and this coconut oil in a simple sugar mix makes for a really wonderful sugar scrub that soaks into the skin easily to help keep moisture locked in.There is no scent to it so no worrying about it mixing with whatever scented oil you choose to mix it with. You can also use it all by itself as a moisturizer which I have also been known to do a time or two.Definitely couldn't ask for a better coconut oil!Sample received at a discount for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5YUKGYEVRXJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U8YGIFO#wasThisHelpful","R5YUKGYEVRXJ2","A1G1U0K2W8HA61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G1U0K2W8HA61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband takes fish oil everyday to help keep his cholesterol in check as well as for the overall health benefits of taking it.  The lemon flavor is definitely a plus.  So often fish oil can have that very fishy taste, which isn't the best in the world. The fishy burps are gross as can  be, but these pills don't leave behind those gross fishy burps.For me, personally, they are a great added benefit to my diet.

"This is RIDICULOUSLY COOL! I wasn't really sure how it worked until it arrived. I thought maybe you were going to have to put water in it or something, but that isn't how it works at all. The plastic that the light shines through is molded to make the watery appearance. It is really neat. The patterns it reflects up on to the ceiling and/or walls is just cool. I could sit and watch it for hours.The kids LOVE IT.  I have nieces and nephews that I will watch from time to time and they absolutely love to sit and watch the pretty colors and lights on the ceiling. It is just the neatest thing.Super easy to use - just a quick touch of a button will turn it on and off or change the colors projected. While you can use it with batteries, it also has an DC plug in so if you use it a lot there is no need to go through tons of batteries.

"I decided to get this LEG magnifier for mu husband. He drives truck and still sometimes has to turn to his map while finding directions.  More often than the map though, he needs to be able to read invoices for shipment/order numbers and stuff like that.  He has a very hard time reading small print, so this really comes in handy for him! The fact that it has the light on it is absolutely a plus - so many of his orders delivery at night time so you need that added light to be able to see and read.It is really light and easy to hold, and is strong as can be. Bouncing around in the truck day after day can damage things so easily, but so far so good with this magnifier! It is holding up really well.

"It had been a long time since I had been able to do any sketching when I was offered this sketchbook to review. I find it to be really relaxing to just sit back and draw, but seem to never have the time to do it anymore.  Sometimes, though, you need to just take a time out and do something that you enjoy doing.This Sketchbook is a really great quality.  The cover is nice and thick and very durable. It can easily come with me anywhere I want to do, and all of the drawings inside are protected from any damage with the thick, durable cover. This isn't your cheap sketch pad that has a paper cover which does NOTHING to protect your artwork. Plus it doubles as a hard surface to be able to draw on which is great.The paper itself is awesome. It is very thick and luxurious and very easy to sketch on. I was really impressed with the quality of the paper, especially for the price of the sketchbook.  It works great for shading, but doesn't smudge like low quality papers often do when working with graphite or charcoal. There is no bleed through when using markers or even pastels which can sometimes bleed through when using cheap, low quality papers.Overall - REALLY a great sketch book. I would definitely recommend it for any artist from beginners to experiences artists!Sample Provided for Review Purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24SS87IS5IU9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q3TCW08#wasThisHelpful","R24SS87IS5IU9H","A1G1U0K2W8HA61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G1U0K2W8HA61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sleep isn't always easy to come by. I find the older I get, the harder time I have falling asleep. It may be for many different reasons, but frustrating none the less. Perhaps it is because as we age out bodies just don't produce enough melatonin to regular our day/night cycle.So far using this melatonin cream - being honest - it is just ok.  I think my problems are more than just melatonin oriented though.  I have taken melatonin in pill form in the past and have found that it didn't really do much for me either. Overall though, I think this cream definitely could work for some people. It isn't too thick, and isn't too thin. It goes on nice and smooth, and doesn't have a bad scent to it.Like I stated though - for me it didn't really do anything. I gave it a shot for a week and had no improvement in my falling asleep. I was still awake in bed for hours before falling asleep, and still waking up multiple times through the night. So for me - I can't really say it worked. Again though - I do think it can work for some people and is definitely worth trying before loading yourself up on sleeping pills. Melatonin can be very good for some people and aid in their sleep IF the melatonin is the issue causing them not to sleep.Sample provided for review purposes","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R86A76X6AU74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGLHU6Y#wasThisHelpful","R1R86A76X6AU74","A1G1U0K2W8HA61","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G1U0K2W8HA61?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Matcha Green Tea is so good for the body.  Honestly, I got this gift set to give to my sister since she is really big into Matcha Green Tea right now.  Drinking Matcha Green Tea can help boost your metabolism and burn calories, calms and relaxes your mind and body, and can enhance your mood and helps with concentration.This set is everything that you could possibly need to make traditional Matcha green tea. It comes in a beautiful cardboard box with a magnetic closure.  Even being cardboard the packaging is quite pretty. It is definitely a high quality set which will hold up even through daily use.If you are like me and don't particularly like the taste of the green tea on it's own, you can always mix it with a smoothie and you will hardly even notice it is there, yet reap all the benefits of it!

"My son has been using a wired headset for about a year and hes been asking for a wireless headset, Hes 10 but with him being a first time wireless headset user, i didn't wanna spend 'hundreds' for a headset. He hooked them up without a hassle, got it all set up and they work flawlessly, He started his game and was amazed at how nice the sounds was and how much better he could hear, and how much more clear things were. The microphone quality is great and as for range its amazing, he can walk out from his bedroom which is on one side of the house, all the way to the kitchen and even the mailbox and still be talking to his friends, I was amazed by that. They appear to be very good quality, and he raves about how much more comfortable they are. He can usually go a the whole school week before having to charge these it just depends how much you play, On the weekends he sometimes has to charge it a few times. It gets about a 15 hour charge.

"Eager for some new low-budget high fantasy, I ordered a Blu-ray version from Amazon's UK site for dirt cheap. Chagrintastically, I then discovered this film already in my collection under a different name, so...As a public service announcement, let's clear up any confusion right here:(original title) -- SAGA: Curse of the ShadowUK (English title) (DVD box title) -- Rise of the Shadow WarriorUSA (alternative title) (English title) -- Curse of the Dragon SlayerUSA (alternative title) (English title) -- Dragon Lore: Curse of the ShadowUSA (English title) (new title) -- SAGA: Curse of the ShadowWorld-wide (alternative title) (English title) -- SAGA: The Shadow CabalIf I were feeling cynical this evening I would say a crafty filmmaker changed the name around to cause absentminded geeks like me to purchase the same flick twice. Maybe it was changed to have ""dragon"" in the title because ""dragon"" is a choice marketing term for this genre, but then they got sued by somebody and changed the name back to something about shadows?Below, I'm just going to refer to it as ""Curse"" (short for ""SAGA: Curse of the Dragon Lore Slayer Shadow Cabal,"" or alternatively, ""Curse of the Many-named Movie"").So is it worth watching? That depends on your viewing needs. Here are some details:*Cinematography*OUTSTANDING. Somebody cut their teeth with Curse, and Hollywood may take notice and scoop up the talent involved. Granted, Utah is intrinsically beautiful, but it still takes talent to scout out the perfect spot and to use camera angles that will make the most of natural splendor. The topography caught on film is lavishly varied, with forests, wetlands, and plenty of mountainous terrain. Going above and beyond the call of duty for a B movie, they even bothered to do some underwater scenes (featuring mermaids who curiously wear bikini tops made of synthetic material). On top of this, serious color grading during postproduction resulted in saturated landscapes and artificial darkness to provide for an otherworldly vibe.*Actors*""They cursed the wrong elf, and they're going to regret it,"" says Nemyt Akaia. Because she is just so damn telegenic that I don't want to imagine this flick without her, I'm reluctant to admit that Danielle Chuchran as the elf named Nemyt was perhaps miscast. According to IMDb, Danielle was ""born in Upland, California but moved to Utah shortly after."" Upland is dangerously close to actual Valley Girl territory, and at times you can't help but think of Nemyt Akaia as being a California elf. Anyway, she was competent in her scenes, and there's something oddly alluring about a girl like that who can spit so well (her elf spits at whomever she's currently disgusted with, which changes frequently). According to the final credits she had a body double, but humorously she also served as a ""Booty Double"" for the treacherous mermaids.I will be seeking out Danielle Chuchran in leading roles elsewhere, and I selfishly hope that she doesn't gain fame and leave the B movie circuit.Curse was Richard McWilliams' screen debut, and Richard did very well indeed as the protagonist Keltus the Wanderer.Paul D. Hunt, who already had experience on the screen, also brings life to Curse as the frenemy orc Kullimon the Black, and he deserves extra credit for wearing what must have been uncomfortable facial prosthetics.The stunning Bailee MyKell Cowperthwaite (she'll need to change her name if she wants to be a starlet) plays the prophetess, although by ""plays"" I mean she stands there looking solemn (nice work if you can get it) while another woman does her telepathic voice. Come to think of it, Bailee looks more like she belongs on the cover of Vogue than in a movie overflowing with orcs.*Plot / Script*Not mind-bending in the least, but if we're going to be charitable we can say it goes beyond simplistic and keeps the audience engaged. I'm just glad there was no actual ring involved, keeping Curse from being The Frenemies of the Ring (since it borrows so much from FotR already). The dialogue was written by two dudes who make it abundantly clear that Curse is concerned with genre and cinematography over launching the career of a screenwriter.*Soundtrack*A bit grandiloquent for a B movie, but I'd rather hear ambition than afterthought. Well done.*Special Effects / CGI*Hit or miss, but mostly adds to the credibility of Curse rather than detracting from it. There was a big fail in attempting to portray an undead minotaur (or demon or something) that had papier-mché hands, but that was the only disaster.Family friendly? Well, if you are fine with your kid witnessing multiple decapitations but can't abide bare breasts on mermaids, then you've come to the right place. The mermaids are fully clothed and there are plenty of melee scenes that end with heads flying off.Final thoughts: Somewhat superior to the Mythica film series, Curse is amusing if you're willing to overlook obvious but expected low-budget flaws... would have been a lot less fun without Danielle Chuchran as the valley girl elf.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRWERK4OSISZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPNFY1K#wasThisHelpful","RRWERK4OSISZI","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That's the announcer describing El Angel Blanco and Renato el Hippie flattening Blue Demon in a tag team fight (1 of 3 lucha libre matches during the movie). Renato the Hippie is a giant unmasked opponent, taller than both Santo and Blue Demon.Anyway, this is one of the best Santo y Blue Demon flicks I've seen, and my first ever encounter with a Dracula who speaks Spanish. As a vampire purist it pains me to see el Hombre Lobo thrown in with a vampire, but what can you do...Notable humor:👹 Dracula, who's apparently crappy at fist fights, was mainly a threat through hypnotism. But he gives Lina (the lovely Nubia Martí) fair warning that he will hypnotize her. Gotta love those villains who talk long enough for the hero to show up.👹 Blue Demon, hands tied behind his back, is made to walk a plank over a pit full of upward jutting spikes. Too bad he wore his shoes with tall heels that day! (what a horrible decade to be stuck in...) Of course Santo saves him from peril, and then Dracula and el Hombre Lobo stand frozen while their henchmen have a wild fight with Santo and Blue Demon. Dracula doesn't seem to have a plan B for most situations...👹 When Santo tells Lina (Santo's girlfriend) to stay at home because he's going into a dangerous situation, she tails him to the dangerous rendezvous and promptly saves both Santo and Blue Demon from a grisly death by fire.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKLI367T8XP75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008XRYA#wasThisHelpful","RKLI367T8XP75","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like early John Waters flicks, Nightmare On Elmo's Street (NOES) will make you throw up in your mouth a little. Yet such a comparison is an insult to John Waters (aka the Prince of Puke), who was capable of going beyond shock value by making educated statements about society in his films. If you don't know who John Waters is, then please do yourself a favor and check out his filmography.While the technical side of NOES is passable, it is otherwise mostly devoid of aptitude in other facets:PROs✔ The music. A well-picked selection of metal, mostly of the blackened doom variety: Satan's Host, Shape of Despair, Tristitia, The Skull, Esoteric, My Dying Bride, Woe Unto Me. The dark neoclassical band Elend was a nice way to break up that monotony.✔ The scantily clad Erin Brown wields a cross to fend off a puppet vampire; a bit offbeat, but what makes it sardonic is that [puppet] Jesus is still nailed to said cross.✔ Lots of unscripted cats. Literally, cats wandering around in many scenes. And if you don't like cats, there are slow-mo scenes of a dog running toward the camera in the snow. Yes, NOES is random.✔ There are a few lines capable of inciting any reaction whatsoever, such as: ""Can I kiss you where you pee?"" However, one good line every 5 or so minutes does not a worthwhile movie make.✔ Lots of extras. If you want more of Erin Brown, Dangrr Doll, Scarlett Storm, etc., it's there on the disc.CONs✘ Other than its pleasantly anti-theistic overtones, NOES is largely pedestrian. Akin to an insular high school boy imagining what ""non-conformist"" would be like, NOES ends up less subversive than The Matrix.✘ The script is wretched. I think Bill Zebub may have been trying for pseudo-philosophy, but the musings are vaguely reminiscent of listening to a dim-witted teabagger explain how much of a rebel he is, as if saying or doing something that isn't labeled (or subjectively perceived as) ""mainstream"" has intrinsic value simply for that reason. Not only has decrying ""mainstream"" become mainstream, but the very idea conveniently serves as a red herring, keeping us from asking questions such as: ""Regardless of budget, is the film worth watching?"" Being politically incorrect just for the sake of doing it is worse than pointless since it creates a snooze fest; perhaps if you live a sheltered and unhappy life, doing so feels avant-garde.✘ NOES is to erotica what feces is to fine dining.✘ I am wondering if you need to be under the influence of something to enjoy this flick; a movie shouldn't require drug use to be entertaining.⚖ Final thoughts ⚖The actors got a paycheck, director Bill Zebub got another notch in his belt, and I got an awful taste in my mouth (and have a little less money and time in my monthly entertainment budget). I support independent film by buying in, but sometimes it just isn't worth supporting.Don't watch NOES unless [1] you have a thing for one of the actresses, or [2] you hate humanity, including yourself.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA1TQ6YSXU59B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010CG2EBY#wasThisHelpful","RA1TQ6YSXU59B","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although it appears to have been rebranded as ""Before the Storm,"" the literal translation of the film's French name is Bad (or Ill) Wind.I'll be honest, I ordered this from Europe because Aure Atika stars in it. As it turns out, the entire cast is wonderful.The plot:Franck (Jonathan Zaccaï) is a very underemployed tech temp worker who takes a gig that entails traveling to a coastal town to work on a computer system at a mega-supermarket that has gone on the fritz following a storm. As he starts working for Hopquin (Bernard Le Coq), the unpleasant man who manages the store, he notices some irregularities in the system that lead him to discover embezzlement. Meanwhile, back at his hotel, Franck has an eye for Frédérique (Aure Atika), who runs the place in its off-season. She has little interest in him unless she happens to be bored or the recipient of a gift from Franck.While this doesn't sound especially enticing, there's something about the way it comes together, with Ill Wind's seamless mingling of romance, humor, danger, desperation, and scheming. The script is solid and the actors know their craft. While the outcome of the romance is not surprising, the outcome of the scheming is not predictable, and remains the strength of Ill Wind. Perhaps I am biased towards liking French film, but I feel that this is a well-spent 92 minutes.A strong 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHRFFTKM84FIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012QCURM#wasThisHelpful","RHRFFTKM84FIY","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2.5 stars at best...with the Beginner's Guide to Sex (BGS), you get basically what you'd expect from characters with names such as Principal Hyman (Tom Arnold), Coach Bush (Lucius Baston), Roberta the Squirter (Danie Coleman), and Marci Cox (Jackie Moore). I was more annoyed than amused for the first half but kept watching because Whitney Moore made the most of her role as the 30-year-old virgin Sex Ed teacher, Laci Cox. Hmm, writing this got me wondering if Jackie Moore is Whitney Moore's sister (Marci Cox is sister to Laci Cox in the movie).BGS is juvenile to the point of being idiotic, yet somehow you don't necessarily need to be an idiot to savor this kind of stupidity (or I could just be an idiot and not know it). Featuring students who jump off buildings competitively (is that a thing IRL?) and truly slimy school faculty and staff, BGS is surely beyond the pale and barely tethered to reality, with characters mostly being caricatures of themselves. It takes a minute to realize that Whitney Moore is not overacting, but rather playing the role flawlessly to fit the tude of the flick.If you can make it thru the first half, the second is better. The gay Coach Bush is a pleasantly surprising role not only because the script successfully walks the fine line between fun and denigration, but also because Lucius Baston excels at bringing his character to life. Other than Baston, the true talent on display is that of Whitney Moore (which is a relief considering that she is the protagonist). The other actors are hit or miss; I would say breakout roles for some, except that they probably don't want to be too much associated with BGS in the future.Final verdict: I'd wager the actors had a better time making this than we get in watching it. Proceed at your own risk.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS0GXOF8KVZ5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016W3Q9K8#wasThisHelpful","RS0GXOF8KVZ5H","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"↷ In the interest of not spoiling the plot, very few details are given below ↶If you read the Amazon blurb, then you know Meadowland takes place ""In the hazy aftermath of an unimaginable loss."" Two children are part of this tale of misfortune, with the adults as equally tragic figures. I'm not a parent, yet Meadowland did an outstanding job of forcing me to feel their struggle. The mother deals with her grief very differently than the father, providing a central premise in Meadowland.For most of its duration I felt a dull tension; as a passive observer, you are suspended in a heightened state while waiting for the other shoe to drop. You hope to see the characters find some light in so much darkness, but you also have a strong suspicion that the predicament will get worse before getting better. The raw humanity in this tale of woe is plausible and nearly palpable, with a very fine collection of actors bringing it together (including a few minutes cameo by Elisabeth Moss aka Peggy Olson aka Zoey Bartlet).*Abrupt ending alert* If you can't abide films that don't neatly tie up loose ends right before the closing credits, you've been warned. Despite no Standardized Hollywood Happy Ending (SHHE), Meadowland doesn't leave you with the urge to slit your wrists.

"An apologist for war? It's simple to label Ian Morris as such if you are unable to get beyond the cognitive dissonance induced by a thesis like the one proposed here. Even more troubling, especially perhaps for libertarians and anarchists, is the approach taken by Morris in holding up Leviathan (Thomas Hobbes) as the desirable endpoint of war. Be prepared also for reading many instances of terms like ""the invisible hand,"" Rumsfeld's ""unknown unknowns,"" and ""globo-cop,"" all of which are used with relish.Since it was written by a notable scholar rather than a radio talk show host, a college try in wading through the slippery denseness of his argument seemed reasonable to attempt. Morris at least attempts to view his thesis from more than one angle, while also providing implied (and possibly explicit, I can't remember) disclaimers so that the reader understands he is not a bloodthirsty sod who is clueless about how awful war is and the horrors that come out of it. The reasoning of his thesis is sound, drawing from disciplines that [at least theoretically] don't place moral judgments on topics.""War. War never changes."" That's how the opening dialogue from the game Fallout 3 commences, but in reference to human nature, not methodology. While Morris definitely discusses how war methodology has changed throughout history, his experience as an anthropologist and historian (rather than philosopher) doesn't lead to much talk of human nature per se, although nature is more or less implied by proxy in the extensive discussion of world history and archeology. Could most of the world's violent conflicts have been prevented (i.e., could differences have settled amicably)? Morris didn't intend to answer that question, and it's a moot point anyway.Morris provides a convincing argument that many won't want to acknowledge because it may be seen as weakening our convictions about the wrongness of war. If only life were black and white. The bottom line is that you can read this book in the morning and go to a war protest in the afternoon. ☮","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FV52Z3LE0O42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFF1FUU#wasThisHelpful","R3FV52Z3LE0O42","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While nudity as protest is old news in the West, FEMEN made some waves in Eastern Europe (2008-2013). The Ukrainian group's éminence grise ironically was a man (Victor Svyatski) who purportedly chose attractive young women likeliest to draw attention to the issues FEMEN would go on to champion. Inna Shevchenko, among the core original members in Ukraine (now heading their Paris HQ, as FEMEN is understandably in self-exile), posits that the patriarchal system is so ingrained in Ukrainian women that FEMEN may never have come to fruition without Svyatski (not stated in this documentary, but in another titled ""Ukraine is not a Brothel"", a slogan used by FEMEN at one point). This is only one of many controversies around a protest group most controversial for its preferred mode of raising awareness.During an interview in ""I Am FEMEN"", Anna Hutsol (the principal organizer of FEMEN in Ukraine from its inception) states:""...we need women who look aggressive, beautiful, and sexy, because Femen addresses another paradox in our society: How can such a beautiful woman, who you normally see in a beauty salon, be a feminist? People ask: Why is this sex object protesting? I'm used to seing her in porno films, in newpapers, in my bed, or in the kitchen. I'm not used to seeing this object protesting.""Statements like these obviously open up a can of worms for many people, including some feminists. Regardless, there is no denying that the young women of FEMEN had some guts in opposing various wrongs in a region with many wrongs to right. In one of the tenser segments of ""I Am FEMEN"", a trip to poke a stick in the eye of Alexander Lukashenko (the dictator of Belarus) in front of the Minsk KGB office predictably leads to three FEMEN members being swiftly disappeared, albeit temporarily. I won't spoil the details of this story for you, or those of their trip to Moscow to shame the tyrant Putin. Suffice it to say, you don't want to get on the wrong side of the secret police.A shortcoming of the documentary is a failure to look beyond the insular group and evaluate if FEMEN had a positive impact in Ukraine (again, a controversial issue). Still, while many won't agree with their methods, standing against political oppression and the designation of women as 2nd class citizens is something worth taking your shirt off for, even in freezing weather. ""I Am FEMEN"" is a good watch, regardless of whether it is viewed for academic pursuits, entertainment, enlightenment, or inspiration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY7H60O4G80Q3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W64YQO4#wasThisHelpful","RY7H60O4G80Q3","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"↷ In the interest of not spoiling the plot, very few details are given below ↶Dirty Weekend is a relatively low-key, dialogue-rich dramedy that takes place over the course of a day (and was supposedly filmed over 15 days). Two strikingly different coworkers (portrayed by Alice Eve & Matthew Broderick) who are due to give a business presentation the following day find themselves delayed in the Albuquerque airport indefinitely, when they decide to go into town. What follows is a peculiar bonding that leads to the duo egging each other on until secrets are revealed.5 points to ponder beforehand:1. Alice Eve is the MVP of Dirty Weekend, very convincingly bringing her character to life with nearly perfect attention to detail. Next to her, Broderick comes off as a novice. Gia Crovatin can probably be considered as giving the second best performance in Dirty Weekend.2. Was Matthew Broderick being too heavy-handed with the deadpan? Was he miscast? Apparently the critics liked him in Dirty Weekend, but I can't see why. About halfway in you sort of just surrender to the choice of him as the male lead; I'm saying this as someone who in 1983 enjoyed Broderick in his breakout role (WarGames) on the big screen, so I certainly wanted to like him here.3. When people say of a movie, ""it isn't for everyone,"" they are speaking of films like this. If you need action, a Hollywood Happy Ending, or cue cards to tell you when to laugh, then skip this. Dirty Weekend also portrays some unorthodox relationships, so if your mind is easily blown by that type of thing... you've been warned.4. Dirty Weekend is about self-discovery, and about how an acquaintance can be instrumental in the process. Basically: life is full of surprises (and so is this film).5. The story may seem an improbable scenario, but trust me: a business trip with a coworker can absolutely lead to all kinds of possibilities (results may vary). Dirty Weekend is not so predictable as to be mundane, but you also don't need to suspend disbelief in order to watch it.Final thoughts: I was grinning for the majority of Dirty Weekend, and was pleased that it ended on a slightly more serious note; the characters experienced growth but didn't neatly resolve their issues in one day. A fondness for Matthew Broderick is not the best reason to watch this. Alice Eve in the role of Natalie, Gia Crovatin as Dylan, and the cab driver who ""likes Shakespeare"" are among the best reasons to watch. ✈","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQWCZG8KSC05P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014WHEK3E#wasThisHelpful","RQWCZG8KSC05P","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so looking forward to an offbeat vampire flick, but I'm going to have to agree somewhat with the reviewer who simply wrote ""Man is bitten by a foam rubber likeness of a colon in a fishbowl attached to flexible air conditioning duct which makes him want to kill."" In fairness, the bowel in a tank is only the genesis of the troubles faced by the two protagonists, one who becomes deeply disturbed and vampiric, the other who remains mortal for longer, desiring to impose salvation on the mad scientist.Strange Blood reminds me of something you would see at a science fiction short film festival; the problem here is that it isn't short.ACTORSMan. I'm going to be unkind and state that Robert Brettenaugh was probably not born to be an actor. He is better in Strange Blood after he shaves his head, but mostly because he looks awkward and truly stark raving mad to fit the part (too bad he couldn't match it with convincing thespianism). There's a somewhat fine line between coming off as a madman and looking like you're trying to pull it off; unfortunately, his performance was over the top.Woman. Alexandra Bard does well with what she was given, but warming up to her occurs only after a quarter hour of acclimating to the anemic script and vibe of Strange Blood. You may or may not feel empathy with her character at times, but you'll also lose respect once too often, which leaves you in no particular mood to continue watching Strange Blood. This is an actress worth looking out for in future productions (I would watch her already released shorts if I could find them).PLOTSimple, and mostly shot at one location (barely qualifying as a disjointed movie set). The whole idea of how a vampire might be created by something other than another vampire was at least an ounce of originality. Prepare yourself to be fine with extensive scenes of the doc flitting back and forth in his tighty-whities, which are often dirty in spots that make you cringe. A fun aspect of the plot is in the last minute AFTER the closing credits, so be sure to watch that (if you can make it to the closing credits).SCRIPTNot worth mentioning. I've seen worse, but that's about the best praise I can offer. The ""love story"" is just horrible in every way. There's one good line Alexandra Bard proffers at a diner: ""If you can't have dessert for dinner, what's the point of being an adult?""CINEMATOGRAPHYThe saving grace of Strange Blood, if you are charitable enough to recognize it, is competent and even creative cinematography. There are flashes of inspiration, but more instances of ideas that don't pan out (such as the use of red lighting). In the beginning, you might say ""Oh no, not another found footage movie!"" Not to worry: it isn't one (that's only a gimmick to get to the real story).ADULT FACTORMale and female nudity, sex scenes, coarse language, abusive/violent behavior, and bloodshed.EXTRA FEATURESNone. The nail in the coffin for low budget flicks like this is when they couldn't be bothered to put anything on the DVD other than the feature film. An interview with Alexandra Bard or Robert Brettenaugh would have been choice, or even one with the filmmaker (discussing for instance where the ideas came from, what challenges were encountered during shooting, etc.; such details are of interest to film buffs even when the movie is not good).Final Thoughts: I paid $10 for Strange Blood and Strangely I don't regret it, probably because I collect vampire films (no matter how bad). For the casual viewer, however, you'd need to *really* like vampire and/or bizarre films to justify this price.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LY8951UERU3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00USBLXZC#wasThisHelpful","R3LY8951UERU3B","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't judge a DVD by it's cover in this case, because the artwork doesn't reflect Mythica: A Quest for Heroes (MQH) very well. In this first of three Mythica movies, the woman front and center on this DVD cover is indeed the protagonist, but she is a magic user who wields no swords.

"Season 2 flashes forward a bit to 1873, still in the early days of the French Third Republic, when many were glad to be rid of the monarchy, yet others pined for its reestablishment. Much to the chagrin of Hortense, Le Paradis is now run by its proletariat residents, but it doesn't take long before the bordello is caught between the vice squad and a small band of hoodlums, leading to such scenarios as a picnic becoming a bloodbath.Season 2 features a magnificent reprisal of Rose by Jemima West, who now ranges from feisty newly literate Marxist to withdrawn lovestruck drug addict. In reviewing Season 1, I stated that somehow Maison Close ""doesn't leave you in a pool of misery""; the same cannot be said for Season 2. Yet despite the emphatic tragedy of it all, Maison Close is well worth watching in its entirety, rivaling the best of dramas about the disenfranchised.There was industry chatter in 2012 about HBO picking up Maison Close for a remake; I can only hope that it didn't happen and that such a series doesn't come to fruition.

"On par with Bron/Broen (The Bridge), here's a similarly top notch production released on the Nordic Noir label. In contrast to The Bridge, The Killing excels at casting doubt on nearly every character introduced, to the point where the only person you are sure didn't commit the murder is Sarah Lund, the central protagonist.Bemusement reigns over not only the murder, but also other plotlines like the source of leaks in a political party (season 1). Starring Sofie Grbøl, the acting is to be commended for nearly everyone involved. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic; less gritty than Bron/Broen, but capturing more color, vitality, and emotion. I urge you to consider the Blu-ray (if you have a player that can handle region B/2) release for this reason.I had no idea there was an American remake of this series until just now when I read another review posted here. I can't imagine it being better than the original, but since ""for some reason [Americans] cannot read subtitles, or they don't want to"" (not my words, but Sofie Gråbøl's), it exists if you really can't abide subtitles.My only complaint about Forbrydelsen, and it is extremely minor: episodes begin with a recap lasting ~2.5 minutes. Do Danes have poor memories?As for price, it's easy to complain about it based on Amazon's US site. However, you can get this compilation of all 3 seasons for much cheaper (DVD or Blu-ray) if you go to Amazon's UK site (I'm assuming you already have a player that can handle foreign regions if you are considering this listing).Final thoughts: A set of prototypical Danish programming that's as good a place to start as any if you are new to Nordic Noir serials, and reasonably priced if you buy from overseas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10EHNUJ6F9L4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B76T6O2#wasThisHelpful","R10EHNUJ6F9L4D","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"↷ spoiler-free comments ↶If you aren't suffering from post-apocalyptic scenario burnout syndrome, then this *might* be worth your time. It's basically science fiction of the ""last man on Earth"" (no, not the comedy) variety. Air manages to run the gamut of man vs. man, man vs. himself, and man vs. nature, but mostly on a superficial level (i.e., philosophy you might expect from this type of sci-fi is conspicuously absent). While the skeleton is set up to make us expect big things, there just isn't much meat on the bones. If Air were a meal, you'd likely still be hungry after watching it.You get the impression that Reedus was doing Air between scenes for The Walking Dead (TWD), because it's almost as if he walked off the TWD set and onto the Air set not wanting to depart too far out of Daryl Dixon mode (even his hair remains the same). Rather than a strikingly different character from the one we all know on TWD, we just get a Daryl who thinks less and talks more. Djimon Hounsou did a fine job as the counterpoint character. The soundtrack is decent, ranging from almost retro (reminiscent of Tangerine Dream) to more traditional and contemporary sci-fi incidental noise.Final thoughts: Sadly, Air doesn't break new ground. It may be worth seeing if [1] you are head over heels for Reedus, or/and [2] you're a diehard sci-fi fan, and/or [3] you have a post-apocalyptic fetish.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32K6O8X4VA01Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013PUVN5C#wasThisHelpful","R32K6O8X4VA01Z","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes I miss the LES, so I'm always up for watching films purportedly shot there, and I also favor movies in the vein [excuse the pun] of Drugstore Cowboy, so was hoping Straight Outta Tompkins (SOT) would fit the bill in that respect too. After watching it on DVD, I'm still on the fence as to whether it was a waste of time.A guy named Zephyr Benson was the screenwriter, director, producer, and [you guessed it] the lead role. Ambitious is certainly a word that applies here, yet I can't help but wonder if narcissistic is another. Control freak, maybe? With a reported $160k budget, he probably didn't have much choice in how many hats he needed to wear for getting SOT done.Whatever the case, I've seen this done before, as with Noel Clarke's Adulthood (Noel was writer, director, and lead). Whereas Adulthood is a winner, the intent of SOT will be lost on many. Dark comedy? Just Say No To Drugs? One can't take it too seriously since the drug use in SOT is so over the top. Some provocative social commentary in the first 5 minutes is followed by some edgy Half Bakedesque material, which leads to a heavy-handed downward spiral into white powders and violence for the final hour.The cinematography (by Brandon Roots) is unmistakably killer, and the video quality (for a DVD) is excellent.The acting is very hit or miss; one bright spot is newcomer Jon McCormick as Sam (newcomer to film, it looks like he's done stage acting). Whoopi Goldberg makes a cameo for a couple minutes, but other than that you won't recognize faces.Rating SOT at 3 stars may be charitable, but given that it was done on a shoestring budget in a very expensive city, Zephyr deserves some slack.Final Verdict: Not bad as a dark comedy, but I suspect it was intended as a drama.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKLDXIHGINOIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U4P6FXW#wasThisHelpful","RKLDXIHGINOIJ","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another top notch production from the Nordic Noir label, on par with Bron/Broen (The Bridge). In contrast to The Bridge, The Killing excels at casting doubt on nearly every character introduced, to the point where the only person you are sure didn't commit the murder is Sarah Lund, the protagonist.Bemusement reigns over not only the murder, but also other plotlines like the source of leaks in a political party (season 1). Starring Sofie Gråbøl, the acting is to be commended for nearly everyone involved. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic; less gritty than Bron/Broen, but capturing more color, vitality, and emotion.I had no idea there was an American remake of this series until just now when I read another review posted here. I can't imagine it being better than the original, but since ""for some reason [Americans] cannot read subtitles, or they don't want to"" (not my words, but Sofie Gråbøl's), it exists if you really can't abide subtitles.My only complaint about Forbrydelsen, and it is extremely minor: episodes begin with a recap lasting ~2.5 minutes. Do Danes have poor memories?This box set of prototypical Danish programming is highly recommended, and it's as good a place to start as any if you are new to Nordic Noir serials.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NSQMTEJELO5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYTDWMG#wasThisHelpful","R3NSQMTEJELO5S","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bright and colorful, yet compact.In the past I tried to induce a pleasant purple aura into my living space by installing Computer Case Cooling Fans into one of my PCs, but while they looked okay, they were noisy.With these light-emitting diodes from Niutop, I now have an ethereal purple emanating from 180 tiny points of light.I was surprised when these arrived, because after opening the package I found that the coiled string of LEDs fit into the palm of my hand. Don't let size fool you though: these are potent and brilliant, casting a beautiful purple haze onto the wall (not overpowering, but brighter than the pictures here lead you to believe).The winding silver wire that links the LEDs ranges from nearly invisible to pleasantly illuminated, depending on how you use the string (you should experiment a little to find the right configuration for your needs).A nice feature is the detachable power supply unit (you may not consider it a benefit until you find out that it is).Every night is a party at my house thanks to these LEDs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TWRW3Z9X45SG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOONFU6#wasThisHelpful","R2TWRW3Z9X45SG","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the English-subtitled version of Real Humans, the show that started it all and has been sold to numerous countries for remakes (such as Channel 4/AMC's Humans). A reminder that this set was pressed in Region 4 format, so plan accordingly.Here's a quick comparison of Real Humans versus Humans. In Real Humans:🎭 The androids and known as Hubots rather than Synths.🎭 More information is revealed to the audience up front; for example, the exact nature of the relationship between ""Anita"" and Leo remains undefined for most of the season in Humans. If you like mystery, watch Humans prior to watching Real Humans.🎭 The tone is both darker and (paradoxically) more humorous. Not only a bloody season premier, but a greater sense of urgency and an ""us against them"" mentality. An example of the humor is when David Eischer's android children walk into an abandoned church for refuge and one of them, aghast upon seeing Jesus on the crucifix (for the first time), exclaims ""Disgusting!""🎭 Niska is the undisputed leader of free androids (when Leo isn't around). While Niska in Humans has a fierce streak that we occasionally see, Niska in Real Humans is a robot you do not want to mess with.🎭 The philosophical points are more readily expressed, such as Inger (Laura in Humans) expressing herself to and about Anita; additionally, Hubots replacing humans (in companionship, in the workforce) is more front and center.So which is better, Real Humans or Humans? That is almost impossible to answer, because depending on which one you watch first, the other will probably seem flawed (The same dilemma as happened with Being Human and Being Human). The British production is a bit more polished than the Swedish one, yet each has details lacking in the other (i.e., watch both!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KTIUN5LZCA54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZSLDO4#wasThisHelpful","R3KTIUN5LZCA54","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"🏰 2 things before getting down to business:1. For the love of whatever deity or demigod you align yourself with, don't rate a movie at 1 star because you failed to read the item description. When you purchase imported movies like this one, make sure beforehand that your equipment will play discs with the region code noted in the description... it's not rocket science.2. Disclaimer: I haven't played D&D since the 1980s (yeah, I am old... although I prefer the term OG), so can't vouch for the movie's authenticity in conforming to current D&D rules and pantheon. A bag of holding is used by the hero; while other references to the game were mostly lost on me, there apparently are plenty of nods to the true campaigner.🏰 Now, the Pros and Cons if you are considering this purchase:Lawful Good (PROs)✔ Although not issued on Blu-ray, this is no reason to despair: The transfer to DVD is excellent.✔ While at times the movie feels homemade, the actors are at least actual actors... far from Game of Thrones quality, but acceptable.✔ Characters: all but one of the characters in the adventuring party are evil, which distinguishes this movie from Dungeons and Dragons 2: Wrath Of The Dragon God. The Vermin Lord is particularly well done, yet each in the party has personality, so to speak.✔ Plenty of eye candy, whatever your tastes: a chiseled, devastatingly handsome Paladin (Grayson) who likes to take off his shirt, and the obligatory ravishing female protagonist (a Shadar-Kai witch named Akordia), who in this case is leading the party (due to her badassness).Lawful Evil (CONs)✘ The plot was nothing mind-bending; at least we get a sexual tension dynamic between Grayson and Akordia (good boy meets bad girl), which keeps D&D3 from simply repeating the plot of D&D2 (but which makes it more like West Side Story).✘ Maybe I expect too much, but the ending was anticlimactic... nor did it set the stage for a sequel, which I surely would watch if Eleanor Gecks were to reprise her role as Akordia.✘ When you watch Game of Thrones, you don't find yourself seeing objects as props, or places as sets. The same can't always be said here. Not surprising since HBO throws $6M (average) at *each* episode of GoT and focuses on producing exquisite sets for the show. You really notice the difference when you see productions which aren't as well-funded and don't procure the talent.🏰 This movie can be watched on YouTube if you don't mind lousy picture quality (and probably commercials).Final thoughts: Is it unusual for a Lawful Good character band up with a party of Chaotic and Lawful Evil adventurers as a means to an end? I'll let someone who knows the rules answer since I haven't played the game for three decades.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NN2LEMVFN9WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008GFZX0I#wasThisHelpful","R1NN2LEMVFN9WF","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"News Flash: any food or drink can be toxic... it depends on how much you consume. Case in point: Water, overconsumption of which can kill you via electrolyte disruption. As another reviewer already pointed out, ""can"" is the operative word in this book. You ""can"" be killed by lightning when you leave the house during an electrical storm. That is good to know, but it is more useful to know your chances of being killed by lightning. Substances you choose to put into your body ""can"" do all kinds of things. Will they? That's what Marina Kushner fails to adequately address. She does explain the how, what, and why, but there are way too many leaps in logic and theoretical scenarios (I say this as a scientist).I consume 2 shots of espresso daily; my dose of caffeine is static. The problem with any potentially addictive substance is the temptation to increase dosage to compensate for tolerance (this is obviously a trap to avoid).There are maybe 2 reasons to buy this book:1. If you are incapable of drinking in moderation, this might be useful to ""scare yourself straight.""2.

"PROs✔ A tale steeped in inter and intrapersonal conflicts (often borne out of political ones), with a twisty plot tying characters together usually on more than one level. This is a narrative of divided loyalties, which leads to some tricky relationships.✔ Indian Summers does pretty well in transporting you back in time, which is naturally of paramount importance for historical FICTION.✔ The writers don't pull their punches; the disparaging attitude of the Brits towards the Indians is captured unflinchingly.✔ Indian Summers was renewed for a second season, so feel free to get attached to the characters.✔ The actors! The primary reason I bought this as soon as it became available on DVD in the UK is because Jemima West is my favorite actress, and lucky us: she is Alice, sister to the central British character, Ralph (Henry Lloyd-Hughes). I was pleased to meet Amber Rose Revah as Leena Prasad, who is easily more telegenic than 90% of Hollywood's actresses. Plus some handsome fellas, if that's your thing. In contrast to her placement on the cover art, the role of Julie Walters is not front and center, although her character is quite the socialite.✔ Indian Summers is likelier to make you want to crack open a history book to learn more than is Downton Abbey.CONs✘ It was shot in Malaysia, not India. While I didn't mind this commonplace inconsistency (if I had a buck for every production filmed in a location different from the one it portrayed, I'd be able to retire), this choice apparently has garnered wrath in some quarters.📀 I purchased this season on Amazon's UK site, regrettably before I became aware of the Blu-ray release. The picture quality of the UK-released [Region 2] DVD set is disappointing. The US [Region 1] DVD release, which has the PBS ribbon across the top of the cover, is encoded differently than the UK release (it's on 4 discs rather than 3) so *may* have a superior picture. I will probably buy the Blu-ray for a second viewing of the season.📀 From the back cover of the DVD:""The year is 1932, the place is India, and the people are romanticized, politicized, and radicalized. They are drawn together and driven apart by class, race, love and theft, and the world around them is changing. In the small British colony of Simla, placed at the foothills of the Himalayas, the beliefs of the British Empire still remain but the young are hungry for freedom.Indian Summers tells a sweeping saga; stories of love, secrets, promises made and broken, and tensions that simmer in the hot, feverish days and nights of India -- an India populated by freedom fighters, star-crossed lovers, political spies, artists, orphans, expats, the rich and the poor.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG31BYS29PEED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S52M98G#wasThisHelpful","RG31BYS29PEED","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While the pace of Red Knot is fairly glacial [excuse the pun], this intentional cadence was set to match life on the ship and its surroundings. The trailer (as one of the extras on the DVD) suggests that the love triangle is the plot; instead, the captain (Billy Campbell) is more of an incidental rather than a pivotal character. Billy Campbell is one of those actors with a face you'll recognized despite not knowing where you saw it... for me it was The 4400 (as Jordan Collier).As for the other actors, this is a chance for you to see what Vincent Kartheiser is like outside of Mad Men, and Red Knot is as good an introduction to Olivia Thirlby (What Goes Up) as any of the numerous other indie films she's had an important role in.Real-life husband & wife Roger Payne and Lisa Harrow round out the cast. Roger Payne (not an actor, he's instead been in several documentaries) is a famous whale biologist, and snipets of dialogue between him and Vincent Kartheiser are artfully interwoven into the story, giving Red Knot just the slightest residue of a PBS science/ ecology show.The scenes were skillfully edited, strung together creatively but logically. Accorded with a fitting economy of dialogue, words were not said when words were not needed. The composer for the soundtrack hit all the right notes and captured the Antarctic about as well as can be anticipated.PG-13? Not even: the newlywed sex scene is so tame that Red Knot might earn a PG rating from the MPAA (if it were to be rated). That said, the movie isn't for kids (it would bore them).Before ordering I was unhappy that Red Knot isn't offered on Blu-ray, but as it turns out, the transfer to DVD is flawless. As decent as it was, I now feel the need to travel and experience Antarctica firsthand.Extras:Too often, DVD extras are relegated to just the dang movie trailer. Not so here. There are 2 interviews with Scott Cohen (screenwriter/ director/ producer for Red Knot), one with Vincent Kartheiser, and one with composer Garth Stevenson. Although brief, these bonus features are revealing for audiences and filmmakers alike.🚢 Final verdict: this was a successful experiment of putting a small cast and film crew together on a ship at the edge of the world for 23 days and having something come out of it that can be enjoyed by more than just those who participated in the adventure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MU5ES65E639R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NDVK0C#wasThisHelpful","R1MU5ES65E639R","A26F0H4X95PSPN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26F0H4X95PSPN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Simple form and function, yes.Quality we expect from Bose, yes.The great sound we expect from Bose, yes.Turn it on by tapping the button-free top of the radio as you walk by or by using a small remote control, yes.Bluetooth? It is optional and a separate purchase, so out of the box, no. Use a 3.5mm cord (not included) to connect from your device's headphone jack into the radio's auxiliary jack, yes.Two separate alarms with the option to make an irritating noise or automatically turn on the radio for wake-up, yes.Reset time, stations and alarms if the power goes out, no. Because there is an internal battery that will store the information for up to 48 hours.AM/FM radio with six presets for you to choose and scanning, yes.But this is the appreciation worth noting about the AM/FM radio feature: we're using the Bose Wave in a neighborhood location that doesn't get TV signals, even with a big outdoor antenna. We're too far from the transmission towers, with water a few blocks over ""there"" and a mountain range a few miles over ""there"" and ""there."" So no live TV. Based on that and the fact that we barely get radio signals in the car until we're a bit away from the house, I didn't hold out any hope for receiving radio signals IN the house, and just planned to use it as an alarm, of course, but also as speakers for a portable music device (Zune, I'm the one and it still works great).I almost didn't even try to set up the radio, but then thought Review! Must Try For The Review! And I'll be darned. The built-in radio antenna is built right into the power cord. Very tidy in appearance without the extraneous. However there IS a port on the back in case you need to add an external antenna for more radio signal reach.But in our little hole in the woods, surprisingly unnecessary.

"I had one of those flat porcelain graters that you set into a bowl to catch the ginger or that you used to grate directly into the bowl. It was fine, but there were always more gratings in the (tines?) than ever landed into the bowl. Eventually the piece broke. I didn't miss it because I didn't use ginger all that often.These days we use ginger all the time and in lots of recipes, so this sparked my interest. The (tines?) seem larger than what I remember on the flat grater. I don't know if that matters, but it does an excellent job of grating lots of ginger quickly and keeps it all nicely contained instead of splashed all over the counter.I love that it's elegantly and simply styled, but best of all is that I can, for the majority of our recipes, measure the liquids right into the grater, which is about the size of a butter dish, which then lifts the ginger bits up and off the (tines?) for pouring into the recipe.Seems a silly thing, but it works really well.

"Two stars means ""I don't like it.""

"I have a brick of a surge protector on the dresser next to the bed that I use as a charging station, and it's hidden behind some framed photos, and I hate it. This is a lovely replacement!Excellent build quality (I expected flimsy plastic, and am happily surprised that the Mediabridge is not that); sleek, modern, unobtrusive design*; the ability to connect USB cables frontwards or backwards (that is such a design plus!); overload protection whether from heat or surge; adjusts to the needs of your connected device; and by my reckoning, the tablet I charge daily from virtually zero power is back to work about a third faster than usual.I do love this charger, full five stars, although when I wake up at night to the array of blue lights* (which, to be fair, are handy if you're trying to plug something in during the dark hours), I feel it is more intrusive than I'd like and maybe don't love it quite as much.This item was given to me for review and I am grateful for the opportunity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32ECDIE7MN5MA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKGZKHS#wasThisHelpful","R32ECDIE7MN5MA","A1KDQXZHQIG5QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDQXZHQIG5QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like others have pointed out, I don't need a bulky case that holds the device and chargers and extras. I put the charging cables in a small, single-purpose bag when I travel. I just wanted a beautiful, simple, uncluttered design to protect the computer while it's in my backpack. This is a score. The reality is just as elegant in appearance as the photo suggests. And it fits my device snuggly, perfectly. Score!UPDATE November 2015: Traveling by plane earlier this year and was sent into the Extra Inspection line by the TSA. All friendly, small airport, TSA agent just doing his job, security guard nearby.Him: ""You are in this line because you forgot to remove the computer from your backpack.""Me: ""Ach! I haven't flown in awhile, forgot about that.""Him: ""No problem."" (Pulling things out of my backpack, including the laptop.)Also Him: ""Is this a laptop case?""Me: ""Well, yes.""

And under $20, so not expensive, either.""Security guard looks over and chimes in: ""That's a laptop case? It really is a beauty.""They continued to delight over the case for several more minutes.

"We aren't actually alarm clock people because {shudder} what a horrible way to wake up! But for reasons, I lately find that I must be up by a certain time and instead of panicking that I'll oversleep -- because I could -- I thought I'd try this. Light as an alarm. Brilliant!The design of the piece is quite beautiful. The light quality is beautiful (and adjustable if you don't want to awaken with too much light). The instructions are clear for setting it up and setting the sound portion of the alarm (we have the radio set to our local classical station, fairly quiet). There are some built-in sounds, too -- birds chirping and the like -- if you'd rather. The sound portion, like the light, come up slowly instead of shocking one awake.To note, while the design is beautiful, this is a very lightweight piece, very plastic. (I'm not a fan of flimsy.) But if you travel and want to bring it along, it won't add weight to your luggage. I guess that's a positive. And maybe I'm doing something incorrectly, but you're supposed to just tap the top to put the sound into ""snooze"" mode. That doesn't work on mine. I have to just turn the alarm off, which is just as well because no good can come of a snooze.So while the light and alarm work well and it is beautiful (and by the way, the radio's sound quality is quite good), it's a three star for the build quality and inoperable snooze.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGD8645UKMDHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UFNMYN8#wasThisHelpful","RGD8645UKMDHZ","A1KDQXZHQIG5QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDQXZHQIG5QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rearranged a few things in the house, and suddenly found myself in need of a vanity mirror. I was a bit nervous about this because it isn't entirely inexpensive as vanity mirrors go, but it might be cheap.It isn't. Excellent build quality and heft. Clear reflection in the three sizes of mirror surface (just learning that I need to do a much better job on the eyebrows -- yikes! -- and I didn't see that spot on my cheek before...huh) and three levels of light, which at any level is not glaring or uncomfortable to use.

"The good and the bad: These headphones are lightweight, very comfortable (on my head, my ears) and offer really good sound quality. The pads rest on your ears rather than enveloping your ears. And they aren't noise cancelling. But for the price, that's okay. That isn't always needed.The controls are very easy to operate, large  and obvious. Connected to your phone (mine is a Windows-based phone), you can take calls that come in. Handy. Although I'd rather not have ""The Beatles"" interrupted by a phone call, but there it is anyway. The Bluetooth paired quickly with two different devices and operating systems without a problem.I did have a problem when using an older Android phone as a music player. The Bluetooth connection was excellent, steady, but I couldn't lower the volume from the headphones as I could with my newer Windows-based phone, and using the volume control from the Android-based phone itself would only lower so far. Deep in the quiet of the night, the headphone volume was too loud. Something just wasn't communicating correctly between the headphones and the old-model Android (which does have the latest software updates).Also, -- not a deal breaker, but to note -- this is Bluetooth only. You can't physically connect a device to the headphones. Although we are all tired of wires all over the place, some devices that are otherwise perfectly usable don't have Bluetooth. I'd love to use this headset with my early model non-Bluetooth Zune, but no can do.I like the sound quality a lot, though.No ""verified purchase"" as the Aduro SB10 was submitted to me for review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XMOEO1G4ONF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYP53UK#wasThisHelpful","R1XMOEO1G4ONF7","A1KDQXZHQIG5QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDQXZHQIG5QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To note: I hate anything to do with ""floor care"". One day floors will simply take care of themselves and for my part, that day can't come soon enough. Until then, I hunt for the perfect tools to help with ""floor care"". I like this tool. Here's why:It's lightweight, but solidly made.It's cordless (yes, please!) and the battery has it's own compact charger so the Hoover Air doesn't need to be stowed next to an outlet (in our next remodel or move we'll have a utility closet with an outlet, but in the meantime, we don't).It does an excellent job of picking up the dog's hair from the tile and wood floors (which accumulates at an astounding rate; read, I hate anything to do with ""floor care"", why do I even have a dog?*). It does a passable job of picking up said-same dog's hair from the low-pile carpet. No deep cleaning happening.The beater bars (on the full and hand held portions) are removable for easy cleaning. Thank you!Did you catch that? The hand-held portion has its own beater bar accessory. I love that.It swerves and curves about the room easily and comfortably. Finally you can dance with your vacuum cleaner! (You know you want to.)It's bagless because we're well into the new millennium. The collected gunk (dog hair dog hair dog hair) drops into the trash can without having to reach into the container to pull it out. I've had to do that with other bagless vacuum cleaners. I HATE it when that happens.The battery charge lasts long enough. I'm not spending the day vacuuming. I don't need the battery to last all day. The claim is 15 minutes and I vacuumed for 15 minutes, with obvious charge leftover. That's the longest amount of time I'm ever going to spend on vacuuming so that's good enough for me.*Because we love her, that's why.UPDATE: I didn't even notice then when I was using it during the day, but this vacuum cleaner is lighted, which was very handy the night a glass went crashing to the tile floor and spread teeny shards from one end of the room to the other. They shone beautifully, and I believe we snagged every one!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSDRUIRY723TB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWCU1N4#wasThisHelpful","RSDRUIRY723TB","A1KDQXZHQIG5QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDQXZHQIG5QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not an audiophile, me. But to my ear this is a wonderful little speaker with clear sound quality. The Bluetooth connected quickly, easily to my Windows Lumia phone. It also has a 3.5mm audio cable (included) for connecting to a non-Bluetooth device (in my case, a Zune ... yes, I'm the one). Under the smooth top there are the usual lighted icons for controlling your music device -- forward, pause, etc. The device charges by connecting the device to either a computer or a USB wall charger with the included cable.A minor complaint that might just be in my device but not complaint enough to strike a star regards the charging light. It's supposed to be red while charging, blue when finished, so say the instructions. On my Ripple Wireless, red and blue lights flash together and when the speaker is done charging, it just stops blinking, but remains red with a sort of blue halo background. You know, oh well.The device charges in a couple of hours. What surprised me about the Ripple is, not only does it have terrific sound for such a small device, but it just keeps playing and playing and playing. I expected a few hours of play before it ran out of steam. I turned it on at 8a and turned it off at 6.30p because it was time to turn on the news. I'll report back if the energy begins to dwindle down the line, as occasionally happens with rechargeable devices.Poolside, during a lovely bath, or to use on long distance trips since the radios in our cars are really old and not digital-connect friendly, this will be a very useful and compact tool for our musical enjoyment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27XYV4T0A606I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OUEO4BI#wasThisHelpful","R27XYV4T0A606I","A1KDQXZHQIG5QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDQXZHQIG5QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband is a carpenter and a measuring tape is probably his most useful tool and since he took it immediately upon receipt, my review is based on his comments.Two things on this tape measure make it a potential stand-out: first, the accurate view where you can clearly see clearly what the measurement is and second is the graphite feature to automatically mark the spot.He finds the accurate view to be helpful and useful. The graphite marking feature doesn't work, at least not on the one we received.Without that feature, it's just a measuring tape. But it's a very good measuring tape. The tape recoils back into place with a good snap. The numbers are easy to read for someone with aging eyes. It's a good measuring tape.

"If you don't have a sanitizing feature on your full-size machine, this might be worth considering.First, message to Samsung: Marketing this as a Baby Care Washer is fairly narrow thinking. Once the baby is grown, this will continue to be a useful appliance for households where adult incontinence might be a problem or for people who sweat a LOT from working out or just plain working, and who are tired of their otherwise good clothes emanating that funk that develops four minutes after the articles come out of the dryer. It's also an excellent appliance for people who don't want to mix their small loads of bright, nice items with the larger loads of yard-dirty clothes. Stank sneakers, smaller or lightweight dog bedding ... there are many reasons that a smaller, quality, sanitizing appliance is useful.We have a perfectly good washer/dryer that is older and lacks a sanitizing feature. The hot water cycle on our full-size machine only gets as hot as the hot water heater setting (like, about 128-degrees). With some bleach, clothes get clean, but not really, wonderfully clean.We installed the  Samsung Baby Care Washer in the laundry area to share the inflow and outflow with our regular machines. Samsung thoughtfully included everything you'd need to install this alongside your current machines, or to install as a portable appliance in another area of the house. My husband's observation (he, who does this sort of thing) commented that the variety of installation parts were all high-quality. It was connected and ready within about ten minutes after unpacking.For the first load we threw in all the nasty working man socks, several tee shirts, under things (no more than 3.5 lbs) and let it rip on Super Sanitize WITHOUT bleach, of course. The machine makes a peculiar guh-lunking sound as it operates. Not wildly loud, but weird. The Super Sanitize cycle takes (I think I saw this correctly and I've only done one Super Sanitizing load so far) 3 hours. Based on how the outflow drain tube felt, the water was REALLY hot when the machine drained. The clothes came out clean, well rinsed and the spin cycle really wrung them quite dry. It couldn't clean months of dinginess from the clothing, but I noticed that the whites really were whiter (WITHOUT bleach). If you start your run of new working/workout clothes with this machine, I am positive they'll stay newer looking, brighter, way longer.A design flaw? The machine is very well crafted, but the top lid is a lint-attractor, which is bizarre since it goes into a room where lint shows up.We've done several loads (again, just the one Super Sanitize, although all loads resulted in really nice, fresh, clean clothes), and are really liking this machine. Will report back if anything goes horribly wrong, but it's a go.And of the blessings that come from being in the Vine program, this product was a real score and I'm grateful for the opportunity to review this appliance. -- Thank you!UPDATE: Nothing has gone horribly wrong at all. Love this appliance. Just wanted to point out in case you wondered, you might be able to run the Samsung Baby Care washer and your original washer at the same time. I can't promise that will work in your set-up, but it works in ours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R331FE0GK7794M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNNOIQ6#wasThisHelpful","R331FE0GK7794M","A1KDQXZHQIG5QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDQXZHQIG5QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a large yard, a garden, and grandchildren, nieces and nephews who visit, so naturally, we've always kept a Radio Flyer around (the old-fashioned, REAL Radio Flyer -- red and metal). Kept outside, but tipped when not in use so it won't hold water, they have each lasted about ten years of fairly rough use.This wagon, however, we can well imagine will be around for longer than that, easily. Quality construction and materials, a very durable paint job to resist rust, steel wheels ... as we put it together my husband couldn't get over it. ""Look at this ..."" ""Look at that ..."" ""I love the steering mechanism, so simple!""Then we put it outside next to our beloved Radio Flyer and could really see the difference. And when you roll them around the yard, you can even hear and feel the difference in quality.We love our Radio Flyer, but we really love this wagon.What don't we love? Well, the instructions weren't ""Greek"" to us, but it was mildly confusing in a couple of spots where I put something together and then had to take it apart again. Not a big deal, but some people might become frustrated. If you're scent-sensitive, maybe open the box outside and let it air out before diving in because WOW, that was some kind of chemical stink emanating off the tires. It dissipates, but it is thoroughly unpleasant before it does. What won't last? The wood sides. They're like balsa wood. But the way we use the wagon, we don't care. And finally, while I put it together, my husband (strong man) needed to tighten everything down.Let me note, one reviewer (maybe more, I only saw one) commented that the plastic hand grip felt cheap compared to the rest of the wagon. Plastic is cheap, of course, but when truly carting stuff around the yard or when the kids pile in and pull the full wagon hither and yon, the metal handle on the Radio Flyer can dig into one's palms. The plastic grip is a thoughtful detail, and except for the plastic wheel caps and a ball in the steering mechanism, I believe it's the only other plastic on the wagon.At the time of this writing, the wagon isn't even available at Amazon, so I don't know what this costs. I couldn't even find it in the Ertl John Deere catalogue. But if you ever come across it, this wagon is a big recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNPCXHHHYINRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPJOHBK#wasThisHelpful","RNPCXHHHYINRJ","A1KDQXZHQIG5QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDQXZHQIG5QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Excellent sound and I tested these headphones against classical and rock music, and videos that were all talk or talk with music in the background. The quality is well-balanced and clear, and made for very comfortable listening.The design is certainly different. The flat wires are a little more bulky than we're probably accustomed to seeing. They're wide like a full sized rubber band. This does keep the wires from tangling up as ordinary wired headphones are prone to doing. Once in place (over the back of your ears and then insert), they stay in place, is my experience, although also in my experience, it takes a moment to get the wires in the right place to stay over and behind my ears. (Maybe my ears are too small...?)I like the wide choice of buds included in the package. Not only different sizes, but different styles so you will find whatever suits you best. And I like the storage case, also included, to keep everything tidy and together, which I appreciate when traveling.The Brainwavz S1 was presented for review, but at this price point, for quality, comfort and customization, I think it's a go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZEQOSXJWJY98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4UQ6U8#wasThisHelpful","R2ZEQOSXJWJY98","A1KDQXZHQIG5QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDQXZHQIG5QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product was in ""pre-order"" mode at Amazon for too long, so I ended up getting it directly from Microsoft. This isn't a verified purchase.I wanted a media device to replace my (well loved, much used) Kindle 8.9 HD, but with a modern Windows environment that would synch to my laptop and cell phone.Kindles are excellent, but limited. With the ThinkPad 8 Touchscreen, I have all the web surfing and media consumption capabilities we expect of a laptop (including the Kindle app for books), but that's comfortable to hold in one hand (while lounging on the couch!).If there isn't an app for it, I can pin my favorite websites to the tile screen, making the device customizable in a way that Kindle could never be.Any business I might do would be through a word processor and Kindle was really lame at that. I can easily use MS Word 365 on this tablet and print and whatever else, but that's what my laptop is for and so I don't. But I could, is important to note.I cuddle up with the ThinkPad and scour the latest from News Bento, watch YouTube videos, catch up on FB, see the family pics on Instagram, browse Pinterest, check trivia on IMDB and watch Netflix or HuluPlus (or Amazon videos -- pin to start!), add to the grocery list in OneNote, which will appear as if by magic (!) on the phone when I hit the store, read my favorite magazines thanks to Next Issue, fuss with my collection of phone photos that are handily saved in the cloud, and that includes editing with Adobe Photoshop Express, and comfortably Skype with friends and family, far and wide. And more! But I don't have all day.It costs less than the comparable 64gb latest generation Kindle 8.9 HDX ($440 at the time of this writing) and the iPad Mini ($600, and I'm sure retina display is swell, but it's not THAT much better). That's a win. A complaint? I wish it had an ordinary charging connection instead of something proprietary. It just makes for one more thing when traveling.That aside and to wrap up, the ThinkPad 8 has terrific resolution, is really fast, reliable, light, the right size and just exactly what I wanted when I replaced my last generation Kindle. I love it.UPDATE February 2015: Thanks to a sharp-eyed consumer who called me out on an error, I need to adjust this review regarding the ""proprietary"" charging cord and port that I mentioned in my original comments. With a closer look, the cord and the charging port on the device are both the current and older mini USB connections side-by-side. That's the cord and charging port, both. But you can stick a newer mini-USB version cord (like what comes with most smartphones, etc) just into that side of the port and it also charges. Or an older mini-USB version cord into the other slot. I never realized that and will adjust my review accordingly.UPDATE March 2015: I have now charged the Lenovo tablet a couple of times with the standard micro-USB connection instead of the proprietary connection that comes with the device and it is slow-slow. Slow. Really slow.

"I like this printer as I've liked all Epson printers. I have always found them very easy to set up with my PC and (now) devices (hold that thought). They always make quality prints. The cost of operation is manageable.This is a very large machine as compared to others. I'm a bit of a weakling, true, so I needed help putting the printer into position. I was able to easily set up the wireless connection. I can't speak to the FAX abilities since that feature isn't connected at this time, but the dialogue box on the printer's panel is straight forward and intuitive.Here's the holdup: I am now 65% into a driver download from Epson that still has half an hour to go over a high speed internet connection onto a zippy PC, so that I can have the proper dialogue box appear when I go to print. Without that driver, the dialogue is very basic: letter size paper, plain or glossy; 4x6 plain or glossy. That's pretty much it. All of my other Epsons featured the option of choosing plain paper in a variety of sizes up to choosing art quality photo paper in a variety of sizes and to print draft up through best, with several quality steps in between, no matter if I was using word processing or graphics design software.If I was on a slower speed internet connection, this would be intolerable. I don't understand that part. I'm sure it will all shake out in the end. I'll report back one way or another.Also worth noting, I've come to expect Epson printers to include a CD-DVD printing capability. This machine, for all its heft, bells and whistles, does not include that feature. They don't claim to, either, but some people might ""assume"", so I thought it worth mentioning.The color 4x6 prints I made were striking. The color output on plain paper has been perfect. The machine prints quickly and quietly. And I am delighted to now have the ability to make 13x19 prints! It's a go.UPDATE: Well this is unfortunate. I was able (in two tries) to get the drivers and firmware updated, so I now have a good-and-proper dialogue box in all of the programs that I use for printing (I have Windows 8.1, also up to date, by the way). Perfect. Except.Although I was able to print before the updates from any program, Adobe Photoshop (latest version) now crashes whenever I select print. It worked before the updates, now it doesn't. I'm sure this will shake out soon, or maybe I'll have to spend hours screwing around with it and everything will eventually work out. But in the meantime, Photoshop isn't exactly an obscure program and this shouldn't be a problem. But it is. (sigh) The good news is, files print beautifully from Adobe Lightroom, so there's that, then.ANOTHER UPDATE (FINAL, June 30th): ...and so to correct this problem, I simply uninstalled the WF-7610 from my computer and then reinstalled it. Why it didn't work out of the box, I don't know, but it works now in all of my software with the proper options and dialogue box. All that aside, it does make beautiful prints.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UAEQHSCE8WVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGETI#wasThisHelpful","R3UAEQHSCE8WVG","A1KDQXZHQIG5QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDQXZHQIG5QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like cream shampoos. They harken back, which is sometimes nice, but also a container of cream shampoo tends to go further than a container of liquid shampoo. I landed on this and decided to try it.What I wasn't expecting was that my hair would feel so wonderfully soft and full after the first wash! It lathered beautifully with just a dab of shampoo, rinsed easily and without being fly-away or unmanageable at all, my hair is really so soft. I'm kinda stunned. (As I always do, I rubbed actual coconut oil on my hands and then ran my hands through my hair before blow-drying. But I've always done that. My hair has never felt this good so it isn't because of the light coconut oil finish.)This cream doesn't really smell anything like coconut oil, but more like a clean baby -- I don't know why.To note -- at the time I ordered this I didn't realize it was coming from a company in the UK, where I'm not. They delivered in a timely manner, given that the package was sailing across a very large pond, but I'll look for this product from a US distributor the next time I order.Although.

"We have a Wii console in a far corner of the house that couldn't play stream video from the internet because between the TV cabinet and the two concrete walls, the signal just didn't reach. Too bad for the kids.This actually was fairly easy to set up. I physically connected the main household computer to the Trek with an Ethernet cord, plugged the Trek into the wall and powered it to ""wireless."" After a moment a website appeared. I entered the information about the household router, applied the information, entered the required sign-in and it was done. I unplugged the Ethernet from the laptop and Trek.

"If you want to protect your phone against drops, bumps, dings, and scratches, and you don't mind the added bulk and lack of ""sexiness"" then this case is for you.  I like that it comes with a belt holster; the case snaps into the belt holster, and the holder can rotate to horizontal or vertical position.This case is good for:-protection against bumps, scrapes, and small drops (ie. from pocket or table top)-screen protection (built-in to case)-minor moisture exposureThis case is not good for:-style points; this case is build for function (protection) rather than looks (it looks rugged)-keeping a slender profile; this case bulks up your phone about 3x in thickness-charging stands; I have the Belkin MIXIT Charge and Sync Dock and this case prevents the iPhone 6+ from connecting to the lightning connector.-use with an armband carrier like the Tune Belt Armband for iPhone 6 Plus; it is a really tight fit, but it requires some effort, and the double screen protector (one for the case, one for the armband) reduces screen sensitivity to touchIf you are more into the sleek and slender look that matches your iPhone 6+ and don't care much about protection functionality, then skip this case.

"I like everything about this planner.I like the smaller size.  At 5.38 in. x 8.5 in. page size this is a nice size to keep on my desk, or if necessary to carry around.  It takes up less desktop real estate.  I like the textured pewter colored casebound cover.  I like the 13-month date range (Jan '16-Jan '17) so I have a month overlap.  I carry this in my every day messenger bag to get a feel of it; it fits easily and is easy to remove from and replace in the bag.  I can't wait to start using it this January.The Weekly Planning layout gives a week's view per two page spread, and features a column-style layout.  There is one vertical column for each day, and includes ruled lines to jot down meetings and to-do's.  There is also a quad ruled, graphed section that runs across the bottom of the two page spread for additional notes and reminders.With the Monthly Planning, you can keep track of upcoming events and deadlines. It covers 13 months from January 2016 - January 2017 and is tabbed for easy navigation. One month per two page spread features open, unruled daily blocks so you can clearly mark key dates. A quad ruled graphed column also runs along the right side of each month for additional notes.The only flaw I see is the relatively ""weak"" cover.  It is essentially a textured cardboard that may be tested by constant and/or consistent store-and-carry in a bag.  I would probably replace this with a more durable plasticky cover, but not necessary.RecommendedRecommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FM3LPW0W6KYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9UTYUU#wasThisHelpful","R3FM3LPW0W6KYK","A3EZEP0FX5BC1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZEP0FX5BC1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned this Victorinox Jetsetter tool for a few years (a gift for my birthday).  I like having a small multi-tool at all times.  I use the scissors to cut paper, tags, plastic wraps, etc.  It has some useful tools:  a magnetic phillips screwdriver tip, cap lifter/bottle opener and wire stipper.It also has a small scissors, key ring, tweezers and toothpick.  I've used all the accessories at one time or another.  And it is small enough that it barely adds weight to my keys.  I highly recommend this blade-less multi-tool.When I fly, I usually keep this in my carry-on and I have had no issues flying over the past few years.  Many TSA agents were surprised by a multi-tool not having a blade.  I've flown through SFO, OAK, EWR, DCA, ORD, LAX, SEA and many other airports without any problems.  Until recently.This was confiscated by TSA from my carry-on bag on a recent flight out of Phoenix Sky Harbor.  I was told that TSA no longer allows Swiss Army knives past screening since 2013.  I knew that, and that is why I fly with this Jetsetter (which has no blade).  The three TSA agents I was dealing with at Phoenix Sky Harbor airport somehow could not grock the idea of a swiss army knife with no knife.  I explained that it does not have a blade, but they did not believe me (or did not care to).  I asked them to open the accessories, but they would not.  I asked for the supervisor, who came by but pretty much sided with his agents.  They explained that scissors are not allowed, but I know that scissors less than 4 inches from the fulcrum are allowed, as per TSA website.  This whole time, I was jovial and friendly with the agents, and not once did I raise my voice or seem frustrated.Finally I asked them if I can show them, and they reacted as if I was a threat.  They said I had to either voluntarily surrender this utility tool, or I can go back to the check-in desk and check in this knife in a bag (and pay a checked bag fee of $35).  So I told the guy to keep it as an early Christmas present from me, but they did not appreciate the comment.  Their response was that these are discarded or thrown away, and not kept for possession or auction (b.s.).As a multi-tool, I like the minimal blade-less set for travelling.  I usually cycle among my blade collection for EDC, which include a Benchmade Mini-Griptillian, a SOG Mini Vulcan, and a Kershaw Blur S30V and I keep these in my check-in bag when I fly.  Thankfully I have another Jetsetter so I am complete again.  To save from future headache, I will not carry this on my carry-on and just check it in.  I still don't get it, but I suppose it all depends on the airport and TSA agents.  Hopefully it is merely a one-time thing.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8V7VP0DFY68W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00932EPYI#wasThisHelpful","R8V7VP0DFY68W","A3EZEP0FX5BC1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZEP0FX5BC1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received the Large (16 oz) gloves in Red and Black.  First impression was how snug the fit is (without wraps) so I was worried at first.  I have been using these almost daily on a Ringside 100 lb heavy bag, and although it got a little roomier it is still a snug fit.  This is good for me, because I don't like my hand sliding around inside gloves when I work on the heavy bag.  Once broken in (after a month) these are now my favorite bag gloves (edging out my Title bag gloves I've used the past 2+ years).I fit the Large (I have 9.25"" hands below the knuckles), but these initially did not fit my wrapped hand, especially the Ringside Gel Shock handwraps and most of my 120"" wraps.  These gloves initially did not fit I use the Hayabusa wraps or the Title Boxing Fist Guards but I can use the thinner gauze wraps.  Over time, the inside opened up and I am now able to use the 120"" wraps.  I still can't use the fist guards, or any gel guards with the full wraps.  For now, I just tap up my hand before I wrap, and these gloves are a perfect fit.Pros:-The ""D-ring"" in the hook & loop wrist closure makes it easier to self-secure the wrist tightly-Soft leather cover-Thumb attachement-Fits my hand comfortably (when unwrapped)-Palm ventilation is decent, though not the best-IMF foam technology makes for a snug fitCons:-Lining is not as comfortable/soft as my other gloves-Tight fit.Very nice bag glove with wrist and fist support.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDZIZW7VHJHY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NVUZUQ#wasThisHelpful","RDZIZW7VHJHY4","A3EZEP0FX5BC1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZEP0FX5BC1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Decent buds. The sound is not the greatest, but good enough.  I've tried to break these in for a week, but the sound did not improve.  Noise isolation is good enough for me.  Not the best, but good enough.  For budget inner ear buds, the Ultimate Ears 200 works better in noise isolation and sound.  If you don't mind spending more, the Klipsch Image X10i or Shure SE535-V are significantly better.  There are three sets of earpads (S/M/L) included for a more custom, comfortable fit.The mic is good enough for voice calls.As significant downside is the severe ""microphonics.""  Which means that when I move and the cord rubs against my shirt/jacket/anything the sound (cord noise) transfers to the earbuds.Overall, these are decent earbuds if you can grab them for less than ten dollars.

"This Remington PF7200 electric shaver is decent.  It shaves close, is comfortable to use, easy to clean, relatively easy to charge, and portable.  It has a 30 min charge time, 30 min run time from a single charge, two flexible foils with stainless steel blades for a close and comfortable shave, and pop-up trimmer.  However, it is not as good as my Remington F7800  which has a charging base station, digital battery life indicator, washable head, and 5-minutes quick charge, or even the or even the Remington F7400 which has a pivot-and-flex head.  Like the F7400, what I do not like is that I don't know how much charge is left in the battery.  It just starts flashing when it needs to be charged, which I suppose is good enough, but there are electric shavers that display approximately how much power is left.  Unlike the PF7400, this shaver does not shave as close as I would like.  This electric shaver is decent enough, but it does not shave close enough and often I have to shave the same area twice as much to get a decent shave with this one.  The trimmer is a nice feature, which I use to shape my sideburns.If all I had was this Remington PF7200, I would be quite happy with its performance and give it 5-stars.  Having used other (and better) shavers, I cannot give this shaver 5 stars.Product Info:Flex Foil Technology - Foils are spaced apart so that the first foil trims hair closely, then gently stretches the skin so that the second foil can get even closer.Surgical Stainless Steel Blades - Shave quickly and cleanly with the sharp, long-lasting blades housed beneath two durable foils.Pop-Up Detail Trimmer - Trim your beard and side burns for a clean-cut look.Other shortcomings:Not as quiet as the PF7400Not Washable (like the PF7400)Not as close a shave as the PF7400","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU8FQJU8MOIAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0X2T9C#wasThisHelpful","RU8FQJU8MOIAJ","A3EZEP0FX5BC1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZEP0FX5BC1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used this on an iPad 2, iPad 4, iPad Air.  This case accomodates these full size iPads.  My iPad mini does not fit the case (as expected) since its size is too small for the holders.  I've had many Belkin cases and have been happy with most of them, and this one does not disappoint.What I am impressed with the most is the battery life.  I charged this the first day I got it, and have been using it for almost a month now without needing a recharge.  I don't think this will last 6 months of continuous use.  The description says the battery will stay charged for over 6 months, but I think they are talking about how long the battery can keep its charge without use.  I will update this section in 6 months.Pros:-Nice and clean look-Fits all full size iPads-Keyboard is easy to charge, pair, and use-Flap in the back folds down for camera use, and accomodates iPad and Samsung camera locations without removing case-Long-lasting battery life.Cons:-Vertical viewing (tablet mode) is not easily accomodated by case/keyboard.  The keyboard is exposed in the back if the tablet is not taken off.  Otherwise, it will have to be taken off.Overall, a clean and functional keyboard case.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U9MHA2T37OSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y3DLTF0#wasThisHelpful","R3U9MHA2T37OSJ","A3EZEP0FX5BC1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZEP0FX5BC1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This works great in deep clear waters.  It is rated to 150m dive depth.  I was pleasantly surprised with this flashlight's brightness.  When you pick it up, you can feel how beefy it is.Pros:-This is bright!!!  It's nice to have three ON settings (Full, 2/3 power, 1/3 power)-Solid build.  It's hefty, and you know it's there-Comes with solid carry case-Button to cycle to ON (Hi/Med/Low) and OFF; I like this better than rotary on/off switch-Constant brightness.  However, this may be a good or bad thing.Cons:-Problems with O-ring not properly seating between body and head/light portion; that seals the battery in the compartment-Single o-ring; my LX20 has a double o-ring seal-High cost, but cheaper than my go-to dive torch LX20There is a smaller and cheaper 700 Lumen LED version from Phantom Aquatics.What comes in the box:-plastic carry case that holds everything-flashlight-sealed batteries-charger and power cable-loop strap to tether onto wrist-hand strap for hands-free use (therefore frees up hand)I have yet to use up the battery, so I will update with this info at a later time.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M9QRXT1UE17K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQ4KCUG#wasThisHelpful","R3M9QRXT1UE17K","A3EZEP0FX5BC1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZEP0FX5BC1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Installation was straight-forward.  I wired it for separate switches to control the light and fan.  I may change out the lights with LED ones in the future, but for now I am using incandescent light bulbs.Pros:-The reversible switch for the fan.  In warm weather, run the fan counterclockwise to stay cooler. In the winter, run it clockwise to recirculate warm air from the ceiling, eliminating cold spots and drafts.Cons:-No remote.

"This SDXC card works well, and is an upgraded version of the PNY Elite Performance 64GB SDXC Class 10 U1 which maxes out at 90MB/s (on paper).  This U-3 card provides transfer speeds up to 95MB/s.  In either benchmark tests or practical applications, I did not see any performance difference between this U3 card -vs- the previous U1 version.  I did not encounter any issues with this card in any DSLR, point-and-shoot, or digital camcorders.Compared to the SanDisk Extreme PRO 64GB U3 this PNY 64GB U3 is slower on benchmark tests and in practical use on a DSLR (using a Nikon D7000 and D5100).  But at half the price of the SanDisk Extreme PRO, this SDXC card is good enough for most consumers.DSLR:These are the numbers on a D7000:-JPEG (Fine): 6 fps for 21 frames, then 2 frames at ~3fps captured every second (approx) up to 100 frames total.-JPEG (Normal): 6fps for 31 frames, then 4 frames at ~4fps (sometimes sped up to ~5fps) up to 100 frames.-RAW: 6 fps for 10-12 frames, then 2 frames at 2fps captured every 2-3 seconds.-RAW+ JPEG (Fine): 6 fps for 10 frames, then around a frame every 2 seconds.These were almost identical to the PNY Elite 64GB U1 version.BENCHMARK:Using Disk Speed Test, I got the following average numbers out of three tests (Updated 2015-06-26):Read - 86MB/sWrite - 52MB/sThese numbers are similar to the older U1 version (Read 86MB/s, Write 51MB/s), tests were performed sequentially (U1 then U3, repeated three times) on a MBP.  However, compared to the SanDisk Extreme PRO 64GB (90MB/s Read and 82MB/s Write) this PNY Elite Performance has slightly slower Read (5% slower), and significantly slower Write speeds (~40% slower).  This is only relevant if, for example, you use a DSLR and shoot in burst mode that often fills the camera buffer (ie. Wedding, Sports, Events photography).  For me, this PNY is sufficient.At the cost of about half the cost of PRO cards like the SanDisk Extreme PRO 64GB, this 64GB SDXC card has excellent performance for the price point.Highly recommended.  Deserves the 5-star rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TY4HH9KQLB2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWBCSG4#wasThisHelpful","R3TY4HH9KQLB2V","A3EZEP0FX5BC1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZEP0FX5BC1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great set.  Comes with mesh bag for easy transport.  I used this on a recent trip to Cabo San Jose.Fins:I use the fins with Tilos Neoprene Fin Socks, which help keep these foot-pocket fins from falling off (not necessary, but it helps me).  The fins have a quick-release strap system, so the fins are easy to get on and off your feet.  The angle of blade is optimized for ""maximum thrust with minimal effort.""Mask:This is a very good mask, and fits my face well.  It is easy to clear, and provides a surprisingly wide field of vision, due to the beveled sides (ie. Patented single-lens design with seamless side window for a panoramic field of vision).  It also has an adjustable head strap with quick-release buckles.  It is soft and wide so it doesn't twist as easily when putting on, and flexible/stretchy enough to put on and off.  It has double-sealed silicone skirt for fit and comfort.Snorkel:Large exhaust and purge valve at bottom for easy water clearing.  Specialized dry top prevents water from entering snorkel even if submerged (this is quite accurate).  One of the best snorkels I have used!  It clears in a small breath, is comfortable to use, and water does not get in my mouth from wave splashes.  I haven't used it to free dive so can't comment on it.Not the best I've used, but definitely a very good set for snorkeling.  I still prefer the Cressi Frog Plus Fins, Mask, Snorkel Set, which cost twice as much as this Phantom Aquatics set.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C9S3MBHV3RB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YLE3GMA#wasThisHelpful","R1C9S3MBHV3RB","A3EZEP0FX5BC1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZEP0FX5BC1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These pens are great for everyday use.  This will work well for note-taking, making lists, or just doodling around.  The rubber grip makes writing comfortable.  The retractable tip is great for storing the pens, so that it doesn't accidentally write on your clothes, notebook, etc.Eight colors:  Four standard colors (Black, Blue, Green, Red) and four brighter/lighter colors (Aqua*, Mint Green*, Hot Pink*, Purple)Don't expect these to replace a Mont Blanc or a S.T. Dupont or even a Cross Pen and you'll have fun with these pens.  I wouldn't use these to write checks, since I would prefer to use pens with special ink like the uni-ball 207 Pens.For me, the only thing to worry about with these pens is when they start growing legs.

"This square pan has a solid build, and you can tell when you pick it up.  It is heavier than the non-professional version of this pan.  The 9x9 dimension is for the top lip.

"Pros:-Arkon mounts are excellent, and this one is no exception-Easy to mount the phone onto this holder-Strong suction for mounting onto glass or supplied mounting plate-Works well with an iPhone 4S/5S/6 in their respective casesCons:-Max supported weight is 6.3 oz; this is barely enough for the iPhone 6 Plus (6.0 oz) and Note 4 (6.2 oz), and not enough for Nexus 6 (6.5 oz), and these are weights without a case-Comes with only two plates (round and rectangle), and as of this review there are no spare plates available for saleThis is decent if you just want to mount your phone and do not plan on touching the screen much.  For example, you can set up your favorite mapping app and then mount it.  It is not good if you are, for example, constantly changing the songs on your phone's playlist and have to touch the screen a lot.  The phone will come off the mount.Otherwise, this is a decent mount.  Easy to to install and easy to use.  The Cons were significant enough to keep me from giving this a 5-star review.

"This review is for the iPhone 6 case.This case is made of a nice leather material.  I like the bright yellow color of the ""Sun Ray"", but it also shows the dirt more easily.  The brown ""Mud Slide"" is more muted, and does not show the dirt as easily as the yellow case.This case provides a degree of protection from scratches, dents, scuffs, and dirt.  However, it will not protect from significant drops and dings.  If you need a more rugged and tough case, I recommend the LifeProof Fre Series case, which is water proof, dirt proof, shock proof, and snow proof.  But at 70 dollar pricepoint, you also pay a premium for the protection.This product has a slim profile (it doesn't add much weight or bulk) while maintaining functionality (buttons and ports are easily accessible) and improving grip.  What is unique about each ullu is that each case is handcrafted by a single artisan from the first cut to the final stitch!It also comes with a screen protector that you apply yourself.  It can certainly help with protecting the screen from minor scratches, but I don't like screen protectors.If you accept that this is just a phone cover and not a protective case, then this is the product for you.  It will save the back of your phone from minor scratches and dings.

"Good quality material.  It is durable enough to handle the exercises designed for it, yet soft enough to create the instability needed to challenge your balance.  In addition to a balance pad, I've used it to as knee, elbow, and butt support for various floor stretches and exercises.  It is small enough to be tucked away behind the TV console, and does not take up too much space in the living room for the exercises.Two negatives are the size the the price.  It is not wide enough for normal push-ups, but good enough for diamond push-ups.  And it costs at least twice the amount as other similar balance pads.

"I like the smaller sized backpacks for everyday use.  I don't like them too big or bulky, only becausethey tend to get filled up with unnecessary things and weighs the bag down, and it is a lot easier to navigate downtown SF with a smaller pack.

If anyone needs to use a capo, I loan out my Kyser Capo.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EXYAEHK4E3JL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTSM8FW#wasThisHelpful","R2EXYAEHK4E3JL","A3EZEP0FX5BC1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZEP0FX5BC1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used cycled this drive as one of my backup drives for work.  It works decent enough, and I like the slim feature.5400rpm HDUSB 3.0, backwards compatible with USB 2.0 and 1.0HD Tune specs:USB 3.0 - Average Read/Write speeds 89/85 MBps (limited by HD speed)USB 2.0 - Average Read/Write speeds 28/22 MBps (limited by USB2.0 speed)The backup software is decent.  However, I use a script in windows for my backups, which I've been using since the XP days.  I modify the script as needed, and I have yet to encounter any problems with it.  Basically, I backup to two separate portable hard drives (including this one), and I bring one home and I lock the other one in my desk.  In the month I've been using this drive, I have not encountered any issues.On my first backup attempt, about 580 GB of data of various file types and sizes took about 3.5 hours to copy onto this drive using a USB 3.0 connection.  The average data transfer speed was 45 MB/s.  It took about 5 minutes longer to copy onto this external drive than copying the same folder from one internal SATA HD onto another internal SATA HD.  Not bad.I've encrypted the entire volume using TrueCrypt, so I don't have to worry about privacy issues if I accidentally misplace this drive... or if it grew legs.Overall, this is a highly portable yet very usable external HD.  Light enough to carry in my shirt or pants pocket, yet large enough to carry a large amount of files.Strong 5-star rating.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VTAD6C73ORTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H4XH5FY#wasThisHelpful","R1VTAD6C73ORTN","A3EZEP0FX5BC1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZEP0FX5BC1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I liked:-Full HD-4K support (4K is 3840 x 2160); also able to upscale from 1080 to 4K-64-bit power is faster and more powerful.-Includes 7 professional quality special effects-support up to 21 tracks-UI and functionality is similar to X5, but A LOT faster-Lots of extras:  Hollywood-style titles, handscript animation, proDAD Mercalli SE to stabilize video footage, cinema quality effects, etc.What I didn't like:-Installation was not as smooth as I would like.  I have X5 installed, and installation of X7 did not uninstall X5 (amongst other installation issues), thus starting X7 ended up opening X5.  I had to uninstall both X5 and X7, and then reinstall X7.  Afterwards, all went well.Bottom line is that this software is a lot faster and more stable than Adobe Premiere Pro (1.5) which is 32-bit, and 2) Corel VideoStudio Pro X5.  I liked both of these programs, and I would say that the VS X7 is far more superior than these two programs.  Plus lots of extras, plug-ins, video effects, customizable options, AND faster and more powerful, this is an excellent consumer/prosumer video editing software.  5-star rating.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W2G1RT1GI9T1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIL0S8W#wasThisHelpful","R1W2G1RT1GI9T1","A3EZEP0FX5BC1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZEP0FX5BC1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received the small 8oz purple/white gloves.  I normally use large 16oz gloves.  These barely fit my unwrapped left hand but I absolutely cannot fit my right hand into the glove.Firstly, 8oz gloves are not useful for sparring/training.  8oz gloves are good for cardio-boxing or the like, but not for hitting things (heavy bags) or people (sparring).They feel soft inside, but I worry about the padding for heavy punching.I actually don't mind the color, since they are easy to see, and therefore easy to see if I am making any mistakes.I let my 8yo daughter use these to practice Muay Thai at home.  She doesn't mind them.So for boxing or cardio-bag, I would give these 3 stars (or less).  For cardio exercises where you don't have to hit anything, I would give these 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R267YNU90554Z5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTL2LTM#wasThisHelpful","R267YNU90554Z5","A3EZEP0FX5BC1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZEP0FX5BC1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Oreck Signature Collection Vacuum is a stylish yet functional vacuum cleaner.Distinctive, colorful inter-changeable bag covers and easy-to-use features makes it the must-have swivel vacuum.Easy to use all over the house.  From the runway to your living room, this lightweight, upright vacuum has it all.  What I like best is that it stores flat enough for me to keep it under the family couch.  Keep in mind that this is more of a traditional vacuum cleaner, so there are no hoses or extensions to work with (if you want to use a hose+attachment to clean the stairs, this is not the vacuum cleaner to use).  But for flat areas all over the house, this vacuum works great!  The suction is strong, and does not get clogged up like other vacuum units.  For most daily cleanups, I use this vacuum unit.PRODUCT FEATURES-The 360 Glide Unique ball-joint and pivot connection design makes it easy to steer and maneuver around the house and around furniture.-It Comes With 4 Colorful Front-Panel Bag Inserts to match your cleaning style.-Low Profile Design lets you gets in tight spots and under furniture.-The Saniseal System Automatically seals shut, locking the dirt in the disposable filter bag.-Direct Suction 5,600 revolutions per minute of suction power draw dirt into the bag for effortless cleaning.-Twin bright LED Lights illuminate dark corners and under furniture.-Two Speed power switch; HIGH speed cleans carpet, while LOW speed is gentle enough for Oriental and Persian rugs.-Weighs only 10 lbs. making it easy to lift and maneuver.

"This backpack is a very nice laptop/bookbag for everyday use.Notable features of this backpack:- Back compartment holds up to a 15.6"" laptop, plus files, papers, folders, etc.  It easily fits my MacBook Pro 15 inch retina display, plus my working files.- Main compartment has a sleeve for your 10"" tablet (stores my iPad 4 quite well), which sits right next to the laptop compartment so that it all the weight is close to your back- There is a top loading small zippered pocket.  This can hold your phone, sunglasses, small change purse, etc.  I use it for my lip balm and coin wallet.- The lumbar padding on the lower portion of the backpack that goes against your back also has a hidden pocket to protect small valuables.  I used this to keep my flight itinerary, just as an easy access without going through the rest of the backpack.- Front pocket panel provides basic organization for small daily accessories.  I use it for my pens, charging cables, and powerbar storage.- Pass through along the back panel easily slips over the handle of rolling luggage.  This helped with my recent trip, where I rolled my backpack on my check-in luggage as I ran through the airport to make a connecting flight.- Side pockets can accomodate a water bottle; or you can store your MP3 inside and easily thread your headphones through the designated slot- Top and bottom grab handles assist easy loading into daily storage and overhead binsWhat I don't like:There is a lack of significant padding on the bottom of the backpack.  I have to be very careful setting this backpack down on the ground, so I end up putting it on a padded chair or on the couch.  I also wished there were more color options.Overall, a decent backpack.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KFMB1UE2SQBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3JXZZ2#wasThisHelpful","R2KFMB1UE2SQBI","A3EZEP0FX5BC1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZEP0FX5BC1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This video camera is a top of the line consumer camcorder.  It has an Exmor R CMOS sensor (1/3"") with Sony G lens for high-quality video and image capture.  It has 32GB built-in memory, and a memory expansion slot for SD/SDHC/SDXC cards and memory stick micro.  It sports a Balanced Optical Steady Shot (BOSS) image stabilization, which gives a decently steady image even at full zoom (60x), which works good enough for home videos.  Built-in projector with 50 lumens for up to 200"" projection.  Coupled with an HDMI in so you can project from a tablet or phone (with the proper cable connectors), or any other device that projects via HDMI.  This works quite well to project movies from my iPad.  HDMI out port is also available, if you want to play your videos onto an HDMI TV.  The 5.1 channel surround-sound mic is a nice addition.This camcorder is the replacement for the Sony HDR-PJ650V and not a replacement for the Sony HDR-PJ790V.  If you go to either product site on Amazon, it would recommend this PJ810 as a ""newer model"" which is not entirely accurate for the PJ790.Unboxing:Top compartment of the box revealed the instruction manuals (English and Spanish), warranty information, mini pamphlet on available accessories.  Inside the box was the camcorder body, NP-FV50 battery, AC adaptor, power cord, micro HDMI cable, USB cable extender, remote control RMT-835 (with battery).First thing is to charge the battery.  The battery has to be mounted on the camera to charge (no separate battery charger).  There is a USB cable, about two inches long, with the USB connector mounted onto the strap.  I used the USB cable extended to connect the camera to the AC adaptor and let the battery charge overnight.The camcorder body on the side of the strap (where you slip your hand to hold the camera) has the feel of a DSLR.  This side also has the microphone input and headphone jack (both stereo minijacks) on this side.  The other side is smooth black plastic that has the flip-out LCD touchscreen.  Opening the screen also the HDMI in and out ports, as well as the external memory slot under a plastic sliding cover.Wi-Fi support is used for connecting to smartphones.  NFC (near field communication) provides ""touch connection"" convenience when transferring images to Android smartphones and tablets.  With this feature, users need only touch devices to connect; no complex set-up is required.  In addition, when using Smart Remote Control -- a feature that allows shutter release to be controlled by a smartphone -- connection between this camcorder and the smartphone can be established by simply touching devices.Video quality is excellent.  I've used it to record outdoor and indoor functions.  I like the dual format video recording, and I record AVCHD and MP4 at the same time.  Overall, an excellent consumer camcorder.  I would say it will give my go-to camcorder (Canon HF S10) a run for its money, which has been my go-to camcorder to record significant events.For better image quality, I would recommend the Sony HDR-PJ790V or the Sony HDR-CX900.  The PJ790V has a larger sensor (1/2"" -vs- 1/3"" for this PJ810), but it will add another $500+ to the cost.  The Sony HDR-CX900 has a 1"" Exmor R CMOS Sensor, has a resolution of 14MP(video) and 20MP (still images), and with similar capabilities as the PJ810, minus the projector.  For 4K video capability, I would recommend the Sony FDR-AX100/B 4K Video Camera, which has a larger LCD at 3.5"" (-vs- 3"" for the PJ810) and a 1"" Exmor R CMOS sensor (-vs- 1/3"" for the PJ810), but also costs about $1K more than the PJ810.Included in the box:-NP-FV50 battery, AC adaptor, power cord, instruction manuals (English and Spanish), micro HDMI cable, USB cable extender, remote control RMT-835 (with battery), step down ring for 37mm lens accessories (filters, etc.).  As mentioned by previous reviewer, this does NOT come with a lens hood, which I always use for outdoor daytime shooting.Noteable features:-32GB embedded Flash Memory-Slot for full size SD/SDHC/SDXC and Memory Stick Micro memory expansion.  However, on paper the description says that expandable memory only supports Memory Stick Micro (this is correct) and Micro SD/SDHC/SDXC (this is incorrect, since it supports full size cards).  The picture on the Sony site even shows a full size SD slot, but the specifications state micro cards are used.  Wrong information on Sony and Amazon sites.-1920x1080 Full HD 24p/60p with 24.5MP Exmor R CMOS Sensor-Project ~200"" videos with 50 lumen built-in projector via HDMI.  Projector is built in to the LCD panel. HDMI multi-terminal allows you to connect external devices that have an HDMI output (smartphones, laptops, tablets, etc) and use the camcorder's projector to enjoy other forms of entertainment such as video games and streaming videos.-Does NOT have night shot.  Or at least I haven't found it yet :p-Has a video light, but it does not function as a flash for still pictures.-Multiple Format Recording:  The PJ810 can redord in AVCHD and MP4 at the same time!-F1.8-3.4 aperture size.-Wide Angle G lens:  Sony G lenses are professional grade, and deliver brilliant, accurate color reproduction and sharp, detailed images.  The 26.8mm focal length offers broader perspective for enhanced wide angle shooting.-Balanced Optical SteadyShot image stabilization:  Moves the entire optical block at once, instead of moving a single ""shift lens""-5.1ch surround sound mic: Records audio in Dolby Digital 5.1 channel.  Also features Auto Wind Noise Reduction.-Color electronic view finder (EVF):  EVF 0.27"" with 201K  colors-3"" LCD display:  The 3"" 16:9 Xtra Fine LCD screen (921K) displays sharp, bring, and vivid images.  Bright enough to shoot daytime outdoors (for me).-Manual controls for Iris, Gain, and Shutter Speed-7 picture effects for video and still photos(edited 2014-04-24 for grammar and corrections)","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDKANNQRT3TGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNJWV1W#wasThisHelpful","RDKANNQRT3TGS","A3EZEP0FX5BC1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZEP0FX5BC1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like the black and green color.  I'm not into green, but this color combo stands out.  The 5S took a bit of effort to get in, but that just means the case will stay on.The silicone core acts like a shock absorber, while the polycarbonate hard shell adds some extra protection from bumps and bruises.  When used with a screen protector like the Tech Armor Premium HD Clear Screen Protector, you'll protect your iPhone 5S from significant injuries (except from drops from a few feet high onto a hard surface maybe).Don't expect it to perform like the Lifeproof iPhone 5S Case and you will be quite pleased with this basic case.

"In my opinion, Pinnacle Studio 17 (basic) is an average software that can perform basic video editing functions.This version is the most basic version of the Pinnacle Studio lineup. This ""basic"" version is suitable if your video editing uses and requirements are relatively simple, and if you have no plans to tackle more complex projects in the future. For example, you only have up to 6 tracks/layers to work with (three video and three audio).  Also, you can't author BluRay discs with this basic version.This software makes it relatively easier for users to create, export, or share their video files.  You can share your finished video project to Facebook, YouTube, and Vimeo.  You can export the videos in compatible formats (such as Flash, DivX, AVCHD, MPEG-4) for use on an iPad, Apple TV, Microsoft Xbox, and more.The new version was designed to run on 64-bit OS, such as Win7 and Win8.Some of the key features that I like:-  10x faster video rendering (from previous version)-  Access video and photos from HD camcorders and digital devices-  Built-in media library-  Storyboard quick first drafts allows you to create movies automatically-  Edit with frame accuracy on a 6-track timeline in HD (3 video, 3 audio)-  Over 1500 2D/3D effects--even green-screen superimposition-  Layer animations and titles easily with included Montage templates-  Use the trim editor to set source clip in/out points, then send to the timeline to include in your project-  Create custom-fit soundtracks with Scorefitter-  Easily archive and restore your work with Project Packages-  Zip through projects via 64-bit, NVIDIA(tm) CUDA(tm), and Intel(tm) Quick Sync Video optimizationWhat I don't care much for:-  Store projects and clips in the cloud to access anywhere, anytime--includes 50 GB of cloud access free from Box.  I need a lot more than 50GB of storage (my current library is well above 10 TB...yes, 10 terabytes).-  Import clips and movie projects from Pinnacle Studio for iPad.  I don't use Pinnacle Studio for iPad, and I don't plan on using it.-  Share HD videos on Facebook, YouTube, and Vimeo with a few clicks Create DVDs and export to your favorite digital devices and formats.  I upload videos myself, and I do not need this ""automated"" for me.I found that Studio 17 is still a bit buggy, especially when using MP4 videos (from GoPro cameras).If you want live screen capture and absolutely need to use Pinnacle Studio 17, then you need to upgrade to either the Plus or Ultimate versions.  If you want 4K Ultra HD support or you are into BluRay authoring, then you need the Ultimate version.If you are still running Windows XP (or earlier), then you are SOL because Studio 17 will only run on 64-bit OS (Win7 or Win8).IMO, Studio 17 is not a significant upgrade from 16.  However, the jump from 15 to 17 is huge, and if you are using 15 or older, then using Studio 17 can be much like using a new or different editing program.The similar program for cyberlink would be PowerDirector 12 Deluxe, which IMO is cheaper (50 dollars) yet more capable for various things, such as 100 track timeline (-vs- 6 tracks for Studio 17 Basic), more support for video input formats (MOV, WMV), and can run on Windows XP.Would I recommend it?  If you have used Studio 16, then yes.  Otherwise, I don't know if it is on the top 3 of my list.  I would recommend Adobe Premiere Elements 12, Cyberlink PowerDirector 12 Ultra or Cyberlink PowerDirector 12 Ultimate.Average at best.  Solid 3-star rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQSOP2VI4WUFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GC1ZMYA#wasThisHelpful","RQSOP2VI4WUFK","A3EZEP0FX5BC1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZEP0FX5BC1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I like:-According to the company, these are made with Polypro, which is ""PVC Free and recyclable""-clear view covers allow you to put a cover paper (and also along the spine)-two inside pocketsWhat I didn't like:-only one binder was shipped; I was expecting a 4 pack-not as ""Heavy Duty"" as I expected;-my binder looked dusty and used; had a few marks that looked like it had already been used-cover feels fine, but the hinges look and feel weak-raised ring set has a 1/8"" gap; makes the binder rings not look sturdy if filled with paper-I was only able to get 170 pages into the rings (not the 200 as advertised); I have other 1 inch binders that can hold 200 pages-front cover was bent in the middle, raising the two corners up when closedObviously, there are lots of QC issues with these binders.  It may be time for Wilson Jones Co. to evaluate their control/quality assurance plan and create a corrective action plan.  Overall, I've seen better regular/standard 1"" binders that I would rather purchase, such as the Avery Economy Binder.  For heavy duty use I can recommend the Avery Heavy-Duty binder or the Avery Nonstick Heavy-Duty.

"Firstly, this case can only accomodate the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 inch models in either color.  Neither the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1 inch) nor the Samsung Galaxy Note (10.1 inch) in any color will fit this case.This bluetooth keyboard pairs and works very well the Tab 3, as well as the Tab 2, Galaxy Note, various iPads, and various iPhones.  Pairing is easy.  The keyboard is really thin yet responsive.For my use, I charge it over the weekend (I used the included micro-USB cable).  During the first week, it was able to go from Monday through Thursday on a single charge.  Battery life slowly increased to about two weeks in between charging.  I use it in daily meetings (which is about half my day) for taking notes and moderate email.  I've used it with various devices.What I like:-micro-USB charging port- I was able to use various micro-USB chargers for this keyboard, as long as it can provide at least 2.1 amps.  I've had a few micro-USB chargers that did not work (ie. those to charge bluetooth headsets).-light padding does not add significant bulk to case-easy pairing with devices-Supposed 3 month battery life (at about 2h daily use)-Decent protective case that protects against scratches and minor bumpingWhat I don't like:-space key is sometimes not responsive; I probably get about 3-4 of this error in 10 minutes of typing.  Not too bad, but definitely not perfect.-keyboard is not detacheable-single viewing angle-keyboard is slightly slimmer then my preference (though I can make it work)-battery life is closer to two weeks when used 4-5 hours a day; I should have gotten at least a month out of the battery life.-light and plasticky feel (a highly subjective opinion that may be a plus for others)The tablet can be set at a viewing angle, held in place by magnetic tabs that keep the ""feet"" of the tablet from slipping.  Unfortunately, this setup limits to only this angle.  This setup does not work well when sitting on my lap, but works very well sitting on a flat top (table, desk, floor, etc).Overall, a very good bluetooth keyboard for the Tab 3 and also for other devices that require a keyboard.  If you have a Tab 3 (10.1 inch), this is a very useful accessory.  If you have a Tab 2 (10.1 inch) or a Note (10.1 inch), this case will not accomodate your tablet (even though the keyboard will work, the tablet will not fit in the case).Recommended.Note:  I took almost two months to get to this review because I wanted to see if the battery life actually lasted 3 months in between charges.  The most I got was two weeks (twice) with only double the usage (I used it for 4h a day), and I should have gotten about a month to a month and a half.Disclaimer: As noted above, I received this product through the Vine program in exchange for an objective and impartial review.

"My Sony DSC H50 fits in this case well.  However, it will not fit if I mount lens peripherals (ex. lens hood).  This also accomodates the Sony Cybershot H200, or a Canon G15.A shoulder strap comes with this case.  There are two side pockets.  One side pocket has my two spare batteries, the other pocket has a couple of SDHC cards and a lens cloth.  Unfortunately, the battery charger for my DSC H50 does not fit in either pocket, so I have to rely on my spare batteries and hope that I do not have to charge them when I am out and about.Padding seems decent, and will protect your camera from mild to moderate bumping.  I keep my camera in this case while and then stuff it in my backpack when I go out.  This case may be enough to protect from a low fall (a foot or less).  I am not comfortable with this case protecting from a drop from a table top (three feet) or higher.This case is good for carrying your camera on an outing, but I would go for a case with more protection if you are hiking, climbing, or out with lots of kids.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L19BXUP52COD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHT6CRC#wasThisHelpful","R3L19BXUP52COD","A3EZEP0FX5BC1P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EZEP0FX5BC1P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the Western Digital 2 TB SATA III 7200 RPM 64 MB Cache Bulk/OEM Desktop Hard Drive, Black, WD2003FZEX.This is part of the ""Black"" desktop series.  WD Black drives feature a dual core processor that offers twice the processing power to maximize drive performance.  According to the manufacturer specs, this 7200 rpm drive has a 64MB cache, advanced format 4K sectors, 6GB/s interface.  WD Black drives come with a 5-year limited warranty (vs the Blue drives, which come with only two years).  In brief, this is a very good/excellent hard disk drive.From what I've seen with this drive, I would not hesitate to use it as a performance or data drive.  It is fast enough to run the OS, and large enough to store tons of data files.  Don't expect break-neck speeds, and certainly don't compare it with solid-state drive (SSD) performance, and you will be quite pleased with this drive.Overall, highly recommended.(Warning:  Geek alert!!!)I tested an OEM version of this drive, and not a retail package (boxed with cables, screws, etc.) on my workstation PC.  First thing I did was format it to NTFS using PartedMagic (multiple partitions).Using CDM 3.0.1 and HD Tach as benchmarking tools, I got the following specs:Average Read - 107 MB/sSequential Read - 133 MB/sAverage Write - 115 MB/sSequential Write - 117 MB/sI'm not sure why I was getting relatively ""low"" benchmark values.  Clearly, these benchmark numbers are impressive.  The benchmark numbers for this drive are less impressive the Seagate Barracuda 2TB model Seagate Barracuda 2 TB SATA III, (which posted numbers at 249, 258, 126, and 136 MB/s, respectively) even though both utilize the fast 6GBps interface (SATA3) and the larger cache (64MB).Interestingly, performance on the outer 25 GB partition was the same as the inner 900 GB partition.  For example, sequential Read/Write on the outer partition was 132/122 while the inner partition was 134/118 (in MB/s).Results from real-world tests are pending.One other thing is that this drive can be noisy when used on a docking station, but not too noticeable when placed inside a computer.  My Hitachi 1TB 7200 and my WD Raptor are louder (though this is obvious).  On my PC, the boot drive (Raptor) is noisier because it is a 10K rpm drive.After seeing the performance of this drive, I would consider using this drive either for a boot drive or for backups.  Only time will tell how reliable they are.My current setup is with Win7 on a SanDisk Extreme SSD 120 GB SDSSDX-120G-G25 and data files (photos and videos) on this WD2003FZEX.Disclaimer:  I received this product through the Vine program in exchange for an objective review.

"Billionaire Alberto Graziani rose all the way to the top after living a measly life during his younger years. Now every woman wanted him. But he's no fool, he knew that they want him for his money and fame. One night while driving home, he accidentally bumped a woman on the street and her memory was lost. Day by day, Alberto slowly fell in love with her. He wished she won't remember anything else again so she could be his for the taking. Until, he discovered her dirty little secret.The story was quite predictable, a little too mushy for my taste, but the concept was fast-paced and plot was promising. Would love to read what happens next when the billionaire finally learns the truth about the woman he graciously helped.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TY57X3H8SWO1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155YHI3M#wasThisHelpful","R1TY57X3H8SWO1","AGE0YGLF7L2ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGE0YGLF7L2ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sicily Moretti had hurt Drake DeMarco's feelings when she lashed out at him after he almost killed a boy in her bakery. The same boy who burned down her competition's building and had declared his love for her. Seeing red, Drake did what he deemed was right but Sicily only saw the monster he used to be.This is the last serial in the Judged series and I loved how it ended. Sicily finally learned more about Drake and she was forthcoming about her final decision accepting him despite his flaws.Seriously, I wasn't really into Sicily on the first two books in this series, I thought she was too judgmental and uncomfortable with her own skin and exuded negativity. But the more I got to know more in the last book, the more I liked her. There's really something about Drake that made her realize her mistakes and changed her for the better.Once again, Ali Parker had written a wonderful serial that is not only intoxicatingly hot but also downright engaging and endearing. I wasn't really into Mafia-related stories before, but somehow, somewhere, some thing in me had changed my heart.  Thumbs up to Ali for another job well done!I received this book from Hurricane Readers in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EXRFEFFE50NU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012UGF588#wasThisHelpful","R2EXRFEFFE50NU","AGE0YGLF7L2ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGE0YGLF7L2ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What would you do when you realized someone knows about you, what you do, where you live, and how much money is in your bank account? This might shock the hell out of you but Rachel knows what to do.Rachel witnessed the kidnapping of a young boy near her place but the police officers weren't doing their jobs due to conspiracy. It's up to Rachel and her computer skills to help the concerned families and put the abductors in their place. Too bad, the tables turned and now she received an email from someone who knew the boy's whereabouts and who knew a whole lot about her.Threats had been issued, guns had been fired, intels had been hacked, and death had been imminent the moment Rachel meddled with the abduction. With the help of new found friends and a hacker love interest, they uncovered a mystery deeper than they could handle. Expect a lot of twists and turns and major surprises, this thing could break your defenses and question the people around you.I enjoyed every minute of reading this book. It's got a lot of action, mind-boggling situations, heart-stopping scenes and a hint of romance that will leave you gushing.

"A short story about a man who doesn't believe in love but willing to get married for the sake of his family. And the woman who wants to be loved more than anything else. The romance factor is there, but I felt that the story was a bit lacking and rushed. There were a lot of narrations about family histories and background stories, but I didn't feel the connection with the characters. If this was made into a full-length novel, the feeling of romanticism and satisfaction would have been achieved. I didn't get to enjoy it enough to want more.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27ABOINI3KU4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BUHNV2#wasThisHelpful","R27ABOINI3KU4N","AGE0YGLF7L2ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGE0YGLF7L2ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Everyone's aware of Superman's origin, right? Well, the premise of Oleah Chronicles is somewhat similar to Kal El's. Angel, the daughter princess of the Tribal Queen of Oleah, was sent to Earth to protect her from the evil fallen angel Sindrell. Coral, the cherub from Urofika, was the one who opened the portal to planet Earth and would stay close until Angel fulfiled her destiny. (So far, that's where the similarity ends).Angel didn't know anything else about her true identity, so she grew up to be as human as possible. She had a bestfriend named Julie who meant the world to her. She was living a normal life, until she felt chills ran down to her bones the moment she met the hot guy but cold-blooded transfer student, Zander. Suddenly, she could feel him whenever he was near. Suddenly, she had this feelings she couldn't describe. Suddenly, she heard voices in the middle of the night and caught her parents talking to the bright full moon. Suddenly she became aware of the shadows that prowled in the dark.It was only a matter of time before Angel finally learned the truth about her. About her claws. About the chills. About her gold and hazel eyes. About her dreams at night. Zander was a big part of the revelation, but could she trust him after she learned about his cruelty and allegiance to Sindrell? After he admitted that he was originally sent to kill her?I just had a grand time reading the Truth and it was awesome!Oleah Chronicles is a whole new frontier for me. While I have read a lot of books featuring shapeshifters (wolves/werewolves, bears and cougars) this is the first time I read about mountain lions shifting and coming from another galaxy. And vampires from another planet. Quite intriguing, huh?I liked how the story unfolded right before my eyes. The world building was consistent and imaginative. I thought I would get bored to death because of the wordy descriptions and history of the Kindren and Oleah and fallen angels, but surprisingly, I was hooked and drawn to their world. I thought I had this out-of-my-body experience and had traveled beyond galaxies just to be able to have a feel to be an Oleah.Michelle Johnson had created a unique world that felt like home and I'm loving it. This is her debut novel and I must say, she rocks her first time!

"Who said Love makes the world go around? Not in Elizabeth Madrid’s world, no, this isn’t true. Absolutely not. Because in this world, Elizabeth does not love. She uses. She lies. She steals.  And she sure makes everyone believe in her and has everyone wrapped around her finger. Even notorious celebrity Chrysalis Magnolia feeds on her hand and takes the bait. She’s that good!But are these people even aware of her? Apparently, Saucy Socials blogs and rants about her but she’s got no idea about her. Of course, no one really knows Elizabeth Madrid. Simply because she doesn’t exist.A few months ago, I’ve read book 2 (Properly Scandalous) from this series and admittedly, I wasn’t entirely connected with the main characters. Maybe because I wasn’t able to read this first book first. But now, I fully understand “Elizabeth’s” hot and cold personality, her power of persuasion,  and the power of her Midas touch. And this deceitful girl is a little too much!Mina V. Esguerra has come up with a believable and thought-provoking story of trust, lies, love and deceit, a story that had me all twisted and cautious of the people around me. The author, as always, breathed life to her characters that had let me peeked into their unscrupulous world.

"Chris Slater is a catch, the the type of guy every girl would want to have. And for this main reason, Devon decides to stay away from him. To move to some place where he is out of reach. But the more she distances herself from him, the more he is drawn to her, the more she wants to go back to his arms. Unfortunately, Christ doesn't want her. He dislikes her. He can't stay in one place with her. He hates her... Or so she thought.Devon is right to fall for him, for all the wrong reasons. Devon's reputation isn't squeaky clean and she knows that. Chris also knows that. But beneath this tarnished exterior is a woman dying to be loved, to be accepted, to be cherished. Her past with Andrew seems to have broken her, but until she can fully accept the reality of their breakup and move on, she won't be getting into the good graces of Chris.Again, those roller-coaster of emotions I felt when I read Christine Natz first book, Seven Years, are all coming back to me now that I've read The Year After.  I swear, I got crazy over Chris Slater, his oh-so-good personality and oh-so-bad in bed character. This guy's machismo rules and he doesn't even had to shed clothes just to prove it.And if there's one thing that I really loved about the man, it's his way to a woman's heart. Pancakes! Have I ever told you that pancakes are my favorite comfort food? (Next to pizza, of course!) If Chris Slater were food, he'd be my pancake and I'm gonna devour him in two minutes top. Yum!I really love this book, not because the author is a friend, but because I have always admired how she was able to encapsulate intensity, drama, family, passion, pain and love in less than 200 pages. These pages have everything you could possibly want in a New Adult book. Christine Natz's writing is fluid and immersive and you can't help but be inclined to read the next chapter and on to the next and the next until you finished it.

But he also realized that Harper needed to make friends and bond with her officemates.

"I think, after a month of reading Trading Up, it is safe to say that Candice Bushnell's novels worked better when HBO interpreted her writing. Believe me, Sex & The City was my favorite Bushnell book but I loved it better on cable. I was also glued to the TV set whenever Carrie Diaries was on.Somehow, with Trading Up, I had a hard time getting charmed with Janey Wilcox and her posse.

"Geli Voyante seemed to think she’s being left out, especially after her frenemy Tiggy got engaged and everyone she knew were either settled down or were bound to walk down the aisle anytime soon. Where was her place under the sun?In my opinion, Angelica Geli Voyante had it all. She wrote the Hot or Not column and snagged her ideal boyfriend. But insecurities crawled upon her when she saw her arch-enemies picture/status on Facebook. Yes, Tiggy was getting married and she wasn’t pleased with the news. At all.I thought at first that Geli’s thinking was absurd. She basically thought she should be joining the bandwagon, just because everyone else was getting married. And then she got interested with her stepsister’s boyfriend. Ah, not good at all.What’s really interesting in this story was how Geli and Tiggy became mortal enemies when they initially started out as friends. Their respective family dramas pinched my heart in the most fascinating way. They even had me laughing all the way until the end. Yes, believe it or not, Geli Voyante is a troublesome character that can get you hot or not. Elle Field deserves to have a field day for this delightfully written story!

"Lexxi Rock learned and watched her boyfriend's infidelity through the screens and she couldn't have been more humiliated. Lexxi, a star in her own right, finally saw the light and fled to her hometown in Tucson for a much needed break. Then all the disguise and pretensions began.Sebastian was a dedicated firefighter, saved lives and served his people. One disastrous fire broke his leg and soon he found himself resting in his apartment, dilly-dallying about his failed relationship with Aileen. How could he not know that the woman he was seeing was already married! He was such a fool!When Lexxi stayed over her father's place, she met Bash, but she didn't tell him who she was. She pretended to be a boy named Alex. What she didn't know was Bash was aware of her all along.Disguise is a new hot and fiery series by the two belles of erotic romance, Bella Wild and Bella Love-Wins. As always, I'm thrilled to read stories from this tandem. Although at first I must admit, Disguise is quite reminiscent of Rocked (their previous six-part novel) because of the similarities with the characters. But in the end, this had been a really different story and the scenes were boiling hot. The Bellas sure can fire up a book, so careful because even your Kindle might just burn up!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTGA3BMTHMR67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GNYN0I#wasThisHelpful","RTGA3BMTHMR67","AGE0YGLF7L2ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGE0YGLF7L2ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chase and Brooke had been working together side by side but never admitted their feelings for each other. One day when Chase was called by his father for an important meeting, he brought Brooke with him. One wrong turn at a bedroom door found Chase looking at a scantily clad Brooke and all hell broke loose.One night of intimacy brought forth a new twist in their relationship. Brooke tried to keep her distance but all her efforts had gone kaput. She knew she shouldn't be dating her boss, but the boss himself won't let her stay away from him. Maybe the whirl of cameras from paparazzi would wake him up? Oh wait, she overheard him say he wasn't planning on ever settling down so why was her heart cracking bit by bit?The Unforgettable Chase story was a good short story. Although there were still some parts missing (about Brooke and her family, et al) the flow of the story was fluid and characteristically engaging. Expect hot and heavy and steamy scenes between Chase and Brooke and you'll surely lose your focus on whatever you're doing.

"A girl named Hikaru Saito never thought she’d be getting the attention of two well-loved personalities in her school. Imagine being tutored by the sought-after genius slash rich kid slash campus heart-throb Takeshi Hinata and saved from the mean girls by teacher Tetsuya Sakuishi, Hikaru’s life turned upside down from all the stares and bullies she was getting. Suddenly, the girl who only wanted to keep mostly to herself and her manga was surrounded by beauty and love.“How can you think yourself invisible until now? You’re the only one I see..” [Takeshi Hinata]I didn’t think that a love story can be effective without the usual villain manipulation or the heart-pounding scenes wherein the lead characters are fatally harmed thus resulting to revenge and death. No, I felt none of that with this book.Blossom Among Flowers gave me the light giddy vibes usually felt by teenagers falling in love. I liked this story a LOT! Reminded me of one of my favorite JDramas/Manga Hana Yori Dango. Takeshi and Hikaru look cute together, they fit together and I seriously believe they belong together. Their fascination with manga (more on Hikaru’s part) really got me going. (Death Note is a big favorite of mine, too!) The book also gave me a glimpse of something Japanese which I have always wanted to see. Japan is such a beautiful country, my own brother tells me so.But what I really, really, really liked in this book are the conversations, the “hirits” made by Takeshi. So romantic, so many feels, it’s like I’m reading a script from a famous “telenovela” and I can’t help but scream with delight and grin like a puppy.“I’m stubborn.. And I won’t stop until I got what I wanted. An what I wanted was to stay here with you. “ [Takeshi Hinata]Gosh, I’m melting into a puddle after reading that. LOL. Jay E. Tria hit the gold mine with this book. I am truly honored to have read this.

"Old wounds opened up again when Liliana had to be with her old lover Emilio Amante. It didn't help her either that she must live and work with him while she was already committed to her new boyfriend Lucas, who happened to be Emilio's employee. This kind of love triangle may sound cliche, but trust me, their love story was something extra-ordinary.This story already captured my attention with its prologue. Liliana was startled awake after she saw herself running away from someone who wanted to claim and lunged her. As the chapters ran, my impression of Liliana being innocent changed to deceivingly cautious and mature. From that point on, I knew I was in for a good read. And it really was! It was an hour later when I realized I wouldn't be able to sleep unless I finish the story.MD Melai and CS Leigh are highly commendable authors, as they both made me thrilled from beginning to end.

"Almost all of the chairs in this world are super comfortable for me, being 5'2"", it's really hard to find a comfortable chair that doesn't feel like it was made for a 6' person. A fully adjustable office chair, while a must for me, often doesn't adjust enough. However, this is a well designed, fully adjustable chair worked like a charm!. For the money, it's an excellent happy-medium between the nicer, high-end chairs and the horrible, cheap low-end chairs. As someone who works at home, I tend to stand more than sit, but when I do sit, I want something that is comfortable and encourages good posture. Given the depth of this chair's adjustability, I suspect it would work beautifully for someone on the other end of the height spectrum. And yes, it's really comfortable.Out of the box, the Lively Task Chair assembled super easily and quickly. It's solid, and with nearly everything adjustable, I was able to configure the chair perfectly to my needs. The armrests, the lumbar support, and of course the height are all adjustable. You can also adjust the tilt to that sweet spot so can lean back in the chair comfortably.I'm super happy I found this chair!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18JPDA961886Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAJNKPI#wasThisHelpful","R18JPDA961886Z","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A bit disappointed in that this didn't provide the WiFi connectivity I expected. It was easy enough to install, but failed to deliver the goods. I tried this on a variety of computers and none would adequately connect. When a connection was established, there wasn't any noticeable speed difference and the connection would drop all too easily. I can't say it's the router itself, we have pretty killer router.While there is probably some limitations around this, the clunky nature of the device was really annoying. In testing this with a laptop, my son kept knocking it out of the USB port as he adjusted his sitting position (of course homework isn't meant to be done lying in bed with a laptop on your lap, so thumbs up for forcing him to sit up properly).

"This is the first book I've read by Mr. Reich, and I found it to be one of the most profound treatises on our economy I've read to-date. Obviously many on the right will poo-poo much of what Mr. Reich states, but this isn't about left or right, it's about the survival of each and every working individual and our future generations in this country. Regardless of where you stand, the detailed history of how we got here is quite revealing. I have often felt we are entering the New Middle Age as we see the middle class rapidly vanish right in front of us.Over the last two decades there has been this shift to create policies and legislation that enable the richer to become richer while the middle class rapidly disappears and the those living in or near the poverty line grows exponentially. So what is really happening here? How can it be that our economy can roar back from the 2008 recession, and everyone but the wealthy top !% does not share in that growth too? Didn't they also contribute to the success? Therein lies Mr. Reich's fundamental point, which is to make capitalism work for everyone, not just a few, for a strong, vibrant and growing economy.With the ""how we got here"" info in place, Mr. Reich goes on to show what the probable future will look like and he brings a lot of historical context to support his ideas. He demonstrates over and over again that the answer is not socialism, which many on the left tend to support, but the answer lies in many of the tenets of capitalism. He clearly outlines why doling out more tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations is not the answer; they are not the job creators they would like for us to believe. He notes that on the contrary there is a decreasing incentive for large corps and the wealthy 1% to continue to invest because as the purchasing power of the middle and lower classes decreases, there will be a decrease in demand for goods in services, which we are seeing already.Nearly all economists agree a healthy economy has three pillars equally contributing to its success; consumer spending, government spending and business investment. According to Mr. Reich, as the middle class disappears and the lower economic class grows, this will create a decline in consumer spending. This not to say that Mr. Reich is pushing for more consumerism (that is a different thing), but if people can only afford the basic necessities, this means demand for simple things such as a trip to the movie theater, will decline and slowly more and more small businesses will close their doors and there goes any hope of new employment. He does not advocate additional government spending as that will rapidly inflate our already ballooning deficit. He also notes that increasing business investment isn't the answer either; what good is it to have a more productive economy if the a growing population can't afford or use it?After thoroughly laying out the vastness of the situation, he doesn't leave you hanging, he provides plenty of details for how we can achieve a more balanced economy that benefits everyone. He outlines this in the last few chapters of the book, most of which will take some serious political action. The foreboding quote at the front of the book really comes home to roost as you near the end of the book and realize how urgent our situation is given that politicians are literally at the beck and call of lobbyists, CEOs and the wealthy 1%...creating meaningful reform that benefits everyone will be seriously challenging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DB8YKWEU94BO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385350570#wasThisHelpful","R1DB8YKWEU94BO","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had the privilege of playing around with several Espon printers, from the high-end to the low-end and this one hands-down is my favorite. Epson really packed a LOT into this little workhorse - it does so much, I think I finally have the one, single device that can handle everything. There are some serious smart design elements that put this one over the top for me; killer Epson color quality, killer Wi-Fi capabilities, two paper trays (see more below) and a pretty amazing photo restore feature (see more below). It simply does everything, and it does it just as good as the some of the higher end devices. Here's the low-down:Graphics Quality - Epson is know for its color and graphics quality, and this printer performs as well as Epson printers costing twice as much. Also the black and white is super crisp, like laser printer quality. The colors are brilliant and this little workhorse does a good job of keeping the quality going even as one or more cartridges are getting close to empty.Ease of Install - if you can press a few buttons, and you remember your network password, it literally takes a minute or two to get the printer onto the network and everyone on the network can immediately access it. The control panel is a really nice touchscreen which has good sensitivity so you don't have to keep pressing the same button a bunch of times to get the desired action.Ease of Operation - Super easy to operate. If you want to copy, scan or fax, simply press that button on the touchscreen and if you want to choose any options, you can select those or simply perform the action without having to scroll through a laundry list of menu items. The printer has a relatively small footprint and since you can feed papers into the top for copying, scanning and faxing, it can easily sit on a shelf. Of course if you need to open the lid or use the rear tray, you'll need some clearance for that.Paper Handling - One of the best features packed into this little workhorse is the dedicated photo paper tray. No more switching piles of paper of different sizes and readjusting the inner paper tray. You simply load 8.5 x 11"" letter  or - Big Bonus - 8.5 x 14"" legal size paper in the bottom tray and photo paper in a dedicated tray on top (holds 4x6 or 5x7 only). When you want to print to one tray or the other, you simply select Cassette 1 or 2 from the Paper Settings and you're on your way.Another great paper handling feature is the ability to select Thick Paper from the touchscreen. I like to print onto card stock and many times find the printer mucks up the project by either failing to get the paper through the feeder or the paper moves too slowly or too fast and the images are distorted. This setting worked liked a charm - thick paper sailed right through without damaging the paper or destroying the image.Awesome Wi-Fi - this printer does a whole lot more than print boring docs from your computer. Got a tablet, phone or Wi-Fi-enabled camera? You can send docs from these devices right to the printer. This is huge - no more emailing stuff, using some cloud-sharing server or other zig-zag method of getting docs from one device to the a printable point. It's worth mentioning Epson's Connect app because it makes it really easy to send docs to the printer and since it bypasses the router, anyone can print without requiring you to give them the password and access to your network. Very nice (and secure)!.Scanning - there are a lot of options for scanning. First you can scan to your computer, memory card or to a cloud-based server (one you registered with on the Epson Connect app). You can also opt to scan the doc to PDF, JPEG or directly to email. I use a document scanner all the time, and I'm seriously thinking I might be able to unload that device since the Epson appears to do nearly everything that device does, including double-sided scanning!Copying - again, amazing array of features here including the usual items such as color, black and white, enlarge, reduce, two-sided (including 2- sided to 2-sided, 2-sided to 1-sided and 1-sided to 2-sided), but it also has a pretty nifty feature: Copy/Restore Photo. Yep, this baby will actually take a faded photo and ""restore"" the color, and guest what? It works!!! I took faded 40-year old photo and copied it to photo paper using this feature, and wow, it really brought the photo to life!!!Another handy feature, especially if you have kids in school, is the Personal Stationery function. From the touchscreen, you can select to print wide or thin-ruled lined paper, graph paper and even music sheet paper. There is also a Calendar print function with an option for Sunday-Saturday week or month calendar.With coloring books all the rage for both adults and children, this printer will make a black and white coloring book page from a photo. This feature worked really well, even with really detailed photos. There is a setting called Line Detection which when altered will produce a more or less detailed coloring book page. I'm already playing around with this for a holiday card idea!This little printer really reset the bar for home printers!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUS2EWMY7VL1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5XSS#wasThisHelpful","RUS2EWMY7VL1R","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My hands were a wreck after about a week of intensive gardening then came the super hot, searing, dry weather so the AHAVA Witch Hazel hand cream was put to a pretty extreme test - and it performed like a champ. This lotion made super quick work of my cracked cuticles and within just three days, my hands feeling less like a pile of dead skin and by around day seven, they were feeling like a woman of leisure's hands. This worked so fast and well on my old-lady hands, I used it on my feet at night too! Running around in sandals all summer long really dries your feet out, and after about a week, this hand cream made my feet feel like I had gotten a killer pedicure!I've used AHAVA products before, they are truly top-shelf quality, and this lotion is no exception. It's not greasy nor watery, and you only need a nickel-sized bit to get your hands, forearms and elbows nicely hydrated. I can't speak to the whole list of ingredients, but it doesn't contain Paragons or Phthalate, and I know those aren't good for you. I'm really partial to L'Occitaine's products, and this is right up there in terms of quality and performance.Lastly, AHAVA sealed the deal with the very faint and pleasant scent. It's just a little hint of floral and definitely not overpowering - there's nothing worse than a great hand cream or lotion product that stinks like a cheap date!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GB7EARMHIOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPO4T7U#wasThisHelpful","R2GB7EARMHIOT","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now Designs has always made really nice dishtowels in both the thicker towel and the thinner linen-like towel. This is the thinner linen-like towel which is best for drying dishes and especially glassware. Despite being a tea towel, it's substantial in heft and a real workhorse in the kitchen.The color in this 100% cotton towel is dyed using vegetable dyes and the cotton is 100% organic. Right out of the box it feels nice and soft, and was even more luxurious after going through a laundry cycle. As for the absorbency, it knocked it out of the park - it handled a huge load of large pots and pans, knifes (you know, the stuff that can't or won't fit into the dishwasher) without feeling like it was saturated after drying a few items. You won't have to reach for another towel or two and then you're left with the kitchen looking like the clothesline feel down with towels strewn about everywhere drying!As for the color, the blue is a really beautiful vintage-looking indigo blue, and a nice surprise is the design on the towel is asymmetrical.

"This Epson printer is a bit like the little brother in this line of new printers from Epson. Epson has long been known for their color quality printing, and this printer meets that expectation. Of course the real benefit is the refillable ink tanks that hold a lot of ink, meaning no more cartridges and plenty of ink for big projects.It is worth noting that printer is really worth the price if you do a lot of color printing (if you do a lot of black and white printing, a small laser printer is more economical). Depending on how fast you blow through color ink cartridges, this printer may or may not make sense given the price tag. Now, here's the low-down:Set-up & InstallSuper easy right out of the box. Filing the ink tanks was a snap and the placement of the tanks ensures the filling process is easy and no mess. Once that's done and the initial ink charging process complete (this step takes about 20 minutes) you can connect to your Wi-Fi network, which takes all of about 20 seconds - as long as you know your password ;-).PrintingAgain, it's that high quality Epson color printing technology that has always made Epson stand out from the crowd. I printed several photos and other color docs and all were clear, crisp and the color spot on as compared to the original. I printed on both matte and glossy photo paper with excellent results. The plain paper photos were okay, but that's a limitation of the paper, not the printer. The color docs I printed were a report with plenty of charts and graphs and that printed beautifully and looked like it professionally done as opposed to being done at the same time as I was making dinner.I also fed card stock, including a piece of heavy weight scrapbook paper and various sizes of paper through this printer and it handled everything just fine. There isn't a rear feed slot so I didn't attempt fabric, vellum or anything tricky. I do wish Epson and other printer manufacturers would add a rear feed tray, some of don't live solely in a plain paper world.Another great feature is the ability print directly form other devices. If you are Mac user, you can also use AirPrint. Epson has a basic, handy app that you can use to print photos directly to the printer. Again, it's basic but it you do any editing of the photo with any of the multitude of apps out there you can get what you want without having to do the upload/download thing to your desktop PC.Copy & ScanThis little printer does a fine job with both copying and scanning. It doesn't do two sided printing (although you can flip the paper and accomplish this manually), nor does it handle two sided scanning. With the copy function, you can really see how fantastic he Epson color technology is; color copies are virtually identical to the original.Again, a great little workhorse if you have considerable color printing/copying needs.

"Rachael Ray has been a long time advocate for animals, particularly abandoned and mistreated pets through her Rachael's Rescue foundation. So one would expect her organization would put out a dog food product that is of the highest quality and yes, this is. Since she donates all of her personal profits to her foundation, your purchase helps pets needing a lot of love.Even though our yellow lab will eat nearly everything, except lettuce, she went nuts when I opened the bag, and I haven't seen that in awhile. We feed her excellent quality dog food, but this must have had the equivalent of of dog food umami in it as she woofed it down like she was a perpetually hungry puppy.There aren't any grains in it as advertised, and the first ingredient is salmon, and salmon meal is the second. The protein content is good, guaranteed to be a minimum of 26%. It does contain beet pulp (a ways down on the list), some consider this to be more of a filler, others claim it has properties beneficial to the dog's intestinal health. And it's all made in the US, not China so there is some comfort that your dog isn't consuming some weird cocktail of plastic bits and who knows what else. As an aside, Rachael Ray's dog food is made by Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, who consistently receives high ratings for its product quality and cleanliness and safety of production.I'm definitely sold on Rachael Ray's dog food, and the hound is happy too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JJWFUWUCB7TH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRGJJ8A#wasThisHelpful","R1JJWFUWUCB7TH","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I owned an Epson many years ago and since then have had the opportunity to print to many different Epson models. The two things that always stand out for me are the quality of the color prints and the fast usage of expensive ink. I ultimately gave up my Epson for a Canon Pixma but now my trusty Canon is no match for this Epson printer - especially since Epson solved the ""drinking ink"" problem so elegantly. So the Canon has been happily being donated and the premium desk space awarded to this new, fabulous Epson printer. Oh yeah, and all of the cartridge inconvenience as well.A key consideration in the purchase of this printer is the economics. It's not an inexpensive printer, and the trade-off is you don't have to buy a slew of ink cartridges. It's really designed for a small office/home office and If you do a lot of printing and currently rifling through several sets of ink cartridges in a one-to-two year period, then this printer is a blessing and a bargain. If you are a home user or your color printing needs are minimal, then this printer might be overkill for your needs. As in all things, know what you need and from there you can make in an informed buying decision. Now here's the low-down:Set-up & InstallOut of the box, this was a snap to get up and running. Everything you need is in the box. After taking all the tape and packing bits off and out, you fill the cartridges. Here is the real beauty of this printer - you fill each of the 4 tanks with ink yourself, the tanks are voluminous and hold way more than the traditional cartridges. Say goodbye to the recycling, refilling or new cartridges mess and hello to a LOT of ink that should last a long, long time. After the ink has charged (the initial process takes about 20 minutes) you go through the set-up which takes about 20 seconds, as long as you know your Wi-Fi network password.Print QualityExceptional. Epson has always done a superior job with color printing, and this printer is no exception. I printed photos on matte, glossy and plain paper all with gorgeous results. The paper tray can be modified to hold various different sizes, up to A4 and as small as 3.5 x 5"". Also, the print speed is incredible. The first set of photos I printed I was cursing under my breath that I must have selected a fast, draft-style print quality because the paper was shooting out so fast, but not so. And no buckling or waviness to the paper in those areas where the color is highly saturated - the  paper was perfectly flat.Copy & ScanThe copier quality was also just as excellent and you can really see the beautiful color print technology as color copies are 99% as good as the original. The same is true of the scanning technology, the scan capture is true to the original, so now you can scan those keepsakes and print them into high quality paper to share or use in a project. Both the scanning and copy functions always print super fast and another bonus is the scanning function will work over the Wi-Fi network. You also have the option to scan to your desktop or to the cloud (iCloud and Google Cloud). You can also save in a variety of file formats. Oh yeah, the copy (and print) functions can do 2-sided printing.FaxAgain, awesome quality in terms of send, receive and the print quality. I had someone fax over a document with color images and the print quality was the same high quality as any other color output this printer produces. It holds up a total of 60 contacts and contacts can be grouped (a group counts as one contact). There is a nifty little utility for both Windows and Mac OS that lets you set-up speed dial and group dial. And you can fax a doc directly from your PC with this utility.Another great feature of this printer is the app for your iOS and Android devices (iPhone, iPad, Android OS devices etc.) that enables you to print directly the the printer. I love that this eliminates the messy step of downloading images, especially since Apple really made new iPhoto app less better. However the iOS/Android app is simple and limited in scope of functionality so if you need to do any real editing, you'll still have to get the image onto your computer and do your magic from there. But given the quality of the camera in most newer cell phones and some of the editing apps available, you can still do your thing and print right to the printer - and so can your family and friends.The one thing I wish this printer had was rear tray which is so helpful when working with fabric or heavier paper or card stock. I did test this printer with card stock, and it handled printing several pages in one job like a champ, and I hope that would be true for a tray full of card stock, but I haven't had the need for this just yet.Overall, I'm thrilled about the marriage of Epson color quality and the all-you-can-drink refillable tanks! And Epson was kind enough to include in the box a set of ink to get started and a set of ink for refilling, you probably won't need ink for awhile...a long, long while!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S0UNOGFM2S7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JFSM#wasThisHelpful","R3S0UNOGFM2S7M","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Obviously the size of these paper towels are the big bonus. We took a roll with us for a weekend camping trip and they served us well, but the size was clearly the only bonus over taking a normal sized roll of paper towels. I could easily see if you have a small house, RV or other tight living condition, you might find these somewhat more advantageous. Regardless, this size advantage is not nearly compelling enough that I'd buy these towels.On the downside, these towels are thin and not terribly absorbent. If you need to mop up a big, wet mess, then you'll blow through a wad pretty fast (and now you'll need two rolls, so why not just have one large roll). If you are prone to big messes, then it's definitely more economical to stick to the normal size towels.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QWR1555MV7EP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010E5IN54#wasThisHelpful","R2QWR1555MV7EP","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I would have never believed it if someone had told me back in the 70's that I would eventually own a set of Al Stewart's tunes. Never being a big fan of Al Stewart, and I would turn the station whenever his pop song, Year of the Cat, came on the radio.  But after hearing a track from this CD I had to hear more. This all acoustic guitar CD really showcases Mr. Stewart's serious talent as both a songwriter and guitar player. Peter White is the perfect complement too. The jazzy, upbeat tempo is sprinkled with a bit of latin and celtic riffs and it is so much more interesting to listen to - I really hope he produces more work in this genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UPFTCAKFXDBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002T5HE3A#wasThisHelpful","R3UPFTCAKFXDBD","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband, who has a very light beard (not a very hairy guy) found the shaver to be comparable to his other electric razor. He noted it was a smooth, close shave but again, he can go a a few days without shaving and only then does it look likes he has a 5 o'clock shadow. He suspects this razor would not be nearly as effective for someone with heavy growth.It gets the 1-star rating as the big ""bonus"" of this unit is the Smart Clean which seems to work intermittently. The hubby tinkered with for several days and couldn't get to operate consistently. Again, he had to wait to get the thing full of enough hair to make it work, so maybe his light facial growth is core to the issue. Regardless, he simply resorted to cleaning the unit the same way he cleaned his old razor with just as good results. He also gives a big thumbs down to the perfumed cleaning solution, he said it reminds him of deodorant.As the other half who shares the bathroom, I'm giving it 1-star based on hideous design of the cleaning unit - it looks like a toilet brush holder sitting on the counter top.

"We've always said we're not really into karaoke, but dang, the Home Singing Machine and a group of people will change that pretty fast! This thing is an absolute blast! You don't have to be a singer to get into the act!First - of the box this unit sets up and installs quickly and painlessly. If you can pair bluetooth, you can set this unit up. A major benefit is when the unit is not being used for karaoke, you can use it as a bluetooth speaker.Quality - awesome!!! The sound quality is excellent, for both the karaoke and as a plain ol' speaker. We used this both inside and outside with equally excellent results! Also, big kudos for putting some effort into the aesthetics, this is a beautifully designed unit and you won't mind having it sit on a shelf or counter since it doesn't look like another blocky stereo component.Music Selection - again, thumbs up to a huge library of music from all genres. You can even create a playlist and download the tunes which helps keep the party moving. Scrolling through a massive laundry list of music will kill the buzz pretty quickly. We had a '70's theme party (yep, plenty of disco, polyester and bad hairdos) and put together a playlist in advance. Everyone had a blast reminiscing the music of that era, and it really made the evening! The Singing Machine company has a website where you can scroll though the music in their library by name, artist, genre, even era (this make finding the 70's stuff pretty easy). You can download audio tunes (note: the audio tunes do NOT have lyrics) or video (audio file with scrolling lyrics). Some tunes are available in both formats, some only in one. When the machine is not being used for karaoke, you can just play the music for nice background atmosphere. From our experience, it really helps to have the video, most people can't remember the lyrics, especially with the old tunes, and we ended up playing less of the audio only files for karaoke. I really appreciated that you can play a sample of the song before committing. Also, the arrangements were exceptionally well done, and sounded like the real track, sans the artist singing.Subscription - at least the folks at Singing Machine considered the use of their device, and they offer a number of really affordable options to get the most out of the machine. You can purchase a monthly pass for $15 or a yearly pass for $75 and for the infrequent user, a Party Pass good for 48 hours for $5. We used the Party Pass to compile the playlist for the 70's party. You can also go their website and purchase individual tunes ($.99 for audio and $1.49 for video).A couple of other notes:- the Mic-Remote was handy, but a little bulky and awkward as a microphone (it certainly didn't stop anyone from showcasing their talent, or lack thereof).- works with your TV, computer and mobile device. For the party, we put a large computer monitor out, plugged the machine in and large groups (who certainly fancied themselves as some sort of ensemble) were able to see the easily see lyrics. We did have some difficulty getting it to pair with an iPhone, but after some technical jiggering, we managed to get one working.While it's not an inexpensive device, it is a lot of fun and at least can live on as a nice speaker when not being used for karaoke.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJXH0O1E7YHU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMHG2SC#wasThisHelpful","RJXH0O1E7YHU7","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, a point of clarification about what you get - these are not the big 8.5 x 11"" sheets you feed through a printer, these labels come on a sheet about 4 x 6"" with 6 per label. You can feed them through a printer if yours will handle a 4 x 6"" sheet (more below).I found these labels to be much easier to work with than the large 8.5 x 11"" sheets for a number of reasons, but the biggest was the accuracy of feeding through the printer. So often with the large sheets, if the sheet is not fed through exactly, the slightest slant will be exaggerated with the labels on the bottom half of the sheet. And if the image and text was set to be centered, those labels at the end of the sheet will be useless. That is not the case with these smaller sheets, a slight angle will not be noticed. Yes, you have to feed more sheets, but you lose no labels in the process.If you are stamping writing or doing any other handmade embellishments, it's easier to work with 6 labels at a time than 24. You won't get smudges and other gunk on the labels at the bottom of the page while you are working at the top of the page.The stickiness of the labels are awesome and if you stick it onto glass, they will wash off nicely with a little soaking in water - not like those nasty labels that require lighter fluid to remove the residue.Last, the kraft color is the perfect balance of rustic and brown. Not too dark and not too light.Nice job Avery!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KBYDRPI1Q6FW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W7VEN0I#wasThisHelpful","R1KBYDRPI1Q6FW","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a rehabilitated Keurig drinker, I have one of the small Chemed drip carafes, and when the box of filters that came with the unit ran out, I thought I just use the traditional cone filters. After all the whole origami folding project first thing in the morning can be a little challenging if you have not had a cup of wake-up juice. I never realized how much difference a filter could make.In my first few attempts with the traditional cone filter, the filter would collapse and a downpour of grounds when into the coffee. Of course, then I had to pour the coffee through another filter to keep the grounds out of the cup. Not to mention I probably spilled half of the coffee all over the place (cleaning up a mess is worse that trying to fold the filter when you are still half asleep!). I tried two filters but that slowed the process to a snail's pace resulting in cooler water going into the carafe (lukewarm coffee is just the worst). After about of week, I realized I had spent more time trying to shove the proverbial round peg into the square hole and bought a box of the filters.So, my hat's off to the Chemex folks, they managed to engineer a filter that is the perfect thickness that balances the right brew of coffee such that the water stays hot and the flavor comes through and no mess.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GDS722U4CJZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQLGTQK#wasThisHelpful","R1GDS722U4CJZV","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent book for new and seasoned school board trustees. I'm sure 99.99% of all school board members initially got involved out of their passion to improve the education experience for the students in their school district. And I'm sure most new school board members, and many seasoned trustees are overwhelmed with the process, legal issues, procedural issues, and can find their passion sapped by the machinations of the various entities they serve in their district. This book is an excellent primer for new members and reminder for seasoned trustees of the work of the school board and most importantly how to set policy to promote the best educational experience for the students being served. And just as important, how to get out of the way of those who are entrusted to make it happen.The concept of a school board is one of the last truly local examples of pure democracy at work, and as such those who serve are generally lay people who have never had any schooling, training or induction into the inner workings of the school board (or any governmental unit). Layered with the Brown Act, state educational code, and union contracts, there is a monumental amount of learning which can easily overwhelm anyone causing them to lose that passion. Certainly in larger districts where one may be elected on a promise to do one thing or another, this book reminds the reader that no single trustee acts alone - once elected, the ideas that they become a member of a single body and should act as a single entity can also be a bit disappointing. Don't despair, Mr. Eadie does a wonderful job of explaining why this is important and how it works to strengthen the board and the trust between the board, the staff, parents, community members and other for whom they serve.So, how can a school board member be effective? Mr. Eadie lays it out thoroughly in an easy to understand manner. He provides the guidelines and activities for how a school board can operate as a single body with impact, integrity and success. Whether you are sitting at the table during the school board meeting or talking with a neighbor, Mr. Eadie gives plenty of sound advice on how to conduct yourself so your school board maintains a strong unified front. Which is not to say that trustees cannot have their own opinion, clearly they can and certainly can vote accordingly, but once the vote is done, all trustees should act as a unified unit (you don't have to agree, but you do have to respect...maybe Congress needs a book like this too!). Mr. Eadie walks the reader through how they can do their part to ensure the school board is most effective at their number one job:  setting policy for the school district they are entrusted to lead, and just as important, how to get of the way of those who are entrusted to make it happen.Finally, this is an excellent book for stakeholders who may not understand the role of the school board (don't be disappointed if your school board trustee cannot fire a teacher or get Johnny transferred from one classroom to another - that's not their job). And if you want to make sure your school board is functioning effectively, you'll learn how to you can push for and support that effort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RESP6QK4RUY4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1578861764#wasThisHelpful","RESP6QK4RUY4K","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While these shipping tags were traditionally used for industrial purposes, they have taken on a new life in the crafting arena. Clearly the tag and the wire are most likely strong enough for freight shipping, I immediately went to work on mine with ink, paint, stamps, punches and all sorts of ephemera along with other bits and bobs. I subjected these tags to plenty of water, glue, heat, and more, and they took the beating and I was rewarded with some awesome looking works of arts! I used some of them for some gifts and all of the recipients commented more about the tag than the gift. I also used a bunch to create a mini-photo album for a friend.Whether your purpose is for shipping or crafting or even somewhere in between, these are super sturdy tags.

"The major benefit of these headphones is the bluetooth capability. The sound quality is OK, and of course they are super easy to ""install"" and get up and running. They are not the best headphones and I found I could not wear my reading glasses as the the headpiece is really hard and rigidto fit comfortably over them. All-in-all, they are a decent value for the price.Here's some more specifics:- Pairs with your computer or other electronic device super easily. I paired these headphones with computers running Windows 8, Mac OS, and other devices such as an iPhone, iPad, and a Samsung phone and Samsung tablet all without issue.- Sound Quality - quite decent for the size and technology. You can actually roam about 30 ft away from the device before you start to lose sound. Of course this is where these headphones really shine; you can easily move around your workspace without having to deal with an annoying tether!- Nice life on one battery charge. I got just a little over 40 hours of time before I needed to pop in the cable to recharge. I forgot to pay attention while the unit was recharging so I can't comment on how long it took to recharge. Another great thing about these headphones is that the battery is built into the earpiece so you only need a cable and a device that can supply power making these awesome for travel and portability.- Reasonably comfortable - the padded earphone not helps block outside sound, but also provides a nice level of comfort. I did find they felt a little tight on my head right out of the box and I wasn't able to wear them for an extended period of time. It looks like Panasonic is going for that Beats headphone look, but they might consider rethinking the hard plastic material and design of the headband, it's not that comfortable for extended wear.I let my teenaged son have a go with these headphones, they seem to be better suited for him.

"The Maxic Compass Emergency Jump Starter is a must for anyone who lives with flaky electrical service and/or spends time outside away from any sort of running electrical current. It's super compact, sleek looking (super thumbs-up for design asthetics) and can charge up quite a few small electrical devices before completely draining the battery. We were able to test with a neighbor's car and it worked like a charm, unfortunately it was all the battery could handle, but in an emergency, you'd be glad to have it!The battery itself charges up pretty fast, but doesn't have the bandwidth to handle a lot - as the name says, it an emergency device, not a primary source of power. Although no instructions or other information come with the unit, the usage is pretty straightforward.The major downside, hence the 4 stars, is this device is NOT UL tested and rated, implying a potential quality control issue. Ours worked just fine for charging cell phones, a laptop, jumpstarting a dead car, a camping lantern with a rechargeable battery and a Nintendo device - not all at once nor on one charge, but with relative speed and ease.

"Let's be clear, this isn't a ""health"" bar or necessarily a better choice than most other similar granola bars. A third of the calories are from fat, it's loaded with carbs (obviously, the main ingredients are grains) and has a smidgen of protein. But at 150 calories and a manageable amount of sugar at 7g, it is convenient and better than a candy bar. Also, all of the ingredients are real things, not chemical composition with the added benefit of actual whole grains. KIND made this tasty bar into a nice balance of crunch and sweetness, which is just enough to take the edge off the afternoon snack cravings without blowing the whole day on something you'll regret 15 minutes later. If you are familiar with the other, traditional KIND bars, I found this bar more preferable; it's not as sweet, and not nearly as hard to bite and chew.Everyone in our house really like this KIND bar, so I bought a couple boxes since I find the teenagers in my house are less likely to buy a candy bar on their way home from school if they have one of these in their backpack (it helps they are just enough of misers with their allowance too!). I keep one in my handbag for the same reason. With the bit of chocolate in it, it's just enough to satisfy the sweet tooth without going overboard into the sugar high/low you get with a candy bar, and definitely not enough to spoil dinner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H6D89E4XZ454/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVRD75Q#wasThisHelpful","R1H6D89E4XZ454","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was totally prepared for this to be some sort of franken-food and honestly had to get a bit of courage up to try it, but my curiosity quickly overrode any hesitation and I made breakfast burritos - sans the rolled tortilla - for family and guests. Everyone went gaga over the tortilla shape, and surprisingly, they tasted just like a soft flour tortilla should. The kids were especially enamored with the idea of a tortilla ""boat"" and actually ate all of their breakfast. As a plus, the trough held up really well, even with the liquid from the salsa sinking to the bottom.I have to tip my hat the folks at Old El Paso for their research and effort in making a soft tortilla hold such a shape without a ton of unpronounceable ingredients (there are a handful of these multi-syllable chemically-based ingredients to be sure). While this isn't going to replace the homemade tortilla, it would be something I'd purchase for a party or other fun event!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZDA0COQX3O9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DIV5FC6#wasThisHelpful","R1ZDA0COQX3O9J","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I LOVE everything about this little drive! Moore's Law is truly evidenced with this slim drive; I have a larger, clunky ""portable"" drive I use for back-ups, but this little drive runs circles around it.First, it set itself up in less than 30 seconds. Simply plug it into the USB port and go. Next, I transferred a bunch of media to it, which went just as quickly as moving the files to a new folder. Finally, opening these files right from the drive was also lickity-split fast. I had no problems plugging this drive in and using it with my client's PCs, both Windows and Mac alike.I also really love the design, clearly Samsung thought about the design - a lot. It has a very Apple-esque feel to the packaging and product. The slim, lightweight design makes it even more suited for toting around than any other portable drive I have. Often I have been up the proverbial creek due to lack of Internet access and I don't like to tote my large laptop if I can avoid it, so having this little drive has made a huge difference in enabling me to keep client files with me and up-to-date regardless of where I am or what kind of access I have. And it fits quite nicely right in my hand bag.One thing to keep in mind is if you will be going through airport security, make sure you have a device that will allow TSA to see it's not some sort of illegal thing. I almost had to give mine up, but thanks to a fellow travel warrior lending his tablet, I was saved.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YJZNKU68R4T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RWXVMRS#wasThisHelpful","R2YJZNKU68R4T4","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son loves these types of pencils, but so often they cannot withstand the force and trauma of a 13-year old boy's clumsy and uncontrolled strength. The Zebra pencil so far has managed to last longer than a semester, so it's by far and away the most durable. He also noted the lead doesn't break nearly as easily or often as other similar mechanical pencils.The lead is easy to replace/refill, and the weight of the pencil is more substantial than most of this type of design.

"We're weaning ourselves off the Keurig mainly due to the limited choices of environmentally friendly packaging, but also because you simply get better tasting coffee outside of the Keurig realm After some research, we landed on the Chemex - and LOVE it!!!It's definitely a bit more of an investment of time and labor than simply popping a Keurig plastic cup into a brewer, and on the those mornings when you need it east and fast, the Chemex solution might feel like a Herculean effort, but if you are willing to preserve, you will be rewarded with some superior coffee. It really helps if you have an electric kettle to get the water super hot and while it's boiling you can get the filter ready. Also, if you go this route, invest in a good burr coffee grinder. Amazon has a great selection of both appliances. I was totally skeptical that a grinder could really make a difference, but since we happened to have both the fancy Krups burr grinder and a cheap Krups grinder I put them both to the test, and was quite surprised to find it does make a difference. Having lost the bet with my better half over this issue, I now have to make the coffee in the morning for the next month.You do need a filter for the carafe, and Chemex of course has their version. I have to wonder about the folks at Chemex, they really made the filter thing a bit of an origami project and when you are half asleep trying to pull off a focused project, you might be tempted to throw a cup under the Keurig and be done. But if you can manage enough brain cells to get the filter folded (and the trick is make sure the little half circle thing is opened properly inside - again, a bit of feat when your eyes are barely open - otherwise coffee grounds will go right through). Chemex does sell pre-folded filters for the morning mentally challenged. So you may ask, why not just use the plain cone filters. Well, they don't fit properly and the mess you will have on your hands will leave you even more cranky than you were (yep, tried this and it was NOT a short-cut).Once the water is ready, you pour over it the grounds, wait a minute or two and repeat until the carafe is mostly full (great opportunity to get that dishwasher emptied while you are making the coffee). Remove the filter which is compostable or recyclable in the green waste can, so you can do your part for the environment, and pour your beautiful cup of joe. Obviously the major benefit of making coffee this way is you can buy really, really good beans.The carafe cleans up well and the coffee is downright awesome. If you have visited any of the more trendy coffee houses and noticed many are doing this pour-over type of coffee, and if you are patient, you will be rewarded with a truly fine cup of coffee.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LCHAUEP131QT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BEQFVY#wasThisHelpful","R2LCHAUEP131QT","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our yellow Lab who eats pretty much anything was a little lukewarm on this flavor of dog food. She's chowed through many other flavors so fast, I'm pretty sure she had no idea what the flavor was, but this one didn't get her to the food bowl with any sort of speed. Kudos however to the Nutro Company for a relatively good product. For dogs, the more protein, and protein from animal sources and not plants, is better.

"Best.Headphones.Ever.Gotta love how the Japanese treat everything they do with such honor and respect. From the moment you remove the sleeve covering the box, you know you are in for something special. The packaging is so beautifully done, you'd be tempted to think you got the wrong item.The headphones are delightfully small and you may think the sound quality would be lacking, but it is absolutely not. Having just purchased a pair of Sennheiser headphones, these are so much better in every way imaginable. Here's my list of pros and cons:Super, Super Comfortable - the small size and lightweight make these incredibly comfortable for lengthy wearing. The ear piece is plenty big to cover the ear without feeling like you have Princess Leia-sized things on your head.Awesome Sound - I listened to jazz, classical, rock, opera, bluegrass and more and I really found myself so much more engaged with the music than with other headphones or going through the stereo in the house. The sound was rich and full, even with the softest of moments. And on the way more boring side, these are coming in really handy as I'm studying for the CPA exam and need to focus and block out the distractions (this is why I purchased the Sennheiser headphones). I even found the quality to be just that much better and am actually able to stay focused for a bit longer.Lightweight  & Portable - I love that these headphones are so light which makes them much easier to tote around. And this might be sort of silly, but I really like the silky feel of the cord.Volume Control on the Cord - super handy, and kudos to the nice design aesthetics.ConsThe only real con might be the price, but I think these are so awesome, I gladly paid for a pair to give to my hubby for an anniversary present (really to keep him from borrowing mine!).Denon has always been synonymous with quality and these headphones live up the that expectation. They even firmly affixed the cord to the one earpiece so there is little danger of it wearing out to the point of disconnecting any of the tiny wires inside (really, love this!!!) but it doesn't prevent the headphones from being flexible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OLOE2EIVJTUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTR4598#wasThisHelpful","R1OLOE2EIVJTUW","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In this age, where the lack of civility and disrespect have somehow become the behavior we reward, David Brooks' The Road to Character not only reminds of what the world looked like before the self-centered, screaming talking heads took over, but how much more fulfilling life can be. Best of all, he lays out the road for one to follow in the last chapter. From the first few pages, I was captivated (Mr. Brooks is an excellent story teller) and by the end, came away with a much needed renewed faith in what I can do personally as well as for mankind.Having been a fan of Mr. Brooks writing for some time, I had very high expectations of his book and while it met and in some parts of the book exceeded those expectations, there also a few lulls. Some of the vignettes fell a little flat and didn't drive the point home as well as others. However I'm sure each individual showcased in the book was carefully researched and detailed to emphatically drive the point home, so I will reread these chapters.A very obvious theme exemplified through the book and with each chapter is that becoming a person of character takes time. As with most things, it takes focus, thoughtfulness and opportunity to practice, which of course means these values will become part of one's being over time, not over night. This isn't a book about religion, although it quite spiritual, in fact if most religious leaders and their followers were to actually put into practice Mr. Brooks' Humility Code, we would find ourselves in a much more truly compassionate and collaborative world. This is one of those books that should be required reading for everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HFBE96RFH5YN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081299325X#wasThisHelpful","R1HFBE96RFH5YN","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've had a lot of fun with this telescoping stick. Hands down the best part is the remote control. Having just got an iPhone 6, which takes amazing photos, now I can set up shots beyond just an arm's length. We did some fun stop animation films with toys, the dog (very uncooperative actor) and even a short film of dinner by using the stick to hold the camera steady and the remote to take the pictures. I can see this will be a must on a trip, since you can use it very much like a tripod (obviously not quite the same).Very much like a tripod, the head swivels so you can position the camera or phone into nearly any position. Also since the telescope collapses down you can use this to mount or steady the camera using a wall, car, or whatever solid structure is at hand for way more interesting shots beyond the overdone selfie. Of course the remote really gives you some great freedom. So get creative!!!

"If you've got a reverse osmosis system hooked up to the kitchen sink in your house, you have this water. If you don't, at more than $3.00 per bottle, you'd pay for a reverse osmosis system in nothing flat. Even a Brita filter system would yield the same results at a fraction of the cost. We have a reverse osmosis system and the water from that tap tastes just the same and has the same qualities as this water, and it costs about 3,000% less.This is a product all about hype and little about substance, very much like cosmetics with all the cost in the packaging and very little in the product itself. Clearly this is a product designed to appeal to a certain type of buyer (not me for sure). Very nice that the packaging is recyclable and that it's made in California, but let's be honest, this is just filtered water from a top going into these bottles, not some fancy pristine spring water from some remote place.If you're a big water drinker, get into the habit of using a refillable water bottle and tote your own around. It won't take long before it just becomes second nature to fill 'er up before you leave the house and you'll be doing a lot of good for the environment.

"LOVE this product!!! I typically use a gentle exfoliation products 2 to 3 times a week, but after using this product only, twice a week for 2-1/2 weeks, I can see much bigger improvement in the quality of my skin. MY skin is much softer and this product definitely took down some of fine lines and reduced some of the bigger ones, especially on my forehead. I don't spend a lot of money or time with fancy products or treatments (heck, my whole make-up routine is mascara) mostly because I don't have the patience to wait fifteen minutes or more for some gloppy stuff to sit on my face and apply several products afterward, so this was a big game changer for me.This product is super easy to use and you really only need a very small amount to produce results. It's a two step process, first apply a thin layer onto clean skin with goo in Step 1 and wait and minute (you'll feel a slight warm/burning sensation). Next you apply a thin layer of the goo from the tube labled Step 2 and wait about 3-5 minutes (I'm not that patient, so I only went for 3 minutes). The directions say to wipe clean with a soft towel, but I rinsed my face with warm water.  And wow!!! It's like new skin! And best of all, it lasted!My skin looked brighter and clearer and felt super smooth (but not weird and shiny) to the touch. My skin is definitely fair, a bit on the dry side and I'm in my 50's. I don't have a lot of sun damage (I religiously wear sunscreen) and did not experience any irritation whatsoever. Your results may vary of course.

"Whoa....I'm actually in awe.I thought my Fellowes 79Ci shredder was killer, then this arrived on my doorstep. What makes this shredder worth the price is the speed, volume and noise level.1.  It's Fast...really fast. I shredded nearly 200 pages in about a handful of minutes.1.  Volume...it holds a LOT. Unlike other shredders where you have to stand hunched feeding a half-dozen pages at a time, with the AutoMax, you open the top, lay the pages down (as if you were filling the paper cartridge of a printer, but it's even easier), close the top lid and press the arrow button and away it goes.3.  Noise Level...amazingly quiet for the size of the motor. I really expected this to sound like a jet taxing down a runway, but instead found it to be almost a little white noise/Zen-like as it was shredding the giant pile of papers.A few other pluses:- It's on Wheels! you can move it out of the way when not in use, love this!!- Giant Bin! And a good thing since you can shred a monster load of paper- Shreds with the excellent micro cross-cut for super high level security- Nice, clean design, super easy to use.- Decent Safety. You can't open the top lid while it's in use.- Shreds everything, staples, credit cards, paper clips, CDs. The instructions do note it won't shred binder clips though :-)- The bin easily slides out and due the design, it has enough depth enabling you to get all the clumps hanging from the teeth into the bag instead of all over the floor (just turn it off first for safety's sake).One side note, I'd buy the Fellowes bags for this shredder, I found them much easier to use since the bin opening is larger than the standard kitchen trash bag.It is bigger than the typical size shredder, but if you have need for a higher capacity shredder, can't stand the noise of shredding machines, or loathe standing hunched over your shredder, this baby is absolutely for you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VD26TYRCNANA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW90WU#wasThisHelpful","R2VD26TYRCNANA","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I really love that this product doesn't contain sugar, and has a healthy dose of fiber and Omega 3. It has all the other good stuff; Vitamin D, B and the other essentials.

"I bought this with a bit of hesitation as a Christmas present for the hubby, who is pretty picky about his grill toys and loves to cook. Not only was this a huge hit, but he bought second one to replace the gargantuan outdoor grill. Here's what rocks according to the man who likes to cook with fire:- good temperature control, and excellent high heat- cleans easily (turn it on to let the gunk burn off, just like a normal grill)- size is great for our family, the second one is the spare that we use when entertaining or grilling a load of stuff- love the portability, it replaced the old camp stove and now we can grill instead being limited to only that which can be cooked in a pot or pan (get the adapter so you can hook up a small propane bottle instead of lugging the giant tank).- more efficient than the big grill which you have to heat up the whole grill for just a couple of burgers.The biggest plus - it stands up just fine to the big boys in terms of grilling quality.We built a counter outside where the two grills sit side-by-side. And since they are portable, we can move them to wherever they are needed.

"I use these for both my business and fun. Business, yes, they work perfectly as a hanging file folder should; they are sturdy, hang properly and can manage with a fair amount of overstuffing. I really love the neutral color. They also lend themselves to some great crafting opportunities. I stamped all over a whole box load for a client, and they were so thrilled to have something interesting in their drawers (office drawers that is!) for a change.  I would however recommend the Pendaflex hanging file folders it you need something really durable - they are thicker and better reinforced on the bottom. For the majority of office use, the Smead folders are just fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U39KXBH97RKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Y52YKK#wasThisHelpful","R2U39KXBH97RKE","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently discovered Jambu shoes and really love how comfortable they are! I'm always looking for a shoe that can walk a few miles each day over a lot of varied terrain, get dirty but easily clean to look like new, be comfortable and stylish. A tall order for something that is really a work boot (sans the stylish requirement). The Bali Mule does all of this and more. These shoes worked fantastically with black tights and a dress and jeans, and breezed through the day and my feet were still feeling good!

"After a couple of cheap shredders, I'm sorry I didn't invest in this sooner. It will chew up just about everything you give it - paper, credit cards, card stock, there is even a slot for shredding CDs. Here's the run-down based on my usage:Pros- No Jams - really doesn't jam, I even stuffed half of an unused check book into it trying to get it to jam and while it ground up the paper more slowly, it choked it down without jamming. There is a handy reverse direction if you do encounter a jam, but haven't had to use it for that purpose.- Micro Cut Shred - much safer than simple shredding- Easy Bin Emptying - a big pet peeve is how much of the shredded bits go everywhere when you empty the bin, the Fellowes shredder is by far the easiest to empty with minimal shredded bits going everywhere. Fellows makes bags for the shredder, but I have had fine success with thin, clear plastic tall kitchen bags- Wheels!! Move it out of the way to clean or when not in use (as some reviewers noted, it is a little challenging to get the wheels installed, but boy is it worth it!)- Noise level definitely tolerable - I found the cheap shredders to be noisy in a more grating kind of way. This shredder has a pretty big motor (you will know this when you first remove it from the box) and I found the noise level to be quite reasonable.- Maintenance - couldn't be easier, when you empty the bin, run a little oil across the opening and run the shredder forward and backwards for about 30 seconds each.Con- Maybe the price? If you are super price sensitive, then go for something less, but as someone who goes through shredders like a teenage boy and sneakers, I'm am so happy at how well this shredder performs! In the short time I've had this, I've easily shredded 30 bags worth of stuff and it's just as strong and solid as the day I got it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZHLI06UTAZIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WB397I#wasThisHelpful","RZHLI06UTAZIZ","A266BFIUYON37V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A266BFIUYON37V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Gorgeous color and it lasts pretty much most of the day, and for sure longer than lipstick. This is an awesome lip stain product! I'm fair skinned, light hair and I love how this lip stain gives my lips a nice, natural color - it doesn't look at all like I'm wearing lipstick. The application is easy and it blends right in with your natural lip line. Sometimes I dress it up a little with some lip gloss which gives my lips that airbrushed look. The color isn't super heavy, although I suppose you could paint on a few layers if you wanted a darker look. Another major pro - it doesn't dry your lips out like some other lip stain products.

"Upon receiving this, my kids (10 year old son & 6 year old daughter) were very excited and set up the track right away.  None of us, however, were prepared for just how fun this innovative and incredibly effective racing system would be.  They played it for hours breaking only for dinner because mom & dad made them.  They have continued to play with it frequently, a sure test of how fun a toy really is.The track is very easy to configure, assemble, and disassemble - simple enough that a child can do it.  The controller is very effective, featuring a 2 way trigger for forward and reverse and a wheel for steering.  I much prefer this over the dual joystick system employed by many RC vehicles, partly because an actual steering wheel just makes sense for steering and partly because it's easier to grasp for younger kids.  The cars handle great and respond in a very nuanced way to the controller - a gentle push or pull of the trigger will produce a slow acceleration which allows for easy turning.  Nudging the trigger a little further increases the speed incrementally up to full on pedal to the medal when the trigger if fully pressed.  The controls are just great.The technology by which the cars recognize and stay on the track pieces makes racing super fun.  You most definitely can and will veer off of the tracks if you just floor it, but that's part of the fun.  You have to use enough control to keep the car from flying off the tracks while also enjoying the assistance of the sensors that reliably keep the car on track at slower speeds.  When you do lose control and leave the course, you simply drive your car back to the track and resume racing.  In one respect this system resembles the old slot car racing sets that also required some nuanced speed control, but without the need to physically replace the cars on the track when they leave it.  Another great feature is that the cars are perfectly proportioned and designed for the track - in other words, their turning radius matches the track perfectly.  Time your turn just right and your car will remain in exactly the right spot on the track.  One of many small things that makes this great.Everything just works, too.  The sensors are reliable and always keep the car on course as long as you don't take corners too fast.  The cars handle well, recover easily when they leave the track, and physically take a licking and keep on ticking.  The kids frequently crash them into each other and into furniture, the cat, the wall, etc and they never skip a beat.  The different racing modes provide variety and flexibility.  The cars are quite fun simply as RC cars even when not racing.  And by the way, battery life is great.  These things will go for hours and hours on a set of batteries.The only complaint that I could possibly find is that the cars sometimes seem to have a mind of their own when you veer off the track and steer back toward it.  It's like the car wants to go one way to get back on the track even if you try steering it another way.  This is probably due to the way it reads the sensors on the track, but regardless it is absolutely not enough of an issue to care about.Once in awhile you find a toy that is so well done it stands head and shoulders above the rest.  This is one of those toys.  It's far more fun than other traditional RC vehicles.  It's far more fun that traditional slot car type sets.  It uses technology in a way that enhances the experience without overtaking it.  It's well made, well thought-out, and creates a fantastic experience.  My daughter said, ""Dad, when you review this on Amazon you need to give it an awesome 5 star awesome rating!""  I agree.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YT9F33W6SBD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGNT3KQ#wasThisHelpful","R1YT9F33W6SBD2","A1JTTI1KH3DOCY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JTTI1KH3DOCY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ok there's no fire involved here, but these really are great trash bags.  They are durable, though not as malleable as some of the ""flex"" varieties of trash bag.  I find, however, that for our general kitchen trash purposes the more expensive flex bags are overkill and these are plenty strong.  Love having the cinch drawstring handles.  The fragrance feature is really nice - very pleasant apple aroma that isn't overbearing but provides a hint of scent (hey I'm a poet and didn't know it!) to offset potential garbage odors.  I for one was grateful that the aroma wasn't overpowering or sickeningly strong.

"I have a 10 year old son and we've gone through quite a few R/C toys.  This one definitely ranks among the better of those we've tried.  What I like best about this is the control.  It's simpler than the ones with dual toggle sticks and more natural to control.  It has a trigger that can be squeezed to move the car forward or pushed away in the opposite direction to move the car in reverse.  Steering is handled with a small wheel.  It's a simple but effective design that even my 6 year old daughter was able to operate right away.The car operates on a small rechargeable battery pack, which is another plus.  One of the reasons some of our past R/C toys didn't get more use was that they often took 4, 6, or even 8 batteries and burned through them super-fast.  I much prefer this route, which while requiring time off to charge the battery saves a significant expense.  The car goes plenty long on one charge too.The big oversized wheels work great, and my kids loved setting up obstacle courses with other toys and objects to drive the truck over.  It worked fine around the yard too.All in all we really enjoyed this car.  I have a little concern about durability since it has an all-plastic construction, but otherwise it's a lot of fun.  Simple but effective control scheme, cost efficient rechargeable battery pack, and big monster wheels = thumbs up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8SZNI62OV5IA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJE5DT2#wasThisHelpful","R8SZNI62OV5IA","A1JTTI1KH3DOCY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JTTI1KH3DOCY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was fortunate to receive this laptop for review purposes and decided to test it against my work-provided laptop.  For those interested in specs, this Toshiba features a 5th generation Intel core i7 processor (5500u 2.4ghz version), 12gb of ram, and Windows 10 64bit.  My work laptop is a fairly high-end Dell computer that is less than a year old (and cost close to $1500 when purchased 10 months ago) and has a 4th generation Intel core i7 processor (4510u 2.0ghz version), 8gb of ram, and Windows 8 64bit.  For fun, I also included in the test my wife's slightly older HP laptop with an 3rd generation Intel core i3 processor (3130 2.6ghz version), 4gb of ram, and Windows 8 64bit.First, I tested the startup time.  The Toshiba was consistently fast, averaging about 13 seconds from power on to the sign-in screen and about 12 seconds from sign-in to the home screen appeared.  The Dell was close behind, taking a few seconds longer to bring up the sign in screen and being about the same speed from sign-in til the homescreen.  The HP was a good bit slower, taking 35 seconds to get to the sign-in screen and another 15 to the homescreen.  In any case, the Toshiba gets up and running really fast, a testament to both the processor speed and the efficiency of Windows 10.Next, I tested the speed of each laptop performing a fairly demanding computing task.  I don't do gaming, but I do use my laptop to do audio and video editing.  I installed the newest version of a video editing program on each computer and had them edit and render (produce a finished video) the same project.  The Toshiba won the race, finishing the project in 7 minutes 19 seconds.  The Dell was fairly close, finishing in 7 minutes 59 seconds.  The HP lagged in at 9 minutes 12 seconds.  Again, the Toshiba clocked in tops.I did a battery test by streaming video with the screen set to maximum brightness.  The Toshiba won with 3 hours 21 minutes of life, the Dell was a close second with 3 hours 9 minutes, and the HP straggled behind with 1 hour 50 minutes.  Again the Toshiba came out ahead, an even more impressive feat considering that it's screen is by far superior to the others (more on this in a moment).The speaker test was one where the Toshiba was not a clear winner.  It sounds great but the max volume was a good bit lower than the Dell, which sounds just about as good but pumps out more sound.  The Toshiba speakers are clear and have good separation between the crisp highs and mid range sounds.  The HP sounded muffled and canned, but the Toshiba was rich and full - but not particularly loud even at max volume.Aesthetically, the Toshiba looks great.  The brushed metal cover with black accent trim is very sharp, and the screen is really thin, giving the laptop and nice slim profile.  The screen on this laptop is INCREDIBLE by the way, the best I've seen.  The colors are rich and natural, the blacks are deep, and its very bright without being harsh.  Comparing it side-by-side to my more-expensive Dell revealed a significant gap in screen quality that surprised me.  It is absolutely gorgeous, head and shoulders above the competition, and is almost reason enough to buy this laptop.  Seriously.  The keyboard is great too, with pleasingly tactile response, quiet action, and back-lighting for easy use in dark conditions.  I love having the numeric keypad too, a plus for those of us that have to do some number crunching from time to time.  I am not a huge fan of the current trend of clickable touchpads without dedicated right and left buttons.  As a right handed user, I find that I tend to try the left click a little too close to the center, which results in occasional right clicks or non-response.  This isn't unique to the Toshiba (the Dell I've been using for a almost a year is the same) and it's not a huge deal - and I'm sure many people prefer it - but I miss the dedicated right and left buttons.Using the computer day in and day out for awhile revealed it to be very fast.  It starts up fast, zips through opening and closing programs, loads web pages quickly, etc.  I don't know how much credit goes to Windows 10 or to the computing power under the hood, but this machine moves.The only issue I've got with the Toshiba, and the reason I'm not going for an all-out five star rating, is the build quality.  I haven't had a single problem with it, but it's light and just feels a little delicate.  Obviously light is good, and I'm sure Toshiba intentionally kept the weight at a minimum, but I'd gladly trade a few ounces of weight here for there and deal with a little more heft for something that just feels more sturdy and engenders a bit more confidence.  Again, haven't had a problem and might never have a problem, but it just feels delicate.All in all, this is a really nice computer.  Gorgeous screen, fast processor, newest and nimble OS, sleek and lightweight design, great keyboard, rich (but not especially loud) speakers...there is much to like here.  I'd think twice if you're hard on your hardware because of the lightweight build, but otherwise this is a really solid piece of gear that excels in a lot of areas, and many of them where it really counts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z5L713R15AS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZD8R30Y#wasThisHelpful","R2Z5L713R15AS2","A1JTTI1KH3DOCY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JTTI1KH3DOCY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"***This review is for the Philips AJT4400B/37 Bluetooth Clock Radio.  Please note that there are several different clock models listed together on this one product page, so I just want to be clear which one I've reviewing (and I've included a photo with this review to help identify this model).***I am really happy with this clock radio.  First, the positives of which there are many..  This clock looks really nice.  It has a compact design with smooth lines and a classy black minimalist look.  I dig the amber colored display, which has 3 brightness settings and is easily visible without creating a harsh glow in dark conditions.  The unit includes a dedicated wire antenna and picks up a lot of stations and locks in on them well with its digital tuner.  You can preset 20 stations, either programming them manually or letting the clock automatically scan and program the 20 stations.  The dual alarms can be set to repeat every day, and the alarm sound (using the beeping buzzer sound or a radio station) starts quietly and very gradually increases in volume - a great feature if you share a bed or room and don't want to wake the other person.  The included usb port located on the rear of the clock is super convenient for bedside phone or tablet charging.  The bluetooth connectivity works great, and streaming music is easy, as is taking an incoming call using the clock's built in mic.  I had no problem hearing callers nor did they have any trouble hearing me when using the clock for calls.As for negatives, there are a few.  Perhaps the biggest is that the speaker volume isn't all that loud.  Think of it as a clock radio with bluetooth as a bonus, as the sound is perfectly acceptable for a clock radio but won't compete with dedicated bluetooth music speakers.  Another minor niggle is that the snooze button is preset to 9 minutes and can't be changed.  It's certainly not a big deal, but programmable snooze times can be nice for those who like to hit the snooze button.Overall this is a really nice feature-rich clock radio at a good price.  Dual alarms, nice styling, usb charging port, surprisingly good radio reception, and bluetooth connectivity add up to a pretty capable little clock radio.  But keep in mind, it is first and foremost a compact clock radio and the sound quality and volume reflect that identity.  If you keep your expectations reasonable for sound quality, there is a whole lot to like here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWAURE3TB559B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012J1B8CG#wasThisHelpful","RWAURE3TB559B","A1JTTI1KH3DOCY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JTTI1KH3DOCY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Feel free to post any questions & I'll do my best to respond.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MGQ7S27I6BEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJLD7MK#wasThisHelpful","R1MGQ7S27I6BEB","A1JTTI1KH3DOCY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JTTI1KH3DOCY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
